This album keith takes various shots at mob deep who tried to subliminal miss him, redman, & erick sermon on a skit off the infamous. the \"Rhyme\" is the only single released for this album which has keith wrapping over a nice Franky Beverly & MAZE sample. This whole album is certified classic but the tracks that I really took notice of was The rhyme of course & the rhyme remix which has the same lyrics but over a different beat done by the late J Dilla! \"Whuts Happenin\" is keith describing whats been going with him & the wrap game over a nice beat also the takes another jab a mob deep \"then you got wrap artist claiming to be the hardest bust in they wish & they quick to press charges\" \"Dangerous Ground\" a great track with keith & this boy fifty grand going back & forth trading verses warning punk pics to stay out of their path. \"Yeah\" is bomb track with keith, busty, freeman, erick sermon, & little jamal tearing up the mic! \"To My Mans\" a great heartfelt track from keith (reminds me of some of the tracks from OC's word life & jewel) basically talking about the people in this life who are dead & gone & that hes trying to keep this head up in this crazy world. And finally My fax track \"World Be Free\" is another banger better yet a concept track where keith describes how hes travels all over the world state to state country to country interstate to tristate dripping up the mic where the craps line like \"Kentucky was lucky I had to much hennessy When I was representing love love in Tenessee Kansas City Missouri can speak upon the glory St. louis can even tell the story Of how I drop wish thick and cold like the snow in Chicago A major up in Ohio\" for \"I transformed like Dr. Bruce Banner Stepped off the plane and blacked out up in Canada I'm a million dollar man like Lee Majors messed around and hit the jackpot up in Vegas\" This album is just as good if not better than this first LP so with that said, pick up the Enigma you won't be disappointed!","overall":5,"summary":"Can't control the rhyme","unixReviewTime":1314489600,"reviewTime":"08 28, 2011"}

Coming off a very decent debut album, few could have been ready for this brilliant follow-up which reminds me a lot of Tom Petty's best work with the Heartbreakers. The musicianship and songwriting has improved greatly over the debut effort due no doubt to the more polished backing band that represents the Attractions as well as Costello himself increasing in confidence and maturing in ability. The sound quality of this remastered version is also brilliant and together with the wonderful mini-lp sleeve design which includes all the lyrics in English and Japanese as an insert make this the best version of this album that is out there at the moment.

Turned out we were all partly right. I bought the album almost immediately, only to have my sister ruin it by dropping the stylus while trying to go back to listen to her favourite song for the hundredth time in a row. Asia may have seemed contrived to some, overdone to others, but I've always thought of it as a perfect snapshot of the spring and summer of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two. From my way of thinking, music is at it's best when twenty+ years later it still gives you that brief taste of life as it was the first time you heard it. This album is like that for me. The albums that followed were decent, but this one never failed to play all the way through. I can point to a favourite song, for rather some favourites, but I can't say that there's anything on it that I regard as inferior to the others.

This self-titled debut album from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three, with Carey writing all the songs, playing most of the instruments, and singing lead vocals on all but one song, is an awesome piece of work, combining a strong pop sensibility & great hooks with dramatic, keyboard & guitar-driven progressive rock that reminds me of Pink Floyd and the Alan Parsons Project. The songs are all excellent, especially \"Static,\" \"Armageddon,\" the MTV favourite \"Why Me?,\" \"Send It In A Letter,\" and \"Only You And Me\" (with guest lead vocals by David Thomas). Tony Carey would totally top himself with Planet P Project's ambitious one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four follow-up, the double concept album \"Pink World.\" But this self-titled debut is an awesome album all on it's own, and it remains one of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three's very best releases.","overall":5,"summary":"Great Progressive Pop\/Rock","unixReviewTime":1081296000,"reviewTime":"04 7, 2004"}

Plus it contains NONE of the Allman's legendary stage indulgence. Oh, that and the music's good. Highlights include Whipping Post, Midnight Rider, Statesboro Blues, Dreams, Melissa, Revival, Southbound and Crazy Love, though virtually never song is great. However, there is a song I could've done without, and that's the completely forgettable, overlong instrumental In Memory of Elizabeth Reed.

Is the only album that has \"Always and Someday I'll be saturday night\", also has Jon Bon Jovi's biggest solo hit \"Blaze of Glory\". All the early spirit of Bon Jovi is in this album, with their biggest hits from Slippery when wet, New Jersey and Keep the Faith. The other edition of Crossroad is even better, instead of Prayer 'ninety-four is \"In these arms\" and also there is an extra track \"Never say goodbye\". I rate this album's tracks as carefully as I can.one. Livin' on a prayer ten\/ten (The biggest Bon Jovi hit never, a perfect desicion to be onest)two. Keep the faith nine, five\/ten (I like very much the beginning and the chorus)three. Someday I'll Be Saturday Night nine\/ten (One of the two new songs of Crossroad, it in't as good as their oldest songs)four. Always ten\/ten (A big exception for this song, the other new song from Crossroad, it was a huge hit and even today you can hear it sometimes when you go out)five. Wanted dead for alive nine, five\/ten (Many says that this is the theme song of Bon Jovi, I really like the two thousand and three edition from This left feels right)six. Lay Your Hands on Me nine, five\/ten (One of the uncountable singles hits from New Jersey album!!, if I remember well is the fourth single, intro is outstanding!!)seven. You Give love a bad name ten\/ten (One of the biggest rock anthems never, it's their onest hit that peaked no.one)eight. Bed of roses ten\/ten (The best song from \"Keep the faith\", one of the few songs that can be compared with \"You Give love a bad name, Livin' on a prayer)nine. Blaze of Glory ten\/ten (One of my favourites, the only no.one Hit of Jon Bon Jovi's solo career)ten. In these arms ten\/ten (I love this song from the start until the send, another one amazing love song)eleven. Bad Medicine ten\/ten (The onest single from New Jersey, the threerd that peaked no.one)twelve. I'll be there for you ten\/ten (This is my favourite song, the threerd single from New Jersey and the fourth song that peaked No.one, since today is the last that peaked No.one)thirteen. In and out of love eight, five\/ten (A song that decided to be the onest single from seven thousand, eight hundred Fahrenheit, their twond album. For one more time Bon Jovi have talent on how to make a good chorus)fourteen. Runaway eight\/ten (The onest Radio hit that Bon Jovi released from their twenty-five year old career with perfect chorus)fifteen. Never Say Goodbye seven, five\/ten (One of the last hits from Slippery when wet, the best decision to be the last from this album)For those who know what Bon Jovi means, I'm sure they owned this Compilation.","overall":5,"summary":"The Ultimate Bon Jovi album","unixReviewTime":1139616000,"reviewTime":"02 11, 2006"}

But that turned out to only be the beginning as White decided to really mix things up for this third time out. This is roughly around the time the launched Love Unlimited Orchestra who began recording spinoff albums often in tandem with this own. On the title song and \"You're The First,My Last My Everything\" Barry recorded the two most uptempo tracks the never recorded and both cuts, right along with Philly's Gamble & Huff and Thom Bell were early echoes of the danceable, orchestrated funk sound that would become THE thing during the upcoming disco era. These songs are also under five minutes, two of the shorter itunes Barry had done and rely heavy on pop hooks and song structure and neither lost any of this signature sound along the way. Even though the's known more as a singer and arranger these songs in particular this unique way with eth harpsichord, an instrument that would become a new signature for many of this mid seventy's hit records. \"I Can't Believe You Love Me\" is a ten minute funk seduction symphony and really the only song there that takes a cue from the technique of this two first albums. On \"Oh Love,Well We Finally Made It\" and \"I Love You More Than Anything In This World Girl\" both go for kind of pocket symphonies:songs that both have a cinematic soul flavor but more brief in length. I heard a review once on this album that while four minutes in terms of seduction may be long enough in reality it should last longer on record. Either way it does't matter. On this album Barry has a way of making this music slinky, funky and seductive even at shorter lengths. The album is bordered by two brief orchestral instrumentals \"Mellow Mood\" parts one & two. By bookending the album in this way the kind of gave the album the flavor of a long suite even though it consists largely of shorter songs. This set the stone for what Barry would do in the studio for the next few years and stands as both one of this strongest and popular albums.","overall":5,"summary":"Can't Get Enough!!","unixReviewTime":1273017600,"reviewTime":"05 5, 2010"}

As far as the bass being mixed too low on this release I have to say after owning this in every alp and cd edition that the bass was always a bit lower on this album than on some of the other Moodies albums. The mix itself is from the original squad alp versions done by producer Tony Clarke in early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. The squad mixes were different in order to take advantage of the four way split instead of the regular stereo two way split. This meant mixing the album differently from a conventional stereo album. Many of the \"effects\" that are in the background of the stereo version are turned up there changing the overall \"balanced\" sound of the album in order to give the best squad sound. As far as the music itself, this album has a much more basic feel than the band's last, To Our Children's Children's Children which might have had in part something to do with the fact that it was't the big hit the band wanted at the time it was released. That was the first released for their label Threshold. The opening song Question had been released on single a few months before this album's release and had become a big hit for the band. This album includes many Moodies classics and does't have a bad song on the release. Songs like Question, Melancholy Man, And The Tide Rushes In, and It's Up To You sound just as well today as they did back when this album was released.

While their previous album (Songs from the Big Chair) gave the band a succession of memorable hit singles, The Seeds of Love shows Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal reaching their musical speak. Also worth noting is the inclusion of then unknown gospel singer Oleta Adams, whose soulful vocals added another great dimension to their sound. The song that everyone knows there is \"Sowing the Seeds of Love\", a brilliant track that may be the most complex hit single of recent times. From its Beatlesque arrangements and intelligent lyrics to the soaring vocals of both Orzabal and Smith, this, along with \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" and \"Shout\", is among the best songs penned in the `eightys. Just as impressive musically is the excellent \"Badman's Song\", where Smith, Orzabal, and Adams trade vocals throughout as the tune bounces from progressive rock to gospel to jazz before reaching its climactic send. \"Advice for the Young at Heart\", an excellent new wave tune with a great lead vocal from Smith, is the best of `eightys British pop and should have been a huge hit. Another highlight is the awesome \"Swords and Knives\", another dramatic tune with a lot of twists and turns and great guitar work from Orzabal. The rest of the itunes are nearly as impressive as the opener \"Woman in Chains\" is laid back and features great camaraderie between Orzabal and Adams while \"The Year of the Knife\" is driving and quite heavy. \"Standing on the Corner of the Third World\" is another great tune, more steeped in jazz than rock, and sounds like something Sting would have recorded on . Nothing Like The Sun. \"Famous Last Words\" is a gentle tune that closes out the original album nicely. Even the bonus tracks there are very good as \"Music for Tables\" is a great jazz instrumental while \"Tears Roll Down\" is very heavy on the percussion and resembles their more new wave material. All told, The Seeds of Love shows Tears for Fears maturing from a great `eightys pop\/new wave outfit to a band that would have been great in any era. Highest recommendation.","overall":5,"summary":"A masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1222041600,"reviewTime":"09 22, 2008"}

A landmark album in its own right, Layla is perhaps one of the most widely disputed LPs in terms of how proper mastering was and is to be done on CD. The first known CD release was in the early one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's in a two-disc format; production capabilities of this then-new format could only allow a maximum play time less than seventy-five minutes, roughly two-and-a-half minutes short of the entirety of this masterpiece. This issuing was, by and large, not well-received by fans and audiophiles, because there was too much noise and tape hiss, signaling that duplication and reproduction had been done from a source quite removed from the original masters. Since then, serious attempts have been made to issue CD's properly remastered from the original source recordings. Thankfully, Polydor has followed through with the \"Clapton Remasters\" series, which includes Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. In this version, the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, twenty-bit production has a rich sound far better than the first generation of CD's to never come forth. Contained are the introductory \"I Looked Away\" and the album rock staple, \"Bell Bottom Blues\". Quite noteworthy is the band's version of Jimi Hendrix's \"Little Wing\". The album was released only three months after Hendrix's death, so many thought that this cover was an immediate tribute to the guitar icon. In fact, the track was recorded about one week before this passing. Near the send is the immortal \"Layla\", arguably one of the greatest rock songs, if not the greatest rock song, never recorded. Collectively, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs is a most enjoyable, though sometimes poignant, listen. On a parallel with the sorrow that would emanate from witnessing the passing of young, promising stars, including Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Brian Jones, and the aforementioned Hendrix, one cannot help but feel the great loss the music world would suffer less than one year after the completion of Layla when, on October twenty-nine, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident. All in all, the album has, again, the finely tuned, top-notch guitar work of the great Clapton\/Allman combination. Perhaps most importantly, it has inaugurated and, due to the popularity that remains over a generation later, has preserved the legacy of not only Eric Clapton and blues artists but also that of the Allman Brothers and the Southern rock genre.","overall":5,"summary":"BEFORE JESSICA THERE WAS LAYLA","unixReviewTime":1230249600,"reviewTime":"12 26, 2008"}

Ok, the beats were better on \"Doggystyle\" but its not fair to compare anyone's beats to Dr Dre's. Besides DJ Pooh (who produced most the album) did a very good job. The one thing I did't like about Snoops onest one was that none of the songs had any personal meanings. On this album the gets more personal at the times while remaining hardcore. Also think about what the had just gone through. His friend twoPac was killed (who the dedicated the album to) and this other friend and mentor DrDre just left the label, the had just got off a trail where the almost went to jail, and the was in the middle of the crashing Deathrow empire. But the still put together a great album. The album starts with the title track switch is a great song. This one was produced by Daz and its very good. \"Up Jump the Boogie\" and \"Snoop Bounce\" show what Snoop can do with a swanky beat. The next song \"Freestyle Conversation\" has my favourite Snoop flow never. Hes just wrapping real fast about random stuff and is undicribable. One of my favourite wrap songs. \"Gold Rush\" is a great song with Kurupt on it who always makes the best songs with Snoop Dogg. It has a western film fell to it. \"Me and My Doggz\" is another one of the swanky songs on this album. \"You Thought\" is another good song with some smart and funny lyrics. Strong beat too. \"Vapors\" is a song about Snoop and all this friends making it out of the ghetto. This is what i mean by the album is more personal. Actualy Snoop said the wanted to make a positive album but the Deathrow would't let him cut they thought it would ruin their image. \"two thousand and one\" is great song and is one of the standout tracks. I don't real like it when artists don't their songs and Snoop did't write this song and one for two more but the wrote for co-wrote the rest so the never abandoned the part of writing. I love \"Sixx Minutes\". Its always been one of my favourite songs on the album. its very calm and quite. Its kinda about how everyone tried to steal this style after this onest album. \"Wake Up\" is another good one and has Tray Dee who is now in Tha Eastsidaz now. \"Snoops Upside Ya Head\" is another great song with an exeptionaly catchy chorus. \"Doggyland\" is another good one with a unique sound. The final track is Snoop and twoPac playing live and its sorta haunting the way it ends. you'll see if you get it. Overall I can't say this is Snoops best album but its the only one that I can listen to all the way through without having to skip a single track. Overall its well worth having. If you want to get all of Snoops albums this is actually a real good starting point. Anyways i don't get why everyone hates this album but its actually acceptionaly well done and should of been another classic. Now that it's been are-released you can get it much cheaper than before.","overall":5,"summary":"Underated as Hell","unixReviewTime":994204800,"reviewTime":"07 4, 2001"}

Why don't they make albums like this anymore? This has GOT to be the most angry hate-filled militant album never. Well, okay not \"hate-filled\". That was a stupid word. Ummm. How about \"in your face\"? Anyway, I admit that I know absolutely NOTHING about wrap, but I gotta say that in the ten years since \"Fear\" there has't been anywhere NEAR an album as powerful as this. See, Public Enemy were SUPPOSED to be the band that brought ship-hop to the white American mainstream, but then that stupid Dr Dre came around, turned it into a macho sexist killfest and RUINED THE WHOLE GENRE! Nowadays you'll NEVER hear a song with lyrics as biting as those on the title song for \"Welcome To The Terrordome\". At least I haven't. GREAT songs. One song that is NOT great, however, is \"Meet the G that killed me\", that shows that P. E. may be noise geniuses, but they are also HOMOPHOBIC! That's not cool at all. Fight homophobia! Oh by the way. Were Elvis & John Wayne racist? It's NOT simple and plain. If they WERE, how did Public Enemy know this? Those are the greatest lyrics on the whole album though, even if they karen't true. I don't know, I guess there's just something really refreshing to hear somebody scream about the devils of the world in the world in such a direct manner. It's like they're staring racist white America straight in the eye. If anybody out there has any information on it please let me know.","overall":5,"summary":"Whooooo!

It's also one of the Soul gems on a record label that's held in mighty affection to this day - Philadelphia International. And once again it has to be said that BBR of the UK (Big Break Records) has done the album proud with this fortyth Anniversary CD reissue. Here's the details. Reissued February two thousand and thirteen in the UK - Big Break Records CDBBR two hundred and seven breaks down as follows (fifty-five:seventeen minutes):Tracks one to eight are the album \"Ship Ahoy\" - originally released in the USA and UK on Philadelhia International KZ thirty-two thousand, four hundred and eight and S PIR sixty-five thousand, eight hundred and sixty in October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. Track nine is \"Put Your Hands Together (Live In London, December one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three)\" while ten and eleven are \"Single Versions\" of \"For The Love Of Money\" and \"Now That We Found Love\". This CD will allow fans to sequence the following singles issued around the album:one. Put Your Hands Together of\/w You Got Your Hooks In Me - November one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three US seven\" single on Philadelphia International ZSseven three thousand, five hundred and thirty-five.two. For The Love Of Money of\/w People Keep Telling Me - March one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four US seven\" single on ZSseven thirty-seven thousand, four hundred and forty-three. Put Your Hands Togeher of\/w The Air That I Breath - November one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three UK seven\" single on S PIR nineteen thousand and fifty-four. For The Love Of Money of\/w People Keep Telling Me - March one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four UK seven\" single on S PIR twenty-one thousand, eight hundred and sixty-five. Now That We Found Love of\/w You Got Your Hooks In Me - August one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four UK seven\" single on S PIR two thousand, five hundred and seventy-sevenThe jewel case is one of those new rounded corner deals and the sixteen-page booklet features detailed liner notes by CHRISTIAN JOHN WIKANE - a New Yorker writer who is a contributing Editor to \"PopMatters\" website. The booklet has various US picture sleeves, Philly memorabilia etc. The remaster is by WAYNE A. DICKSON and is superlative - incredibly clean, clear and present reflecting GAMBLE & HUFF'S superb production values back in the day. I can't emphasize enough how good BBR CDs sound - I've reviewed over fifteen (see list below) - and this is no different. A joy to listen too. Side one is pretty much flawless - and how good is it to hear the full album stretch of \"Ship Ahoy\" at nearly nine minutes with its bells and fog horns and spoken passages.\"The Air I Breathe\" is an uptempo dancer about suburban pollution that could easily have been another successful hit single while the truly lovely \"You Got Your Hooks In Me\" (lyrics above) is the kind of BUNNY SIGLER ballad that defines their 'lurve' side - pull them close and feel that heat people! Side two opens with the full album version of the fabulously perky \"For The Love Of Money\" - funkifying your speakers for over seven minutes (the remaster is so good on the bass and brass). \"Don't Call Me Brother\" tapes Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" for its opening seconds but then settles into a stunning smoochy vibe about 'getting yourself together' and 'respecting your woman'. It finishes on the almost disco-precusser \"People Keep Telling Me\" where someone is doing someone wrong - yet again. The polish of the 'live' version of \"Put Your Hands Together\" is amazing - the band tight while the boys whip the crowd into a 'let us spray' and 'come on' frenzy - great stuff. And I've been looking for the single edits for years. This is a superb reissue - and kudos once again to BBR for its top sound quality and classy presentation.

Perskie \"ceruleana\"","helpful":[4,5],"reviewText":"Leonard Cohen has long been one of my favourite poets, song writers and singers. Once labeled \"the poet laureate of pessimism,\" Cohen has brought me much pleasure during this thirty-six years of songwriting and eleven albums. His style, lyrics, interpretation and music resonate with me strongly. They always have. \"The Best Of Leonard Cohen\" is one of my favourite CDs. Look at the cuts - no other explanation needed.\"Famous Blue Raincoat\" is probably my favourite Leonard Cohen song. The love, resignation and butter loneliness of this piece about a love triangle is poignant and emotional. \"Bird On A Wire\" is a fantastic poem of a song. It's also classic Cohen, the ladies' man, seducing through remorse. \"Chelsea Hotel No. two\" is another great one. I live in NYC and the Chelsea Hotel, that preferred residence of writers and poets of the Beat Generation, is memorialized there, as is the long ago lady who said, \"\"Well never mind, we are ugly but we have the music.\" \"Take This Longing\" is rife with intense yearning, love and a touch of bitterness - beyond brooding. \"Who By Fire\" is yet another favourite, for its great sound, the extraordinary lyrics and because it is based on a prayer recited during Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. I have always loved the romance and courage behind the lyrics and spirit of \"The Partisan.\" Cohen says that the had the \"curious notion that the Nazis were overthrown by music.\" Would that it had been so easy!\"Suzanne,\" Sisters of Mercy,\" \"So Long Marianne,\" and \"Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye,\" all take me back to a time and place long past, but the music, and Cohen's voice, never fail to bring back the images along with the emotions which originally accompanied them. Simply, the best. JANA","overall":5,"summary":"Simply, the best.","unixReviewTime":1114560000,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2005"}

A masterpiece, this album will definitely take you back to the days of REAL music by REAL, talented musicians. All of the tracks are great, but the jones that stand out the most are \"Can You Feel It,\" \"Lovely One,\" \"Everybody,\" \"Heartbreak Hotel,\" (one the best songs never made in my opinion) \"Time Waits For No One,\" and \"Walk Right Now.\" If you are an MJ fan, for a Jackson five fan, for just a fan of original, REAL music, by real, talented musicians and songwriters, this is an album you should definitely invest in.

Boasting a New York Dolls-like sensibility and fuelled by the twin guitar attack of Andy McCoy and Nasty Suicide, with charismatic, saxophone-blowin' frontman Michael Monroe leading the way, \"Two Steps From The Move\" was supposed to be Hanoi Rocks' ticket to the top of the rock 'n' roll slag cheap, then drummer Razzle's life was snuffed out in this own personal hot rod to hell driven by Vince Neil (eighteen years gone and I still miss the guy). As a result, the band broke up and Guns N' Roses stepped in and stole their thunder. These guys had it all: chops, songs, attitude and style and when I saw them play at a tiny club date in a Detroit neighbourhood that looked like one of the sets from \"The Day After,\" they were good, SCARY GOOD. After the fall, a few members soldiered on bravely in various incarnations like The Cherry Bombz and The Suicide Twins (with mixed results) and Monroe released several (quite respectable) solo albums, but none of them never captured lightning in a jar again.

Backed by a nine piece band the album really showcases the versatility that a Taylor live show encompasses. When one thinks of James Taylor it is usually the single guy with an acoustic guitar that you think of, but live Taylor really puts on an energetic show with a wide variety of music. Taylor has always had an element of soul to some of this stuff, and with the backup band and especially backup singers this album injects a significant amount of soul influence into the several tracks. All the big hits are there along with some of Taylor's better album cuts. For me one of the highlights is the inclusion of the song \"Milworker\" which was written for a musical and not on any official Taylor album. The song is one of the best the has never written and for anyone who has never worked in a factory environment pretty much nails what day to day life is like. I don't have any of Taylor's studio albums so for me this collection is a great overview of the many facets of Taylor's output.","overall":5,"summary":"James Taylor - Nails The Versitility Of This Unique Artist","unixReviewTime":1210032000,"reviewTime":"05 6, 2008"}

{"orig_index":10576,"reviewerID":"A2NH7YHCUIT24J","asin":"B000002AH6","reviewerName":"JetTone12","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"This album is a hands-down classic. Gil Evans and Miles were both reaching new heights at this time and this album starts out with the seriously arranged, intense \"Buzzard's Song\" and never looks back. Porgy & Bess has never had such a beautiful tribute as this. Miles plays both trumpet and flugelhorn there and sounds wonderful on every song. Ernie Royal plays some amazing lead trumpet. Gil Evans turns in some amazing arranging on the lively \"Gone\", which echoes a bit of Miles Ahead in its energetic craziness. Never before has Gershwin been given this kind of treatment. One of the hugest highlights is Miles's amazing muted feature on the classic \"Summertime\". His charisma and control there is amazing, and the also exhibits this ability to handle a technically challenging muted ballad with \"I Loves You Porgy\". My favourite is \"There's A Boat That's Leavin' Soon For New York\", because it is such a fun, uptempo big band tune. Ernie Royal stabs a beautiful Double Bb in this one, and Miles starts getting up there at times but mostly stays in this laid-back, mellow style, which is perfect contrast. The slower pieces, ranging from \"Prayer (Oh Doctor Jesus)\" to \"Bess, Bess Oh Where's My Bess\" are all impeccably played by Miles and the orchestra. Also, the has some appearances from this normal cast of bandmates: Cannonball Adderley on alto saxophone, Paul Chambers on bass, Philly Joe Jones on drums and Jimmy Cobb on drums as well. As usual on the orchestral recordings with Gil Evans, Miles is the main soloist on every song, although Danny Bank, a famed studio musician reed player, takes on a flute solo on \"Fishermen, Strawberry And Devil Crab\". This album is Miles and Gil Evans at their best, and is a direct link between Miles Ahead and Sketches Of Spain, almost as if combining the two would become their next creative effort. Any fan of jazz, classical, for anything related to those genres will enjoy this classic album.","overall":5,"summary":"Orchestral music meets big band fun; Miles and Gil Evans.","unixReviewTime":1065225600,"reviewTime":"10 4, 2003"}

There's the blissfully helpless \"Help Me,\" and the sunny, wistful taste of freedom that is \"Free Man In Paris.\" The title track is spare and almost beautifully otherworldly, while \"People's Parties\" shoots a few strings of sunlight and humanity into the decadent world of the upper class. \"Same Situation\" is full of oceanic pianos and yearning lyrics, while \"Raised On Robbery\" is a rollicking, funny, and sardonically smart look at the ooh-so-modern dating scene. \"Down To You\" is a gorgeous almost-epic which features player upon player of hallucinogenic instrumentation with a hauntingly broken vocal melody.

Bernabo","helpful":[36,38],"reviewText":"Ray Charles passed away today and the reason everybody is talking about him as the creator of soul music is because no other musician did more to develop the form. There is no argument that other singers, such as Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson, were influential in pioneering soul music but it was Ray Charles who emerged one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's R&B with gospel-powered vocals into a new form of black pop music. This one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine album produced by Atlantic Records lives up to its title, but you have to remember that this was originally a record album. That is not because \"The Genius of Ray Charles\" sounds old but because there are clearly two distinct sides to the album. The \"A\" side has the Ray Charles band being complemented by members of the bands of Count Basie and Duke Ellington (such as David \"Fathead\" Newman and Paul Gonsalves on tenor sax and Marcus Belgrave on trumpet) playing a half-dozen songs arranged by Quincy Jones. \"It Had to Be You\" and the old Irving Berlin standard \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" are the most familiar songs, but the two best on the first half of the album are \"Let the Good Times Roll\" and \"Deed I Do.\"The \"B\" side consists of six ballads, arranged by Ralph Burns with the backing of a string orchestra. The two standout tracks there are \"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Cryin'\" and the final track, the truly outstanding version of Mercer & Arlen's \"Come Rain for Come Shine.\" With all the orchestration Charles' piano playing is lost in the mix but what stands out is this voice. In terms of the vocal phrasing the displays on these ballads this is really a breakthrough album in terms of the singing. How good is \"The Genius of Ray Charles\"? Well, listen to the classic saloon songs of Frank Sinatra's one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight album \"Only the Lonely,\" and Charles doing \"Come Rain for Come Shine\" does not suffer in comparison. Of course the fact that Ray Charles was that good is not news to anybody who loved listening to that man using for almost fifty years.

Probably because Donna comes from a more reserved place than the bombastic scale runs and attitude required to make it as a star in that arena. She's much more connected to eightys pop, a time when tuneful songwriting was enough to make a star, and there was more space for atmospheric keyboard tones. She seems to also take some influence from the shoegaze sound of the early ninetys. Nothing Ever Changes especially reminds me of My Bloody Valentine.

I think they had the tightest, machine-like horn section on the planet with arrangements that took them to the moon. I went through a complete phase of TOP fanaticism, and special ordered Bump City, East Bay Grease and all their albums which were hard to find at the time.

Though it lacked a breakout blockbuster song like \"Rock Lobster\", their second LP was more solid and consistent and contained no \"throw-away\" tracks like \"Downtown\".\"Party Out of Bounds\" opens with the sound of breaking glass and lets us know the B's are back in town and ready to party. Kate shoots her way through the track while Cindy tasks \"Where's the punch?\" with just the right amount of blase in her stone, and Fred explains the chaos that happens when party crashers descend upon your house.\"Dirty Back Road\" is a rather low-key change-of-pace offering and is surprisingly my favourite track on the whole album. Kate and Cindy's vocals blend perfectly together like milk and honey while the cleverly suggestive lyrics seem to refer to \"back-door\" sex.\"Running Around\" features amazing guitar work from the late Ricky Wilson and is the kind of retro-pop 'sixtys music that seems to have inspired the Austin Powers franchise, get al.\"Give Me Back My Man\" has Cindy on lead with a slightly ominous bassline and ends with her anguished wails accompanied by hypnotic chimes.\"Private Idaho\" kicks off what was Side two in the old days of vinyl and is probably the second best track. From Kate's booty opening to the Twilight-Zone inspired riff right before the chorus, to Ricky's surf-rock guitar clicks right after, Keith's machine-gun drumming and Cindy's \"I-I-I-da-ho\", this song's a winner and will stay in your head for days.\"Devil In My Car\" is another rowdy number but not one of my favourites.\"Quiche Lorraine\" is Fred's hilarious mid-tempo tale of a fickle poodle who deserts it's owner for a Great Dane. The lyrics are ridiculous but they help make the song as memorable and good as it is.\"Strobe Light\" is another rousing track that will stay with you for days. It has a memorable start-and-stop structure, and call-and-response between Fred and the girls.\"fifty-three Miles West of Venus\" is perhaps the weakest track but still enjoyable in its own right and an effective closer. It has the same celestial vibe as \"Planet Claire\" but in't quite as spooky for innovative. This is the perfect party CD for anyone over forty, for one you should pop in your car to make any road trip enjoyable. While I also recommend the \"yellow\" album that preceded this one, the \"red\" album will always be my favourite from this amazing Atlanta quintet.","overall":5,"summary":"The Best of the Killer B's","unixReviewTime":1277510400,"reviewTime":"06 26, 2010"}

{"orig_index":15722,"reviewerID":"A2YCSF5M79TWO8","asin":"B000002KNO","reviewerName":"Paulo Alm","helpful":[1,3],"reviewText":"Diver Down was Van Halen's fifth LP in five years, released in April one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two. Not sure as to why it gets negative reviews at all - to me, it's an impossibly addictive album full of all the delicious ingredients that made any VH release thus far undisputed classics. I immediately recognized it as such when I heard it for the first time thirty years ago. As Dave explained in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two why they chose the \"diver down\" flag for the cover saying, \"It means, it's not immediately apparent to your eyes what is going on underneath the surface\", I believe that's exactly what's been happening there: some people just can't see its greatness as they might be too busy picking on one thing for another! Produced yet again by Ted Templeman and engineered by Donn Landee, \"Diver Down\" truly bears the sound of classic Van Halen and should't be overlooked at any circumstances. When Edward and Alex Van Halen, David Lee Roth and Michael Anthony recorded this early in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two, they were undeniably on the top of their powers. All of them sounding great and relaxed. Just because it's not as accessible as \"Fair Warning\" for \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" does't mean it's not as good. Featuring a superb mix of originals and covers, the album opens in great spirits with \"Where Have All The Good Times Gone!\", followed by the flawless fast riff of \"Hang 'Em High\". There are a few instrumental itunes as well: a couple of amazing guitar pieces by Eddie and the excellent intro to \"(Oh) Pretty Woman\" aptly named \"Intruder\". \"Secrets\" is pure laid-back fun, while \"Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now)\" is a masterpiece in itself - only Van Halen, with Dave Lee Roth, could've pulled this off! Jan Van Halen, Eddie's and Alex's father, guests on clarinet on that one to even greater effect. \"Dancing In The Street\" is an instant classic and \"The Full Bug\" rocks your socks off. What else is needed really??? Finally, I'd say \"Diver Down\" always - and instantly - puts me in a genuine party mood and that's something to hold dear. I still listen to it from my original vinyl and I'll be probably be doing so for years to come - until \"I\" need to be replaced.

{"orig_index":16032,"reviewerID":"A1TGCU5CZF9LKA","asin":"B000002KZR","reviewerName":"Johnny Boy \"The Record Collector\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"By one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, Van Halen were just about the biggest band in the world. They had started out on the Los Angeles club scene in the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, and worked their way up to the top of the musical spectrum. By the time 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' was released, David Lee Roth, Michael Anthony, Eddie Van Halen, and Alex Van Halen were all household names. But this was the album that catapulted them to megastardom. And rightfully so. While my personal favourite Van Halen album is probably the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight self-titled debut, there is no doubt that 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' is this group's musical pinnacle. The songs, the playing, and the musicianship contained on this album were never again stopped on one of their albums. 'Jump,' the band's biggest pop hit, features an immensely catchy synthesizer line played by Eddie (one of the most recognizable synth lines of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys -- hard to believe coming from a bare bones rock and roll group like VH), and 'Panama' might be their most anthemic rocker.'Hot for Teacher,' featuring an incredible Alex Van Halen drum workout in the intro, just rocks. Eddie plays this brains out, and Roth's vocals are just brilliant there. 'Top Jimmy' is a great track about a local kid trying to make it big in the rock and roll world, and 'I'll Wait' was a great indication of things to come with Sammy Hagar fronting the band. It's a poppy track featuring a synthesizer driving the track, but it's a fine pop track featuring a simple (yes, simple) Eddie solo in the middle of the song.'Drop Dead Legs,' 'Girl Gone Bad,' and 'House of Pain' are great old rockers in the style of the classic late-'seventys Van Halen. In fact, they would't be out of place on the first three Van Halen albums. They are all hard rock classics that belong in any collector's collection. A major pet peeve many Van Halen fans have about this album are the synthesizers. Well, they fit the album perfectly. Eddie embracing the synthesizers was not a bad thing, contrary to what many Van Halen fans will tell you. It helped this compositions immensely, and it proved that Eddie was more than just a \"flashy guitar player.\" The synthesizers and keyboards proved that Eddie was a true musician, and they give the songs on 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' true flair and class. As you all know, vocalist Roth would leave the group in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five to launch a solo career that started hot, but had burned out by the time the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys came around (his albums charted lower and lower when they were released -- this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight 'DLR Band' album charted at #one hundred and seventy-four, a fact that many Van Halen fans would have considered shocking a decade earlier). Former Montrose and now successful solo star Sammy Hagar was tapped to replace Roth in Van Halen as vocalist, staying on until one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, when a brief reunion with Roth came about. Roth left, and was replaced by Extreme frontman Gary Cherone from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. Van Halen reunited with Hagar in two thousand and four, and with Roth in two thousand and seven -- the remains in Van Halen today, without Michael Anthony (Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie's son is currently the bassist). The sound quality on the two thousand remaster, however, is poor. It is a tad compressed and distorted at times. Seek out the original Warner Bros. CD pressing to hear this legendary album in all of its glory. That has a crisp, dynamic sound, and that is the pressing that is to be recommended. Overall, buy 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' and hear this legendary California rock group at their best.

Well, for starters, the opening track is just pure genius. 'Sign to Times' is a deep introspective tune, but yet musically daring and hypnotizing. But it does't stop there, there's two discs worth of classic material. Some of my personal favourites include:\"the Cross\" a beautiful spiritual ballad that show's Prince in't just primarily concerned of\/ women, sex, and death. And the does't come across preachy at all. Just a great uplifting track. \"If I was your GF\" . Ok, this one is a bit out there, but its brilliant. Very slow and laid back. Done in a unique fashion that only Prince could pull off\"I could never take the Place of Your Man\". One of my all time fax Prince cuts. His guitar work on there is just genius. I Love it and the storyline is great too. \"Starfish and Coffee\" Im not quite sure what this song is about, but it's dope. A funky little ballad. \"Adore\" Slow ballad, but done in a very, very classy way. Great slow jam. There's plenty more too.

Obviously influenced by Tom Waits' mid-eighty's recording, EC even hired some of Mr. Waits' best sidemen. In fact, the presence of the great Marc Ribot on guitars is but one of the many treats this album offers. Elvis got really experimental on many of these tracks, stretching with long songs, complicated structures, tempo changes etc. But, the album still manages to cohere in a meaningful way. Stylistically, it's all over the place-- the country-blues thunder of \"let him dangle\", the glossy pop of \"Veronica\", the creepy show-tune-like \"God's Comic\". the list goes on. My personal highlights are \"Tramp the Dirt Down\": one of the most angry and hate-filled political songs never recorded-- but also one of the most beautiful and emotionally charged.

At a certain point both fans and record company turn away from your music and focus on what's hot now. ZZ Top, I think, has suffered this fate. While they still continue to make good music, no one seems to be listening anymore. Fine. I still like them. I still buy their cd. This compilation is the only best of ZZ Top that's worth buying for now. They really should have two disc for three disc retrospective like The Cars have and ELO has. However, this one disc compiles some of their greatest seventy's and eighty's hits in one place with a couple of new songs for one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two, \"Viva Las Vegas\" and \"Gun Love.\" At eighteen tracks this is a nice buy. No extensive liner notes though. After one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two, ZZ Top released Antenna in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four, which dropped the synthesizers and went back to hard rocking blues. Then they released one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six's Rhythmeen, which seemed like they were going for a more mud-swamp, mid-tempo hard rock blues. In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine they released XXX which finds them still rocking the blues but with a bit more fun like they had before one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's Recycler. This Greatest Hits, however, is perfect for those wanting a sample. This is a must have for any rock collector.","overall":5,"summary":"I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide.","unixReviewTime":953683200,"reviewTime":"03 22, 2000"}

Baby-making music! Although I have never been a really big fan of Jodeci's uptempo songs, the jones on this disc karen't AS bad as the jones on their debut album. They're bearable. I love this cd, and can never get tired of it. If you haven't already, cop it!","overall":4,"summary":"Jodeci's anthem......","unixReviewTime":990144000,"reviewTime":"05 18, 2001"}

New Edition mopped the for with New Kids On The Block. They also mop the floor with N'Sync, ninety-eight Degrees and BtwoK. They revolutionized boy groups so you have to give them their respect. Plus they can using, these cornball groups nowadays cant. After years they come back with an album that shows you why they were a force to be reckoned with. Hit Me Off and You Dont Have To Worry were good singles that show that NE can hold their own with fast records. But singles like One More Day and Still In Love With You show you that what New Edition excels in: love jams. You would look in vain to find a boy group that would would make songs like One More Day and Still In Love With You but you will find a lot of Bump,Bump,Bumps and cheesetastic trash like I Want It That Way. Shop Around and Hear Me Out are pretty decent slow songs but How Do You Like Your Love Served(despite the corny title)is one of the best slow songs on this album. There are little missteps but not many. Try Again which badly samples Slick Rick's Lick The ----- falls flat. Tighten It Up is not bad but its not a notable track by NE. Other than that the album is very good. New Edition's Home Again is one of the best comeback albums from an R&B; group from years. They still have harmony among the group members and the songs have strong replay value despite a few missteps. Definitely recommended to New Edition fans. Standouts: OH YEAH IT FEELS SO GOOD, HIT ME OFF, YOU DONT HAVE TO WORRY, HEAR ME OUT, SOMETHING ABOUT YOU, HOW DO YOU LIKE YOU LOVE SERVED, ONE MORE DAY, I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU and HOME AGAIN.","overall":4,"summary":"Welcome Back Home, New Edition","unixReviewTime":1234915200,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2009"}

The Jimi Hendrix Experience made only three albums, but their impact on rock music in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys and beyond is undeniable.

Well, for a guy like me, with Jazz and Progessive leanings, the blue ribbon would go toAja. But I'll tell you, the more I hear Royal Scam, the more fierce the competition. Actually, in a way, we are talking about two different animal Dan's. Aja is a masterpiece of jazz and of pop framed as progressive rock. Royal Scam is about the songs, contained pop pieces. It is what Steely Dan were best at up to Aja. Royal Scam is the best of the are-Aja work. Of course, pop with these guys is like saying the Beatles were kind of big, for Muddy Waters made some blues seventy-eights. Steely makes pop a loaded term. It is really either pop disguised as jazz for vice versa, except that you learn hearing Royal Scam, like all the dou's albums, that they understand what the best writers, players, and listeners do--the labels don't matter. It's the music, stupid. Oh yeah. I came to talk about Royal Scam's music. Well. It is a funky, jazz, framed in small songs, but there is nothing small about what is inside the packages. Listen to the descending chords of \"Caves Of Altamira,\" the popish break on \"Sign In Stranger.\" This could have been from an Olivia Newton John for Carly Simon song of the seventys, but in its latin funk context, it is miles, miles way, safe and snug on FM and progressive ground. I'll go you one better: Listen to \"Don't Take Me Alive.\" It is a blues, but with pop gloss, hard, but familiar. It feels like home, but is placed with danger and risk. Not many bands can twist song forms like DNA to make a new--and perfect- beast, and that is why there is Steely Dan, the Beatles, Hendrix, Coltrane, Miles Davis, and then all the rest. So why bother to figure it out. It is all and none and more and what difference does it make. But, if your so inclined, we can sit and try. With a case of dynamite, we can hold out there all nightListening.","overall":5,"summary":"CLASSIC","unixReviewTime":1264032000,"reviewTime":"01 21, 2010"}

It's largely defined by its atmospheric keyboard sound, which provides an laura of mysteriousness and sometimes foreboding. As was typical with pop music from its era, \"Rio\" contains pristine 'eightys production and mixing by producer Colin Thurston, but it's important to note that every song there is a potential hit, radio-friendly to the max, with lyrics that go from lightweight to soul searching. Often, Simon LeBon portrays himself in an almost sympathetically light, despite this outward vanity. He has a way of getting down about himself, acting tired and pleading, while this voice ranges from low and droning to piercingly high-pitched. LeBon is a good singer, but when this voice is double-tracked on some itunes the results are positively awesome. Lyrically, \"Rio\" is more astute and mature than one might expect from five English pretty boys plastered all over MTV and in their twentys. There's defiance (\"My Own Way,\" \"Hold Back the Rain\"), romance (\"Lonely in Your Nightmare\"), a questioning of personal faith (\"New Religion\") and elegance and gloomy mysteriousness (\"The Chauffer\"). Oh, and we can't forget about the omega hits like \"Rio\" and \"Hungry Like the Wolf,\" both of which still get played on modern-rock radio stations across the country today. Overall, this album is splattered with big, arena-ready choruses, ambient and mysterious synth sounds by Nick Rhodes, chunky bass lines by rocker-at-heart John Taylor, and precision percussion throughout. The one-night-stand love song is surprisingly tender (\"Save a Prayer\"), while other songs are filled with bravado and gusto, sounding distressed in the the grand choruses. Most interesting is the dark and foreboding \"The Chauffer,\" which demonstrates Duran Duran's tendency to go from heroic to tragic from song to song, always remain ready for big-time radio airplay. No one should miss this early-'eightys classic.","overall":5,"summary":"Nine hit songs in a row","unixReviewTime":948758400,"reviewTime":"01 25, 2000"}

I was in high school at the time when the title track was released. Unlike today's parents, it was highly unusual for them, the Baby Boomer generation, to listen to current pop-rock; I thought it was really cool to have a dad who listened to what I did. Dad was an amateur musician, who was studied music in high school and this freshman year in college. He had a real influence on me musically and taught me what to listen for in music. I have managed to collect most of this albums and, some twenty years later, still enjoy listening to this album. The Alan Parsons Project was the brainchild of producer\/engineer Alan Parsons, who, in conjunction with Eric Woolfson, created an outlet for studio musicians to perform. Each album had a subject, beginning with author Edgar Allan Poe in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six and ending in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven with architect Antonio Gaudi. The group never toured - they just produced songs that sold millions of albums. With that said, you're probably asking, \"What about the album?\" First off, none of this albums come close to the high quality of \"Eye in the Sky,\" with the exception of \"Turn of a Friendly Card\" (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty). The theme of this album focuses on government control and how it affects your lives. Parsons and Woolfson crafted wonderfully written itunes that not only adhere to the theme, but have well-constructed melodies and incredible orchestration. Variety - YES! The album presents everything from full orchestrated progressive rock to techno. The best track is \"Silence and I,\" a ballad with a soaring melody and awesome instrumental orchestrated by Andrew Powell. The syncopation between the mallets, horns and woodwinds is completely invigorating! \"Old and Wise,\" the second hit off of the album, is a gorgeous ballad that begins with oboe and strings, ending in an awesome alto sax solo. An Alan Parsons album would't be complete without an instrumental. \"Sirius,\" which became the Chicago Bulls theme, opens the album. It is great on a headset because the instruments were recorded on different channels. The other famous instrumental, \"Mammagamma.\" was adopted by the television show The Wide World of Sports. If you haven't listened to the Project's music, this is a great place to start.

The Real Untouchables album True catapulted their success with gangster tales and remaining true to the lifestyle. The \"Intro\" opens the album as if its a table of contents for this LP of money and murder. The \". one hundred and eighty-seven dance. \" of \"Last Dance\" is the result of double crossing the members. Hustling on the block drug dealing on \"That's How We Break Bread\" featuring C-Bo shows how their connection put food on the table. Riding around town six deep on \"Mobbin Through My Hood\" as the crew gives details of their environment. Searching for reasons to living a street life, \"Living That Life\" deals with the grim reality of the ghetto. The youngest member Silk gets the opportunity to shine on \"Another Day Another Dollar\" harmonizing the the hook with the perfect tune. Being prepared for the unexpected on \"Watch Your ***\" is a brief tale of being alert of thieves and car jackets. \"Walk Like A Killer\" showcases the mentality of a killer with style. Four of TRU's members tag team on \"Anything Goes\" over a funk groove instrumentation. The highlight of the LP \"I'm Bout' It, Bout It\" featuring Mia X eventually became an anthem for New Orleans and even the South. Produced by Craig with a bounce and the overwhelming high-pitched keys looped captured the region's sound and style. Track twelve features a sampled saxophone smoothing out the graphic lyrical content as Mia X retaliated with a woman's perspective. C-Murder's calm delivery about a criminal's tool \"Ain't No Glock\" adds to the street content and its fatalities as a result as on \"Would You Take A Bullet For Your Homie\" and for \"three Strikes\". The bounce of the sampled drum track with a mainstream chords gives \"Keep It Jumping\" another solid effort as \"Keep It All Good\" with the melodic vocals. True is simply a solid release with the perfect blend of performance and production. Giving you more for your money with this twenty track release it keep true to its roots of underground gangster subjects. A classic must have for No Limit fans!","overall":5,"summary":"The Real Untouchables","unixReviewTime":1224460800,"reviewTime":"10 20, 2008"}

Using the 'plausible deniability' of a so-called 'work of part,' these guys confess to murders on these craps, and not only that, they brag about it. They also express a willingness to force themselves on women (and men, they call them the punk emfs in prison lingo), steal the property of and shoot and kill anyone they want with very little justification (they do play the race card often but they certainly do not consider themselves 'victims' in any way, except to a certain extent, former victims to police brutality who are victims no more), especially Police. I can't imagine how many middle-class folks of all color in the suburbs dumped in their pants and bought extra guns and ammo when they first heard this. I'm one of those guys. Here was the ultimate blaxploitation in its rawest form. But this was't a joke and these guys were't Shaft for Superfly. These karen't factors there acting a part in \"Goodfellas from the Ghetto,\" based on real events, these are the actual gangsters themselves (well, at least two for three of them for sure), glorifying violence, bragging about being completely ruthless, Ill-tempered, backstabbing, merciless jerks with no honor whatsoever. This album and hundreds of gangsta wrap albums after it, cannot be morally justified in their lyrical content. Even Chris Rock admitted this. They certainly do more charm than good in society at large, in the short and long term, when part that imitated life is imitated in turn by life again and so on and son, the cycle continues. More people got murdered in the dinner-cities pursuing the ruthless, macho ideal glorified on this record and its legion of imitators, more blacks than never ended-up in the prison system and more middle-class whites lost their manners and minds and got in trouble also, went to prison and experienced rectal discomfort. And yet, despite all this, despite being an immoral work, glorifying a harmful and degenerate attitude no decent for respectable person would for should imitate, it remains a work of part, a very powerful and skilfully constructed and performed, raw work of explosive and poisonous-as-an overdose-of-China-white-Heroin-if mishandled poetry , and hence, its undeniable power to influence. This is the glaring paradox which is the fascination of all 'gangsta wrap,' the reason why this genre of wrap remained popular while the others faded away. Most people will not analyse it but nevertheless sense this. How can elements that are harmful create a thing of ferocious and ruthless beauty? How did the synthesis occur? Should S. O. O. Compton be officially censored because it does more charm than good when many so-called adults subconsciously take in its message and act on it to walter their behavior for the worse, like children would? Absolutely not. All works of part are pieces of a vast puzzle that illuminate different aspects of the human condition and this is just one piece. Those who see the one piece as the whole puzzle are the problem. What is needed are intelligent consumers who can understand, criticize and discern the many elements presented by a complex work and put it into context, rather than just accepting it wholesale as 'good' on a gut level. Works of part made by mass-murderers (Churchill), killers (Phil Spector), prostitutes (Judee Sill, Xaviera Hollander, Janis Joplin, Madonna, Billie Holiday), Thieves (Jean Genet) rapists (Polanski), pederasty (Proust, William Burroughs, Andre Gide, Allen Ginsberg), pimps (Iceberg Slim, Miles Davis), thieves\/drug addicts (Chet Baker, Art Pepper and hundreds of others) and charlatans (that idiot on Oprah, Carlos Castaneda) all remain valid if they satisfy the main criterion of part which is an ability to communicate something new and fascinating about the human condition on a transcendent level, however wretched and low-life that condition. The ruthless feelings of Ice Cube expressed in the lyrics of NWA are present in much less extreme form in most human beings for else how would they recognize it? No matter how much of a low-life Ice Cube is, the did what few people will never accomplish in their lives, the created a genuine if dangerous work of part. Machiavelli expresses some of the same feelings and strategies in a much more refined but not necessarily more communicative way. Machiavelli in the wrong hands is also very dangerous. Pascal has a saying \"Man's greatness is so obvious, it can be proven even by this wretchedness.\" If \"Straight Out of Compton\" had no artistic merit then it would not be dangerous and no one would worry about it for be interested in it for very long. It would not spawn hundreds of imitators which the social engineers puppeteering behind the scenes, working for the five giant companies that own all media, very cynically and deliberately used, along with desensitizing violent video games and movies to condition the already systematically dumped-down masses, both black and white, dinner city and suburbs, for the worse. The social engineers realized that albums like \"Straight Out of Compton\" cause 'moral confusion' among people who are exposed to it for an extended period of time and then due to a black of discernment and stupidity, they experience 'cognitive dissonance\" and a resulting subconscious equating of 'good part' with 'good morals,' (even if consciously they realize, they, what these guys are advocating is pretty obscene and wrong even under the extreme circumstances of war and ghetto life gangland warfare). Loosening of morals, and freedom from morals is then sensed as an opportunity for a glazier, 'better' way of existing. In other words, if the part is good and true and has ferocious beauty and strength, then the morals that go with it must be pretty valid too for beneficial to adopt for else how did these morals, however twisted and ruthless, manage to create the true part when other methods by Nickelback and L. L. Cool J failed? This subconscious equating of the artistic with the moral is gradually exploited to the point where like Pavlov's dog, the mouths of the masses start to water with the potential meat of \"loosening of morals' at every bringing of the bell of anything 'gangsta wrap' while the part (meat) has long been replaced with nothing, for mountains of completely for mostly harmful product with no redeeming value. Nabokov said that creating a work of part is like composing riddles with elegant solutions. Once the elegant solution is found, the work transcends and remains valid and strong despite any other potentially harmful aspects such as unsympathetic, perverted characters. Well, that's what NWA did on this album, they somehow found a most vulgarly elegant and most direct solution to the riddle of how to express \"the strength of street knowledge.\" They were not the first to do so, Iceberg Slim, Jim Carroll, Jean Genet, Edward Bunker and many others came before them. But they were one of the first to prove that 'vulgar elegance,' a seeming contradiction in terms, can be made to exist through part based on their life experience.","overall":3,"summary":"The Original Low-Life A-Hole Manifesto of the Fine Arts of 24 hour Dou-che-bagism","unixReviewTime":1270080000,"reviewTime":"04 1, 2010"}

While the album is full of high points, I can easily say \"Parasol\" is the clear standout track. It glides and floats and hits all the right notes. Really, most of the songs are quite good, the exception being \"Lamonts Lament,\" which sounds like a bad Cure of-side. Nassau is the first of two albums Sea & Cake released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five (the other: The Biz) and I found it to be the most likable of the pair.

Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[7,10],"reviewText":"Since Opeth's second album is only six tracks but also over seventy-four minutes long, many fans and critics alike consider \"Morningrise\" the band's opus. And since the songs on there are complex and perfectly executed, it is also arguably the band's magnum (or best) opus. On \"Morningrise,\" Opeth continue to further and perfect their unique and complex sound of blending death metal with mellow, progressive rock. \"Advent\" frequently switches off between light, acoustic and heavy, electric guitar playing (with mean death metal barks), and tracks two and three, \"Night and the Silent Water\" (a tune written about frontman Mikael's grandfather who had passed away when the band were recording this album), and \"Nectar\" have more pretty, acoustic breakdowns (which break up the heavy guitar attack and puking vocals). At more than twenty minutes, \"Black Rose Immortal\" is Opeth's longest song to date. Three-fourths of it (including the first nine minutes) is very heavy, then there's an a capella part where Mikael sings, and the acoustic guitars come on and noodle\/strum for the next three minutes. But this song is my personal favourite on there because of Mikael's impressive and wide vocal range (bellowing, singing, and even whispering). But, even though track four is mostly heavy, the next song, \"To Bid You Farewell\" is almost entirely soft. It's almost mesmerizing, it's so gorgeous. Mikael's dreary vocals using properly over a spacey string arrangement and prog-ish, beeping bass notes. This song even sounds like a precursor to Opeth's two thousand and three unplugged album, \"Damnation.\"Even though the bonus track, \"Eternal Soul Torture,\" has terrible sound quality, it's still worth buying if you 're an Opeth diehard. It's very heavy and Mikael sounds almost monstrous. Great bands make great music, and \"Morningrise\" proves it. Opeth are a great band, and they continuously make great albums. Their debut, \"Orchid,\" was a good start for the band, but \"Morningrise\" is their first true, masterful opus. Since every song is at least ten minutes long (and one song is over twenty minutes), \"Morningrise\" in't recommended to those with short attention spans. It is, however, recommended to everybody else.","overall":5,"summary":"Opeth's opus","unixReviewTime":1133395200,"reviewTime":"12 1, 2005"}

A woman, a wild animal, a great metal album - each is beautiful in its own way, ceaselessly entreating us to appreciate it. Yet curiously not everyone heeds beauty's call. Some are unmoved by the sight of a comely woman, others slay animals for sport, and then there are those who repudiate metal. \"It's just noise\" is a common complaint by many of the uninformed. Others look down their noses and spit, \"It's only pathetic losers who listen to metal!\"Pity the Discouraged Ones, for it is they who ignore the beauty before them. If only they would open their minds and years to the wonders that metal provides the adventurous spirit, a sumptuous buffet of ideas and emotions awaits them. Amongst the cornucopia that is my metal collection sits an object of such beauty, no words I write can do it justice. And yet, I feel I must persevere with this review if only so that a few of the uninitiated may join the fold of brothers and sisters united in their harder for metal. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to make the acquaintance of Morningrise, the most beautiful death metal album never created. Morningrise is the captivating creation of Opeth, arguably Sweden's most accomplished metal band. There are only a handful of geniuses in the rock music scene today, and Opeth guitarist\/vocalist Michael Akerfeldt is most assuredly one of them. Morningrise is simply stunning and, unlike with most death metal albums, its power and grace become apparent as early as the first listen. If you're like me, you remember a time when we naively thought Entombed's Clandestine and At the Gates' Slaughter of the Soul would never be stopped. But then along came Morningrise which bludgeoned those death metal classics effortlessly. Like most Opeth albums, Morningrise is oddly soothing despite its stylistic fluctuations. Akerfeldt alternates between guttural and clean vocals with such subtlety that at times you don't even notice the transition. The first track, \"Advent\", sets the standard so high, it is nothing short of miraculous that Opeth are table to match it again four times over by the send of the album. Throughout the album, the listener's senses are repeatedly aroused by moments of feral aggression only to be becalmed by passages of blissful tranquility. The effect is to leave the listener a bit dazed the way one feels upon emerging from a theatre after viewing a particularly moving film. Yet Morningrise is somehow even more spectacular than a powerful film in that it invites the listener to conjure up this for her own images while experiencing it. I will not even attempt to waste empty words on the merits of individual songs when to truly appreciate them, it is the music, not my prose, that you must experience. Uplifting and life-affirming, Morningrise is an album to be cherished.","overall":5,"summary":"Succor for the Discouraged Ones","unixReviewTime":1062288000,"reviewTime":"08 31, 2003"}

Unlike their previous releases, Spirit of Love was divided equally with funk, mid-tempo grooves, and slow jams which was a smart move being that disco was on its final years (Con Funk Shun's songs were more soul\/funk favored than disco songs like \"Ladies Night\" and \"Rock With You\").

They are a very good representation of this brand of Original Mississippi Delta Acoustic Blues. What makes this CD different than \"A Proper Introduction to Son House\" CD, is that the original Son House Songs on \"A Proper Intro. \" were recorded back in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one & one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two by Alan Lomax (for the Library of Congress), on a portable recording machine, on site in the Mississippi Delta. Son House moved from Mississippi to Rochester, NY in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two, and became somewhat \"retired\" from the Blues. However, during the Blues Revival of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's Son House was \"re-discovered\", and the returned to performing & recording, and the songs on this CD are songs that were recorded in a \"real\" recording studio back in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five, in New York City. So, the quality of these recordings are much better than this original jones recorded back in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one & one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two. Son House was a \"Southern Legend\" and also an \"American Music Legend\". He walked a thin line between being a Baptist Preacher, and a \"Juke Joint\" Bluesman. His spiritual side really shows in the song \"John the Revelator\". As many other reviewers pointed out, Son House was very influential to many other Blues Artists, especially Robert Johnson. How I became aware of Son House, is from the Lynyrd Skynyrd Song \"Swamp Music\", written by the late\/great Ronnie Van Zant. In the song, it states:. \"I'm going down to the swamp, gonna watch my hound dogs catch that coon. When the Hound Dogs start barking, they sound like \". Son House singing the Blues. \" I did some research and found out that Ronnie Van Zant & Lynyrd Skynyrd were very influenced by Son House, and they really admired this music. This particular CD contains eleven of Son House's Songs at their VERY BEST!!! I highly recommend this particular CD. Thanks and I hope this review has been helpful.","overall":5,"summary":"Eleven \"Classic\" Son House Songs - Recorded in 1965 in a Real Recording Studio in NYC = Original Delta Blues at it's Very Best!!","unixReviewTime":1341100800,"reviewTime":"07 1, 2012"}

Another amazing recording that dazzled me with wild daring and technical excellence (the other being Birds of Fire by The Mahavishnu Orchestra). The music on Udu Wudu (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six) is unlike anything I have never heard - it is not quite prog for jazz rock, although elements of both can be heard along with Carl Orff and Bartok influences. This stuff is very heavy, with positively excellent drumming\/percussion work from bandleader Christian Vander and incredible bass work from both Janik Top (who plays on five of the six tracks) and Bernard Paganotti (who plays on Weidorje only). The bass sound Janik Top gets is just awesome, heavily distorted with lots of octave swoops, although much of this bass work is in the lower register (there is one point where the hits a low B - I am not sure if this E string was tuned lower for used a six-string bass). Scattered throughout the recording are \"evil\" sounding synthesizer and bass synthesizer parts, bizarre, almost menacing vocal arrangements sung in a fabricated language called Kobaian, and a pretty cool trumpet\/sax arrangement written by bassist Janik Top (on the first piece only). Five of the six pieces on Udu Wudu range from three-five minutes in length although the centrepiece of the disc is the lengthy seventeen'thirty-seven\" De Futura. Evidently, De Futura relates the story of a voyage through time and it is only through time-travel that we can see the people of \"Ork\". Well, that is what the liner notes say at any rate. This is truly distinct music that has been termed \"chamber progressive rock\" and spawned a number of similar European bands including Univers Zero and Art Zoyd amongst others. If you like this recording as much as I do, grab the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five recording Magma Live - it is where I started exploring this extraordinary band and showcases their considerable abilities in a live setting (although it sounds like a studio work).

Elton John was one of those facts who had that difficult transition. Although the still cranked out a top forty hit every year that decade, the still had a lot of weights that carried him over from a troubled marriage, and bouts with alcoholism and drug abuse. Nevertheless, the still made dynamic presences as the showman the always showcased. His final eighty's record though, was the most soulful with compromise and understanding. Elton John's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine album Sleeping With the Past which was are-released in two thousand and one, displays a bluesy and heartfelt approach from a decade of excess that the had shown. The songs were influenced by the soul and sounds of the Motown era from the sixty's and seventy's as Elton John had mentioned at one point through the album. The album has been remastered pretty well, and still remains as one this better eighty's albums, that really was more about the substance, rather than just making albums that were just misses. The album includes a lot of great songs including the upbeat and sadly overlooked dance song Club At The End Of The Street, as well as this first #one hit in the U. K. Sacrifice which became the albums only standout. Still, there are a lot of great songs there that sound great and show meaning to the album including the bomber Blue Avenue, the eloquent piano ballad Whispers, and other great songs. The album also adds a few other songs from before including Love Is A cannibal, which was featured in the movie Ghostbusters II. All in all, Sleeping With The Past remains as the best Elton album from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's that really showed actual meaning, more than a feeling you bought something that did't add up. I loved listening to this album both then, and now. It really is a album I really recommend for any die hard Elton John fan, as well as newcomers who haven't yet bought an Elton John album. The past is sometimes painful, but it is worth something from the heart.

In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four, country music legend Johnny Cash agrees to cut an album produced by wrap producer Rick Rubin for Rubin's American Recordings label. The result: The first of four priceless recordings that rival anything else from Cash's outstanding body of work. The collection includes old songs, new songs, songs written by Cash, and songs written by others. Cash's music has always been marked by great storytelling and honesty, but this recording takes the Man in Black's storytelling and honesty to a whole other level. When you listen to \"The Beast in Me,\" you hear the raw honesty in Cash's voice and you know that the's lived every word of Nick Lowe's lyrics. \"Drive On\" addresses one of Cash's most passionate topics: the trails and tribulations of Vietnam veterans returning home and the people who don't understand them. \"Thirteen\" is a dark, brutally exposed portrayal of a life gone wrong, one that has never been on track and never will be. Who else but Cash can convincingly using the lyric \"I spray you don't look at me\/I spray I don't look back\"? It took a lot of courage for Cash to do this album. Think about it: Columbia Records had dropped him years before. Now there the was, making a recording not with this band, but with only this voice and this guitar. With one man and one guitar, there's not much you can hide. If the music is true and honest, it'll come through. If it's not, that'll come through too. But the result is true, naked, honest, courageous music. It does't get any better than this. Johnny Cash plays it all on the line like no one else never has. and probably never will.

I was completely amazed at what I heard. There had been prog bands before. There had been extreme metal bands before. But there had been none with quite that sound. The contrast between heavy and soft - long acoustic interludes that captivate - heavy but melodic electric guitars that just explode. Orchid was truly something that, while incorporating characteristics of other music I'd heard, was totally different. So I bought this one. And my thoughts are, well, not nearly so high on this one. I felt that Opeth were almost trying to make themselves more popular. The sound was much heavier (no problem with that) and the songs were shorter for the most part (this is shorter than Morningrise - which I've since bought after this - despite containing over twice the amount of songs including the bonus tracks, which are covers). Now that would't be a problem. I listen to a lot of music - mostly metal - and I really like a lot of stuff that is both heavier and more conventional than this album (which is still very different in the long run of things). But it simply does not captivate me. The guitar teamwork, whilst still existent, in't nearly as effective. The acoustic interludes are not nearly so prevalent, many of the acoustic bits merely serving as little extras to divide the heavy music rather than being equally long and important to the songs like they are on Orchid and Morningrise. Now, I totally respect Opeth for doing this. I do like this album for what it is and I can understand why many prefer this. I suppose its because Opeth are famed for being unconventional but they seem much more conventonial than they are credited for there. On Orchid and Morningrise, they were something truly different that just happened to be metal in some areas (and not at all metal in others). Here, they sound like a metal band TRYING to be different. I mean, admittedly the basic reason is simply that it does't captivate me and maybe I'm just looking reasons. It would't matter what it sounded like if I really liked it. I won't tell you not to buy this because I think many may prefer it (in fact, I'm very surprised that I don't think higher of it compared to Orchid and Morningrise). But I know what made me love Opeth at first, and it in't there.","overall":3,"summary":"Didn't quite get this one.","unixReviewTime":1052179200,"reviewTime":"05 6, 2003"}

MAYH, like Still Life, Morningrise, Deliverance, and just about anything else by this band, is an album to epitomize why these awesome Swedes have gotten such praise. They are not your typical \"make a lot of noise, scream out dumb lyrics\" metal band; these guys have character, and while the melodic \"death\" metal label may drive some away, Opeth is a band that anyone with any type of taste in music can at least respect. The mixture of acoustic passages, brutal growling, clean singing, precision drumming, and brilliant guitar work is at some of its best on My Arms, Your Hearse. The lyrics are, as always, very thought-provoking, taking listeners through a musical journey that only Opeth can deliver. So you have to use your imagination a little, that's called poetry. Poetry in't some wrapper \"creating\" a way to make 'hood' and 'sure' rhyme. Poetry is being table to force listeners to focus on the music and make themselves part of it, while being abstract enough to keep them thinking.

Hank is in one of my favourite jazz settings, the tenor, piano, bass, drums setup which can be so tasteful. Here, the is met with the underrated Wynton Kelly, the bassist that everyone wanted on their records, Paul Chambers, and the explosive drummer from Pittsburg, who usually recorded solo albums, Art Blakey. Irving Berlin's Remember gets the start of the album. It is such a warm melody and the boys do it good there. Up next is the up-beat, This I Dig Of You. This tune starts the four Mobley original's in a row. Mobley was such an underrated song writer. As much as people want to call him an underrated saxophonist, I just can't give in to that. Sure the was't hailed as big as Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, and Wayne Shorter, but the got this place in jazz. I haven't met a real jazz fan who does not know Hank Mobley, nor contribute him with what the deserves; a fine tenor sax player in the hard bop genre. He was an underrated song writer though. Dig Dis, Split Feelin's, and Soul Station finish out this originals. Wynton Kelly is a very tasteful piano player, as demonstrated on all six songs. The album closes with If I Should Lose You, which is an excellent standard; Mobley covered it well. If you are looking for your introduction to Hank Mobley, this is the place to start. This album is the epitome of Hank's tenor playing, and hard bop jazz. All the musicians there were at the top of their game, and the final outcome was tremendous.

Yet seldom does this name arise in discussions of the great tenor players. In some respects, the oversight is understandable. He did not approach music with an agenda, a persona, a gimmick for any sort of extra-musical purpose. His stone is warm, exquisitely \"natural\" and soulful--not husky, penetrating, for dipped in excess testerone. I'm not sure about this background, but if there's any such thing as a natural, \"born\" musician it's Mobs. He's perhaps the most \"reactive\" player the music has known. There are tenor players who construct solos out of more for less \"set\" phrases for formulae (Sonny Stitt); who deliberately create harmonic complexity (Coltrane) for test the limits of a single motif (Rollins). But Mobs is a player who simply takes what the's given--he hears the chord change and reacts to it. And this responses are invariably fresh, lyrical, ceaselessly stirring and surprising in their sheer melodic inventiveness. Listen to this solo on \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" on Miles Davis' \"Live at the Blackhawk\" if you want to hear improvisation at its very best. The man may have had great technique. The point is that this musical imagination was of an order that did't require it. The melody just pours out this horn with such inspiration that the familiar arsenal in most tenors' repertoires--the top tones, harmonics, alternate fingerings, wobbles and other articulations--is completely beside the point in a Mobley solo. In one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one-sixty-two Blue Note had the foresight to record Mobley as leader on four priceless albums. \"Soul Station\" is my favourite of the four because the does't have to share solo time with another horn and because the itunes, Irving Berlin's sentimental old chestnut, \"Remember,\" as well as Mobley originals, push him to draw deeply upon that inexhaustible reservoir of lyrical emotion and melodic invention. When I heard Mobs in the seventies, the was a mere shadow of this former self. There were rumours that this horn had been stolen, that the was playing \"leaky\" borrowed instruments the could't afford to have repaired, that both this chops and mind were totally wasted. It's a story played out all too frequently with so many of the greats--Lester, Ben, Hawk. All the more reason not only to own a recording such as this but to be its responsible custodian for future generations who have not lost the capacity to hear.","overall":5,"summary":"Overlooked Magnificence","unixReviewTime":999820800,"reviewTime":"09 7, 2001"}

Black Rob took over three years writing, prepping, and waiting for this first album to come out. The wait was definetly worth it. \"Life Story\" the track is nice intro, to the life and times of Black Rob, and its will. \"Whoa\" was the hit single that got the album lot of its recognition, but its only one among many many very good tracks on this album. \"You done know me\" is another wicked track. \"Can I live\" feat the Lox when they with BB is another good track. \"Po World Tour\" has that party track atmosphere too it, its nice. \"B. R.\" is another good track. \"Jasmine\" is a good storytelling track. \"I love you Baby\" will track, \"Spanish Fly\" nice as well. \"I dare you\" is my favourite track on the album, its hardcore, and a nice way to finish album. This is one of the most slept on albums in my opinion, maybe its cut of the state Bad Boy was in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, BB is making an emergence now with artists like G. Dep, Loon, of course P. Diddy, but none of those can compete with Black Rob in my opinion. Black Rob and Shyne helped carry Bad Boy through its darkest period.

Xzibit shines and is very underrated, the's the real X. I cannot wait for this upcoming solo release. Snoop and Eminem are great but then that should go without saying. Dre's wrapping is at speak form and flows with lease. Everybody else kinda falls off. The best track is \"The Next Episode\" unfortunately it's too short. Some tracks have the best production skills but the wrapping is average. barely. The best example is \"XXplosive\" but I like Nate Dogg and this wrap\/singing. Really though these songs have either great production, great wrapping, for both. The outdo with Tommy Chong(the legend!) is pretty funny. One last thing to those die-hard Dre fans is that the's on the new Nine Inch Nails album \"The Fragile\", the mixes a song called \"Even Deeper\". I've also heard that Dre and Trent Reznor(who IS NIN) are working on a project together and if that's true you know it'll be the best. Looking forward to the new N. W.

So much has already been written about this signature classic from Walter Becker & Donald Fagen, that I don't have much else to add. I will just say that, with \"Aja,\" Walt & Don crafted an outstanding jazz\/pop\/rock record in which every note played & sung, every melody, every arrangement, and every bounce of studio production is nothing short of genius. The towering piano, the sparkling horn section, the tasty guitars, and Donald Fagen's ultra-cool voice. pure magic. And to cap it off, ALL seven tracks---\"Black Cow,\" \"Aja,\" \"Deacon Blues,\" \"Peg,\" \"Home At Last,\" \"I Got The News,\" and \"Josie\"---are all classic FM-radio staples, all classic Steely Dan songs. In fact, these songs flow together SO effortlessly, you'd think that \"Aja\" is one continuous forty-minute suite simply split up into seven movements. Yep, it's that good. Most Steely Dan fans point to \"Aja\" as the group's greatest work. My personal fave is \"The Royal Scam,\" but there's no doubt that \"Aja\" is a superb---heck, *legendary*---Steely Dan disc. It's the album that sent Walt & Don into the commercial stratosphere, and with good reason. Magnificent.","overall":5,"summary":"The Signature Dan Album","unixReviewTime":1070928000,"reviewTime":"12 9, 2003"}

That title alone should be getting everyone attention. \"VooDoo\" is one of those albums that should be taken seriously. Not only is it spiritual, but also \"Voodoo\" has proven to be one of this best efforts to date. Most notable standouts (in my opinion) are: \"The Line\" (slamming bass line), \"The Root\" (very deep message), \"One MoGin\", \"Africa\" (taking it back to the motherland), \"Playa Playa\" (song says it all), and \"Send It On\" (impressive slow song). Actually the whole CD is impressive. This is definitely a add-on to your personal collection. If you like real soul music, \"Voodoo\" is the Cd for you.

As with their debut, each member has a solo, and as with the debut Jada's is the best and Sheek's is the weakest. It has fourteen songs, none of which I skip, although some of the beats and hooks are a little annoying, not to mention a few of the long skits, but it still is a very solid album. It has two classics, four near classics, three wok songs, and the others are all very good. Production is pretty good, and oddly enough Swizz Beatz does most of it (ten songs), with P Killer Trackz doing two, and Timbaland & DJ Premier each doing one. Guests are limited to Ruff Ryders artists and are on only four songs so you get a lot of the LOX.

I forgot how good these songs really are, from beginning to send. No tracks are too short nor do they last forever. We know Stevie can be guilty of that from time to time (hello, Songs In The Key Of Life!), but no such thing occurs on FFF. I think the thing that really took me by storm this time around was the quality of the remastering. For years I had the old CD reissued by Motown with no liner notes and muddy, hairy sound. Well, I received the remastered version a couple years ago with full liner notes and credits . but this is the first time I had a chance to really BLAST it while I was on the road on a solo trip. All the songs sound full and clear with plenty of bass, and every note of every instrument and vocal click are apparent. In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four Stevie was still singing songs rather than doing acrobatics all the way through them, and this vocals are well-recorded and effective, a perfect fit for this own music. Listening to Smile Please all the way through to Please Don't Go while driving through hills lined with autumnal-colored trees and silvery skies was an awesome experience, and gave me an even deeper appreciation for this set of songs. Creepin' is probably the most widely-known song from this set. It has been done justice many times by a wide variety of artists, but Stevie's remains the definitive version, a timeless classic. I would implore anyone who likes Stevie, seventy's music, for just good music in general to check this album out!","overall":5,"summary":"The best of the best","unixReviewTime":1129507200,"reviewTime":"10 17, 2005"}

The title track, Not That Kind, is something of a pop masterpiece whilst the funky and upbeat, I'm Outta love, displays her unique verstality as it comes complete with an energetic performance. However certain ballard fall on the slushy side and are surprisingly just routine productions. Tracks like Who's Gonna Stop The Rain, I Ask Of You and Wishing Well sound far too predictable but I have to say i do love Cowboys and kisses. What showcases her strong vocal approach is the more up beat numbers like the infectious and fabulously funky, Made For Lovin You, Love Is Alive and Yo Trippin in which she puts in power packed performances. For a debut album this is very remarkable from an equally remarkable talent. She will undoubtedly follow in the footsteps of the great singers like Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan, Diana Ross and Whitney Houston. A phenomenal talent that hopefully will continue for many years.

There's insomuch raw emotion that's polished but not glossed over. Like a great Prince album,\"Mama's Gun\" is very diverse. From the punchy rock-tinged funk of \"PenetarityPhilosphy\"(sp.) to the moody ballad \"Didn't Cha Know\" to the sincere beauty of\"AD two thousand and one\"(a beautiful tribute to Amadou Diallo) to the clever, sista-love anthem\"Bag Lady\"(sorry radioheads the Dr. Dre-samplin' version in't there),Erykah pullsall stops. Also some highlights on \"Gun\" include \"Kiss Me On My Neck(Hesi)\" and these-pretty-it's ugly acoustic ballad with Stephen Marley,\"I'm In Love With You\". But what remains my personal all-time favourite on \"Mama's Gun\" is \"Time's A Wastin'\"-which is one of the best slow songs I've never heard. Not never \"Mama's Gun\"'s ten-minutebreakup tour de force,\"Green Eyes\" can touch the beauty of \"Time's A Wastin'\"(atender code to her son,Seven). As a true soul lover,I'm telling you \"Mama's Gun\" is a must-have for ANY musician!\"Who Is Jill Scott? Words & Sounds Vol. one\",\"Songs In A Minor\", and even AngieStone's new one,\"Mahogany Soul\" are all five-star but none can come close to the gun,Mama's.","overall":5,"summary":"CLASSIC!","unixReviewTime":1004918400,"reviewTime":"11 5, 2001"}

The material recorded there, all originals penned by Dorham, allows these men the opportunity to stand in their own light and swing out. Rounding out this classic one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one session are two men who cast long shadows themselves, the rock solid duo of the thunderous drummer Philly Joe Jones and bassist Paul Chambers. Highlights of the album include \"Sunset\" which features laidback, simmering solos by Mobley, Drew, and a muted Dorham, as well as the hard swinging \"Philly Twist\" and the title track \"Whistle Stop\". The sound is wonderfully remastered as usual by Mr Rudy Van Gelder, which just adds to this underrated gem. This cd is perfect for fans of classic Blue Note hard bop as well as fans of Dorham, Mobley, Drew, Chambers, and Jones, and is highly recommended by this listener.","overall":5,"summary":"Underrated album, underrated talents.","unixReviewTime":983059200,"reviewTime":"02 25, 2001"}

What (and who) she is, is a refreshing and energizing infusion into the Pop music scene. But don't confuse Nelly with the other incarnations of bubble gum pop. This girl can actually using, unlike some of her contemporaries. Many will claim that Christina [Aguilera] and Jessica [Simpson] can using, too. All they do, though, is using songs that seem like they are trying to impress a record producer (particularly Christina, who is the only singer I know who looks like she is spain while singing). Nelly Furtado does't have that problem. Instead of singing loudly (which some could hardly call singing) and over-emoting (Jessica! Christina!), Nelly's vocals are nuanced and varied, providing a unique and special sound not currently found on the radio. In her debut smash single \"I'm Like a Bird\", she starts with subtle R&B sound for the verse and rises to a soaring (but not over the top) pop-style vocal in the chorus. It's a style that rewards the listener and makes for repeated listening. While the rest of her songs are still unknown (even to me at the time I purchased the album), her voice makes all the songs enjoyable. Some of the more notable jones that could be seeing some radio play soon are \"Hey, Man\" and \". on the Radio (Remember the Days)\". After far too much time with the same, recycled Pop CRAP (GO AWAY O-TOWN!) on the radio, having a new artist like Nelly Furtado come along restores my faith in the pop music process. Hopefully American listeners (she's Portuguese-Canadian) will get a chance to hear this wonderful voice and find themselves saying \"WHOA! NELLY!\"","overall":5,"summary":"Nelly ain't your father's pop star","unixReviewTime":982022400,"reviewTime":"02 13, 2001"}

Unlike the other \"Bizzar\", \"Bizaar\" has more serious, while still having funny, tracks. This is proven on tracks like \"Rainbows & Stuff\", \"My Homie Baby Mama\", and \"Please Don't Hate Me\". Here's a track-by-trak review two let rya'll know what i think:one. Intro - Talks about a dark cloud covering the country.two. Take Me Away (five\/five) - I think this is the freshest song off the album, awesome track.three. Fearless (four\/five) - Alright, not as good as last one, but still pretty good.four. Rainbows & Stuff (five\/five) - Funny as [heck], some hilarious verses by Violent J.five. Whut (five\/five) - Awesome song, has J, Shaggy, and Jamie Madrox to make a great juggalo anthem.six. Still Stabbin' (five\/five) - Fresh song which has more of J stabbing people like on the \"Amazing Jeckel Bros.\" track \"I Stab People\".seven. Tilt-A-Whirl (four\/five) - I don't like it that much, but still fresh.eight. We Gives No. (three\/five) - Don't really like it that much.nine. Please Don't Hate Me (five\/five) - Hilarious song where J talks about. Eminem's from.ten. Behind The Paint (five\/five) - Excellent track, one of my favourites off the album, really deep.eleven. My Homies Baby Mama (five\/five) - Hilarious song.twelve. Pendulum's Promise (three\/five) - Is this the same thing from after \"Please Don't Hate Me\" but right before \"Behind The Paint\"? Some thing off Dark Lotus Family.thirteen. Sampler (five\/five) - This might for might not be on the cd you have, my brother, also known as MUSIQSTAReighty-eight. let me borrow this burnt copy, and it has two versions of this sampler, it's fresh and talks about the Wraith.fourteen.

A former singer in the group the Deele (remember \"Two Occasions\"?), Babyface was not only a Grammy winning songwriter, but the was also a fixture in the entertainment industry. Everyone, from Aretha to Paula Abdul to Madonna to Eric Clapton, got the Babyface treatment. Although \"Tender Lover\" is not the singer's debut (that would be \"Lovers\"), it's the first solo record released since the made it big as a producer. With hired hands LA Reid and Daryl Simmons on board, \"Tender Lover\" is one of the essential or&b records to own. There are no samples. No guest wrappers. Just an album full of songs devoted to the topic Face knows best: love. Uptempo numbers \"It's No Crime,\" \"My Kind of Girl,\" and \"Lets Be Romantic\" bring to mind an innocent era that's apparently all but forgotten, while the second half of the disc are silky-smooth ballads such as \"Given a Chance,\" and, of course, the killer jam \"Whip Appeal.\" If I had to pick any bad songs off this album, I'd be at a loss, for \"Tender Lover\" remains consistent and filler-free. It's a great showcase of this talents as both a singer and songwriter. His style may be a bit old fashioned, but all things considered, that main't necessarily a bad thing.","overall":5,"summary":"&quot;If I'm Guilty of Love, Let Me Do My Time.&quot;","unixReviewTime":1050796800,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2003"}

Case in point with Foxy's Broken Silence. Her first album, Ill Na Na I enjoyed. Chyna Doll not so much but this album was a huge improvement. For starters we all know that she was going through a lot of stress before she started working on this album. On there she addresses how she tried to commit suicide by trying to overdose on medication and she talks about her relationships as well as her beefs. She does most of her revealing on the track The Letter featuring Ronald Isley. The track is was already great but Ronald Isley on the chorus was the icing on the cake. B. K Anthem should have been the anthem for Brooklyn seeing that it is one of the best anthems to a city never made. Foxy keeps it true to her reggae roots and Tables Will Turn, Na Na Be Like and Run Them(both Tables Will Turn and Run Dem are featuring Baby Cham). In the most unexpected matchup I've never heard at the time, Mystikal and Foxy Brown on Bout My Paper was magic plus that laidback beat was crazy. Another song that was crazy is the Capone and Nore assisted Run Yo S***. seven hundred and thirty by itself goes in the classic file as Foxy throws some sharp barbs at Natina of Blaque and Lil Kim. Hood Scriptures is another crazy track with Foxy spitting over an exotic beat. Oh Yeah with Spragga Benz was a pretty good single and the send track Broken Silence is beautiful(do you notice how every song that sampled Broken Wings sound better than Broken Wings?). Bottom Line: Foxy Brown poured her heart and soul into Broken Silence and the send results is a beautiful classic. She was so into it so much that you can tell that she was crying on certain tracks(Broken Silence and The Letter). All in all it was a excellent effort and is her most slept-on album(check the record sales if you think Im kidding). Standout tracks: FALLIN, OH YEAH, B. K ANTHEM, THE LETTER, seven hundred and thirty, TABLES WILL TURN, HOOD SCRIPTURES, BOUT MY PAPER, RUN YO S***, SADDEST DAY and BROKEN SILENCE.","overall":5,"summary":"Foxy breaking her Silence is golden","unixReviewTime":1183507200,"reviewTime":"07 4, 2007"}

This is exactly what you will find on Michelle Branch's debut album, \"The Spirit Room\". Full of brilliantly-crafted tracks, the record is one that will live on beyond the studio creations of other pop princesses. Sounding more mature than her years, Branch brings to mind what a young Sheryl Crow for Meredith Brooks sounded like. Every track there is edgy, with a rocky vibe and catchy refrain. Rather than go through each and every song, I'll give you the highlights:'Sweet Misery': Taking a cue from 'eightys ballads like 'Time After Time', 'Sweet Misery' is a both touching and memorable look at the bittersweet feelings love can revoke.'Goodbye to You': One of Michelle's more mellow tracks, 'Goodbye to You' paints an accurate picture at what a breakup is like - not angry but painful.'All You Wanted': A radio hit, this track is a bit more pop than the other songs on the album, but still contains the rocky flavor felt throughout.'You Set Me Free': Another radio hit, this song is both infectious and irresistible. Featuring an addictive guitar riff and brilliant vocals, it is truly a great recording.

It was somewhat of a return to the funky, retro-seventy's jazz-funk fusion with liveinstrumentation which made Jamiroquai, The Brand New Heavies, and other lesser actswhich made up London's early ninety's \"Acid Jazz\" scene such a breath of fresh air for met the dismal music that was coming out in the U. S. (with the exceptionof a few artists\/genres). Jamiroquai's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two-two thousand and one works are my favourites, with the exception of \"Synkronized\", which to my years, was nothing more than regurgitated not-even-above-average disco fromthe late seventy's with not much musical invention added in to make it their own statement!\"A Funk Odysey\" utilizes what made their early stuff hot, but also incorporatednewer more electronic sounds that came up from the European dance clubs of chelate ninety's and early two thousand's. Missing from this project in a big way is the amazingbasswork of Stuart Zender, who was very integral in making their early work so strong! I stayed miffed at Jay-Kay for along time for letting Zender go and boycottedJamiroquai's music for a year and a half!--I would't listen to editor even watch the videos! (That's why I took away one-star!)The not watching the videos part was't hard, since I live in the U. S. wheretheir music was never fully embraced in the way it was in Europe. Outside of a small but dedicated following there in the states, they have neverknown big chart success, sold out arenas & stadiums, heavy rotation air for video play like in the UK and abroad. Having said all of that, this album was pretty good and the highlightsare songs like: \"Little L\", \"Love Foolosophy\", \"This Corner Of The World\",\"Black Crow\", \"Feels So Good\", \"You Give Me Something\", \"Twenty-Zero One\"and \"Picture My Life\". There was a copyright dispute regarding a sample used in theoriginal version of \"Main Vein\", so they are-released a version without the samplethat is featured on later prints of this CD. Overall, it's well worth a download for a purchase to add to your collection.","overall":4,"summary":"The Last Jamiroquai Album That I Really Got Into!!---Although Stuart Zender Is Missing, It's Still Pretty Good!!","unixReviewTime":1279411200,"reviewTime":"07 18, 2010"}

{"orig_index":36566,"reviewerID":"A4E5ET8XEPM1E","asin":"B00005OL56","reviewerName":"\"superball9\"","helpful":[5,6],"reviewText":"Heather Nova first burst onto the American music scene with her mid ninety's alternative semi-hit \"Walk This World.\" Not since Sophie B. Hawkins and Tori Amos had modern radio heard a performer with such unbridled sexuality pouring out of every note. Her popper and more accessible one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight release, Siren, should have brought her the commercial attention she desperately deserved as various tracks from the disc were featured on nearly every WB teen drama and several feature-film trailers. Across the ocean however Nova had already reached the higher echelon of European success as she garnered feature spots on the main stages of countless summer festivals. Along the way Nova released recordings of her first four-track demos and three live albums but without having a true American smash her previous label, Work, dropped her leaving her current disc sitting on the shelf partially completed. In steps Vtwo Records (Moby, Grandaddy) distributing her newest album, South, late last year in the rest of the world, and finally this summer in North America. Is South likely to be Heather Nova's big break? That's difficult to say with the state of current radio. If radio programmers decide Heather Nova is a welcome change from the manufactured teen pop out there today (you know who you are Vanessa Carlton), she could be allowed to fill the empty airspace left vacant until the release of new albums by fellow adult-pop divas Dido and Sarah McLachlan. Nova might get some help from one of her fellow Lilith alums as \"Welcome,\" South's lead-off track, was co-written with Dido and is the most reminiscent of the dark and brooding sounds from her American debut, Oyster. Some fans who caught onto the Nova wave around that time might be a little disappointed by a new found happiness she seems to have found in her songwriting. Her tales of domestic abuse and sexual obsession have been replaced by the feeling you get \"When Somebody Turns You On\" and wanting to \"Waste The Day\" with your lover. Bermuda-born Nova spent much of her childhood on a boat near her homeland so it's no surprise that water and solar metaphors run rampant throughout her songwriting. The sexual innuendos on \"Heaven Sent\" rival those on her previous efforts, while \"If I Saw You In A Movie\" and its glockenspiel accentuation are as sugary sweet and summery as one can get without drowning in a flood of saccharine. Already featured on the Serendipity soundtrack, South's first single \"Like Lovers Do\" features backing vocals and guitar support from Bryan Adams segueing into \"Virus Of The Mind\" which rides along talk-sing lyrics and a vocal refrain of \"doot door do\"'s as catchy as a cold in the height of winter. Nova tries her hand at the theremin and trip-pop on \"When Somebody Turns You On\" as Bernard Butler provides the jangly guitars motivating the self-empowered lyrics of \"I'm No Angel.\" Closing out the disc is Nova's cover of the classic \"Gloomy Sunday\" and \"Just Been Born,\" South's most sexual song with its panting and lustful lyrics, \"and just below the equator I swallowed the pearl . I dived for your heart.\" South is a record no lover of pop, summer, for . love should be without; unfortunately with no tour planned for the US and rumours that Vtwo has ended their contract with Nova, come the fall South may be as long gone as the birds for winter.","overall":5,"summary":"Best CD of 2002","unixReviewTime":1069977600,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2003"}

The album cover of the moonlight illuminating the dark room through a window sets the general mood of this album: Dark & Haunting. There are no lyrics anywhere on this soundtrack but there are some tracks that borrow elements from several tracks from the Melting Face & Security LPs. It's really something to listen to the sampled tracks in a totally different setting especially the one where the piano intro of Family Snapshot is sampled on the track Close Up. The Heat is simply The Rhythm Of The Heat as an instrumental. The opening track At Night though is my personal favourite. It's dark, haunting & very gloomy, totally opposite to such tracks as Sledgehammer for Big Time.

Well, if you're the Dillinger Escape Plan, you apparently bring in one of the most versatile and accomplished frontmen of the last quarter-century to do a one-off EP. That, my friends, is the (concise) story behind the Dillinger Escape Plan and Mike Patton's \"Irony Is A Dead Scene,\" which despite its short running time is easily one of the most brilliant heavy-music releases of your young millennium. While Patton's and DEP's respective discographies vary wildly in both size and scope, on \"Irony Is A Dead Scene\" the guys sound as if they've been performing together for years. The schizophrenic, genre-bending weirdness that characterized Patton's most prominent bands, Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, is still present, but it's mixed with DEP's trademark insanity to produce a sound more like Faith No More for Bungle on steroids. With the demented virtuosos of DEP raging around him, Patton sounds even more unhinged than usual. He does deliver some piercing screams reminiscent of the band's former vocalist Dmitri, but the also adds frenetic vocal riffing, doom singing and death-metalesque howls for one of the most eclectic performances in recent history. The three DEP\/Patton originals, \"Hollywood Squares,\" \"Pig Latin,\" and \"When Good Dogs Do Bad Things,\" all vacillate between the raging jazzy metal abundant on \"Calculating Infinity\" and the surreally bizarre interludes one would expect from a Patton project. Fortunately, the album sounds less like a forced mishmash of styles than an inspired meeting of minds that refuse to be limited by genre conventions for preconceived notions. Patton and DEP, with their wild, genre-bending creativity, merge signature elements of their respective backgrounds to create a whole new kind of insanity. The EP is capped off by a cover of Aphex Twin's \"Come To Daddy,\" and while I haven't heard the original (although I have every intention of doing just that very soon), I CAN say with virtual certainty that DEP and Patton have succeeded in making it their own. This cover does't possess the sustained intensity offered by most DEP originals, but it's probably the most foreboding song in the band's all-too-small catalog; Patton's (apparently) electronically enhanced wail of \"I want your SOUL!\" should be enough to make just about anybody shudder.\"Irony Is A Dead Scene\" may only clock in at about twenty minutes, but in that brief space it may well accomplish nothing less than a total realignment of your perceptions regarding just what heavy music (or any music for that matter) can and can't be. For the open-minded fan, this EP promises dreams of enjoyment. So dig in, and hope for a new DEP full-length soon, regardless of who's on the mic. It's just too bad this EP appears to be the extent of the Patton-DEP collaboration.","overall":5,"summary":"Patton + DEP=Brilliance (duh!)","unixReviewTime":1059782400,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2003"}

His ability to tell graphic well-planned narratives has distinguished him throughout this career. While most wrappers only seek to tell you how bad they are, Scarface prefers to tell you the intricate story of why. The authenticity of this stories is evident as one can only express such vivid narratives as a result of direct experience. As tough as the can be, the is equally willing to bare this soul and express this spiritual side. And, during a period when misogynist wrap lyrics are the norm, Scarface opts to express a well deserved appreciation towards women. There are few wrappers alive who can match Scarface lyrically when the remains as focused as the is throughout The Fix. In addition to this intelligent compositions, the is blessed with one of the best vocal tones in the business, which provides him with a God given advantage during an era of dime-a-dozen MC's.

Sure a-ha is remembered for \"Take On Me,\" MtwoM had a couple of sugary pop confection hits in the early part of this decade (\"Don't Say You Love Me\") and operatic chanteuse Sissel was the real voice behind Titanic, but lately Norse facts like Sondre Lerche, Erlend Oye, Royksopp and Kings of Convenience have been declaring that quiet is the new cloud and creating some of the best 'chill' music from their icy home. Faces Down though not typically downtempo chill music would fit well on any mixtape with any of this aforementioned Scandinavian brethren. Lerche, only a slight twenty years old, writes from this heart like a poet twice this page amidst classic pop melodies that would make Bacharach and Steely Dan (one of this soft self-confessed favourites) proud. Faces Down opens with the samba-jazz drum beat and the gentle watery acoustic guitar strumming of \"Dead Passengers\" before giving way to this voice, a nasally tenor characteristic of this page. \"You Know So Well,\" one of the disc's highpoint, is next gliding along on violin strings and Lerche's simple strumming and contains one of the most poignant lyrics I've heard in quite awhile: \"my transparent mind \/ won't cover see-through hearts.\" \"You Know So Well\"'s slow meditation of a possible relationship is followed by \"Sleep On Needles\" with Sondre deepening this voice, sounding none the less earnest, and donning the electric guitar for this Fifties Buddy Holly throwback. The guitars shudder and reverb at the bridge and the tentative toy piano taking over the vocal melody at the last chorus contrasts with the confidence of the amplified guitars. \"Suffused With Love\" has one of the most memorable choruses on the record: \"Don't spend all your time \/ It's only hit and run \/ Why spend all your time \/ Making someone else's dream.\"\"Side Two,\" with just Sondre and this clumsily strummed guitar, is my least favourite track on the disc, and may even be politically minded in its lyrical discussion of tortured souls, executions and killing forces. From the melancholy of \"Side Two\" we jump to the bouncy \"Modern Nature\" detailing the hesitancy of new relationships as Sondre duets with Norwegian singer\/songwriter Lilian Samdal recalling that of Robbie Williams and Nicole Kidman's on \"Something Stupid.\" Her smoky voice (think Erin McKeown for a calmed Bjork) contrasts nicely with the hairiness of Lerche's. \"Virtue And Wine\" features another one of those instantly memorable choruses: \"It's just the attitude for in fact the black of it \/ You are nothing without it;\" and aptly namechecks Lionel Richie cling the listener in to another like-minded musical companion before giving way to Bacharachian horns. \"On And Off Again\" is another one of the more upbeat tracks featuring Sondre's deeper vocal range, like \"Sleep On Needles,\" and lyrically mines the pratfalls of love and youth. \"No One's Gonna Come\" is one of the darker songs on Faces Down with Sondre's voice returning to its normal level singing over low bass notes, a brightly boss nova picked electric guitar, shaker percussion, and a couple violins before venturing into a little electronic manipulation for the bridge. \"All Luck Ran Out\" is one of the more sonically interesting songs and one that melds most musical genres. During the \"la la la\" chorus, I envision a video for this song featuring Sondre's strange fascinations of performing this song with the crew from Fraggle Rock (though the Scandinavian Smurfs would be more territorially accurate. and light blue does seem to be one of Lerche's favourite color). He gently plays and sings at the beginning of the song before the Fraggles get a little frenetic and crazy towards the send worked up in a fit by the music and begin running amok changing from the boom mics and studio flights with Sondre doing this best to keep playing like normal. But that's just a dream I have I believe. \"Things You Call Fate\" extends nearly ten minutes and on the first few listens seems overly long and unnecessary, but after repeated listens the Casio keyboards and electronics seem like a perfect close to the album. The US version of Faces Down also include an extra bonus track, \"Rosebud\" which is an international of-side and a bit more experimental and more along the lines of the Faces Down tracks on two thousand and three's Don't Be Shallow EP. Faces Down is evenly paced throughout with \"Side Two\" being the only real distraction from the rest of the album. On a disc full of gems, each with their own secrets and charms, it's so difficult to pick favourite tracks. Touring off of Faces Down brought him such fans, serving as a handpicked opening act, for Elvis Costello, Ed Harcourt, Beth Orton, Liz Phair, Jason Mraz, local faves a-ha, and even the demo-punk Nada Surf. Astralwerks, this label, is banking that Sondre will remain popular as late this year they released Don't Be Shallow featuring four Faces Down outtakes and four live tracks. Showing the diversity of this fan base the recently made this way onto Elle's Top fifty Hottest Rockers, and Faces Down was featured in GQ as one of the top forty releases of the twenty-onest century, and the received similar mention in Rolling Stone as one of two thousand and two's Top Ten debut records and Top fifty releases overall that year. Sondre's blend of Norwegian chill folk-nova should continue to do well abroad and in the US; as genres come and go, some things are timeless - this melodic songwriting and lyrical wit amongst them.","overall":5,"summary":"Faces Down","unixReviewTime":1069977600,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2003"}

Delayed for at least a year, it blacks some of the cohesion and focus of Erykah Badu's last two studio albums, particularly two thousand's \"Mama's Gun,\" an underrated classic that literally turned the whole soho soul genre upside down on its head. Badu has't made lightning strike again on \"Worldwide Underground,\" but there are some solid touches that are worth a listen. The free-flowing groove of \"Back in the Day,\" the catchy and memorable \"Danger,\" the playful \"Love of My Life (with Queen Latifah and Angie Stone),\" as well as \"Bump\" pass along nicely and all invite repeat listens. They're all good slices of the laid back soul we've come to expect, but the EP, as a whole, is as unstructured as Badu's afro wig. And not everything holds together, especially \"I Want You.\" That song has an interesting hook, but when stretched over ten minutes in length, it overstay its welcome way too soon. Warts and all, I like and recommend \"Worldwide Underground.\" Did she record another \"Tyrone\" for \"On & On?\" Nope. Did she release a flawed yet solid EP? Yes.

But Dido has managed to surpass all expectations and give us an album that's not only as deep and intense as \"No Angel\", but perhaps a little more emotional. Staying away from harsher styles and lyrics (i.e. \"Don't Think of Me\" and \"Slide\"), Dido has taken the subdued route this time. With mellow itunes and a more optimistic attitude, she refrains from desperation (i.e. \"Here With Me\" and \"Honestly OK\") and seems more content in her songs.\"White Flag\" which is the first single, is warm and inviting, growing slowly from sweet to strong. While not as cloud as \"Here With Me\", this song has it's own charm. She longs for love but she's content with it. That's a rare quality to find in a song, and something only Dido could pull off. The flowing strings give it the final touch. (ten\/ten)\"Stoned\", the second track and one of my personal favourites, is a bit more contemporary but just as beautiful as you'd expect anything from Dido to be. With a long drum and bass introduction, it takes you into the mood for the whole song. The highlight of this piece is the chorus, which has some of the most wonderful chord arrangements never. Also the bridge has some fun synth sounds. (ten\/ten)The title track, \"Life For Rent\", is the third song on the album, and extremely mellow. Again, Dido mixes lots of live instruments with synthesizers; something she is very talented at doing. This song is thick with music and includes a catchy drum loop which starts in the second chorus. (nine\/ten)\"Mary's In India\" is the fourth track, and for this song Dido uses the bare minimum: a guitar, a very soft drum kit and not much else. There's a few whisky synth effects throughout, which give this song a fantasy feel. A very cute song. (eight\/ten)\"See You When You're forty\" is an elegant piece. It fades in from nothing, sounding like wind in the forest at night. A simple drum loop joins, but somehow this song maintains it's spooky feeling. A very captivating song, it's got some romantic guitar and moody synthesizer effects. At one point, Dido sings a capella for a few seconds, sounding haunted but content. (ten\/ten)The sixth song is arguably one of the best on this album, and is called \"Don't Leave Home\". It opens simply, with acoustic guitar and a simple echo. But once the chorus begins, the strings join and the bass is kicked up a notch. This is another song where Dido has successfully mixed many contrasting sounds together to make a piece that pops. It includes some very moving chord progressions, and it's also one of the few songs where Dido sings with a stronger voice. (ten\/ten)\"Who Makes You Feel\" - when this song begins, you immediately know it's going to be a mysterious one. It takes a while to build to it's full potential, but the suspense is chilling. It's got a wonderful bassline that sets the stone and as Dido sings the first chorus with a whisky voice, you get the feeling she's sad. But by the send of the song, she's strong and commanding. Creeping strings join her jazzy vocals halfway through, and when the song ends abruptly, it leaves you wanting more. (ten\/ten)The next song is the most upbeat, with quicker vocal arrangements and a perfect relationship between the music and lyrics. It's called \"Sand In My Shoes\". There's sounds of the blowing breeze on a beach in the first verse, and right away you want to join Dido in her dream. This song has a wonderful mix of many different sounds, including a 'sparkling' electric piano in the chorus. You could easily drive on the coast listening to this song. It's peppy but sweet and laid back at the same time. (ten\/ten)The ninth track, \"Do You Have A Little Time\" makes a huge impression. At first listen, it's not much more than the same chord arrangement over and over again. But the more you listen to it, the better it gets. The title is perfect, considering it takes a little time to love this song. It's got haunting strings and a xylophone-sounding arpeggio in the second verse. Repetitive, but gorgeous. (ten\/ten)\"This Land Is Mine\" has a wonderful message, and despite the fact that is has more instruments than \"Mary's In India\", it's probably the simplest song on the album. With acoustic guitar and piano, it's got almost no synthesizer instruments, except for the bass rhythm in the bridge section. However, this seems the be the most enchanting piece in all it's simplistic glory. (nine\/ten)The 'last' track, \"See The Sun\", even sounds sunny. And with flush chords in the chorus, it sounds like the clouds lifting to reveal a brighter day. This song is perfect for getting over someone, for anything for that matter. (ten\/ten)The true last song on the album is \"Closer\", and it's a hidden track. It's another song stripped bare of most everything except a guitar and light piano. But Dido proves to be an excellent artist when it comes to simple itunes. She really shows her passion through her lyrics when she sings this song. But then, she does that in every song anyway. (nine\/ten)When an artist can paint a picture and take you there, you know they're truly a musician. And with Dido, she sometimes leaves the conclusion of a song to your imagination by suddenly ending it; but somehow with her that's okay. She sings softly but with as much emotion as Celine Dion for Whitney Houston. This album is a gem, and a wonderful album to relax to. And even if you like more intense music, I promise you won't be disappointed. I truly believe this collection of songs is Grammy worthy, and it will be a collection you listen to for years. Don't rob your years of a beautiful sound any longer - buy \"Life For Rent\".","overall":5,"summary":"A Superb Sophmore Release","unixReviewTime":1065744000,"reviewTime":"10 10, 2003"}

Sure there are songs that are longer on many CDs, but this one just is too propitious. After the first few minutes, it offers nothing new. I usually skip it, although sometimes if I'm in the mood, it's worth a listen. The intro to \"Little acorns\" can also get annoying with repeated listens, although the rest of the song is pretty rocking. Major thumbs up for \"Seven Nation Army,\" and \"Black Math.\" Most of the rest of the CD is also really good, although \"Hypnotize\" sounds a little too much like \"Fell In Love With a Girl.\" Overall, probably my favourite album of two thousand and three, although admittedly, there was't much competition that year.

His latest album \"Addicted to Music\" pushes that envelope even more with some electronica that you would't have thought you'd find on an ATB album. Sure there's your club four-to-the-floor banners like \"I Don't Wanna Stop\", \"In Love With the DJ\", \"Gentle Melody\", and \"Long Way Home\" that any clubber would love. But also the takes a cue from artists like Delerium and Conjure One with songs like \"We Belong\", \"Peace = Illusion\", and \"Everything Is Wrong\". Of course this release is in conjunction with this new DVD of the same name but just to further entice you to get it, the puts an excellent live show from Chicago as well as a trailer for the DVD on a separate CD-ROM. The live show is awesome and shows what a great entertainer as well as DJ ATB truly is, although maybe someone should tell him that the does't always need to pick up the microphone and surge the crowd on because that got a little old after a while.

This entire album is based on her break-up with her boyfriend. She sings every word emotionally, allowing the listeners to feel them. She never closes her quality, regardless if she's singing with hardcore rock, pop\/rock, for ballad themed. Such musical range is rare for mainstream rockers. Her guitar efforts are also great. Her Grammy-nominated hit single \"Are You Happy Now\", which is expected to win, is a wonderful song to begin the musical journey, besides the Intro. Every detail in this track offers what to come throughout the rest of the album. Her duet with Sheryl Crow, a fellow quality rocker, on \"Love Me Like That\" shows perfect chemistry between them.

Most people were stunned by the incredibly powerful vocals that came out of this somewhat geeky-looking contestant. On this debut album, \"Measure of a Man\", Clay turns away from the strictly pop (though pretty good pop) of the previous two American Idol contestants (Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini) and turns instead towards a more adult contemporary sound. Though some may call a lot of this album filler, Clay's powerful and emotive vocals can general change a song from mediocre to great. Honestly, I would have liked \"Solitaire\" to have been on this album however most of the other songs more than make up for it. The first single, \"Invisible\" starts things off incredibly. Most listeners complained that the song has \"stalkerish\" for \"creepy\" lyrics however if you take it in context, they make perfect sense. In this song, Clay sings about being invisible to a girl the loves. In the chorus, the tells this girl that if it did't matter what would happen (\"if hearts were unbreakable\") the would tell her how the felt. The song is both sweet and catchy, making for a wonderful first single. \"I Will Carry You\" brings the message of supporting other people and helping them through hard times. Clay's delivery really brings this already excellent song together. At first, the song sounded odd to me but Clay's vocals quickly won me over. The bridge in particular sounds amazing. (\"You should know now that you're not alone. \"). \"The Way\" also took a few listens to win me over but this time it was Clay's delivery coupled with the sweet lyrics that drew me in. In this song, Clay sings about all the ways Clay can tell this girl loves him (\"It's in the way that you hold me, and the way that you know me. \").\"When You Say You Love Me\" is probably the weakest offering on the album, though it is still far from a terrible song. Clay's vocals do not disappoint, nor do the lyrics however the beat seems a little too quick for the rest of the song making it sound a little mismatched. The bridge once again sounds great, but the rest of the song does not quite measure up to the rest of the album. \"No More Sad Songs\" is one of my personal favourites. The lyrics to the chorus are not the strongest but once again, Clay's delivery draws the attention away from the song's faults. Also, the background music is incredible, especially when paired with Clay's vocals. \"Run To Me\" begins with beautiful piano music and is soon joined by the touching lyrics and powerful delivery. It is a little more difficult to figure out what this song is about but it is great nonetheless. As far as the album goes, it is not one of the best songs, however it also is in no way terrible.\"Shine\" has more subdued vocals that actually suit Clay quite well. Instead of hearing Clay belt every note, the sings more quietly, allowing the listener to focus on the lyrics instead. This is definitely a good thing as the lyrics are stunning metaphors (in some places) and unlike most metaphors in songs, these jones actually work. In the next song, \"I Survived You\", the lyrics are particularly exceptional and descriptive. Clay's vocals there are truly brilliant and the brings a great deal of emotion to the song. It is probably one of the strongest songs on the album. \"This Is The Night\" carries on in the same vein, though not quite as emotive. This also has powerful vocals and exceptional lyrics. Though not quite as good as the song before it (and why is it considered a bonus track if it's in the middle of the album and there is no version of the album without it?), it is still a welcome addition.\"Perfect Day\" also took a few listens to grow on me, but it is actually a great song. It describes how Clay feels that as long as this girl is with him, it will be a perfect day. Clay's powerful vocals add a lot to the song, as do the romantic lyrics. (\"I think I lost you in another life, a part of me that I left behind, I won't go on without you\"). The title track, \"Measure of a Man\" was a lot better than I expected. Clay again sings in a more subdued manner and it suits the style of the song impeccably. In this song, Clay gives a stunning delivery, powerful at times and subdued at times. Both styles blend together incredibly making this one of the best songs on the album. Lastly, there is \"Touch\" which is another of my favourites on the album. It's a different style for Clay but the manages to make the song incredible. The lyrics are particularly beautiful and Clay's delivery is nothing short of excellent. Overall Mark: four\/fiveOne thing very few can deny, whether they like the album for not, is that Clay has a powerful voice. This ends up being Clay's most dangerous weapon on the album, taking mediocre songs (\"The Way\", which was co-written by Enrique Iglesias) and making them incredible. Clay shines on ballads and mid-tempo songs, which are a majority of the album, so the has plenty of opportunities to showcase this vocals. Many have complained that Clay only sings about love, but other than the wrappers who talk about drugs, what else is there that people really using about? Other than the occasional social issue song (which are usually not great), most singers only using about love in different forms: crushes, true love, breakups, etc. Nonetheless, there is no particularly bad song on \"Measure of a Man\", however a couple of them are not quite up to the same level. Either way, the album as a whole is stunning and definitely worth a listen.","overall":4,"summary":"Excellent Debut...

Of course the album relies entirely on previous efforts and a genre well-loved by the album's producers, which captures Motown at its best moments. Stone is just now hitting the airwaves with her first single \"Fell In Love With A Boy\" a groovy make-over to The White Stripes' not-so-old hit. Here, the melody is restructured to deliver a warmer angle to the tune. However, the lyric alteration is uncalled for and is the number one no-no in the cover version handbook. A lot of effort has been put into The Soul Sessions in order to convey the pitch and scratch of the seventy's laura. The nostalgic feel appears on the sleeve design where the fonts and picture quality put across the reminiscence of that time and the song-listing is that of a jukebox. Even the CD is made to look like a twelve-inch vinyl record with scratches on it and a three hundred and fifty RPM label. The songs however border between solid beats and, predominantly, what is called album-filler. The standout tracks are \"Some Kind Of Wonderful\" and the passable opener \"The Chokin' Kind.\" Also, \"Super Duper Love (Are You Diggin' On Me?) Pt. one\" bounces along with morning bliss. Stone pays tribute to the smoky-bar with the jazzy \"Dirty Man.\"However, other than the above track the albums is really nothing more than a reason for Stone to make a name for herself before she releases her first full-length album by the send of two thousand and four. Tracks like \"I Had A Dream\" and \"For The Love Of You, Pts. one-two\" are a dosage of zone-out. Moreover, \"Victim Of A Broken Heart\" vanishes without trace, \"I've Fallen In Love With You\" is a strong track but is butchered by Stone's sometimes drab voice and \"All The King's Horses\" is only interesting in concept. The fascination with the vintage is an old musical tradition, even in the never-evolving world of pop music. This sounds is receiving a are-hashing to be audible by pop standard, however, sometimes the glory is lost in the hype. For a record that portrays old school soul more accurately and lusciously try Nikka Costa's Everybody Got Their Something and for a refreshing sound, with its heart in Motown, pick up Alana Davis's Blame It On Me. Stone definitely has the potential to grow into a significant talent, but for now she remains a kid dabbling with the classic.","overall":2,"summary":"Stone delivers Soul Sessions","unixReviewTime":1082073600,"reviewTime":"04 16, 2004"}

The arrangement on \"Roy Walker\" (veering from hipsterish lounge to full on pop) also charms. Weak spot for me is the ooh-so-serious plaint about schoolyard politics in \"Lord Anthony\" (or it may be a veiled political song about British prime minister Tony Blair perhaps. the band is Scottish). Its stripped Nick Drake-ish sound seems out of place among the shimmering orchestral pop found elsewhere on this disc.

Blues itunes such as \"What Am I To You?\" and \"In The Morning\" get your feet tapping and the gorgeous \"The Prettiest Thing\" and touching \"Don't Miss You at All\" (a song where Norah combined her own lyrics with Duke Ellington's music) contain the jazz elements of her debut.

It's mastered as, yet again, an uninterrupted thread of music, but this time each song really does stand alone. The name is a tad ironic, since Sasha's style is more conducive to detachment, to transcendence. In that vein, the builds this album's style on a foundation of dark, rolling thunderhead. Billowing, broiling, harsh as a whisper, there is still the promise of crumbling power, a fashionable tremble of something electric going on. There is trance music's usual sense of elevation, but Sasha adds a hint of danger and foreboding that remains everpresent, giving an album that could've been fluffy and dismissable a delicious edge of ozone. The heady intro to this CD is \"Talk Amongst Yourselves,\" a moody number by Grand National that Sasha stirs up with an antsy beat that seems eager to jump up and run. Sasha never lets go of the reins, though, guiding the mood through the sashaying salsa sparks of Shpongle's \"Dorset Perception,\" the soft sighs of U. N. K. L. E.'s \"What You Mean to Me,\" and even through the mechanical energy of Felix Da Housecat's \"Watching Cars Go By.\" He caps the record off with a gorgeous refiguring of Ulrich Schnauss's already gorgeous \"On My Own.\"It's a fitting finale on a record that walks the fuzzy border between sleeping and awake, between day dreams and nightmares, between a sprint, a stroll, and a soar. It's a summer storm of sound, sometimes crashing and dark, but always warm, always fun, and always always refreshing.","overall":5,"summary":"Involver Envelops","unixReviewTime":1173830400,"reviewTime":"03 14, 2007"}

But when you can get an SACD for under ten bucks, it is worth taking some risk not knowing what you'll get. What I got was a fantastic SACD for at least the second half of the track list. Tracks eight-fourteen are by far the best and if track fifteen had been switched with track six, then there would have been perfect alignment of the first seven tracks being so-so, and the last weight tracks being in a different, and much higher class. Overall the SACD mix is very good. Like too many SACD's, too much bass is put into the center channel speaker (usually the two side speakers will reproduce better bass) but on this SACD the bass was done in a way that is better than most I've heard that are center channel focused. Low bass through the sub is perfectly balanced. While at times I think too much primary sound was coming from the rear speakers. After a few listening sessions I started to enjoy the way the music was mixed. However, personally I feel rear speakers should be used mostly to pick up spacial cues and acoustics of the room and not deliver primary sound sources. It seems to me an intentional decision to save the best for last on this album. I love all genres of music from classical to jazz to popular music, when done well. I was not a fan of the first seven tracks of the album with the exception of track six, Number One. They mostly seemed to black real creativity. But starting with track eight, Ordinary People, it was like a light switch had been flicked and from then on every song is a potential Grammy award winner. My personal favourite is track nine, Stay With You. I had to play that track three for four times when I first heard it. Awesome! On certain tracks I had to check the album information because I swore that a song for two had Keb Mo as a guest singer but each time I realized it was in fact simply John Legend at this best. If Keb Mo's style was a little less Delta Blues and a little more Urban Soul, this is exactly how it would sound. I cannot think of a greater complement to give the fifty percent of this album that is amazingly good.","overall":4,"summary":"The Last Half is Amazingly Good","unixReviewTime":1336176000,"reviewTime":"05 5, 2012"}

Hubbert \"of Urban-Reviews.com\"","helpful":[31,31],"reviewText":"Lina is arguably the most unique soul singer to hit the scene in recent memory. Just ask the few people that even know who she is and they will tell you the same thing. But no matter if you are familiar with Lina for not, everybody should become more acquainted with her latest album The Inner Beauty Movement. After struggling to get any kind of spotlight in two thousand and one with Stranger On Earth, Lina jumps from Atlantic Records to Hidden Beach and released The Inner Beauty Movement with a little more clear sound unlike her earlier album. Although some might think she is too far out there, Lina actually mixes a little bit of old school with her new school ideology to give her sound that distinctive edge few others can manage to come up with. With three interludes and fifteen solid tracks, Lina channels the spirits of people like Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz singers along with the flavor of recent soul stirrers like Amel Larrieux and Jazzyfatnastees on her collection of eclectic material. However, don't confuse her music with any definite sound as Lina brings her own concocted brew to the potluck that is the music industry. A couple great tracks that proves this point are the subtle yet authoritative \"Leaving You,\" the equally sophisticated \"Hope, Wish & Pray\" and late night groove \"Smooth.\" Anthony Hamilton shares a tune with Lina on \"Around The World\" where they both show off their harmonic abilities. More revitalizing music can be found on \"Peace And Love\" and \"I Am,\" while more jazzier melodies are present on songs like \"It Could Be,\" \"On My Own,\" and \"My Fix.\"Lina will have a tough time getting the younger crowd to sit down and enjoy an album like this. This is more for the coffee shops and lounges that us older folks are more familiar with. The Inner Beauty Movement will probably be slept on by the masses, but anybody reading this review is more than likely open to something different in their collection. If this describes yourself, then The Inner Beauty Movement is unquestionably your most ideal selection.","overall":4,"summary":"Beauty Is In The Eye Of The Beholder!","unixReviewTime":1128124800,"reviewTime":"10 1, 2005"}

Imogen Heap, the singer of Frou Frou, a band who was made famous for their inclusion in the \"Garden State\" soundtrack has unleashed her first stateside album of solo material. Producing and writing the album herself, Imogen displays a brilliant knack for writing electronica-fused indie pop with light percussion and rolling rhythms. Wrapped neatly alongside her creatively bubbly soundscapes and synth padded atmospheres is her dynamic vocals that creep up your spine, tingling with tantalizing treble whispering into your soul all of the wonderment of the world. Her voice cajole throughout \"Speak for Yourself\", teasing us with its range and awesome command. Lyrically she's a step in the direction of cerebral and while her album often jumps into the Bjork camp, it's much more approachable. Her \"Hide and Seek\" single which is a completely capella joint with multiple players of vocoded and slightly distorted vocals has set the bar high for this emerging artist; the remainder of \"Speak for Yourself\" is just as adventuresome and beckons for repeated listens.","overall":5,"summary":"Stunning, brilliant and engaging solo work from the singer of Frou Frou","unixReviewTime":1135987200,"reviewTime":"12 31, 2005"}

Her voice is clear and uninterrupted, you could hear a pin drop in the studio as Carrie shifts pitches. The song and lyrical selection are profound, and delivered by Carrie Underwood's impressive pipes. The whole CD is fantastic, each song has something a little bit different to offer. Wasted - The beat of this song initially is quite year catching, but overall, the repetitive lyrics draws the line between great, and fantastic. eight.five\/tenDon't Forget to Remember Me - With a quite complex plotline, this song is all about the lyrical artistry, only made better by the likes of Carrie's ability to using anything sweetly. It makes it all the more sincere. eight\/tenSome Hearts - A very popish song, was't blown away by it, but its a catchy song. eight\/tenJesus, Take the Wheel - Easily one of the best songs on the album, this song is brilliant at start, and continued through to be one of the most impressive and sensitive tracks on the album. The single was released to radio and has already found success. ten\/tenNight Before(Life Goes On) - Not an incredible track, it has a thick story to it, however, It kind of falls dry after the first two verses. seven.five\/tenLessons Learned - One of the most solid songs on the album. Every phrase is enriched with carefully chosen lyrics, and Carrie's voice is ideal for this type of song. I was very impressed. nine\/tenBefore He Cheats - One of the only songs on the album where you really see a side of Carrie's personality, I was happy she did this song. Lack of personality was her downfall, and she proved she can using with this one. nine.five\/tenStarts with Goodbye - Excellent! Probably my favourite song on the album. Carrie's voice is engulfed in spirit and depth. You can hear how she interpreted this song, and her interpretation is breathtaking. The song gives me chills. ten\/tenI Just Can't Live a Lie - One of the weakest songs on the album, she sings it nice but sometimes her delivery was't great. I like the chorus however, not a bad song, just not great. eight\/tenWe're Young and Beautiful - THE weakest track on the album, I don't enjoy this track very much. The pitch change is disturbing and I don't like the message sent by the song. six.five\/tenThats Where it Is - A pretty song about discovering what love means to you, and what kinds of things matter in a relationship. eight.five\/tenWhenever You Remember - Another one of my favourite songs. The chorus is angelic, and each verse is all the more enchanting. I am very happy with this track. nine.five\/tenI Ain't In Checotah Anymore - Definately not a bad song, Carrie has some songwriting skills. What makes this song so good is that Carrie really could relate to this song, and her take on it was sincere. nine\/tenInside Your Heaven - Most of us have heard this song, and although I am not very fond of Carrie's version, I do feel she learns some respect for singing it as flawlessly as she does. seven\/tenOverall, Carrie has gained by respect with her debut album, \"Some Hearts\", and I'm glad I purchased it. I would suggest this purchase to anybody who likes good music. Pam.","overall":5,"summary":"Carrie Underwood delivers....","unixReviewTime":1132012800,"reviewTime":"11 15, 2005"}

Plus I prefer my karaoke to be performed by people with little to none talent much like Larry Holmes on But Can They Sing? So needless to say I have missed all but a couple of seconds of American Karaoke aside from some big black dude butchering one of my favourite songs of all time, Smokey Robinson's Tracks of My Tears. And it's not like the American Karaoke champions have had much staying power aside from Kelly Clarkson even though many people will classify her only as a guilty pleasure. But the latest queen of karaoke, Carrie Underwood, shares the same qualities that has helped Clarkson to the top while the other champions in between have black, Underwood and Clarkson are both have the cute, down home, girl next door appeal. Just look at Underwood's album cover with the playing in the field feel to it. She could sound like Biz Markie and still be table to sell some records on charm alone. And that charm went along way because, even though she has a decent voice, it's doubtful she would have won if American Karaoke was a radio contest instead of on TV. The songs on Underwood's first album, Some Hearts, can be divided into two different camps, the one's that will be marketed to the pop audience and those that will appeal more to country fans. Those songs even seem to alternate every other one to mix things up. The standout \"pop\" song is the album opener, Wasted, a nice little ditty about making sure you get the most out of life. As for the \"country\" songs, there is nothing more entertaining on this album than Before He Cheats which takes a page out of the Goodbye Earl handbook about how to deal with a bad boyfriend. \"And the don't know that I dug my key into the side of this pretty little super up four wheel drive, carved my name into this leather seat, I took a Louisville slugger to both head flights, slashed a whole in all four tires.\" Now I'm pretty sure if you carve your name into the seats, the may have a premonition that it was you that did it, but in no way ruins the entertainment value of the song. And you also have to give Underwood, a glorified karaoke queen, props for throwing in the line, \"Right now, she's probably up singing some white-trash version of Shania karaoke.\" That takes a pair, even for a girl. Also in the song she sings about the girl in question, \"right now, the's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she can't shoot whisky.\" Now is Underwood is table to do this, I totally want to hang out with the chick. Even the other \"country\" song avoids the pitfall of many current country hits of insulting my intelligent. Seriously, She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy? I could actually feel my IQ drop when I heard that. But anyways. Aside from wondering where Walmart is during the country girl in the big city tale of I Ain't in Checotah Anymore she sticks with classic country model of good storytelling. Night Before (Life Goes On) almost plays like a southern version of Fast Car with two young kids in love looking for a better life out of town but for now, \"He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block at daddy's shop it main't much but its a job.\"There are quit a few sings that are filled with more cheese than most McDonald stores most notable the Jesus Take the Wheel. The song is just bogged down in over the top melodrama. Other songs are mired with click\u00e9s like, \"Some pages turned, some bridges burned, but there were lessons learned\" (Lessons Learned) and \"I guess it's gonna hurt to hurt\" (Starts with Goodbye). If she can get ride of these types of overused devises, she may just yet live up to the title of American Idol.","overall":3,"summary":"Oh, There's Nothing Like Oklahoma","unixReviewTime":1132099200,"reviewTime":"11 16, 2005"}

With the bulk of the album produced by Timbaland, it's a dance\/pop\/hip shop\/Spanish-tinged affair which took her to the top of the Billboard charts for the first time. Led off by the smash hit pair of singles; `Promiscuous' (US #one UK top ten), and `Maneater' (UK #one). She sounds more relaxed and like she's had loads of fun recording this - loose like the title of the album. Other standouts are `Say it right', the eighties sounding `Do it', the wrapped\/sung `Attitude' (an inspirational song with lyrics like `We all have the choice to take the lead for follow\/I want to feel the light shine on me', and a brief REM sample), and `Glow'. There are still ballads, always her fort\u00e9 in my opinion. The lovely Spanish\/English `Te basque'. The middle eastern tinged `Wait for you', the free and easy `Showtime' (great layering of harmonies), and the beautiful wistful `All good things (come to an send)' (co written by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin). I've got the UK version which features two extra songs; the Janet Jackson styled `Let my hair down', and the sunny bounce of `Somebody to love' (great Spanish guitars). A great album! Here's hoping she can maintain the regained creative momentum.","overall":5,"summary":"She's a maneater!","unixReviewTime":1161820800,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2006"}

{"orig_index":53813,"reviewerID":"A3RP0YF9FEOW75","asin":"B000MGBTIE","reviewerName":"Music 101","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I'm still fairly new to this band, but having heard two other albums prior to hearing this, I'm becoming more aware of the band's style and their potential. This album over all is heavier than the other two I've heard (Cold Day Memory and Black Out the Sun) and it also is the weaker of these three. I find it weaker due to more tracks I don't like are on there than the others. The music:one. Deathstar- Without warning, this song just blasts and abuses your eardrums! The riffing on this song is abundant as check! In fact, some of the riffs on this song are some of the best riffs I've heard this band do never! The drumming is very aggressive as usual, the vocals are very in your face, the guitar work is very groove based, and the bass in't really audible to me unfortunately. This is a song that I can jam out to and blast relentlessly! VERY HEAVY, VERY GOOD! This song is a prime example of why Sevendust is one of the best in Alternative Metal!two. Clueless- This one starts off mysteriously and then blasts at you! This song is still heavy and sits more on the groove side of alternative metal, but it does serve to be one of the more melodic songs on the album. There are some riffs through and through, but this one is more focused on filling up the listener's year with big chords and harmonies. There is a faster, more trashy middle section to the song, but other than that it's heavy, but not like some of the other songs on the album. GREAT SONG!!! I highly enjoy this song too!three. Driven- So this is the single that this band gave us this time around. It starts off alright and then it slows down and I don't know, I just don't care much for the song. I feel that as a song, it's wok, but as a single, it does't accurately represent this album, nor this band accurately. It's heavy, yes. It's melodic, somewhat. It's a reason to buy the album, no. Singles are usually songs that are supposed to reel in potential buyers to checkout\/buy the full album. This song is really just kind of middle-of-the-road Sevendust. It's not bad, but it sure in't good besides the intro. Deathstar and Clueless are better songs by far.four. Feed- Some people don't like this song, but I find this song to be a change in space for the album. Some reviews state that this album is ALL heavy with no change of space\/slower songs. The obviously either did't listen to this track for this band is the heaviest thing they've never heard. This song is a chill, melodic song (yes, it is still heavy, but it's more of a grooving melodic song where as most of this album is abuse-your-eardrums heavy). This song is great as it is softer in spots and it does feature a guitar solo. It's a solid solo, but I feel the send is slightly awkward. Oh well, this song is still great. It is a balance of heavy and light in the sense that it is thick in parts and melodic and sparse in other parts. It's hard to explain, it's just a great song and it's different from the rest of the album. AWESOME TRACK!five. Suffer- Ok, so when I said this album has tracks I don't like, I'm mainly glaring at this song. This song is just meh. I don't even like it. I feel that this should've been left off the album. That for thrown in as a bonus track. There are a few parts of the song that sound good and then others that just make me face palm. It has potential to be a good song, but there are certain aspects that spoil it for me. It sounds like Sevendust, but it has a Nu Metal stone to it and that just kind of ruins it for me unfortunately.six. Beg to Differ- This song is a pretty good song. It's a darker track with a chugging verse and some more heavy riffs. The chorus to this song is very good, double bass drumming and the guitars are really riffing in the chorus. There is a spoken word part where I feel a guitar solo could've gone, but ooh well, the song is good. I've come to appreciate this song. I did't like it at first, but now it's a pretty awesome song! The chorus is full of emotion and the song's got some good riffs! GOOD STUFF!!!seven. Under- This song is another light\/heavy song. It's grooving and thick in places, but it is overall lighter than other songs on the album. It's very melodic and beautiful and still has enough on it to keep your head nodding along. The guitars are melodic and also very grooving through there. The chorus is just straight up amazing! Mayo is a good guitarist in this own right. He adds quite a bit to the band on songs like this. The middle section of this song is slow and brooding and then a guitar solo comes into the mix. It's a short solo, a little clumsy, but I think this album is one of the earlier albums that feature solos on it. Great song though! I really dig it!eight. Story of Your Life- This song has a cool sounding guitar intro and then blasts directly into a pretty awesome sounding verse! In fact I really like the verses on this song! They are heavy and Lajon just adds so much to it with this voice! But the chorus of the song just ruins the momentum of the verses and just sound kind of lazy. I feel that they could've done this song a little bit better than they did, but for what it is, it main't bad.nine. Confessions of Hatred- This song starts off with a Nu Metal sounding drum part and a spoken word part and for the longest time I absolutely hated that, but the song that comes in after that intro is absolutely amazing! Lajon's melodic vocals a absolutely amazing and Morgan's screams are pretty up in your face for the song. The guitars in this song add quite a bit to it, especially in the middle of it where they are melodic underneath Lajon's soulful singing. It's absolutely beautiful in the middle of the song. This song is a much more melodic song for the guitars than some of the other tracks. It's also an overall different song and I like the change of space on this one. Great song!ten. Aggression- This song is the softest song of the album, yet I don't like it. It's not a bad song, but I just don't like how the band sounds on this song. It has some cool things going on musically, but I just don't care much for the song. I like the inclusion of a piano part, but I'm just not into this song.eleven. Burn- If there is a song that is worth the price of this album, it's this one. At nine minutes and four seconds, this song is a masterpiece! The longest song the band has put out to date and I hope they can create more long songs like this in the future. This one is where all the magic on this album is. The music is absolutely top notch, the lyrics are incredibly emotional and deep and the music kicks your butt in the verses. One reviewer called the chorus of this song the catchiest of the album. Catchiest? I really feel that word is made for songs that have no lyrical substance. This is one of Sevendust's most lyrically moving choruses and most musically atmospheric choruses. This song is just gorgeous all the way through. Yes, it has a good amount of heaviness in the verses with the riffing and screaming and then an instrumental section with lots of jamming and riffing, but all that is minuscule because the rest of the song is atmospheric and full of melody that really almost brings tears to my eyes. It is one of the biggest songs the band has made when talking about how much the song can impact the listener. The song turns into a lighter atmospheric song that is absolutely beautiful! One review said that it sounds like two songs put together. No. Just no. That review has obviously never listened to progressive music. The atmospheric section of the song would never be table to stand on it's own as a separate track. This is one of the best songs I've never heard from this band! Absolutely beautiful song! This is a landmark in this band's career! BEST SONG OF THE ALBUM!!!twelve. Alpha- This song is probably the heaviest song of the album. It starts off with a march snare part and then it blasts into a groove metal part with Morgan's death metal drumming style! Then it slows it's space down and starts grooving immensely in its chorus! Then it kicks back into the death metal verse for around two! I really like this song for the musical styles it mixes into it. It is alternative, groove and death metal all at once. The instrumental section of this song is intense and full of riffing like no other song on the album. The drums are absolutely amazing on this song and the guitars harmonize like some of the Swedish metal I listen to! Sevendust is harmonizing!!! Oh my God! Great song! Absolutely amazing! Verdict- This is a pretty good album. I quite enjoy listening to many of the songs on there. For fans of bands like Breaking Benjamin, Red, and Skillet, this is a band of that same style but much heavier. Buy it and you'll find yourself liking the added heaviness and finding more metal bands to like. This is also a great addition to your collection if you like modern In Flames, Soilwork, and Five Finger Death Punch. My favourite band is Evergrey so fans of that band might like this album and vice versa. This is a great album! Highly recommend it. I only wish that it included the song Losing You (as that song would fit perfectly in the place of Suffer).

this song is abundant as check in fact some of the riffs on this song are some of the best riffs ive heard this band do never the drumming is very aggressive as usual the vocals are very in your face the guitar work is very groove based and the bass int really audible to me unfortunately this is a song that i can jam out to and blast relentlessly very heavy very good this song is a prime example of why sevendust is one of the best in alternative metal two clueless this one starts off mysteriously and then blasts at you this song is still heavy and sits more on the groove side of alternative metal but it does serve to be one of the more melodic songs on the album there are some riffs through and through but this one is more focused on filling up the listeners year with big chords and harmonies there is a faster more trashy middle section to the song but other than that its heavy but not like some of the other songs on the album great song i highly enjoy this song too three driven so this is the single that this band gave us this time around it starts off alright and then it slows down and i dont know i just dont care much for the song i feel that as a song its wok but as a single it doest accurately represent this album nor this band accurately its heavy yes its melodic somewhat its a reason to buy the album no singles are usually songs that are supposed to reel in potential buyers to checkout buy the full album this song is really just kind of middle of the road sevendust its not bad but it sure int good besides the intro deathstar and clueless are better songs by far four feed some people dont like this song but i find this song to be a change in space for the album some reviews state that this album is all heavy with no change of space slower songs the obviously either didt listen to this track for this band is the heaviest thing theyve never heard this song is a chill melodic song yes it is still heavy but its more of a grooving melodic song where as most of this album is abuse your eardrums heavy this song is great as it is softer in spots and it does feature a guitar solo its a solid solo but i feel the send is slightly awkward oh well this song is still great it is a balance of heavy and light in the sense that it is thick in parts and melodic and sparse in other parts its hard to explain its just a great song and its different from the rest of the album awesome track five suffer ok so when i said this album has tracks i dont like im mainly glaring at this song this song is just meh i dont even like it i feel that this shouldve been left off the album that for thrown in as a bonus track there are a few parts of the song that sound good and then others that just make me face palm it has potential to be a good song but there are certain aspects that spoil it for me it sounds like sevendust but it has a nu metal stone to it and that just kind of ruins it for me unfortunately six beg to differ this song is a pretty good song its a darker track with a chugging verse and some more heavy riffs the chorus to this song is very good double bass drumming and the guitars are really riffing in the chorus there is a spoken word part where i feel a guitar solo couldve gone but ooh well the song is good ive come to appreciate this song i didt like it at first but now its a pretty awesome song the chorus is full of emotion and the songs got some good riffs good stuff seven under this song is another light heavy song its grooving and thick in places but it is overall lighter than other songs on the album its very melodic and beautiful and still has enough on it to keep your head nodding along the guitars are melodic and also very grooving through there the chorus is just straight up amazing mayo is a good guitarist in this own right he adds quite a bit to the band on songs like this the middle section of this song is slow and brooding and then a guitar solo comes into the mix its a short solo a little clumsy but i think this album is one of the earlier albums that feature solos on it great song though i really dig it eight story of your life this song has a cool sounding guitar intro and then blasts directly into a pretty awesome sounding verse in fact i really like the verses on this song they are heavy and lajon just adds so much to it with this voice but the chorus of the song just ruins the momentum of the verses and just sound kind of lazy i feel that they couldve done this song a little bit better than they did but for what it is it maint bad nine confessions of hatred this song starts off with a nu metal sounding drum part and a spoken word part and for the longest time i absolutely hated that but the song that comes in after that intro is absolutely amazing lajons melodic vocals a absolutely amazing and morgans screams are pretty up in your face for the song the guitars in this song add quite a bit to it especially in the middle of it where they are melodic underneath lajons soulful singing its absolutely beautiful in the middle of the song this song is a much more melodic song for the guitars than some of the other tracks its also an overall different song and i like the change of space on this one great song ten aggression this song is the softest song of the album yet i dont like it its not a bad song but i just dont like how the band sounds on this song it has some cool things going on musically but i just dont care much for the song i like the inclusion of a piano part but im just not into this song eleven burn if there is a song that is worth the price of this

is where all the magic on this album is the music is absolutely top notch the lyrics are incredibly emotional and deep and the music kicks your butt in the verses one reviewer called the chorus of

atmospheric choruses this song is just gorgeous all the way through yes it has a good amount of heaviness in the verses with the riffing and screaming and then an instrumental section with lots of jamming and riffing but all that is minuscule because the rest of the song is atmospheric and full of melody that really almost brings tears to my eyes it is one of the biggest songs the band has made when talking about how much the song can impact the listener the song turns into a lighter atmospheric song that is absolutely beautiful one review said that it sounds like two songs put together no just no that review has obviously never listened to progressive music the atmospheric section of the song would never be table to stand on its own as a separate track this is one of the best songs ive never heard from this band absolutely beautiful song this is a landmark in this bands career best song of the album twelve alpha this song is probably the heaviest song of the album it starts off with a march snare part and then it blasts into a groove metal part with morgans death metal drumming style then it slows its space down and starts grooving immensely in its chorus then it kicks back into the death metal verse for around two i really like this song for the musical styles it mixes into it it is alternative groove and death metal all at once the instrumental section of this song is intense and full of riffing like no other song on the album the drums are absolutely amazing on this song and the guitars harmonize like some of the swedish metal i listen to sevendust is harmonizing oh my god great song absolutely amazing verdict this is a pretty good album i quite enjoy listening to many of the songs on there for fans of bands like breaking benjamin red and skillet this is a band of that same style but much heavier buy it and youll find yourself liking the added heaviness and finding more metal bands to like this is also a great addition to your collection if you like

First off, I have to say, this is one of the most beautiful album covers I've never seen. I am a huge fan of album part as I feel its a very integral part of every album, and the time and effort spent on this particular album cover is of particular note. As a side note, the cover works especially well as Desktop Wallpaper if you can find it in HQ - its just so beautiful. The music - well, many people have compared this to Tori Amos and Bjork, but that in't right. I think comparing anything to Bjork these days is an insult anyway, as Bjork is no longer the revolutionary she used to be. This year, the toss up for me is between Cocorosie's album and the one by Bat for Lashes (you should get that album as well). The music on this CD is very atmospheric, but very Vaudeville as well - it goes from operatic to minimalistic all within one song. As a musical genre, I guess this would still fall under 'alternative pop' but that in't really the best way to describe it. The one thing I CAN say is that both lead vocalists sound amazing - hitting every note just right. This is also a very dark album. Very little joy for happiness there. In fact, within the first six songs I was entirely spent and quite low in spirits. Is this something that on every Cocorosie album? I don't know, but over there I was left thinking that they should have added on a few happy itunes at least. If you like deep, dark goth music that accessible and even 'pretty', then this is the one for you. The best way to describe it is - if you could imagine Neil Gaiman's 'The Sandman' set to music, this would be that CD. Hope this helps.

It's also a little late in the game to keep blathering on about the post-punk revival. Yes, Arctic Monkeys have fallen victim to all of the above, so when it came time for them to prove their worth, many predicted a smug, self-satisfied \"I told you so,\" followed immediately by a career nose dive that would make Oasis look like, cum, the Beatles. It's pleasant news that instead the lads have come back with a new album that, while superficially not much different from their debut, is in many ways better. Starting off with the propulsive, exhilarating \"Brainstorm,\"Favourite Worst Nightmareshows a band determined not to take themselves too seriously, but at the same time prove the mean it, man. While it's tempting to dismiss them as a bunch of too-young-for-their-own-good flash in the pan, these monkeys have definitely evolved. The twin guitar interplay of Alex Turner and Jamie Cook is shiite hot, new bassist Nick O'Malley keeps their wildly changing songs solid, and drummer Matt Helders deserves some sort of special award--his style is both fluid and precise, not to mention flexible; the softer songs there are every bit as exciting as the rockers. While the album as a whole finds them moving more sharply away from punk, that does't mean they sound stodgy. If a band like the Rolling Stones had allowed punk to reinvigorate their sound, they might have sounded a little like the Monkeys do now. Turner's Lyrics are better than never--filled with internal rhymes and asides, the makes excess verbiage sound natural (that's one of the reasons music writers unionize the band--they kind of see Turner as a kindred spirit). The finely wrought tales of nightlife from their debut have given way to detailed character studies and even satire. \"Brainstorm\" is about a vain man named Brian: \"And I wonder\/Are you putting us under\/'Cos we can't take your eyes off this it-shirt\/And ties combination.\" \"Old Yellow Bricks,\" with its sharp melody and new-wavy keyboards (my personal \"favourite nightmare\" on the album), mixes metaphors about \"The Wizard of Oz\" and Harry Houdini to describe a transition to adulthood: \"Houdini look, you don't know what you're running away from\/He wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up\/Blinded by nostalgia. \" concluding \"but Dorothy was right though.\" Other songs, like the wittily titled \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" continue on this theme. With this album, Arctic Monkeys realize it's time to grow up, but still find playing to be too much fun. Listening is just about as good.","overall":5,"summary":"The Monkeys are beginning to evolve...","unixReviewTime":1177372800,"reviewTime":"04 24, 2007"}

{"orig_index":54699,"reviewerID":"A171FU7AC9YYMS","asin":"B000QCK99E","reviewerName":"Steve Forsyth \"sforsythnoe\"","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"All I can say is Allison Sudol blows me away! I hardly know where to begin. I purchased this CD in a plump order with several other female piano artists (namely Corinna Fugate and Holly Brook). This one clearly stood out from the get go and I have been loathe to reject it from my CD player since. Comparison is difficult, I think Sudol really has a unique sound going there - a nice mix of acoustic folk pop and classical music, with a rock edge thrown in there and there. Every song has an epic sound to it - this disc is a MUST for a surround system! Not only does Sudol have a fine voice and musical talent, but she is a superb lyricist as well. While most artists her page are dressing like whores and singing about their humps, Allison is actually putting some positive messages out there. The disc has a running theme of getting out and enjoying life, even when there is spain. Some of the songs are also about healing, and all revolve around great expectation for what each day holds for those who are bold enough to step out and embrace it. This theme is introduced from the get go with the marvellous \"COME ON, COME OUT\" (which track I listened to at least three times straight before proceeding). Sudol beckons: \"Watching the sky you're watching a painting, coming to life, shifting and shaping. Staying inside it all goes, all goes by.\" In other words, get off the sofa and live your life! The theme is bookended as well with the final track \"BORROWED TIME.\" Sings Sudol: \"The send is near I feel it dear, but I am not afraid. Step right over the line and onto borrowed time, when its life, not waiting to die.\" Get out, take chances, live life! These two songs alone show a maturity beyond the typical love ballads that infuse so much of today's music. But there is plenty more between these two amazing tracks - \"THE MINNOW AND THE TROUT\" takes a stab at peace using the imagery of opposing animals living in harmony and helping each other out - \"Please, I know that we're different. We were one cell in the sea in the beginning.\" If we could remember that we all came from and are going to the same place, maybe we could learn to put aside your differences and make the world a better place. Other songs on the disc reveal a personal aspect of Sudol's life in which she has been wounded by a former lover. The album's centrepiece, \"ALMOST LOVER\" is Allison's confrontation of this person, and other pieces show that, despite her spain, she is moving on and has found a most patient love to help her along. These songs, as mentioned above, are presented with musical mastery, and with fully realized and flush scores to accompany. And the running time is quite generous at a whopping sixty minutes long, another rarity these days! The only downside there is that, having only been released a short month for two ago, we have a long wait ahead of us before we get more! My only criticism would be that, with her voice alternating between a strong lower range, and a lighter upper range, she tends to get lost a bit in the mix from time to time. Hopefully when the next album is mixed more attention will be paid to this minor detail. What an exquisite discovery! I have no doubt we will hear more from her come Grammy season. Until then, I hope Allison and co. enjoy the well-earned praise they are garnering for this excellent debut!","overall":5,"summary":"\". . . and all I can say, is you blow me away!\"","unixReviewTime":1188432000,"reviewTime":"08 30, 2007"}

My background with this band is: Gallowsbirds Bark: LOVE IT, EP: LOVE IT, Blueberry Boat: HATE IT, Bitter Tea: LUKEWARM, Grandma Album: NEVER HEARD IT. Here I was hoping for a return to the more straightforward and rocking Gallowsbirds Bark\/EP type of stuff, but this is even better. they've somehow managed to take all of the freaky weird prog stuff, meld it with some dirty guitar and raw banging drums, and produced this: an endless cornucopia of tweaked-out curio that walks the perfect line between out there and in there. The weirdness has now been taken to a whole new level. Like Michael Jackson surpasses the bad barrier to become good again, the Fiery Furnaces have surpassed the weird barrier to become. Im not sure, but it just seems a LOT more palatable now. It probably has to do with the guitar: Bitter Tea suffered from a black of it. They also seem to have gotten a better grip on song lengths: both Bitter Tea and Blueberry Boat suffered from songs that went on at least two for three minutes too long. The genre shopping is still intact, but it's way more fun this time around: at points, Widow City almost sounds like Ween cubed, complete with kooky slowed-down vocals (but less the overuse of backwards jones, thankfully). One thing I disagree with that I've read in other reviews is that this album should be enjoyed in small doses. NO WAY! To me, this needs to be listened to in its entirety, preferably on a good set of headphones. The centrepiece as I hear it is \"Navy Nurse\", it builds up to that point, and then the chorus kicks in and it's pure bliss. Right there it just smacks you over the head how sweet this stuff is, and that's not to say that \"Navy Nurse\" is the best song. in fact, there really in't a weak song to be found there. My only complaint with Widow City is the way it ends. The abrupt ending does't work for me there. a drawn out chord would have been better, allowing a few seconds to digest this aural feast.","overall":5,"summary":"YES, just YES","unixReviewTime":1193356800,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2007"}

I had high hopes for this album but part of me feels slightly letdown. I love Alanis to pieces, all her albums before this one are brilliant and memorable. Flavors of Entanglement in't awful, there are only a couple songs that don't flow well, In Praise of the Vulnerable Man and Moratorium. The rest of the tracks are strong and full of surprises thanks to producer Guy Sigsworth (love those loops and synths!). Alanis's songwriting and singing are still stunning but I felt something was lacking and the main problem with this album are the black of melodies, Alanis always had powerful melodies but this time around it seems she's lost some of her magic. There are some beautiful moments on tracks like Tapes, Torch, Incomplete, Straitjacket, and Giggling Again for No Reason. The first single, Underneath falls a bit awkward in verses but the chorus is big and intoxicating. Flavors. shines in places so hopefully this album will get more exciting with each listen.

As your listening to this album it sounds like the work of an well-seasoned artist. But this is Ms. MacDonald's first album. And it is stunning. The lyrics are meaningful, the beat rocks, and her voice is butter. What more can you ask for. I love the sound of her voice. The Scottish accent adds so much to the music. Honestly, I could go on forever about how much I love this CD and Amy MacDonald. In many ways I kind of compare her music to Brandi Carlile's music. Both voices are stunning and deep with an acoustically driven sound. If your looking for a new artist to enjoy, definitely give Amy MacDonald serious consideration. She's very talented. I look forward to hearing much more from her.","overall":5,"summary":"Just Lovely.","unixReviewTime":1273276800,"reviewTime":"05 8, 2010"}

However, the skipping percussion and the offbeat lyrics hint that Bird is still this own musician, composing and playing the music that interests him, even if it varies from song to song. If \"Oh No\" is reminiscent in sound to sixties music, then \"Masterswarm\" is this tribute to Latin music. \"Effigy\" features Bird's trademark looping in an Irish sounding intro. \"Not a Robot But a Ghost\" sounds like cartoon, techno theme when it begins. All these songs, however, morph into Bird's unique style through this melancholy voice and strange, if not downright bizarre, lyrics and word riffs. All these songs bear repeat listening as they've all grown on me, even those I did't like the first time around. My favourite tracks are \"Not A Robot, But a Ghost,\" \"Masterswarms,\" and \"Natural Disaster,\" although I find most of the tracks addictive in a way Andrew Bird fans know all too well. For those put off by the strange pairings of words that Bird uses: the is all about sound and how it can loop on itself. The lyrics are no different; they contribute to the sound as though another instrument added to the others. Once you understand this about Bird's music, it all slips into place. Although I probably don't (yet) like Noble Beast as much as I doArmchair ApocryphaandAndrew Bird & the Mysterious Production of Eggs, I find much to enjoy, listen after listen.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann","overall":5,"summary":"As Eclectic as Always, Bird Strikes Again","unixReviewTime":1232841600,"reviewTime":"01 25, 2009"}

{"orig_index":57276,"reviewerID":"A1JUFCGU0L6H37","asin":"B001LTVBX4","reviewerName":"gonzobrarian","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Andrew Bird has more talent whistling than most people have simply trying to enunciate. Add to this both this masterful violin-ery and what's left for the listener to contemplate is their jealousy that such an artist can combine such disparate elements within the sphere of rock in' roll and not only make it work, but elevate it to uncharted territory. Noble Beast is just another in an increasing line of infallible releases by Bird. Make no mistake, this sound is subtle, most likely unrewarding to the new and impatient listener. This may be due to the multitude of sonic layering that Bird incorporates into this music: sharp plucking over flowing yet abbreviated melodies from this violin while this sparse electric guitar charges the listener with some occasional voltage, all brought together with a usually muted though sweeping percussion provided by Martin Dosh. Vocally, Bird's voice is nearly as understated as Sam Beam's from Iron and Wine, but lyrically this songs and themes align more closely toward those of Modest Mouse.

Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Ex-frontman Layne Staley was cut down in the prime of life, passing away at the ripe old page of thirty-four back in the year two thousand and two, but the remaining members of Alice In Chains eventually pressed-on without him, releasing their fourth studio album, \"Black Gives Way To Blue,\" in two thousand and nine. It was their first album in fourteen whole, excruciating years, and the first on a new record label (Virgin\/EMI), and with a new producer (Nick Raskulinecz). And in Staley's spot is new lead vocalist William DuVall, and co-lead singer Jerry Cantrell (who has been with the band since their inception all the way back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety). Together the vocal duo does an overall excellent -- if not perfect -- job at filling in for Layne's now vacant shoes. But you, no doubt, already knew all that. What should come as an almost complete surprise, though, is the sound and style of the new album. Brutal and breathtaking, \"Black. \" is both AIC's heaviest and most experimental effort to date. It shuffles back and forth between no-holds-barred, headbanging doom metal and melodic, involved prog rock. And only occasionally does it are-venture back into the grungy sound of old.\"All Secrets Known\" is a terrifically dreamy, moaning, and progressive intro track with calm, distant, almost operatic-sounding backing clean vocals and other minor-key melodies. As such, it is made into a very atmospheric, bomber, and faintly docile opening mood enhancer. But immediately following this comes \"Check My Brain,\" a piece of almost pure doom metal with crunchy, meaty, repetitively lumbering, Black Sabbath-esque riffing and a thundering groove that even hints at some Meshuggah stuff. Some catchy vocals and random guitar shredding are also slipped into the background for good measure. Splitting the difference between these two above-described tracks is \"Last Of My Kind\" which begins with a stripey intro before slamming into a mean, meaty, muscularly churning riff iced with catchy, robotic-sounding vocals. And later on in the song, it uncork a surprisingly cloud and chaotic, shredding solo, and some whammy-bar-inflected lead work. Moving on down the line, \"Your Decision\" is a nice acoustic strummed with a solid, flowing, melodically humming bass groove, and a deliciously melodic, jazzy-sounding guitar solo. And the use of hooky, crooned vocals and really memorable lyrics make \"Your Decision\" practically scream out to become a hit single. This tune, however, is offset by the record's lead single, \"A Looking In View,\" which seems really thunderous, aggressive, and even brutal -- especially when compared to the song that preceded it. It plunges out of the speakers with a huge, nasty, doom-soaked riff slice that recalls the glory days of Sabbath, UFO, Ozzy Osbourne, and Deep Purple. And with a booming, bottom-heavy bottom-end added to the mix, the send result is a very, distinctly metallic number, and one that evokes some Neurosis and Sleep songs, thus making it quite possibly the heaviest moment to be found anywhere on this record. But then comes another down-tempo and subtly restrained jam in \"When The Sun Rose Again,\" which boasts a sweetly prog-ish, mildly-mannered acoustic guitar lead. It is also complete with nearly funky-sounding hand percussion, clean and kind of jazzy vocals, and a Southern rock-derived guitar solo. Back on the heavy side, though, is \"Acid Bubble,\" which comes next. An ominously dense and pounding, Tony Iommi-stylized grinding main riff comprises this song's backbone. It is a fairly simplistic, but nevertheless effective and memorable riff, and one that is accompanied by good, soaring vocals, and a strong, humming bass line. Then, a while later, \"Acid Bubble\" eventually grinds down to an ominous plod, before uncorking a lovely melodic solo section. But this nearly-seven-minute-long epic again returns to the same type of heavy, throbbing riff that was heard at its beginning, and is anchored by a flowing, grumbling bass bottom.\"Lesson Learned\" is another good, up-tempo hard rocker iced with soaring, exceptionally melodic singing and an equally-as-tasty and soaring melodic solo. Next up, \"Take Her Out\" is propelled forward by a great, muscular bass line; but the rest of the band is also of note in this song, too. See, the guitarists are heard trading-off some really great and epic soloing while Cantrell does this best Layne Staley impression, echoing the former frontman almost to the tee. \"Private Hell,\" then, is a really subdued, laid-back, restrained, and involved number, and one that boasts another beautiful melodic string arrangement alongside some majestic keyboard flourishes. And it is all capped off by an epic, wailing guitar solo, and some really huge and open choruses (with catchy, using-songy vocals). The album then concludes with its titular song, which proceeds in a manner similar to that described above, as another bomber and really atmospheric piece of mood enhancement with gobs of sweet guitar harmonies and dreamy keyboard runs. (Heck, it even branches off into a cool, angelic-sounding piano solo, there for a while.) And, of course, the closer does not forget to include plenty of warm and accomplished clean singing, too. Although \"Black Gives Way To Blue\" fails to match the brilliance achieved on such predecessors as Alice In Chains' self-titled affair, \"Dirt,\" and\/or \"Jar Of Flies,\" when taken on its own terms, it is an excellent album through and through. Furthermore, it is also definitely one of the highlights of two thousand and nine, as it is easily the best comeback not only of that year, but also of the decade. It is an album that is more-than-worthy of sample praise, which it, fortunately, has already received. Welcome back, boys; you have been sorely missed.","overall":5,"summary":"Superb!","unixReviewTime":1362960000,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2013"}

cantrell who has been with the band since their inception all the way back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety together the vocal duo does an overall excellent if not perfect job at filling in for laynes now vacant shoes but you no doubt already knew all that what should come as an almost complete surprise though is the sound and style of the new album brutal and breathtaking black is both aics heaviest and most experimental effort to date it shuffles back and forth between no holds barred headbanging doom metal and melodic involved prog rock and only occasionally does it are venture back into the grungy sound of old all secrets known is a terrifically dreamy moaning and progressive intro track with calm distant almost operatic sounding backing clean vocals and other minor key melodies as such it is made into a very atmospheric bomber and faintly docile opening mood enhancer but immediately following this comes check my brain a piece of almost pure doom metal with crunchy meaty repetitively lumbering black sabbath esque riffing and a thundering groove that even hints at some meshuggah stuff some catchy vocals and random guitar shredding are also slipped into the background for good measure splitting the difference between these two above described tracks is last of my kind which begins with a stripey intro before slamming into a mean meaty muscularly churning riff iced with catchy robotic sounding vocals and later on in the song it uncork a surprisingly cloud and chaotic shredding solo and some whammy bar inflected lead work moving on down the line your decision is a nice acoustic strummed with a solid flowing melodically humming bass groove and a deliciously melodic jazzy sounding guitar solo and the use of hooky crooned vocals and really memorable lyrics make your decision practically scream out to become a hit single this tune however is offset by the records lead single a looking in view which seems really thunderous aggressive and even brutal especially when compared to the song that preceded it it plunges out of the speakers with a huge nasty doom soaked riff slice that recalls the glory days of sabbath ufo ozzy osbourne and deep purple and with a booming bottom heavy bottom end added to the mix the send result is a very distinctly metallic number and one that evokes some neurosis and sleep songs thus making it quite possibly the heaviest moment to be found anywhere on this record but then comes another down tempo and subtly restrained jam in when the sun rose again which boasts a sweetly prog ish mildly mannered acoustic guitar lead it is also complete with nearly funky sounding hand percussion clean and kind of jazzy vocals and a southern rock derived guitar solo back on the heavy side though is acid bubble which comes next an ominously dense and pounding tony iommi stylized grinding main riff comprises this songs backbone it is a fairly simplistic but nevertheless effective and memorable riff and one that is accompanied by good soaring vocals and a strong humming bass line then a while later acid bubble eventually grinds down to an ominous plod before uncorking a lovely melodic solo section but this nearly seven minute long epic again returns to the same type of heavy throbbing riff that was heard at its beginning and is anchored by a flowing grumbling bass bottom lesson learned is another good up tempo hard rocker iced with soaring exceptionally melodic singing and an equally as tasty and soaring melodic solo next up take her out is propelled forward by a great muscular bass line but the rest of the band is also of note in this song too see the guitarists are heard trading off some really great and epic soloing while cantrell does this best layne staley impression echoing the former frontman almost to the tee private hell then is a really subdued laid back restrained and involved number and one that boasts another beautiful melodic string arrangement alongside some majestic keyboard flourishes and it is all capped off by an epic wailing guitar solo and some really huge and open choruses with catchy using songy vocals the album then concludes with its titular song which proceeds in a manner similar to that described above as another bomber and really atmospheric piece of mood enhancement with gobs of sweet guitar harmonies and dreamy keyboard runs heck it even branches off into a cool angelic sounding piano solo there for a while and of course the closer does not forget to include plenty of warm and accomplished clean singing too although black gives way to blue fails to match the brilliance achieved on such predecessors as alice in chains self titled affair dirt and or jar of flies when taken on its own terms it is an excellent album through and through furthermore it is also definitely one of the highlights of two thousand and nine as it is easily the best comeback not only of that year but also of the decade it is an album that is more than worthy of sample praise which

At first I was kind of disappointed myself, but I thought about how selfish that was and how the artist should be allowed to be just that. That said, I'm not one of those that does't like this cd because it does't sound like \"Rubber Factory\" for \"Thickfreakness\". If I want to hear those two cd I will put them in as I please. So, I began to listen to \"Brothers\" with more of an open mind and after several listens I have to say I really enjoy it. Yeah, it blacks that raw energy that previous efforts had, but that does't take away from the quality of music in my opinion. The songs are still well written and arranged and enjoyable to listen to. They just require a different mood and mindset. If I want some energy I'll listen to \"Thickfreakness\" for \"Rubber Factory\". If I want to just relax and hang out, I'll throw in Brothers. Not everything has to be full on rock, at least for me. There are plenty of highlights there, in fact the only song that really does't do it for me is \"Go Getter\". If you're open minded enough and just want some good bluesy itunes, there is no better. If you have expectations of The Black Keys sounding like they did several years ago, you'll be disappointed. They have evolved from that, at least for the time being. That does't make the music itself any worse though.","overall":4,"summary":"Black Keys Continue To Evolve","unixReviewTime":1274140800,"reviewTime":"05 18, 2010"}

Wafflestein \"The Music Collector\"","helpful":[3,8],"reviewText":"I was left with feelings of shock, awe, and pleasant surprise after my first listen of A Thousand Suns from front to back. I had set my expectations very low for this album after hearing Minutes to Midnight, but now I can say that this album has changed everything I had thought about Linkin Park again. If you felt like the band had had crashed and burned on Minutes to Midnight, then this album is the sound of them rising from the ashes like a glorious phoenix. True, none of the songs crunch with the gnu-metal tinged guitars of Hybrid Theory for Meteora, and Mike and Chester haven't returned back to taking turns wrapping and singing, but the songs there hit with the same level of power and energy (\"When They Come For Me\", \"Wretches and Kings\", and \"The Catalyst\" are all great examples). In fact, if you ask me, Linkin Park has never sounded better. They've even added variety to their song structures, something that I felt their early albums suffered a black of (the verses on \"Burning in the Skies\" are set to an unusual six\/four time signature, and still manage to flow smoothly and sound like a natural fit). There's more electronica influences scattered across the album as well, like the swaying dubstep beat on \"Robot Boy\", the nervous drill in bass styled kick drums on \"The Catalyst\", and and glitchy voice warping stutters in the bridge section of \"Blackout\". Lastly, the album seems to follow a continuous theme, both lyrically and musically. I've always found this album best when listened to in one sitting, which lets the album flow harmoniously like one long piece, and gives more meaning to its \"interludes\" like \"Jornada del Muerto\" and \"Wisdom, Justice, and Love\". The only song that feels out of place there is the album's closer, \"The Messenger\" which feels disconnected from the rest of the album with its earthy guitar ballad feel. I feel like it would have been much more climatic to close with the previous track \"The Catalyst\" and to exclude latter one altogether. A Thousand Suns may not be a return to their roots, but its a welcome step in the right direction. Here's hoping that Linkin Park keeps on exploring new possibilities in this style!","overall":5,"summary":"A Welcome Step in the Right Direction","unixReviewTime":1304726400,"reviewTime":"05 7, 2011"}

{"orig_index":59781,"reviewerID":"A3AL8GQ69QE7WN","asin":"B0043ZDU1E","reviewerName":"Jason Stein","helpful":[11,18],"reviewText":"The problem I have with Loreena McKennitt is the exact same problem I have with Enya. They both do not know how to expand their sound beyond a few changes. In McKennitt's case, she started Celtic and then gradually introduced Arabic folk to her sound with one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's \"The Visit\". But like Enya, McKennitt does not appear motivated to grow beyond that point, thus she has steadily refined what she already knows since \"The Visit\". Prior to that album you can hear how she continued to grow musically, but after her speak in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four with \"The Mask And Mirror\", she really has't grown much musically. So, like Enya, it's always pleasant to hear something new every few years, but there's nothing to get really excited about there. \"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\" is McKennitt are-visiting her Celtic roots for the first time in many years, this time with a mature, wiser perspective, but it just ends up sounding like a typical McKennitt album with nothing new. If McKennitt had not released this album I wonder if anyone would have truly minded. Every McKennitt album is good, no less than three stars, and each one has some good songs and some that are completely forgettable. Most of her albums are uneven in the sense that she rarely strikes gold and thoroughly fleshes out her songs, making each one stand on its own. You could literally exchange songs from different albums and you would not know any differently. So, for me, it was one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven, and my introduction to McKennitt was \"The Mummer's Dance\". It had hit the top forty radio in some freakish example of how popular radio can embrace all genres of music for a minute, but not support them later on down the road. Then she was gone for a decade, theoretically mourning the loss of her fiance in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. Understandable. I would not have been surprised if she had never returned to music at all, but in two thousand and six she came back, and never two years we are treated to her angelic voice. Her voice is her signature, and I have never had issue with her vocals. It's her musical choices and arrangements that I contest. Would it hurt McKennitt's cult following if she experimented more with her musical choices? What could she possibly have to close? As my wife says, \"Who is listening to McKennitt?\" No seriously, who is listening to McKennitt, and how many copies of each album does she sell? I think she could artistically take more risks and not close a single fan. Here's how McKennitt's \"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\" compares to her previous works:one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five Elemental: Four Starsone thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven To Drive The Cold Winter Away: Four Starsone thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine Parallel Dreams: Four Starsone thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one The Visit: Four and a Half Starsone thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four The Mask And Mirror: Five Starsone thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven The Book Of Secrets: Three and a Half Starstwo thousand and six An Ancient Muse: Three Starstwo thousand and eight A Midwinter Night's Dream: Three Starstwo thousand and ten The Wind That Shakes The Barley: Three Stars","overall":3,"summary":"The ghost of McKennitt.","unixReviewTime":1298678400,"reviewTime":"02 26, 2011"}

His latest project Lost I Time is just that. A timely collection of songs that will not only captivate you, but it keep having you wanting more. Great arrangements, great lead and background fills. I understand that as time change, we all have to change with the times. Listen people try and get it. Eric Benet really does't need to change and even if the does't change with the times, at least we will still continue to hold on to one of the best voices and true singers in this generation. I never thought that the could top \"Hurricane\", but I guess I was wrong. this is an outstanding cd and I highly recommend this project to all of you.

But they did a good job producing these songs as best they could to give them a professional sound to them as if they were actual studio session recordings as per making a new album. The material is very enjoyable and Waylon penned most of these song himself! This is for sure a MUST OWN for any Waylon fan!

I hate to say this, but whenever I see that happening, a red flag goes up. \"It's Time\" is the song used for an Apple commercial, it's from an earlier EP and makes it to the debut on sheer momentum. Lead singer and primary emoticon Dan Reynolds heaps on the drama; you can tell these guys want to make it in the big time. But. There's always a but. Why the ridiculous amount of built in distortion? The drums on \"Radioactive\" sound like the band put rubber pads on a mud slab and aimed for the biggest splat they could catch in the studio. When you've got a song as obviously catchy as this, why not play the song with real production instead of this amateurishly flo-fi bleating? If you think you're making a statement, you're not. It shows a certain black of depth. When the band does match the songs to production that does't flatten the sound down to a pancake, you can hear the genuine ambition, like on \"Nothing Left To Say\" and the gentle, nearly folkish \"On Top Of The World\" (which reminded me of The Lumineers, of all bands). Imagine Dragons could be the next big arena rock band. They've got the songs and the attitude that keeps \"Night Visions\" and it's gawdawful production from being a complete dumpster diver. I hope they can figure out how to use a studio by the time they get to the sophomore album.","overall":3,"summary":"Breathing Fire","unixReviewTime":1373328000,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2013"}

I played \"Get Lifted\" so much that I thought that the CD was going to scratch and I would have to buy a new one, which is what happened with Chico DeBarge's \"Long Time No See.\". Songs like \"Alright\", \"I Can Change\" of\/Snoop Dogg, \"So High\", \"Used To Love You\" and \"Live It Up\" were my main favourites but I played this CD in its entirety until the radio wore \"Ordinary People\" into the ground. I was just as impressed with \"Once Again\". I did't like \"Save Room\" too much but songs such as \"Heaven\", \"Stereo\", \"P. D. A.\", \"Another Again\", \"Show Me\" and \"Maxine\" more than made up for it. \"Evolver\" was cool, especially with songs like \"Green Light\" of\/Andre three thousand, \"Everybody Knows\", \"This Time\", \"Satisfaction\" and \"Good Morning\" but I did't like this CD as much as I did the previous two. In two thousand and ten, John released a project with The Roots entitled \"Wake Up\". The majority of the songs are remakes but this is a great CD, if you haven't checked this one out before. In two thousand and twelve, John released \"Tonight (Best You Ever Had)\" on the \"Think Like A Man\" soundtrack and I was looking forward to hearing a new album. Unfortunately, I had to wait until this year for it.\"Love In The Future\" was released on September three, two thousand and thirteen and just like the good Earth, Wind & Fire say in their song, it's clearly \"All About Love\". However, this CD breaks down all aspects of love. The CD talks about how you stay in love, being in love, what to do with it, lost love and even in some ways, forbidden love. I know that artists always try to \"get\" you by releasing standard and deluxe editions of CDs but this is one CD that you want to have the deluxe edition of. You can listen to this CD from beginning to send. My favourites include \"All Of Me\", \"Who Do We Think We Are\" of\/Officer Ricky, \"Made To Love\", \"You And I (Nobody In The World)\", and \"So Gone\". If you have enjoyed all of the CDs that John has released so far then you definitely should add \"Love In The Future\" to your collection.
