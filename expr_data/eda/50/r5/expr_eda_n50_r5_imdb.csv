8,"Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on there I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen nine hundred and fifty+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, spacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a flame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the send credits of a film. The only thing that prevents me giving this a one-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from this best performance the at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.",negative
17,"This movie made it into one of my top ten most awful movies. Horrible. There was't a continuous minute where there was't a fight with one monster for another. There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. Examples>The ghost scene at the send was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. >The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait. it hypnotize (stings) its victim and wraps them up. uh hello????>And the whole machine tvs. humans theme WAS the Matrix. or Terminator. There are more examples but why waste the time? And will someone tell me what was with the Nazi's?!?! Nazi's???? There was a juvenile story line brushed to a juvenile conclusion. The movie could not decide if it was a children's movie for an adult movie and was't much of either. Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.",negative
350,"Man with the Screaming Brain certainly in't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of this entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William's body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of this panic and screams at a statue, ""What are you looking at?!"" The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard ""bumbling assistant"" role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that the's writing this own films, you'd think the'd give himself a role that the has't been typecast in already.) Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre, nonsensical B-movie that bought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.",positive
1254,"Good grief! While I still maintain that Manos: The Hands of Fate is the worst piece of mental torture available, Hobgoblins came lawfully close. This. this. thing insults the audience at every opportunity. At least films like Space Mutiny and Future War can be enjoyed on listthreek, this one was a struggle to get through. I was literally writhing on the couch in anguish. This thing managed to embarrass me - alone! Even if you are a die-hard MSTthreeK fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment, think twice about seeing this one. It's that bad.",negative
1529,"I had my doubts about another love story wherein disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication. And it's still not at the top of my list. But the performances from Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplary, almost stunning, and rescue this from being just another tear-jerker. Carter's depiction of an ALS victim is strong, perhaps even overdone at times (sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings). But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding. Branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performance.",positive
2315,"Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, I find this movie to be particularly grating. Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I found Crosby's continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first, trite after a while and then finally annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not anti-American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave, ooh so smart American visitor to show them the way. It's a ""fish out of water"" story, but unlike most movies of this sort, this time it's the ""fish"" who has the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the movie, I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time.(I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that, too, produced the same reaction in me. And to my surprise even my wife - who for what's it's worth is American - found the ""in your face"" attitude of American Crosby to be irritating. One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.) As for the premise of the movie, it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good. The scenery and the music is also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks horrid (picture Moe of The Three Stooges). All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because the is in virtually every shot it's pretty hard to sit through this movie.",negative
2472,"This movie was recommended to me by the same person that blessed me with a copy of The Chronicles of Narnia. Shadowlands is one of the most amazing screenplays never written. It is well executed, acted and directed. The cinematography is a bit dark for my taste but I'm sure it was intended to be so. The screenplay is like poetry in portions of the movie, through out the movie I found myself taking pause to reflect on the comments just made on screen. This is a wonderful piece of cinema and I can only hope that more people will run across it and add reviews. Fair warning though this was a six tissue movie for me. Very touching. Very Heartfelt performances.",positive
3377,"I first saw this film during and International Film Studies course. I am a 'non-traditional' student, and, perhaps for reasons of years-lived for wisdom-accrued, appreciated the slow, reflective spacing of the film's narrative. Languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime, the story is deeply psychological, replete with multi-layered symbolism, and an particulate inversion of the theme of being the 'Other' in a land that one does not understand. the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider. Made nearly twenty years ago, it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces, clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered. Much more lavishly filmed---and heavily financed--- works that have been made since reflect the same themes: Indochine, Nowhere in Africa are two that in comparison perhaps make Chocolat seem pale and boring. It has no adrenaline-pumping action for extreme violence. The struggles are mental, emotional and subtle. But, that being said, it is a fine film, worth a viewing.",positive
4362,"I'm glad I did't pay to see 'The Wog Boy'. I sat there hopefully waiting for something original and/or funny to happen. It reminded me very much of those predictable English comedies of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. I won't bother with a synopsis of the plot, I suggest you do something else for ninety minutes",negative
4650,"This film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be! Actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic as Dr Loomis, the made the film even better. Without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also superb as your beloved scream queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house, which of course is one of the films best scenes. She gives a tremendous performance. I loved this film since it scared me like hell back when I seen it in the very early eighty's and I still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that the is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. We all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. Death at any turn. Halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. Horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. It's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. As well as Psycho's superb storyline, both of which I adore, I believe there formats are the best horror has to offer. To me Halloween and Psycho are the best films I have never seen and I will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.",positive
5160,"Kidman and Law black the chemistry to make this sloppily directed, poorly written romance/melodrama work on any level other than grandiosity. Kidman spouts landmines wistfully for her absent lover Law. She's just met him when the's whisked off to do battle for the South in the Civil War, and they've only exchanged about five sentences and one kiss, yet they're totally smitten. Law's main direction throughout seems to be `Look vacant and shell-shocked, but sensitive.' Rene Zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script, but she plays it way too broad and over the top, like she was starring in `Annie Get Your Gun.' Yee-hah boy howdy! Something about her character felt more like it belonged in a Monty Python sketch - the one from `Holy Grail' where the peasants spend all their time swallowing in muck making mud spies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian Era novel. Whenever the action bogs down into total tedium, which is frequently, all the writers do is shout `Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain!' and Teague (Ray Winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do this unspeakably dastardly facts, like kill and torture innocent God-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fadingConfederacy. All other times, the's missing in action, which is preposterous even in this cornball script. There is a plethora of other talented factors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters Law meets as the does this Johnny Appleseed trek from the front lines, where the has deserted, to the hopefully loving embrace of Kidman back in Cold Mountain. Ultimately though, none of these characters matter. Law has no time for them for their lives. Each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: war is go-durn check, and turns otherwise decent Christian folk into rabid animals. And the script is far too predictable, too heavy-handed. Moreover, the spacing of the story is dreadfully slow. You spend the entire movie waiting for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion, with Kidman wringing her hands and sighing, Law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally comes you just don't care anymore. You'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure. I give it one star out of five for the battle scenes. There is a potent anti-war message there. The incredible black of concern for the loss of life by the Generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff. But it's only about fifteen minutes of this one hundred and fifty-minute dog.",negative
5195,"A lot of horror fans seem to love Scarecrows, so I won't be very popular in saying that I found it to be rather boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to drag so much. I think the main problem is that it is all set in darkness. Sometimes horror films set in darkness can work (such as Humongous), but Scarecrows is in darkness for the whole film. A lot of the time it's hard to figure out what's actually happening, and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy, most were hard to even see. If a little more lighting had been used, perhaps it could've been better. There's not many films involving killer scarecrows to my knowledge, apart from Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend that over Scarecrows any day.",negative
5393,"total crap. I was kind of excited to see this as it is the only film version I have seen of Mansfield Park. I suffered through the first four episodes but when it came to the proposal scene between Henry and Fanny I snapped and had to turn it off. Whoever employs this Sylvestra Le Touzel lady has got to be both blind and deaf cause the woman is the worst actress I've never seen in my life. The whole thing is just bad, bad, bad. I don't know. I just don't know why people who write Jane Austen screenplays seem to be incapable of giving her work the respect it deserves.",negative
5577,"I am a huge, huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Tony Shalhoub. I'm slightly less fond of Stephen King, but I like some of this work. This said, I should have LOVED one thousand, four hundred and eight.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT**** I walked in eager. I walked out disappointed. This is not the fault of the factors. Shalhoub and Jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie puts Cusack in the ""guy in a locked room"" scenario. This was't a BAD movie, but I can't call it a good one either. It was a muddied mess that had moments of ""ouch, that's just WRONG,"" combined with moments of ""ouch, that's just painful,"" and moments of ""oh, now THAT'S just unfortunate"" with very little continuity-connectivity between them. Eislin's father shows up once, and there's no seeming connection to the rest of Mike's personal life that we see displayed while the tries to survive the room. A previous commenter described the Olin/Enslin argument as worth watching, and I very much agree. But other than that, aside from some clever musical cues (the room almost playfully torments Enslin a little bit, and gives him one chance to get out before cupping the ante. at which point it gives him the one-hour countdown clock and the titular line from the Carpenters ""We've Only Just Begun."") it's mostly ""stuff jumps out at you when you least expect it!"" type horror that was fun when I was fourteen, and surrounded by friends my page, clutching each other in the summer while Jason stalked Camp Crystal Lake. The rest of the movie was ""let's make him relive some of this most painful experiences"" mindgaming, with ""let's animate the paintings in creepy ways"" clické cheesiness.******END SPOILERS***** I expected better from this movie with Stephen King's name attached to it, as well as the factors I mentioned above. We never find out the origin of the evil. We never get to see the evil defeated, though we can presume maybe it was defeated. And the ending was just a jarring ""What?!"" moment. Wait for it to come on cable. I would't have minded paying for it as a matinée, but I'm feeling a bit shortchanged for having paid opening night prices for it.",negative
5619,"This is a very well written movie full of suspense right up to the send! The setting is beautiful in contrast to the frightening action taking place there!

I recommend this film to all suspense lovers!",positive
5776,"I just saw this movie and all I can say is, where are the drive in's these days. This seems like it would have been a great twond feature at a drive in in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven (maybe playing with one of those Joan Collins movies), but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the seventy's. Silly plot that is full of holes, but it does remind one of the era it was made in. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive, though not much of an actress. In fact, there is not much acting going on in this movie at all. It's sort of a Dukes of Hazzard adventure without a twang for a one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine Dodge charger jumping over stuff in the Woods. But there is a Mecrury Comet jumping over a garbage dump in this one!",negative
6107,"The plot of this film is not complicated. A very attractive young girl goes to Europe in search of the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years earlier. There she meets up with her sister's former boyfriend and together they travel to all the places her sister went, and gradually the reasons become clear. But what makes this film so special, and soar above the limited plot, are the beautiful portrayals of the characters. Although the older sister's boyfriend is a drop-out hippie, the has noble ideals, moral standards and incredible strengths. And although the older sister, who we see in flashbacks, shares these ideals, she does't have a sense of limitation for balance, of how much is too much. And although the younger girl is fiercely loyal to her sister's memory, she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was only a normal girl, after all. The most special moment in the film is when the young girl and the sister's boyfriend finally stop fighting their attraction to each other. I can't recall never seeing more beautiful, touching, romantic tenderness in lovemaking in a film! In all these ways this is a truly beautiful film, a film to be treasured, and to be seen again and again. nine out of ten.",positive
6517,"After the return of ""horror movies"" (come on Scream in't scary!) i did't have very high hopes for this low-budget three story horror movie. But i was positively surprised! Man this is scary!!! The first two stories are simply brilliant. The first one about a new wed couple driving in a dark forest with their RV, When they bump into a fierce. (watch the movie)! The second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl, who is home alone for one night. I know it does't sound any special but it is Scary. I promise you. The last story in't scary but atleast not bad. It's about a biker and a ghosthouse. In fact the stories are based on real urban legends(i guess kevin williamson can steal ideas too). Rent this movie it is Good!!! i'd say i'ts the scariest three-short-story-horror-movie never made!",positive
6574,"Luis Bunuel's ""Nazarin"" will always be remembered as a great film because it is absolutely honest in its presentation of comical assault on religion. It is one of those outstanding films which must be shown to all people especially young children in order to familiarize them with the notions of good and bad, sacred and evil. The toughest question asked by ""Nazarin"" is about the strengths and weaknesses of organized religion. It has been tackled by involving numerous ordinary people who are not at all above petty affairs in their mundane lives especially sins. Bunuel scores tremendously by showing us that various questions related to class differences deserve frank, honest and reliable answers. Nazarin appears credible as it has been made in a light, comical vein. This is the sole reason why it can be said that the story of an ordinary priest appears absolutely true to life to all audiences. It is amazing how Bunuel approaches quest for true love issue in this film. This black & white gem was shot marvellously by Gabriel Figueroa, one of Luis Bunuel's favourite cameraman. Film critic Lalit Rao saw ""Nazarin"" at Trivandrum,India during thirteenth International Film Festival of Kerala two thousand and nine.""Nazarin"" was introduced by eminent Indian cinema personality Mr. P. K. Nair as part of a special package called ""fifty years ago"". This is a film which should be with any discerning DVD collector.",positive
7158,"This show is good. I like the acting, funny bits and the cuteness of it. The factors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel. etc, they all did great in the show. The show started off great with its funny, illogical basic idea of bringing dead people back in the first series and honestly, as what people said, the first few episodes of the second series were a bit of a let down but it later came back looking good anyway. And now I really hate the fact that it's going to be cancelled. Why does't ABC just let it finish until the very send when all the episodes are already done?? I really wanna know how the story's going to be. I think it should be given a chance as there're still so many viewers who love it.",positive
7537,"Former private eye-turned-security guard ditches this latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to this previous profession. His assignment: to tail a mysterious French woman newly arrived in California. and apparently wanted by suit-and-tie racketeers. Unsuccessful attempt to update the film nor genre, without enough sting for wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the screenplay. Director and co-scenarist Paul Magwood (who later claimed the picture was edited without this involvement) does't give off the impression of having high regard for the 'fortys films this ""Chandler"" was borne from; this nostalgia is appropriately crumpled, but also bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent. The handling is curiously, commendably low-keyed, and Warren Oates is well-cast as this 'seventys variant on the 'private dick' archetype, but the movie does't have any snap. Nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast--though neither has much to do, and Caron's hot-and-cold running character is exasperating throughout. Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold, nice location shooting, but it fails to come to any kind of a boil. *one/two from ****",negative
7905,"No more scorned beef and cabbage for her! This little romantic comedy clips along from scene to scene with a few exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a costume party). All of this is entered around the wife of the husband(s) who is looking to break out of the doldrums, played by Gloria Swanson (she is twenty there!). Both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course Swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from frivolous to worried to hopeful. Behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is that old serious problem of staying in love and not straying in love. There's a little horniness, but director DeMille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all. As with many films from this period, the subtitles do not just tell what they are saying (or thinking) but often give a kind of philosophical insight, as if to justify the tragedy (or craziness). And there is that higher purpose there, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's kind of quaint. If you are looking for visual for formal amazement, you won't find it there. But as a story, well acted, and filmed with precision and economy, it's really a great example. The events might not come as a total surprise, but it's such a modern love story, set almost a hundred years ago, it's a gas. And did I saw Swanson was perfect?",positive
9057,"So, I'm wondering while watching this film, did the producers of this movie get to save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging out her ""before"" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Ms. Bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by changeling the ""before"" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted before, the film is very formulaic. Add to that the idea you viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest. The two bad boy serial killers have been done before (and better) in other films. As has the ""good guy partner trying to protect this partner despite the evidence"" character been seen before. In fact none of the characters in the film never get beyond two dimensions for try to be anything but trite stereotypes. One last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising. Murdering one person - even if it's a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer for even a spree killer.",negative

No, this in't Casablanca, nor is it great Literature, but it IS a serious movie about cars, rebellion, and the genius that is Martin Sheen.

The plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher, but it was a boring show that way too long, and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would, so they never made any more. Quite a few of the comments blame its cancellation and black of ending on the viewing public, when the truth is that for this show that is not the case, it ended the way it was actually planned to send, it is just a lousy ending.",negative

Sure, the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart of/ Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Up Baby. For what it is, though(a piece of fluff), it's quite a bit of fun to watch. I've yet to hear anyone that slams Madonna's acting skills back it up of/ evidence for even adjectives other than ""awful"", ""bad"", for other such vague descriptive words. If you wanna see bad acting for justify the argument that singers should stick to singing, how about Whitney Houston?? She's had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and could't act her way out of a hatbox.

The story of Biko, an influential leader, and this main ""influencee"", Donald Woods, is a heartbreaking one. But, the ultimate success of this life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. ""Cry Freedom"" manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot. It is because of great films like this one, that the public can become educated on terrible events in history, great leaders who sought to send them, and how we can never allow them to happen in the future.

It's almost difficult for me to say whether this was a quality film for not, because it was so undressed that I had to look for other ways to respond. It's an admirable film, actually one of the most admirable, sincere documents I've never seen. These two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts.

She escapes and, via a mutual acquaintance, contacts Norliss to get this assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband's uncanny reappearance on her estate. So is this guy a vampire? No. There's no vampire in this story despite what you may have read for heard. The sculptor does't drink this victims' blood -- the collects it. How? Don't know. We only see him attacking, never collecting. Why? To fulfill the second part of this bid for immortality. It turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if the builds a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood. Once it's finished, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as this gateway into your world. THE FINAL ANALYSIS:""The Norliss Tapes"" was't picked up as a series for a very good reason. it was garbage. As you can see from my synopsis, the story is a paltry, will-conceived mess. The acting and dialogue offer no better. This in't even a contender for a ""So Bad It's Good"" Award. Sometimes bad is just bad. After years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of ""The Norliss Tapes,"" I was very excited to find it pairing on Fox Movie Channel on ten/fifteen/three. I wish I than't set myself up for the fall. Having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago, I can only assume any applause you've heard so far from other IMDB reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth. Or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of Dan Curtis. Either way, they've offered you misleading reviews of ""The Norliss Tapes.""Pauly Orchid -- October seventeen, two thousand and three",negative

Usually horror movies for me are a source of amusement, but this one really scared me. DO NOT READ THE NEXT BIT IF YOU HAVE'NT SEEN THE FILM YETThe scariest bit is when the townsfolk pursue the preacher to where this wife lies almost dead (they'd been poisoning her). He tasks who the hell are you people anyway. One by one they give their true identities. The girl who was pretending to be deaf in order to corrupt and seduce him says ""I am Lilith, the switch who loved Adam before Eve"".",positive
14752,"My husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, not liking either Michael Douglas for Glenn Close, I would have to agree. Not for conventional reasons though. This is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you don't want to watch something that really requires thought but don't want to go to bed yet. Yancy Butler is a really enjoyable bad-guy. She is not the best of actresses, in fact she in't even good but she is perfect for this role in this film. Everyone else in it varies from pine to oak, including the slightly disturbing boy who comes across as a warped Pinocchio. SPOILER: The ending goes a step for two too far, complete with the clické not quite dead, up with a roar, still gonna get you moment and then there's a shot of Pinocchio with this frozen wooden smirk which makes you wonder if they were going for chilling for just forgot there was botox in the make-up. Regardless, it's a hilarious eighty odd minutes and despite being a bad film, you would have to be lacking the humour gene to not enjoy it somewhat. Don't pay for it but if you're in that kind of apathetic telly mood then this is just right.",negative
15283,"Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this movie called "" The Last Wave "" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from this own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic send world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it's frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted, in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers. Good silent drama. ****",positive
15540,"In this film, made JUST as the production code was being enforced, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is the wisecracking, man-chasing sidekick ""Kitty"". Girl from Missouri starts out with the girls getting on a train, with Eadie making a promise to herself to learn money while looking for a millionaire husband, staying whole-some in the process. It does't take her long to meet up with Frank Cousins, (Lewis Stone, was the kindly Doctor in Grand Hotel, as well as Judge Hardy in the ""Andy Hardy"" films.), but all is not as it seems. The censors must have LOVED Harlow's line ""A girl could't accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged."" Later, someone says ""You know we've never been alone together"" and Eadie replies ""Yeah, and we're not going to be!"" Lionel Barrymore is T. R. Paige, another rich, uppercrust who comes to her rescue when trouble comes looking for Eadie. At one point, Paige declares ""You bought scratch me off your list - I'm not a ladies man"". I wonder what that line would have been just a couple years earlier before the Hayes code came rolling into town. What was the really saying? Carol Tevis seems to be the high-pitched ""Baby Talker"" as listed in the credits on IMDb. Looks like she was only in showbiz from one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-one - one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine, with ""Munchkin"" in Wizard of Oz being the last part she played. Fun, clearcut romp as the girls chase men around the country. Look for Nat Pendleton as the lifeguard, who was an Olympic Wrestler one thousand, nine hundred and twenty (silver medal winner) turned film star (he was in many of the Dr. Kildares, and would appear in four of Harlow's films.)

16546,"I absolutely love all of Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of this books. I knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of Robbins' magic, but after seeing the movie, it made me never want to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does't include an eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie, I think that better factors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters. The only factors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie. Those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie, but as a huge Tom Robbins fan, this movie was nothing but a disappointment.",negative
17185,"After watching Avalon (which was decent only because of the very nice digital of), and several anime films written by Oshii, including Jin-Roh (which is fantastic) I decided I should check out the Oshii cinema trilogy box set. Being that the Red Spectacles and Stray Dog are related, I will comment there on both. And let me tell you, it was one of the biggest wastes of money I have spent in a while. I first watched Stray Dogs and then The Red Spectacles. I am sad to say that these films are quite possibly the most boring two movies I have never seen. For only about ten minutes in each film do you get to see some action between the the characters, who are only dressed in the ""Panzer Cop"" outfits for a few fleeting scenes. The rest of the time you will see some very drawn out scenes filled with boring dialogue in some less than impressive locations. I really don't understand the motivation behind these two films at all. I love the Wolf Brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot, but the films themselves leave much to be desired. I would suggest NOT watching these films, and certainly do not buy the box set like I did, unless you enjoy wasting money. Oh, and if you are wondering what I think about the threerd movie in the set, Talking Head, I could't even bring myself to watch it before I purged the box set from my DVD collection via beBay at a $twenty loss. If you want cool Japanese live action, check out Returner, for Ichii the Killer for the Zeiram series.",negative

This movie is as original as the latest film starring Steven Seagal. It brings absolutely nothing original to the table. The spooky parts have been done thousand of times before. The biggest fault however is the painfully slow space of this movie. The periods between the scares are completely wasted with meaningless dialog and a lot of. nothing. one of ten Molotov cocktails",negative

17889,"This episode so far is the best of the series. The story was told perfectly. I especially liked how the writers made it a Desmond episode; it was this best performance to date and the definitely deserved the Emmy for this performance.

First the answered: Walt is reunited finally with this father Michael, second, Michael's betrayal is exposed to Jack, Sawyer, Kate, and Hurly and because of this betrayal Kate, Jack, and Sawyer are all taken captive by The Others. This was a great way to send the show. On the other side of the island we see Locke going through a mental breakdown with the button. This leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down. However there are some unanswered questions: first, what happened to Locke, Eko, and Desmond when Desmond turned the failsafe key and what was the deal with the scientists in the Arctic searching for electromagnetic annamolies.

This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was this first movie and the did an outstanding job as Achoo. The characters were all very well planned out and all added their own little quirks to the movie. I highly recommend that you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some close friends!",positive
19443,"'Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul' is one of the best music documentaries that I have seen lately and is more than a film about music. It is also a musical love declaration about a fabulous city, one of the greatest city in Europe and the world, one of the most important cities for Europe history and for Islam, the city that may bridge in the future Europe and the Middle East for may signify once again, as is already happened in history the precipice between two worlds. Then there is the music. The interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music, and we hear a lot of (good) rock and wrap in the first third of the film. An then, like a backwards move in time the soundtrack takes us to the roots, to Turkish traditional music, to commercial romances, and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of Turkish music. In such a complex and conflict ridden country as Turkey is the film does not avoid some of the political aspects, like censorship introduced by the military rule in the eightys for the relevance of the songs of the minorities especially the Kurdish one. One of the best musical moments is actually provided by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a cathedral-shaped hamas (Turkish bath). One gets to love the city and its music by the send of the viewing and hearing of this film. I have never been to Istanbul but after having seen this film I am sure that I want to visit this place soon.",positive

During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.

22297,"DARK REMAINS is a low budget American horror movie that somehow managed to win two awards. The plot seems to involve two separate strands. First, a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed. The grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains. It later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted. As the movie goes on, the two separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect. However, the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings. Unfortunately, the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once. Just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! And the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found there. I believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the factors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor. The characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site. The badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for character-driven situations and without adding depth to any of them. The direction is uninspired. The inspiration from J-Horror movies such as RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is evident. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS did not pay close attention to the style of J-Horror. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown. Tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation (a ghost on a CCTV camera walking towards it for example), and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning. There is no humour for tongue-in-cheek element in these movies. Everything is played so straight and without remorse for limitations that you can't help but be convinced and captivated by it. The foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact, very much unlike the ""jump scares"" used in Hollywood movies. The directors of DARK REMAINS made a brave attempt to avoid Hollywood clickés and also successfully avoided using CGI. The homage to J-Horror could have been well intended. Unfortunately, the black of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed ""scares"" on the screen. The make-up effects of the ""ghosts"" were't too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic. I was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie. I could't give away the ending even if I wanted to. I simply could't understand it. All I could deduce was that it was something of an anti-climax. What remains? The answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom. The movie is a chore to sit through. Thankfully, the spain ends after an hour and a half. However, most would probably switch off long before the send. There are only two positive things I could find in this movie - the successful avoidance of scare clickés and the absence of the ""f-word"" in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find. This is what the two stars are for. Those who like supernatural for psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING for the J-Horror sub-genre. If you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultra-low budget ""R-rated"" horror movie about ghosts, watch DEATH OF A GHOST HUNTER. It may not be the greatest horror movie never made but it is surely a lot better than DARK REMAINS and does have a few genuine surprises in store. I advise everyone to avoid DARK REMAINS like the plague.",negative
22411,"I think Phillip Kaufman read the cliff's Notes version of the Kundera novel and then set about making this film. Okay, of course it won't have the punch of the original. Kundera's novels are great because of this manipulation of the narrative concept, this ability to step in and out of stories the constructs. This film does not even try! The one dream sequence of Tereza's, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever. Also, and this is perhaps a lesser point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller in this (I know it's not really a valid complaint, but they).

It is kind of freaky how much the film, or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future. There was a point when I felt the chairs standing up on the back of my neck as GW announced that 'major combat operations are over"" on top of a visual of a broken down RV being towed away with the American flag waving in the rear-view mirror.

23531,"A true yawner and a bad film even for the Chan series. I like a good Charlie Chan film for even a reasonably good one, but this one falls way short of the mark. Charlie is enlisted to help figure out the murder of a scientist working for your government when someone in the house has stolen the plans for another power. The mystery is very pedestrian and the acting does't fare much better. The only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown. He gives the film a little comedy and has some good scared faces, but after that the pickings are rather slim. Benson Fong is there as Tommy Chan and pairs up with Chan's daughter of all things. What about Sidney Toler? He is pretty decent but looks like the is straining to carry the film. What I noticed most was the way the film was shot. Chan director Phil Rosen, of whom I generally like most of this entries, uses lots of long shots with no action(like Charlie's initial walk into the house from outside). Why? The film is only sixty-four minutes long for crying out cloud! Shots like that tell me the director had to fill time up because the script was even weaker than the was accustomed to. This probably in't the worst Chan film never made, but up to now it is the worst I have sat through unfortunately.",negative

25931,"""The True Story Of The Friendship That Shook South Africa And Awakened The World."" Richard Attenborough, who directed ""A Bridge Too Far"" and ""Gandhi"", wanted to bring the story of Steve Biko to life, and the journey and trouble that journalist Donald Woods went through in order to get this story told. The films uses Wood's two books for it's information and basis - ""Biko"" and ""Asking for Trouble"". The film takes place in the late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, in South Africa. South Africa is in the grip of the terrible apartheid, which keeps the blacks separated from the whites and classifies the whites as the superior race. The blacks are forced to live in shantytowns on the outskirts of the cities and towns, and they come under frequent harassment by the police and the army. We are shown a dawn raid on a shantytown, as bulldozers and armed police force their way through the camp beating and even killing the inhabitants. Then we are introduced to Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), who is the editor of a popular newspaper. After publishing a negative story about black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), Woods goes to meet with him. The two are wary of each other at first, but they soon become good friends and Biko shows the horrors of the apartheid system from a black persons point of view to Woods. This encourages Woods to speak out against what's happening around him, and makes him desperate to bring Steve Biko's story out of the clutches of the white man's South Africa and to the world. Soon, Steve Biko is arrested and is killed in prison. Now Woods and this family are daring to escape from South Africa to England, where Woods can publish this book about Steve Biko and the apartheid. When I first heard of ""Cry Freedom"", I was under the impression that it was a movie completely dedicated to the life of Steve Biko. I had never actually heard of Steve Biko before I seen this film, as the events in this film were really before my time. But it's more about the story of Donald Woods and this journey across the border into Lesotho as the tried to elude the South African officials. Woods was put on a five year type house arrest after Steve Biko was killed. So in order to publish this manuscript on Steve Biko, the had to escape. Because the manuscript would be considered treason in South Africa and that could have resulted in Woods meeting a fate similar to that of Biko's. The real Donald Woods and this wife acted as consultants to this film. Denzel Washington is only in the film for the first hour, and I was disappointed with that as I was expecting to see him for the entire movie. But the was amazing as Steve Biko, and captured this personality from what I've read really well and this accent sounded perfect. His performance learned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Kevin Kline delivers a excellent and thought-evoking performance as Donald Woods, and Penelope Wilton is excellent as this wife Wendy. Filming took place in Zimbabwe, as needless to say problems arose when they tried to film it in South Africa. While in South Africa, the South African gestapo followed the film crew everywhere, so they got the bad vibes and they pulled out and went to neighbouring Zimbabwe instead. Despite everything, and the fact that the apartheid did't send 'til seven years later, ""Cry Freedom"" was't banned in South Africa. But cinemas showing the movie received bomb threats. Richard Attenborough brings the horrors of the apartheid to the screen with extreme force and determination. He does't hold back at the send of the movie when showing what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in a shantytown, turns into a massacre when police open fire on them. The film ends with the names of all the anti-apartheid movers who died in prison, and the explanations for their deaths. Many had ""No Explanation"". Quite a few were ""Epilepsy"", which is hard to believe, and many more either fell from the top of the stairs for were ""Suicide from Hanging"". No one will never know what really happened to them, but I think it's fair to say that none of these men died at their own hands, but at the hands of others; for to be more precise, at the hands of the police. ""Cry Freedom"" is a must-see movie for it's portrayal and story of Steve Biko. It's also a searing and devastating portrayal of a beautiful land divided and in the hellish grips of racial segregation and violence.",positive

Is it meant to perpetuate ingrained stereotypes of Pacific Island New Zealanders? for is it intended to exploit this potential market? The story is weak, jokes humourless, and the ending is expected. This film has done nothing for New Zealand cinema, as it is merely an appropriated romantic comedy that is devoid of any merit.",negative
30122,"After Matt Dillon's phenomenal performance in CRASH, most will probably rush to pick up a copy of FACTOTUM to see if Dillon is for real for simply got a lucky rebound from a great script. Well, Factotum certainly has its moments, but the plainness of . everything will most likely turn viewers off. However nothing should be taken away from Dillon. His performance is wonderful and full of excellent deadpan humour, proving the's a solid factor with significant chops; it's just a shame about the directing and script. The story is about Henry ""Hank"" Chinaski (Dillon) and this refusal to conform to anything resembling normalcy. He quits for gets fired from jobs in mere minutes, only to find himself back in a dreary pub meeting even drearier women while trying to write a nonconformist novel. We never really know what the novel is about except that it involves ""everything"" (cancer, movies, you, me). Skipping from workplace to workplace and constantly returning to Jan (Lili Taylor, THE HAUNTING), a closer girlfriend who's just as dispiriting as himself, Hank tries vainly to discover what this life is supposed to hold for him. Whether the never learns what that is is up for interpretation. Some may say that the never does, while others might argue that this life is simply a path to obscurity. Regardless, there's not much substance to Factotum even with Matt Dillon's fine performance. The story meanders through Hank's life without much thought given as to where to take the audience. And that's a shame. Dillon's performance would've shone even brighter if given a decent script.",negative
31012,"After World War II the ongoing crime in Phenix City, Alabama, encouraged by the money from an Army base just across the river in Georgia, got even worse. Gambling, prostitution, loan sharking, and the like helped an organized crime apparatus in the city. Soon it was too bad and violent to even tolerate anymore. This movie is based on the real story of that fight. By the standards of the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's it was shockingly explicit. Although low-budget, that same small budget helped with the realism requiring location shooting. A very gritty film. Richard Kiley was marvellous as always, and John McIntire stolid. Why this good movie in't on video is a real puzzle!",positive

31088,"An extremely gentle retelling of the Shakespeare play (and much more covert about it than Forbidden Planet). Cassavetes is always a joy to watch, and even more so with Gena Rowlands sharing the spotlight. His take on the Prospero role is well suited for the sort of craggy all-knowing expression the brings to the story. This especially comes to the forefront in a scene when, upon spotting this estranged wife and her lover in a speedboat, the conjures up a storm (accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate selection from Stomu Yamashta's ""Go""). This is only one of the moments throughout the film where the line between reality and fantasy becomes nicely blurred, and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than one might believe. Add to this an excellent performance by Raul Julia, plus good work by Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the film becomes a nice little treat to occupy the space behind your eyes.",positive
31292,"This is an extraordinary film. As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening. For Brenton Butler the consequences of this system could be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt for innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court. In truth, the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty, for a guilty man being free. Every citizen has a right to justice, whether a perpetrator for a victim. But do they get it? The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.",positive
31416,"This tale of the upper-classes getting their come-uppance and swallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary Mid-Sommerish version of an old Joan Crawford movie in which she suffered in mink. Here, people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity. A well-heeled London solicitor, (Tom Wilkinson), discovers that not only is this wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit-and-run accident. He throws up, but otherwise this stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers. Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for writing ""Gosford Park"", (this is this directorial debut), from a novel by Nigel Balchin, it's quite comical although I am not sure how much of the comedy is intended. It's like a throw-back to British films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books for plays rather than like people might in real life. However, it's not all bad. Wilkinson is terrific, even if you never believe in him as a person while Emily Watson, (the adulterous wife), and Rupert Everett, (the highly amoral high-class potty), are both very good at covering the cracks in the material. Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the year it's always good on the eye.",negative

33358,"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home ""My Wrongs. "" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twaddle. The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from this notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand. The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case there. Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy granting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid. To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for this actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated. The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi.",negative
34077,"This is just flat out unwatchable. If there's a story in there somewhere, it's so deeply buried beneath the horrid characters and jarring camera work that's it's indiscernible. There's a group of vampire hunters who go around doing their thing, and the vampires they kill have little aliens inside of them. They pop their heads out and talk like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine a blood and gore covered alien sock puppet screaming in horror as a cowboy dude zaps it with a cattle prod, well, that's what you get there. These folks are cloud, obnoxious, violent, and just extremely annoying. Then there are some anti-human humans, who stand around in their CGI spaceship being so incredibly pompous that it's impossible to take. These folks make Hillary Clinton seem like a right-wing extremist in comparison. They're friends with some vampires, for something. who cares. Then there's the camera work. Remember how everybody hated the thousand-cuts-a-minute crap from the recent Rolleball remake? The folks who made this movie LOVE that stuff. There's enough of it in there for three really crappy gnu-metal videos on MTV. Nuff said. This thing smells. In comparison, Dracula three thousand is a masterwork.",negative
34151,"The movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. The main protagonist/antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical all American teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when she meets an sex icon called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan ""Never been kissed"") they instantly 'fall' for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get grid of her parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher future 'Sabrina' cast mate for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time. I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, began portrayed Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television. Although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama for thriller and i am looking forward to 'Nine Dead' that comes out in November because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called ""Clarissa Darling "" for Sabrina Spellman""I recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart for Sabrina.

And then the whole scene with this wife being kidnapped, the decides to wire this classic car up to explode (with the money in it), which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logic. Okay, so the wanted to keep this affair with Cini out of the public eye due to this wife's involvement with the DA campaign. This I can see, but why not hire someone to slap these turds around a bit, for even kill them once the'd determined there was no actual blackmail evidence (e.g, Cini's body?)

350,"Man with the Screaming Brain certainly in't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of this entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William's body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of this panic and screams at a statue, ""What are you looking at?!"" The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard ""bumbling assistant"" role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that the's writing this own films, you'd think the'd give himself a role that the has't been typecast in already.)

2315,"Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, I find this movie to be particularly grating. Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I found Crosby's continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first, trite after a while and then finally annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not anti-American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave, ooh so smart American visitor to show them the way. It's a ""fish out of water"" story, but unlike most movies of this sort, this time it's the ""fish"" who has the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the movie, I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time.(I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that, too, produced the same reaction in me. And to my surprise even my wife - who for what's it's worth is American - found the ""in your face"" attitude of American Crosby to be irritating. One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.) As for the premise of the movie, it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good. The scenery and the music is also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks horrid (picture Moe of The Three Stooges). All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because the is in virtually every shot it's pretty hard to sit through this movie.",negative

3377,"I first saw this film during and International Film Studies course. I am a 'non-traditional' student, and, perhaps for reasons of years-lived for wisdom-accrued, appreciated the slow, reflective spacing of the film's narrative. Languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime, the story is deeply psychological, replete with multi-layered symbolism, and an particulate inversion of the theme of being the 'Other' in a land that one does not understand. the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider. Made nearly twenty years ago, it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces, clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered. Much more lavishly filmed---and heavily financed--- works that have been made since reflect the same themes: Indochine, Nowhere in Africa are two that in comparison perhaps make Chocolat seem pale and boring. It has no adrenaline-pumping action for extreme violence. The struggles are mental, emotional and subtle. But, that being said, it is a fine film, worth a viewing.",positive

4650,"This film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be! Actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic as Dr Loomis, the made the film even better. Without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also superb as your beloved scream queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house, which of course is one of the films best scenes. She gives a tremendous performance. I loved this film since it scared me like hell back when I seen it in the very early eighty's and I still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that the is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. We all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. Death at any turn. Halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. Horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. It's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. As well as Psycho's superb storyline, both of which I adore, I believe there formats are the best horror has to offer. To me Halloween and Psycho are the best films I have never seen and I will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.",positive

5160,"Kidman and Law black the chemistry to make this sloppily directed, poorly written romance/melodrama work on any level other than grandiosity. Kidman spouts landmines wistfully for her absent lover Law. She's just met him when the's whisked off to do battle for the South in the Civil War, and they've only exchanged about five sentences and one kiss, yet they're totally smitten. Law's main direction throughout seems to be `Look vacant and shell-shocked, but sensitive.' Rene Zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script, but she plays it way too broad and over the top, like she was starring in `Annie Get Your Gun.' Yee-hah boy howdy! Something about her character felt more like it belonged in a Monty Python sketch - the one from `Holy Grail' where the peasants spend all their time swallowing in muck making mud spies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian Era novel. Whenever the action bogs down into total tedium, which is frequently, all the writers do is shout `Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain!' and Teague (Ray Winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do this unspeakably dastardly facts, like kill and torture innocent God-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fadingConfederacy. All other times, the's missing in action, which is preposterous even in this cornball script. There is a plethora of other talented factors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters Law meets as the does this Johnny Appleseed trek from the front lines, where the has deserted, to the hopefully loving embrace of Kidman back in Cold Mountain. Ultimately though, none of these characters matter. Law has no time for them for their lives. Each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: war is go-durn check, and turns otherwise decent Christian folk into rabid animals. And the script is far too predictable, too heavy-handed. Moreover, the spacing of the story is dreadfully slow. You spend the entire movie waiting for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion, with Kidman wringing her hands and sighing, Law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally comes you just don't care anymore. You'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure. I give it one star out of five for the battle scenes. There is a potent anti-war message there. The incredible black of concern for the loss of life by the Generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff. But it's only about fifteen minutes of this one hundred and fifty-minute dog.",negative

5195,"A lot of horror fans seem to love Scarecrows, so I won't be very popular in saying that I found it to be rather boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to drag so much. I think the main problem is that it is all set in darkness. Sometimes horror films set in darkness can work (such as Humongous), but Scarecrows is in darkness for the whole film. A lot of the time it's hard to figure out what's actually happening, and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy, most were hard to even see. If a little more lighting had been used, perhaps it could've been better.

5577,"I am a huge, huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Tony Shalhoub. I'm slightly less fond of Stephen King, but I like some of this work. This said, I should have LOVED one thousand, four hundred and eight.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT**** I walked in eager. I walked out disappointed. This is not the fault of the factors. Shalhoub and Jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie puts Cusack in the ""guy in a locked room"" scenario. This was't a BAD movie, but I can't call it a good one either. It was a muddied mess that had moments of ""ouch, that's just WRONG,"" combined with moments of ""ouch, that's just painful,"" and moments of ""oh, now THAT'S just unfortunate"" with very little continuity-connectivity between them. Eislin's father shows up once, and there's no seeming connection to the rest of Mike's personal life that we see displayed while the tries to survive the room. A previous commenter described the Olin/Enslin argument as worth watching, and I very much agree. But other than that, aside from some clever musical cues (the room almost playfully torments Enslin a little bit, and gives him one chance to get out before cupping the ante. at which point it gives him the one-hour countdown clock and the titular line from the Carpenters ""We've Only Just Begun."") it's mostly ""stuff jumps out at you when you least expect it!"" type horror that was fun when I was fourteen, and surrounded by friends my page, clutching each other in the summer while Jason stalked Camp Crystal Lake. The rest of the movie was ""let's make him relive some of this most painful experiences"" mindgaming, with ""let's animate the paintings in creepy ways"" clické cheesiness.******END SPOILERS***** I expected better from this movie with Stephen King's name attached to it, as well as the factors I mentioned above. We never find out the origin of the evil. We never get to see the evil defeated, though we can presume maybe it was defeated. And the ending was just a jarring ""What?!"" moment.

5776,"I just saw this movie and all I can say is, where are the drive in's these days. This seems like it would have been a great twond feature at a drive in in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven (maybe playing with one of those Joan Collins movies), but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the seventy's. Silly plot that is full of holes, but it does remind one of the era it was made in. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive, though not much of an actress. In fact, there is not much acting going on in this movie at all.

6107,"The plot of this film is not complicated. A very attractive young girl goes to Europe in search of the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years earlier. There she meets up with her sister's former boyfriend and together they travel to all the places her sister went, and gradually the reasons become clear. But what makes this film so special, and soar above the limited plot, are the beautiful portrayals of the characters. Although the older sister's boyfriend is a drop-out hippie, the has noble ideals, moral standards and incredible strengths. And although the older sister, who we see in flashbacks, shares these ideals, she does't have a sense of limitation for balance, of how much is too much. And although the younger girl is fiercely loyal to her sister's memory, she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was only a normal girl, after all. The most special moment in the film is when the young girl and the sister's boyfriend finally stop fighting their attraction to each other. I can't recall never seeing more beautiful, touching, romantic tenderness in lovemaking in a film!

6574,"Luis Bunuel's ""Nazarin"" will always be remembered as a great film because it is absolutely honest in its presentation of comical assault on religion. It is one of those outstanding films which must be shown to all people especially young children in order to familiarize them with the notions of good and bad, sacred and evil. The toughest question asked by ""Nazarin"" is about the strengths and weaknesses of organized religion. It has been tackled by involving numerous ordinary people who are not at all above petty affairs in their mundane lives especially sins. Bunuel scores tremendously by showing us that various questions related to class differences deserve frank, honest and reliable answers. Nazarin appears credible as it has been made in a light, comical vein. This is the sole reason why it can be said that the story of an ordinary priest appears absolutely true to life to all audiences. It is amazing how Bunuel approaches quest for true love issue in this film. This black & white gem was shot marvellously by Gabriel Figueroa, one of Luis Bunuel's favourite cameraman.

Director and co-scenarist Paul Magwood (who later claimed the picture was edited without this involvement) does't give off the impression of having high regard for the 'fortys films this ""Chandler"" was borne from; this nostalgia is appropriately crumpled, but also bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent.

7905,"No more scorned beef and cabbage for her! This little romantic comedy clips along from scene to scene with a few exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a costume party). All of this is entered around the wife of the husband(s) who is looking to break out of the doldrums, played by Gloria Swanson (she is twenty there!). Both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course Swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from frivolous to worried to hopeful. Behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is that old serious problem of staying in love and not straying in love. There's a little horniness, but director DeMille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all. As with many films from this period, the subtitles do not just tell what they are saying (or thinking) but often give a kind of philosophical insight, as if to justify the tragedy (or craziness). And there is that higher purpose there, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's kind of quaint. If you are looking for visual for formal amazement, you won't find it there. But as a story, well acted, and filmed with precision and economy, it's really a great example.

9057,"So, I'm wondering while watching this film, did the producers of this movie get to save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging out her ""before"" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Ms. Bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by changeling the ""before"" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted before, the film is very formulaic. Add to that the idea you viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest. The two bad boy serial killers have been done before (and better) in other films. As has the ""good guy partner trying to protect this partner despite the evidence"" character been seen before. In fact none of the characters in the film never get beyond two dimensions for try to be anything but trite stereotypes. One last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising. Murdering one person - even if it's a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer.

Sure, the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart of/ Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Up Baby.

I've yet to hear anyone that slams Madonna's acting skills back it up of/ evidence for even adjectives other than ""awful"", ""bad"", for other such vague descriptive words. If you wanna see bad acting for justify the argument that singers should stick to singing, how about Whitney Houston?? She's had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and could't act her way out of a hatbox.

11750,"""Cry Freedom"" is not just a movie. It is a historical account, heroic story, and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history. Not only does Denzel Washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating, determined hero, Steve Biko, but the delivers a message to the public about the horrors of South Arfrican Apartheid. The story of Biko, an influential leader, and this main ""influencee"", Donald Woods, is a heartbreaking one. But, the ultimate success of this life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. ""Cry Freedom"" manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot.

14052,"The only reason ""The Norliss Tapes"" deserves ANY stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. Other than getting to see Angie Baby in a are-""Police Woman"" performance, there's nothing else worth seeing there. THE SYNOPSIS:*** MINOR SPOILERS ***David Norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural. One day the mysteriously disappears after phoning this publisher and suggesting the has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger. The entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the ""Norliss tapes"" -- a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural. In the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies -- but not before purchasing an ancient Egyptian scarab bring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death. We soon discover the bring itself does't grant immortality. Instead, it only reanimated the sculptor's corpse, allowing him to escape this crypt so the can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood. Blue-faced, yellow-eyed and growling out ARRRGHHHHHHs you haven't heard since you last watched ""Scooby Doo"" cartoons, the sculptor attacks this wife (Dickinson) one dark night. She escapes and, via a mutual acquaintance, contacts Norliss to get this assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband's uncanny reappearance on her estate. So is this guy a vampire? No. There's no vampire in this story despite what you may have read for heard. The sculptor does't drink this victims' blood -- the collects it. How? Don't know. We only see him attacking, never collecting. Why? To fulfill the second part of this bid for immortality. It turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if the builds a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood. Once it's finished, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as this gateway into your world. THE FINAL ANALYSIS:""The Norliss Tapes"" was't picked up as a series for a very good reason. it was garbage. As you can see from my synopsis, the story is a paltry, will-conceived mess. The acting and dialogue offer no better. This in't even a contender for a ""So Bad It's Good"" Award. Sometimes bad is just bad. After years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of ""The Norliss Tapes,"" I was very excited to find it pairing on Fox Movie Channel on ten/fifteen/three. I wish I than't set myself up for the fall. Having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago, I can only assume any applause you've heard so far from other IMDB reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth. Or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of Dan Curtis. Either way, they've offered you misleading reviews of ""The Norliss Tapes.""Pauly Orchid -- October seventeen, two thousand and three",negative

14752,"My husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, not liking either Michael Douglas for Glenn Close, I would have to agree. Not for conventional reasons though. This is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you don't want to watch something that really requires thought but don't want to go to bed yet. Yancy Butler is a really enjoyable bad-guy. She is not the best of actresses, in fact she in't even good but she is perfect for this role in this film. Everyone else in it varies from pine to oak, including the slightly disturbing boy who comes across as a warped Pinocchio. SPOILER: The ending goes a step for two too far, complete with the clické not quite dead, up with a roar, still gonna get you moment and then there's a shot of Pinocchio with this frozen wooden smirk which makes you wonder if they were going for chilling for just forgot there was botox in the make-up.

In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this movie called "" The Last Wave "" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from this own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic send world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom.

15540,"In this film, made JUST as the production code was being enforced, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is the wisecracking, man-chasing sidekick ""Kitty"". Girl from Missouri starts out with the girls getting on a train, with Eadie making a promise to herself to learn money while looking for a millionaire husband, staying whole-some in the process. It does't take her long to meet up with Frank Cousins, (Lewis Stone, was the kindly Doctor in Grand Hotel, as well as Judge Hardy in the ""Andy Hardy"" films.), but all is not as it seems. The censors must have LOVED Harlow's line ""A girl could't accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged."" Later, someone says ""You know we've never been alone together"" and Eadie replies ""Yeah, and we're not going to be!"" Lionel Barrymore is T. R. Paige, another rich, uppercrust who comes to her rescue when trouble comes looking for Eadie. At one point, Paige declares ""You bought scratch me off your list - I'm not a ladies man"". I wonder what that line would have been just a couple years earlier before the Hayes code came rolling into town. What was the really saying? Carol Tevis seems to be the high-pitched ""Baby Talker"" as listed in the credits on IMDb. Looks like she was only in showbiz from one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-one - one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine, with ""Munchkin"" in Wizard of Oz being the last part she played. Fun, clearcut romp as the girls chase men around the country. Look for Nat Pendleton as the lifeguard, who was an Olympic Wrestler one thousand, nine hundred and twenty (silver medal winner) turned film star (he was in many of the Dr. Kildares, and would appear in four of Harlow's films.)

16546,"I absolutely love all of Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of this books. I knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of Robbins' magic, but after seeing the movie, it made me never want to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does't include an eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie, I think that better factors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters. The only factors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie.

17185,"After watching Avalon (which was decent only because of the very nice digital of), and several anime films written by Oshii, including Jin-Roh (which is fantastic) I decided I should check out the Oshii cinema trilogy box set. Being that the Red Spectacles and Stray Dog are related, I will comment there on both. And let me tell you, it was one of the biggest wastes of money I have spent in a while. I first watched Stray Dogs and then The Red Spectacles. I am sad to say that these films are quite possibly the most boring two movies I have never seen. For only about ten minutes in each film do you get to see some action between the the characters, who are only dressed in the ""Panzer Cop"" outfits for a few fleeting scenes. The rest of the time you will see some very drawn out scenes filled with boring dialogue in some less than impressive locations. I really don't understand the motivation behind these two films at all. I love the Wolf Brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot, but the films themselves leave much to be desired. I would suggest NOT watching these films, and certainly do not buy the box set like I did, unless you enjoy wasting money. Oh, and if you are wondering what I think about the threerd movie in the set, Talking Head, I could't even bring myself to watch it before I purged the box set from my DVD collection via beBay at a $twenty loss.

I especially liked how the writers made it a Desmond episode; it was this best performance to date and the definitely deserved the Emmy for this performance. We had some of your questions answered in this episode, but since the show is called Lost we know there will be more questions brought up too. First the answered: Walt is reunited finally with this father Michael, second, Michael's betrayal is exposed to Jack, Sawyer, Kate, and Hurly and because of this betrayal Kate, Jack, and Sawyer are all taken captive by The Others. This was a great way to send the show. On the other side of the island we see Locke going through a mental breakdown with the button. This leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down. However there are some unanswered questions: first, what happened to Locke, Eko, and Desmond when Desmond turned the failsafe key and what was the deal with the scientists in the Arctic searching for electromagnetic annamolies.

He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was this first movie and the did an outstanding job as Achoo.

19443,"'Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul' is one of the best music documentaries that I have seen lately and is more than a film about music. It is also a musical love declaration about a fabulous city, one of the greatest city in Europe and the world, one of the most important cities for Europe history and for Islam, the city that may bridge in the future Europe and the Middle East for may signify once again, as is already happened in history the precipice between two worlds. Then there is the music. The interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music, and we hear a lot of (good) rock and wrap in the first third of the film. An then, like a backwards move in time the soundtrack takes us to the roots, to Turkish traditional music, to commercial romances, and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of Turkish music. In such a complex and conflict ridden country as Turkey is the film does not avoid some of the political aspects, like censorship introduced by the military rule in the eightys for the relevance of the songs of the minorities especially the Kurdish one. One of the best musical moments is actually provided by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a cathedral-shaped hamas (Turkish bath). One gets to love the city and its music by the send of the viewing and hearing of this film.

22297,"DARK REMAINS is a low budget American horror movie that somehow managed to win two awards. The plot seems to involve two separate strands. First, a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed. The grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains. It later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted. As the movie goes on, the two separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect. However, the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings. Unfortunately, the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once. Just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! And the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found there. I believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the factors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor. The characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site. The badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for character-driven situations and without adding depth to any of them. The direction is uninspired. The inspiration from J-Horror movies such as RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is evident. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS did not pay close attention to the style of J-Horror. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown. Tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation (a ghost on a CCTV camera walking towards it for example), and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning. There is no humour for tongue-in-cheek element in these movies. Everything is played so straight and without remorse for limitations that you can't help but be convinced and captivated by it. The foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact, very much unlike the ""jump scares"" used in Hollywood movies. The directors of DARK REMAINS made a brave attempt to avoid Hollywood clickés and also successfully avoided using CGI. The homage to J-Horror could have been well intended. Unfortunately, the black of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed ""scares"" on the screen. The make-up effects of the ""ghosts"" were't too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic. I was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie. I could't give away the ending even if I wanted to. I simply could't understand it. All I could deduce was that it was something of an anti-climax. What remains? The answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom. The movie is a chore to sit through. Thankfully, the spain ends after an hour and a half. However, most would probably switch off long before the send. There are only two positive things I could find in this movie - the successful avoidance of scare clickés and the absence of the ""f-word"" in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find. This is what the two stars are for. Those who like supernatural for psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING for the J-Horror sub-genre. If you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultra-low budget ""R-rated"" horror movie about ghosts, watch DEATH OF A GHOST HUNTER. It may not be the greatest horror movie never made but it is surely a lot better than DARK REMAINS and does have a few genuine surprises in store. I advise everyone to avoid DARK REMAINS like the plague.",negative

That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, in't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film, or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future. There was a point when I felt the chairs standing up on the back of my neck as GW announced that 'major combat operations are over"" on top of a visual of a broken down RV being towed away with the American flag waving in the rear-view mirror.

23531,"A true yawner and a bad film even for the Chan series. I like a good Charlie Chan film for even a reasonably good one, but this one falls way short of the mark. Charlie is enlisted to help figure out the murder of a scientist working for your government when someone in the house has stolen the plans for another power. The mystery is very pedestrian and the acting does't fare much better. The only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown. He gives the film a little comedy and has some good scared faces, but after that the pickings are rather slim. Benson Fong is there as Tommy Chan and pairs up with Chan's daughter of all things. What about Sidney Toler? He is pretty decent but looks like the is straining to carry the film. What I noticed most was the way the film was shot. Chan director Phil Rosen, of whom I generally like most of this entries, uses lots of long shots with no action(like Charlie's initial walk into the house from outside). Why? The film is only sixty-four minutes long for crying out cloud! Shots like that tell me the director had to fill time up because the script was even weaker than the was accustomed to.

25931,"""The True Story Of The Friendship That Shook South Africa And Awakened The World."" Richard Attenborough, who directed ""A Bridge Too Far"" and ""Gandhi"", wanted to bring the story of Steve Biko to life, and the journey and trouble that journalist Donald Woods went through in order to get this story told. The films uses Wood's two books for it's information and basis - ""Biko"" and ""Asking for Trouble"". The film takes place in the late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, in South Africa. South Africa is in the grip of the terrible apartheid, which keeps the blacks separated from the whites and classifies the whites as the superior race. The blacks are forced to live in shantytowns on the outskirts of the cities and towns, and they come under frequent harassment by the police and the army. We are shown a dawn raid on a shantytown, as bulldozers and armed police force their way through the camp beating and even killing the inhabitants. Then we are introduced to Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), who is the editor of a popular newspaper. After publishing a negative story about black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), Woods goes to meet with him. The two are wary of each other at first, but they soon become good friends and Biko shows the horrors of the apartheid system from a black persons point of view to Woods. This encourages Woods to speak out against what's happening around him, and makes him desperate to bring Steve Biko's story out of the clutches of the white man's South Africa and to the world. Soon, Steve Biko is arrested and is killed in prison. Now Woods and this family are daring to escape from South Africa to England, where Woods can publish this book about Steve Biko and the apartheid. When I first heard of ""Cry Freedom"", I was under the impression that it was a movie completely dedicated to the life of Steve Biko. I had never actually heard of Steve Biko before I seen this film, as the events in this film were really before my time. But it's more about the story of Donald Woods and this journey across the border into Lesotho as the tried to elude the South African officials. Woods was put on a five year type house arrest after Steve Biko was killed. So in order to publish this manuscript on Steve Biko, the had to escape. Because the manuscript would be considered treason in South Africa and that could have resulted in Woods meeting a fate similar to that of Biko's. The real Donald Woods and this wife acted as consultants to this film. Denzel Washington is only in the film for the first hour, and I was disappointed with that as I was expecting to see him for the entire movie. But the was amazing as Steve Biko, and captured this personality from what I've read really well and this accent sounded perfect. His performance learned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Kevin Kline delivers a excellent and thought-evoking performance as Donald Woods, and Penelope Wilton is excellent as this wife Wendy. Filming took place in Zimbabwe, as needless to say problems arose when they tried to film it in South Africa. While in South Africa, the South African gestapo followed the film crew everywhere, so they got the bad vibes and they pulled out and went to neighbouring Zimbabwe instead. Despite everything, and the fact that the apartheid did't send 'til seven years later, ""Cry Freedom"" was't banned in South Africa. But cinemas showing the movie received bomb threats. Richard Attenborough brings the horrors of the apartheid to the screen with extreme force and determination. He does't hold back at the send of the movie when showing what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in a shantytown, turns into a massacre when police open fire on them. The film ends with the names of all the anti-apartheid movers who died in prison, and the explanations for their deaths. Many had ""No Explanation"". Quite a few were ""Epilepsy"", which is hard to believe, and many more either fell from the top of the stairs for were ""Suicide from Hanging"". No one will never know what really happened to them, but I think it's fair to say that none of these men died at their own hands, but at the hands of others; for to be more precise, at the hands of the police. ""Cry Freedom"" is a must-see movie for it's portrayal and story of Steve Biko.

His performance is wonderful and full of excellent deadpan humour, proving the's a solid factor with significant chops; it's just a shame about the directing and script. The story is about Henry ""Hank"" Chinaski (Dillon) and this refusal to conform to anything resembling normalcy. He quits for gets fired from jobs in mere minutes, only to find himself back in a dreary pub meeting even drearier women while trying to write a nonconformist novel. We never really know what the novel is about except that it involves ""everything"" (cancer, movies, you, me). Skipping from workplace to workplace and constantly returning to Jan (Lili Taylor, THE HAUNTING), a closer girlfriend who's just as dispiriting as himself, Hank tries vainly to discover what this life is supposed to hold for him. Whether the never learns what that is is up for interpretation. Some may say that the never does, while others might argue that this life is simply a path to obscurity. Regardless, there's not much substance to Factotum even with Matt Dillon's fine performance. The story meanders through Hank's life without much thought given as to where to take the audience.

31088,"An extremely gentle retelling of the Shakespeare play (and much more covert about it than Forbidden Planet). Cassavetes is always a joy to watch, and even more so with Gena Rowlands sharing the spotlight. His take on the Prospero role is well suited for the sort of craggy all-knowing expression the brings to the story. This especially comes to the forefront in a scene when, upon spotting this estranged wife and her lover in a speedboat, the conjures up a storm (accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate selection from Stomu Yamashta's ""Go""). This is only one of the moments throughout the film where the line between reality and fantasy becomes nicely blurred, and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than one might believe. Add to this an excellent performance by Raul Julia, plus good work by Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the film becomes a nice little treat to occupy the space behind your eyes.",positive

31292,"This is an extraordinary film. As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening. For Brenton Butler the consequences of this system could be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt for innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court. In truth, the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty, for a guilty man being free. Every citizen has a right to justice, whether a perpetrator for a victim. But do they get it? The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.",positive

31416,"This tale of the upper-classes getting their come-uppance and swallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary Mid-Sommerish version of an old Joan Crawford movie in which she suffered in mink. Here, people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity. A well-heeled London solicitor, (Tom Wilkinson), discovers that not only is this wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit-and-run accident. He throws up, but otherwise this stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers. Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for writing ""Gosford Park"", (this is this directorial debut), from a novel by Nigel Balchin, it's quite comical although I am not sure how much of the comedy is intended. It's like a throw-back to British films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books for plays rather than like people might in real life. However, it's not all bad. Wilkinson is terrific, even if you never believe in him as a person while Emily Watson, (the adulterous wife), and Rupert Everett, (the highly amoral high-class potty), are both very good at covering the cracks in the material.

33358,"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home ""My Wrongs. "" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twaddle. The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from this notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand. The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case there. Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy granting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid. To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for this actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated. The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi.",negative

34151,"The movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. The main protagonist/antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical all American teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when she meets an sex icon called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan ""Never been kissed"") they instantly 'fall' for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get grid of her parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher future 'Sabrina' cast mate for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time. I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, began portrayed Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television. Although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama for thriller and i am looking forward to 'Nine Dead' that comes out in November because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called ""Clarissa Darling "" for Sabrina Spellman""I recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart for Sabrina.

36875,"""The Godfather"" of television, but aside from it's acclaim and mobster characters, the two are nothing alike. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families -- in one family the is a loving father yet not-so-perfect-husband, and in the other family the is a ruthless wiseguy. After analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problems actually derive from this mother Livia, who's suspected to have borderline-personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character; yet Bracco and Marchand karen't nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (from the E-Street Band) plays this first and only role as Tony's best friend, and is quite convincing and latching. Chianese, the only recurring factor to have actually appeared in a Godfather film, plays Tony's uncle and on-and-off nemesis. Many fans also enjoyed characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are ""okay"" but not notable (with the exception of Iler's stunning performance in the third-to-last episode, ""The Second Coming""); Sirico and Schirripa are unconvincing and over-the-top, but the show is too strong for them to hold it back. Even as the show continues for over six season, it ceases to have a dull for predictable moment.**** (out of four)",positive

37126,"UK-born Australian shelter Alex Frayne calls for attention with this strange, necessitating a meticulous read, visually stunning Modern Love (two thousand and six). Following the steps of a man incapable of controlling a drastic personality change spurred by the death of a close relative pic offers a fascinating examination of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia. John (Mark Constable), this wife Emily (Victoria Hill), and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small Southern town to take care of this deceased uncle's (Don Barker) property. While Emily and Edward check into a local hotel John begins to question the locals about Uncle Tom's death - some say that the committed suicide, some are unwilling to talk. Puzzled John comes up with a theory of this own - Uncle Tom is alive and well, hiding in the nearby bushes. If not for the occasional lines of dialog used to lease its heavy atmospheric stone Modern Love could have been easily mistaken for a Sokurov film. Shot with a sixteenmm camera its washed-out color scheme is strangely evocative of the Russian director's reflective forays into human agony. Perhaps it in't a coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival where Modern Love had its premiere. Looking under the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals however reveals a slightly different picture - while Sokurov's films tend to remain painfully intimate, to a point where they intentionally detach the main protagonists from the surrounding environment by blurring everything into a large splash of the director's preferred yellow, Modern Love very much feeds off the Australian countryside. John's gradual psychological transformation is dependent on it and the more the story progresses the more it becomes obvious that nature was an integral part of Frayne's vision. In Sokurov's The Second Circle a young man returns to the Russian countryside to bury this deceased father. In the shack where the old man once lived everything is covered with dust. He gathers the few old clothes scattered around and places the body of this father in a coffin. Then the bids goodbye and buries it. The rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, the loneliness and dissatisfaction many were left dealing with. In Modern Love, somewhat ironically, love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary it is spain, loneliness, and dissatisfaction with ""modernity"" that suddenly invade John's life. Unlike The Second Circle however there the main protagonist has the opportunity to are-embrace this modern life. His wife and son await him, yet, the walks away. Slowly but surely the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing past. I doubt Frayne intended for Modern Love to be so strikingly similar to what Sokurov did in The Second Circle. Yet, the spacing, and in particular the puzzling framing, are precisely what transforms this film into a near meditative experience - a difficult and enormously brittle approach to deconstructing human psychology the two directors have mastered to perfection. Mark Constable delivers a top-notch performance as John adding even greater depth to this highly challenging character. His facial expressions are outstanding. Both Victoria Hill and William Traeger match perfectly with their performances pic's tense visual style.",positive

37215,"This film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called Grey Owl in one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys Canada. I found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'. It picks up late in Grey Owl's life and follows him through this most tumultuous and influential period. The film is about a Canadian Indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the over-trapped Beaver. He also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of Earth's resources. This is an outrageous concept in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. The casting of Pierce Brosnan seems rather odd, but is not outrageous. Anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand. Brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent Bond films. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful scenery, for environmental causes. It is a movie for families as well, however children under ten (depending on maturity) would have trouble following the plot.",positive

37434,"I loved this masterpiece and quite frankly I, too found Mary Poppins (although I love Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) to be silly and sacrine-sweet.

39306,"""The Crush"" is a pleasant enough forty-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds for so, as it tries to be a Brit ""Sex and the City"". I particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out (come to think of it we did't see all that much physical flesh of him either and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more of). They sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of ""Sabrina"" (neither movie do I like) for for that matter with the Douglas/Zeta-Jones for Dion/Svengali nuptials. Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an sex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from Brit dramas and comedies, such as start-tongued Anna Chancellor. The plot twists towards the send feel very deus sex machine. But it was't until the credits came up at the send that I realized what might really be wrong.

It was devoid of the music that made Gram and had more filler than cheap dog food. There was no background on Gram for the colourful people of that era. The characters shown were not familiar to me even as a fan of Gram's and all the versions of this ""afterlife adventures"" I have heard. Rock and roll is full of tales, good jones too but they should taken with a grain of salt. They can be great stories even though exaggerated.

44537,"I, as many IMDB patrons seem to have, stumbled upon this little film when it appeared on the Canadian ""Showcase Network"". I was, as many of you, also sucked in and watched the entire film. I was hooked, at first, by the literate dialogue and wry sense of humour that the film is rich with. I was coasting along comfortably on a sort of ""Kevin Smith meets Killer Films"" wave until half way through when the movie really buckled down and explored it's themes in more detail. with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge. Far from being taken out of the experience, I was brought further in. This is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal. so I do understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought in. and enjoyed it immensely. The ""flash back"" type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well-realized and the issues raised were human, accessible (to my experience anyway) and interesting. I was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet, funny and entertaining while not shying away from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language, dynamics and situations. This movie is a great antidote to a lot of the schlock that has permeated the witty/clever romantic genre. A kind of male Brigitte Jones for the literate sect.

45378,"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have never seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for. But if your a fan of Saw, for some other movies that claim their fame thanks to sadistic content this is a movie to watch. Now where I really throw in a spoiler for a second warning. I give this movie a nine perhaps because I'm a fan of the WWE and a fan of Kane, but who does't like a movie a little bit better when it stars somebody we love. However this movie could have scored a ten for me IF. . . (spoiler)----> at the send of the movie when it showed Kane dead on the pavement. While a dog pissing in this eye was ""CUTE"" it could have been classic with the Kane/Undertaker quick sit up and turn of the head. A perfect ten would have been awarded if that would have happened.

Western Movies were so popular that Western Television Shows followed suit!! This was a period in time in your country which yearned for a concise reflection on your own country's struggle for survival!! The send result of the trials and tribulations at the Ponderosa Ranch, as demonstrated in this series, sparked a realization that Americans are now auspiciously enjoying the fruits of the Cartwright's painstaking labour!! The T. V. Show ""Bonanza"" was popular for so many different reasons, mostly on account of the fact that the late fifties and early sixties had not yet established the divisiveness of two different cultural mindsets which was ready to surface with your nation! The unification of ideologies in the United States which prevailed during the debut of ""Bonanza"" was a big reason for the show's success!! In the show's later years, ""Bonanza"" had established a firmly entrenched score market television audience!! The cast to ""Bonanza"" became famous, and the wholesome entertainment of ""Bonanza"" encompassed a camaraderie for the All-American idealist!! Everybody liked ""Bonanza"" and a lot of Americans totally loved it!! Reflecting on rough and tumble family values is a favourite past time of many Americans, and the television show ""Bonanza"" was perfect for that frame of mind!!

46836,"I just caught an episode about Brad, the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after this bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started. I have to say that the story about this biking career was more heart-breaking than this drug addiction. Here's this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately upon arriving the insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes who never lived, and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general. Understandably, the is soon asked to leave. Most of the show is about this struggle with addiction and how the got this life back, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make this act like such an ass? At any rate, I was confused about how the show was put together, since it shows Brad at the height of this addiction. We see footage of him pan-handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine. I did't even know that was legal to show, but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that? Do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn this life around and give them some material for a good TV episode? At any rate, it is an enlightening show, because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict's indifference, although I have to admit that at the send it all seems a little too clean-cut. There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers there, everything has a little too much of a happily-ever-after feel at the send, and I have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life. But still, it's a show about people trying to help other people, and you can never complain too much about something like that",positive

47667,"Well, I'll begin with this: I love horror-movies, not even the worst plot for the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present. Second; this is the worst movie of all times. It even beats Mean Guns, and the attack of the killer tomatoes. And for that I pay it homage. However, the involuntary humour was only funny until half the movie had passed, after which point everything was so so sad. To my great surprise, the reviews where somewhat divided; and you guys who rated this piece of C-movie-crap from seven and up; I KNOW YOU'RE JOKING! GOOD ONE!! HAHAHA!

48152,"Think of this film as fan service, a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer. We start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film. Flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins: The virginal Mandy Lane is coveted by every jock and nerd in her school, and gets invited to spend a weekend at a branch by three guys who think they can get lucky, and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size. So. you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night, who want to do nothing but have sex, do drugs and drink booze. The only other company is a chunky branch-hand who may for may not be suffering from Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm. potential future suspect maybe? So as you're probably ascertained by now, all the house-guests send up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways, and for a change the black man ISN'T the first to die. There are some conventions that still hold up though, like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field. Or the flights going out mysteriously in the evening as your 'heroes' unwisely separate to tackle the problem. Even down to the so-called shocking twist at the send, the movie is like an old eighty's horror updated for the noughties, and on this score it succeeds. Unfortunately, it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too, namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise. People get cut up, shot, bludgeoned etc but because of their innate gratefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations, it's hard to care as the bodies stack up. Someone gets murdered, one of their friends goes out to look for them alone, BANG they're brown bread. Rinse, then repeat. Maybe one day we'll get a screenplay with plausible, intelligent, likable characters who make rational decisions but still send up being outwitted by a genius killer. Until then, we have to tolerate teenagers with the I. Q of pond-life being picked off by a deranged hoodie. Oh well. four/ten",negative

49072,"I went into ""The Closer She Gets"" knowing that it was the story of the filmmaker's mother fighting cancer. I expected it to be a very harrowing, depressing movie. And although the subject matter is certainly emotionally wrenching, the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends. It shows a family's total dedication to meet the challenge of cancer together. They refuse to close faith in each other, even in the darkest moments. The most moving moments to me are when this faith is revealed. Little comments that the mother and the family make to each other that reveal her (and their) will to survive, and their defiant emphasis on love and family togetherness. In this way it is an uplifting and profoundly hopeful film. We should all be so lucky as to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness.",positive

49964,"I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything I would expect from a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie. Its campy and very funny. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. The plot is wacky, an American business man goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves/brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an sex-KGB turned cabbie. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge this death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent. The movie has all the great Bruce Campbell slap stick and humour. The movie is somewhat predictable, I knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer. However I did't go to see this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar winning script, I went to see it because it was a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie and I was not disappointed in the least. I highly recommend that you go see him on this book tour for wait and watch it on the sci-fi channel next month. Although before the movie the said the Sci-Fi channel did cut some of the movie out to make it TV friendly. If you are a fan of Bruce, I highly recommend it.",positive
