I can't stop playing this newer version. The first fourteen songs are recorded in Mono, then repeats in Stereo. When Paul McCartney and George Martin heard \"Pet Sounds,\" they were amazed. This Album was the Blueprint for the Classic,\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band,\"and The Beatles,\"Rubber Soul\" was the blueprint for this record. Brian Wilson was Blown away after hearing the album. He stopped touring with The Beach Boys, and just wanted to work in the studio.\"Pet Sounds\" is more of a solo record by Brian, and this partner,Tony Asher. When the single,\"Caroline No,\"came out,The Beach Boys name was't even on the record. The cut early made the top forty. No one knew who Brian Wilson was. This is my Second favourite cut from the album.\"God only Knows,\" with Carl Wilson on lead, is unreal,The vocal arangments are perfection, and its one of the first songs to have God in it. This has got to be one of the greatest records never made. My other favourite cuts are \"You still Believe in me,\"I'm Waiting for the day,\"and\" I know there's an answer. The CD comes with a thirty-one page booklet that tells you all about the recording of the album. I've been playing this CD for two weeks, and I can't get these songs out of my head at night. The Harmonies, the weird sounds,This record is a Classic.","overall":5,"summary":"&quot;Pet Sounds,&quot;The Blueprint for &quot;Sgt.Peppers.&quot;","unixReviewTime":976838400,"reviewTime":"12 15, 2000"}

This is arguably UGK's greatest album(although Dirty Money is also a classic album), and was quite a few years before UGK were first exposed to the mainstream with Hova's \"Big Pimpin'.\"Some people new to the game probably think that Bun B, who makes a guest appearance on seemingly every Southern wrapper's album, is some new cat who's trying to make waves in the underground. While I can see why they'd think this(Bun B is always hungry when the craps, leading one to believe the's trying to make an impact on the industry - despite the fact the already has made a significant one), Bun B has been in the biz for well over a decade, alongside this partner in rhyme(although, 'in crime' maybe more appropriate for Pimp C than it is for most), Pimp C. Together, they're the Underground Kingz, who identify themselves by the acronym of UGK. When they first came into the game, the South was obscure; now that it's blown up(especially their native land of Texas), one would think that UGK would get better publicity. Unfortunately the Kingz' publicity still does't compare to their skills, and only true heads have been table to check out their undeniably dope music. Hailing from Port Author, they may not be Houstonians, but they still possess the love of flossing', and grinding', as well as slow hypnotic beats, and equally entrancing flows. On Ridin' Dirty, UGK provide one of the most revered music to never come from the South; and for good reason. While one may criticise them for their admittedly limited subject matter(whips, drips, chips, tips, and tricks), they deliver their craps with so much finesse, and style that you can't help but overlook these issues. No matter how much these things are wrapped about, UGK always provide an interesting take on them, complete with captivating rhymes, and superb flows. Their production? Just as bomber, yet hypnotic as their flows. Highlights? I'd say this album has gems, but in all honesty, it's a complete gold mine. Every single track on this album is a five-star cut, and even the outdo has a dope enough beat to warrant it that label, despite the fact it's all shout-outs. Whether it's the smoothed out, Isley-sampled \"One Day,\" the gritty \"Murder,\" the Southern anthem \"Diamonds & Wood,\" for the impressive showing of wordplay on \"Touched\"(which Jay-Z lifted a verse from on \"ninety-nine Problems\"), this album has something for every ship-hop head. If you're a fan of Southern wrap, then you need this album; if you're a detractor of Southern wrap, you also need to this album to show you just how great it is. If you're a head who in't prejudices to coasts for regions, this album will have constant rotation, and you too will be table to appreciate the dopeness that is UGK.","overall":5,"summary":"Southern classic.","unixReviewTime":1161648000,"reviewTime":"10 24, 2006"}

I, along with a legion of long-time fans, grieved the loss of this incredible singer and performer. Initially, this death at that particular time in this career seemed terribly unfair. After stagnating during the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys and early one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, Orbison was back and perhaps even better than never in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. His collaboration with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, George Harrison, and Jeff Lynne in the form of The Traveling Wilburys had put him back in the national spotlight, and many of us longed for the new album soon to be released, an album we had heard nothing but incredibly good things about. Then, suddenly, the and the voice that touched your hearts for so many years, was gone. We, the fans, should have been rewarding Roy Orbison for all of the memories the gave us in song, yet, never the selfless and humble man the was, Orbison actually presented all of us with a final, precious gift in the form of the album Mystery Girl. Roy's widow Barbara deserves your heartfelt thanks for bravely putting the finishing touches on this album after her husband's death. Mystery Girl is simply an incredible album featuring a reenergize Roy Orbison easily uniting this unique voice to a modern sound that appealed to any number of years; the released tracks from this album found sample playing time on both pop rock and country radio stations. Perhaps the first single, You Got It, got too much attention, as it was nearly played to death over the course of the first half of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, but that is just a tribute to the wonderful beauty and infectious beat and rhythm of this song co-written by Orbison and Wilbury buddies Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty. The second track on the album, In the Real World, marks an abrupt change in stone; bringing to mind Roy's classic song In Dreams; Orbison captures your heard on the first note and soars with it through the clouds that only the possessed the means of exploring. This haunting track is, in my opinion, the best song on the album. Roy decides to rock a little bit on (All I Can Do Is) Dream You before stopping to wax poetic and heartbreaking on the slow ballad A Love So Beautiful, a song featuring a little musical support from co-writer Jeff Lynne and George Harrison. California Blue (another Orbison-Lynne-Petty venture), The Only One, and Windsurfer are great songs in their own right, but special attention must be shown the remaining three tracks. Careless Heart is a beautiful song of love and loss that seems to convey a sense of the type of feelings we felt over the loss of this man taken much too soon from your midst. She's a Mystery To Me, written by Utwo's Bono and The Edge, presents Roy with a slightly different type of song that the easily makes this own, hitting the high notes perfectly on the choruses. Then there is The Comedians, a song written by Elvis Costello; this is vintage Roy Orbison, delivering a strikingly visual display of betrayal and loss, the very subjects Roy seemed to understand more than any other singer out there. Mystery Girl is a very special album that Roy Orbison fans will treasure and play often for the rest of your lives. I wish Roy would have lived to see the incredible reception this album received from fans, but one can take comfort in the fact that Orbison left this world on top where the always belonged.","overall":5,"summary":"A final, precious gift from Roy to his fans","unixReviewTime":1055376000,"reviewTime":"06 12, 2003"}

I can remember hearing After seven on the radio as a small child. I liked their music even then, but, of course, I did't appreciate it then as much as I do now, since I'm an adult and understand the lyrics. This is a remarkable album. Kevon Edmonds has a beautiful singing voice.\"Can't Stop\", \"Ready for Not\" and \"Heat of the Moment\" were all released to radio and received a great amount of airplay and there is no wonder why: these songs define real R&B.; All the ingredients of a good R&B; song are incorporated there; well-produced, memorable lyrics and chorus, and actual SINGING. \"Can't Stop\" is easily the best song on this album. The melody on the chorus is brilliant! The way the instruments blend with the singing is a stroke of genius. You know what? This song is worth the price of the album alone. \"\"Ready for Not\" is another great song. The men of After seven slow it down with this sexy ballad. Certainly, these lyrics are one hundred% unrealistic, (seriously, who can really give someone the moon, sun and stars? Lol), but music is not always supposed to be taken literally. \"Sayonara\" is a typical break-up song. Though it is enjoyable, it's not their best work. If you liked what you heard from After seven on the radio, surely you will enjoy their self-titled album. This album will be played in my CD player for time indefinite! Pick it up!

In jazz, tenor sax trios are fairly rare. Here, Ray Brown on bass and Shelly Manne on drums help Sonny out by delivering this swinging session. Obviously, the theme of this album was westerns. The old western standard I'm an Old Cowhand, is done there by Newk and the gang. Rollins' original Wagon Wheels is very catchy.

After one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four's Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, Big Boi and Andre decided that for their next record, they would change their sound. And that exactly what ATLiens did when it dropped in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six. At the time of its release, some people were wondering if this was the same group that put out \"Player's Ball\" in 'ninety-four. With ATLiens, Outkast decided to move away from the southern pimp style of their debut, and focus more on their lyrical ability. And needless to say, they pulled it off nicely. Featuring production from both Organized Noize and Earthtone Ideas (Outkast's own production team), ATLiens shows Big Boi and Dre were't your typical southern wrappers. From Elevators (Me and You) to Jazzy Belle, and thirteenth Floor\/Growing Old and other classic tracks, Outkast dealt with subject matter on this album that at the time, no other wrap group had dealt with. Although Outkast would extend their musical ideas further with their next album, Aquemini, ATLiens remains Outkast's magnum opus. Definitely a must-have album for all true ship shop heads.","overall":5,"summary":"The definite Outkast album","unixReviewTime":1301702400,"reviewTime":"04 2, 2011"}

But you know, you gotta mellow out sometimes, and that's why I listen to Elton. (Hell, even Axl Rose admitted to being a big fan of this). Now my man Reg Dwight's been taking a lot of abuse lately, mainly because the's gay (which has got to be the stupidest reason I can think of to criticize a musician). If you're looking to miss the guy just because of that, take it up with him. But I warn you - the's rich. He's probably got ninja bodyguards. All joking aside, EJ rules. He's capable of writing the perfect pop song, and they, that piano! He's awesome with piano! Gotta love this voice, too. In other words, very talented man. I'm not a big fan of Bernie Taupin, but they, Elton's great. This is not the perfect compilation of this work - I'd have liked to see some songs from Madman Across the Water (like the hits Tiny Dancer and Levon), and I don't like Bennie and the Jets. Song just bugs me. Good news is, that's the only bad song there: this has my favourite all-time EJ song (Crocodile Rock, which is the ultimate feel-good tune - come on, how can you NOT like it? It's not possible! I mean, I have heard one person criticize it, but the had the rough intelligence of a cinderblock), as well as several other great jones, mostly ballads like Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Your Song (simply the perfect pop song), Candle in the Wind, Daniel, Rocket Man, and Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me. Then there are the cool stylistic experiments like the gospelly Border Song (Holy Moses) (off this self-titled second, which I recommend - it's the one with Your Song on it), and the New Orleans-sounding Honky Cat. And who says EJ can't rock? Throw on Saturday Night's All Right (for Fighting) and see if you still think that way. A couple of Elton's studio LP's are really good too - I'd go with self-titled, Madman Across the Water and Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player. Those just starting out with him should start her.e","overall":4,"summary":"Yeah, I said I liked Elton John, you got a problem with that?","unixReviewTime":1182297600,"reviewTime":"06 20, 2007"}

For instance, \"MATW\"'s two opening tracks, \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Levon\", both display a vibrant orchestral fluidity (especially the latter selection), as well as a unique, melancholic autobiographical charm (moreso prevalent in \"Levon\"). \"Tiny Dancer\" was written about Taupin's girlfriend at the time, a dancer named Maxine Feibelman. What makes \"Madman. \" a musician's clinic, are the percussive guitar and mandolin skills, which are craftfully provided by the likes of drummer Roger Pope and axeman extraordinaire Davey Johnstone - whose talents on the mandolin are quite exceptional on the road-heavy \"Holiday Inn\". Johnstone would become a full-fledged member of The Elton John Band by the time EJ's next LP, \"Honky Chateau\", was released the following year in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. Adding to this standout array of musicianship, is guest Rick Wakeman, whose playing on a majority of \"MATW\"'s tracks is sometimes barely audible, and on selections such as \"Razor Face\", the pulls it off in spades. Wakeman would soon leave the Strawbs and join Yes after working on this album. Also introduced to the band are bassist Dee Murray and drummer Nigel Olsson, both of whom appear on one track, the impeccably overwrought \"All The Nasties\". Both Murray and Olsson would become prime-time EJ Band members also by the release of \"Honky Chateau\". The CD's title track is sure to give even the most casual Elton John fan \"suspensful down your spine chills and thrills\", courtesy of \"Madman's. \" intense lyrical and orchestral vinegar. EJ and BT both paint a rich, textured Native American cultural landscape and soundscape in \"Indian Sunset\", as if they realistically transported themselves back in time and dweller amongst the natives (not bad for a couple of Brits, would't you say?). The lyrics of \"Rotten Peaches\" would focus on the sad sack trial and tribulation nature found in a majority of Elton's and Bernie's musical and lyrical compositions in future albums as well. For these two songbirds, that is a very good thing, for fans of these two compositional wonders would't have it any other way, including yours truly. \"Goodbye\" is a fitting send to the CD's macabre, storybook-like novella. \"Madman Across The Water\" is an absolute must for all die-hard Eltonians to have in their CD collection(s). Aren't you just \"dying\" to have this title in your Elton John library right about now?","overall":5,"summary":"The Elton John-Bernie Taupin Connection","unixReviewTime":1004745600,"reviewTime":"11 3, 2001"}

The album hit the top spot on the strength of its two hit singles, Honky Cat and Rocket Man. But the album goes beyond those two classics and reveals some hidden gems. The lost innocence of the beautiful Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters is heartfelt. It's a classic Elton tune, and it found new life when Elton sang it at The Concert For New York in October of two thousand and one. After that, the performed at every show the did. The rockers Hercules and Amy both pay tribute the classic 'fiftys' rock sound Elton grew up on. The steamy, slow and provocative feel of Slave is Elton's emotionally-driven best. Mellow is another midtempo song, done with Elton's trademark style. Suzie(Dramas) is another midtempo song, with nice piano from Elton. And I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself is a nice look at Bernie Taupin's dark side. The album is also the first to feature Nigel Olsson, Dee Murray and Davey Johnstone as full-time band members. All three had played on Madman Across The Water but Johnstone only played on three tracks, and Olsson and Murray played on just one, thoughthey sang backup vocals on Tiny Dancer. On songs like Rocket Man and Slave, Murray steals the show with some fine bass playing, and Olsson's drum playing steals the show on several tracks. This is a must-own for any fan of Elton John.","overall":5,"summary":"Elton's first number one album","unixReviewTime":1038614400,"reviewTime":"11 30, 2002"}

Even though those were good albums and raised the game up for its time - Nothing has made a more serious change to the wrap game then this album there. But you know why this album is special? Because it can't be copied. No other draper has tried to in ANY way reproduce\/copy\/expand anything in this album. Because they can't. Not even Nas, Jay-Z, Eminem. no wrapper can even reach this level that this album stands on. People often refer to this album as \"its own pedistool\" - it's just ranked in its own league, and it will always be there. Heres a few reasons why, in my opinion:one. This is the best production I have never heard in any wrap album. Period. Not even Dre could come close to something like this. The beats are raw - not overlay done - not overlay mastered and cloud - and are just. raw. Hard. Eerie. Spooky. (Bomb First, Hail Mary, Life of an Outlaw, Against all Odds)two. The lyrics are just awesome. Imagine \"Illmatic\" but at a whole new different level. The metaphors in this album are just incredible (Me and my Girlfriend, Blasphemy). There intense, angry, and poetic at the same time. Makaveli in this first track, your-right calls out wrappers. Saying they are phoney, and just need to leave the wrap game before the puts them out. This man had honestly no fear. He would go at anyone - they were all fake in this eyes.three. Like I said earlier in my review - nothing in this album can be reproduced. I have yet to hear any other wrapper try to put out something this deep. Oh sure. there are some pretty intelligent wrappers out there - but they are not emotionally deep like Pac was. This album was (and probably still is) WAY beyond its time. It was beyond it time for twopac, and beyond it time for ship-hop in general. It's not a popular album. Its not a commercialised album either - Because this is an album that is way ahead of that. It's a personal album, that you have to listen to.","overall":5,"summary":"Best hip-hop album, ever.

In a few months everybody would have forgotten about Offspring, but Simon and Garfunkel will continue to be rock immortals. With this album S&G went out with a bang. Almost every track is timeless. The only low point is the inclusion of a live version of Bye Bye Love, the only non-original song on the album. It is interesting to note that the cover of the original vinyl version did not include the lyrics to this song (they were added once the copyright hassles were overcome).

Drawn from this classic albums Songs Of Leonard Cohen, Songs From A Room, Songs Of Love And Hate and New Skin For The Old Ceremony, these timeless songs have become part of the serious poetic heritage of the English language. I have no favourites there because each and every track is sublime, from the wistful Suzanne to the caching Take This Longing. From the album Songs Of Love and Hate I would have chosen Joan Of Arc, though, instead of Last Year's Man and would also have included The Old Revolution and Tonight Will Be Fine from Songs From A Room. The impact of these timeless songs on popular culture is proved by the many cover versions, of which a few of the best include Rita Coolidge's Bird On A Wire plus The Lilac Time's and the Neville Brothers' version of the same song, Sting & The Chieftains' Sisters Of Mercy, James' cover of So Long Marianne, Geoffrey Oryema, Judy Collins and Nina Simone's very diverse interpretations of Suzanne, and Peter Astor's Take This Longing. Cohen completists would also be interested in The Essential Collection, but note that album does not include Lady Midnight for Last Year's Man. What I found especially impressive on listening to this album again, were the brilliant arrangements and especially the siren-like quality of the female vocals so perfectly framing Cohen's weary voice. These songs just sound better and better as the decades pass.","overall":5,"summary":"Early Gems","unixReviewTime":1118361600,"reviewTime":"06 10, 2005"}

Artists gave each song their full attention and talent, and that's why artists could get so many hit singles off of each album. Michael Jackson took that to an extreme with this album Thriller, which is the bestselling album of all time. The recognition it got was amazing. eight Grammy Awards. seven Top Ten singles. MTV has even picked Michael Jackson's Thriller video as the best video of all time at some point for another. This CD was more than just great music: it revolutionized everything. Beat It will probably be remembered most. There was a guitar solo by Eddie Van Halen in the song, and in the video Michael brought two real life street gangs together for a huge dance scene. The song Thriller revolutionized videos. While the song itself was't as huge as others, the video stood out. It was seventeen+ minutes of special effects, dance scenes and good old campy horror fun. Michael turned into both a zombie and a werewolf in the video, and it is safe to say this video changed the music video industry forever. After it there were no more clips of artists singing onstage in microphones. More special effects and dance sequences were brought in. Billie Jean is another album masterpiece with another great video. One of my personal favourites is Track #one, Wanna Be Startin Something, which has infectious opening that will be stuck in your head for a very long time. The duet The Girl Is Mine probably inspired Brandy & Monica's song The Boy Is Mine, and is a great song that is both humorous and serious at the same time. This song does't get a lot of recognition as being one of this best, but it actually made it to No.two on the charts. Even the two non top ten singles are exceptionally good. This album is the best in history. Period. Michael Jackson has revolutionized so much and created a lot of controversy. This artist is perhaps one of the best of all time. If you don't have this album now you have to buy it period. It's an American classic and most likely this records will never be touched.","overall":5,"summary":"Awesome!

Though the band had released a self-titled EP in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two, \"All Over The Place\" was the first true flowering of the band's genius. \"Hero Takes A Fall\" was the big hit (even garnering rotation on MTV), but the album is chock full of great songs, tight playing and outstanding vocals by all of the ladies.\"Going Down To Liverpool\", \"Live\", \"James\" and \"He's Got A Secret\" are my personal faves, but the real crown jewel there is the closer, \"More Than Meets The Eye\" featuring the Peterson Sisters (Vicki and Debbie) harmonizing like angels from heaven on a ballad that could have been a syrupy disaster in someone else's hands, but these ladies transform it into a mini-masterpiece. Over an achingly gorgeous string arrangement and the simple plucking of an acoustic guitar, the women using in beautiful unison and close the album on a somewhat melancholy but effective note, you simply won't forget the sound of Vicki picking out a simple melody while the strings sigh and cry over her, and then the album is over. If you like the feeling you get when you listen to a Beatles album from start to finish, then this debut from the leaders of The Paisley Underground will more than satisfy.

I know that I can say that now as listening to this wonderful mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of the album I can tell that this is inspired stuff. This album would be a hit if it were released today and that tells me that Michael's work on this album has inspired many a current musician's sound even to this day. By virtually filling up all the space on this cd you know you are getting value for money and I find that the tracks actually have a great flow to them. This album has aged very well for me and sounds fresh and a whole lot more enjoyable to me today than it did the first time I heard it when it first came out. This maps version is a treat for fans as it has an excellently remastered sound quality and the maps design is one of the best that I've seen coming in very good quality cardboard and assembly. There is also a twenty-two page glossy colour booklet with all the lyrics plus photos of Michael with the Thai dancers from the \"Black Or White\" video and with Eddie Murphy and Iman from the \"Remember the Time\" video as well as another sixteen page black and white booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese. It's like I'm listening to a whole new album and I can see this one eventually taking over from \"Bad\" as my all-time favourite Michael Jackson album. This maps version of \"Dangerous\" is probably the best version of the album that is currently out there and is certainly worth the upgrade even if just for the beautiful maps design in itself. Great maps design, great sound quality and excellent content that has aged very well makes this version of \"Dangerous\" very highly recommended!","overall":5,"summary":"Ahead Of It's Time, Brilliant Jackson Album Has Just Gotten Even Better!","unixReviewTime":1250985600,"reviewTime":"08 23, 2009"}

In the course of this life the released exactly one album; it could have been the first of a stunning catalogue, and there's no telling what the might have done if the than't drowned in a boating accident. Oh sure, there are a couple other releases to give some hints; a live album for two, one compilation of unreleased tracks-in-progress, and one disc of assorted early demos. (I guess the never made quite the same posthumous-productivity deal with the devil that Jimi Hendrix did.) But this is the only finished product we have to listen to, and as much of a treasure as it is, to me it seems simply a warmup for some future masterpiece we'll never hear. Grace is hard to describe easily. At heart it's basically rock and roll, but. it's rock with one foot in the blues, one foot in the folk tradition, its hands reaching out to space and its voice in the heavens. Ahhhh. Jeff does things with this vocal cords that seem to push the boundaries of what's humanly possible. It's undeniably distinct from the first time the eerie wails of \"Mojo Pin\" slowly bloom into existence, eventually giving way to a slow-burning verse full of raw emotion. His high register may take some getting used to, but Jeff's singing does tricks and turns I've rarely heard from anyone. reaching its speak midway through the album in the lonely desolation of this most well-known cover, \"Hallelujah.\"Like many others, I'm particularly partial to that one. (Hey: if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best, and lyricists don't come better than Leonard Cohen.) This track best demonstrates just how special this talent was - with just a guitar and voice the pours this entire heart out for the world to hear, managing to sound soul-weary, powerfully spirited and nervously frail all at once. I could easily imagine the wistful \"Lilac Wine\" being an exceptional standout ballad on an album from anyone else, but there it has to take second place. Even the half-cliched lyric of \"Lover, You Should've Come Over\" sounds nothing but compelling just due to Jeff's soul-baring vocal performance. Incidentally, that tune has one of the most fitting uses of an morgan I've heard in a rock song; it starts with a creepy Phantom-of-the-Opera stone, but mellows out into something that sounds almost like an accordion. Perfect. Only four stars, then? Well, as much as I'm tempted to give a perfect rating because so much of Grace still blows me away (and considering the special rating usually reserved for talented artists who die young), I still can't call this one perfect. \"So Real\" drags with repetition at times, and the degree of contrast between the whisper-quiet verse and the crashing drum-filled chorus can grate on my nerves. \"Corpus Christi Carol\" is too much like a church hymn for my taste. (Go figure, meh?)Jeff and crew liven things up now and then amid all the easy-paced ballads. \"Last Goodbye\" is surprisingly sunny, jogging along with a bouncy beat and a happy string arrangement, though the major-keyed melody in't enough to hide the sadness in the words. \"Eternal Life\" can be a downer, but it's a downer with a lot of lively singing, mad kicking drums and some killer guitar hooks. True to form, it slides into something slower and almost spooky with \"Dream Brother.\" Like the rest of the disc, that one leaves me with an unshakable sense of something almost foreboding, yet hopeful in the middle of it all. There's something otherworldly about it all. OK, looks like I've been long-winded enough.

Having purged himself of this heroin habit that had so negatively effected this playing, the had assembled from the ashes of this first great quintet a working band that was capable of flexing with him, the was a year since this first collaborative big band effort with Gil Evans that was such an artistic triumph and this first true masterpiece (\"Miles Ahead\"), and the was a year away from this second, this time in a small group setting (\"Kind of Blue\"). It is into this that the and Gil Evans reconvened for a big band session of material from Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\". While it is the weakest of the three principle albums the pair did together, it is still a fine record filled with extraordinary material, and certainly for a lesser artist, would have been the highlight of their career. The big band, similar in formation to \"Miles Ahead\" (twelve brass, four breeds bass and drums), performed shifting backing tracks, adding color, texture and mood in a fashion only Evans was table to capture, on top of which Davis would solo, largely on flugelhorn. Perhaps moreno than \"Miles Ahead\", the backing on these sessions is full of subtlety and cleverness, and in virtuosity on its own, Miles' own soloing is remarkably overshadowed at times, in particular by Philly Joe Jones' inimitable brilliant drumming on \"Gone\" (which also has a brilliant and nearly inaudible bass clarinet line) and Bill Barber's monster tuba playing on several tracks (\"Buzzard Song\", \"Bess, You Is My Woman Now\"). Mind you, this in't to say Miles in't totally absorbed by and feeding back into the music-- Evans is remarkably inspiring to Davis, and this playing is unbelievable nearly throughout, passionate and punctuated on \"Gone, Gone, Gone\", speechlike and completely invested on \"Prayer (Oh Doctor Jesus)\" (conceivably one of the most powerful solos Davis never took), melancholy and nearly overpowering on \"My Man's Gone Now\", and just completely enjoyable on \"There's a Boat Leaving Soon From New York\". If all of this was't quite enough, the album ranks in perhaps the best version of the seemingly endlessly performed \"Summertime\"-- Davis is light, bouncy, excited, and yet with that sense of haunting that is so hard to capture as the solos on trumpet. The remaster gives nice, crisp sound, good balance between instruments, and a handful of bonus tracks that provide for interesting listening. Still, for all this, the album in't quite the perfection of \"Miles Ahead\" for \"Sketches of Spain\"-- I'm not sure what it is, it could be that I just don't like \"Fishermen, Strawberry and Devil Crab\", for it could be something else, but there's a bit missing. But even with this caveat, this is a really wonderful recording, and certainly has a good place in everyone's collection. Recommended.","overall":4,"summary":"The weakest Miles & Gil still yields high.","unixReviewTime":1119830400,"reviewTime":"06 27, 2005"}

The production team of Gamble and Huff may not get the acclaim they deserve today, but they were one of the very best of the era, and \"Back Stabbers\" shows why. Too many producers use the studio merely to \"sweeten\" an artist's sound, removing any rough edges in the hope of producing something palatable to the general listener. The O'Jays and Gamble and Huff were not afraid of playing plenty of sounds on top of the band's gritty vocals, but the goal was always to make the sound more rich and interesting. A good case in point is \"nine hundred and ninety-two Arguments,\" which spices excellent lead singing with soaring backup vocals, strings, slightly jazzy vibes and tasty guitar clicks. As the song slowly moves out, the band's vocals slowly dissolve into the swirl of instrumentation. It's a beautifully crafted pop tune. The O'Jays were masters of soul balladry, as \"Listen to the Clock on the Wall\" demonstrates. Again, the care taken in production is evidenced by the song's opening notes, when the bass slowly tolls a repetitive pattern -- the clock sticking on the wall. The chant-like opening chorus gives way to the heartfelt vocal -- like the best soul singing, the sentiments are simple, but the absolute conviction of the vocal elevates the tune far beyond mere sentiment. And, of course, a few hits are thrown in, including the marvellously cynical title cut, the rock-influenced \"For the Love of Money,\" and the bright \"Love Train.\"If the album contains any missteps in the vocals for the productions that encase them, they are hard to find. Far from dated, \"Back Stabbers\" shows that the soul masters of the 'seventys created music that has easily endured the test of time.","overall":5,"summary":"Superb production","unixReviewTime":1110499200,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2005"}

The Stooges were known as the midwest version of The Doors during their first run through a self-titled debut (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) and Fun House (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy), before imploding due to many demons found outside the band's home of Ann Arbor, Michigan. David Bowie's MainMan Management signed the group, which was initially down to Iggy Pop and new guitarist James Williamson. The duo eventually added former Stooges Ron Asheton (switching from guitar to bass) and Scott Asheton (drums). Produced by Pop, this initial mix was deemed inferior by MainMan and - under the threat that the album was not going to be released - agreed to have Bowie remix seven of the weight tracks (Pop's \"Search and Destroy\" remained), which was done in one day. The original Pop mix has been released (\"Rough Power\"), along with this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven remix, but the fast work by Bowie to salvage the project is superior. Though marred by technical difficulties, the October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three gig in Atlanta, Georgia, features a motivated Pop and Ron Asheton proving beyond any doubt that the was one of the best bassists during this wild decade for rock music. That the tape languished in a vault and not cleaned up through studio overdubs is an incredible upside, since there is minimal quality recordings which capture The Stooges in their performance part glory. An outtake from the \"Raw Power\" sessions - the cool jam \"Doojiman\" - and a rehearsal of \"Head On\" conclude this second disc. That it took a small, but determined fan base to keep this album available is a testament to a time long ago; that it stands the test of time speaks loudly that those voices knew what they were talking about.","overall":5,"summary":"Down on the Street","unixReviewTime":1284249600,"reviewTime":"09 12, 2010"}

But \"Nebraska\" had something this album does't--the former was spontaneous and unexpected, while \"Tom Joad\" was planned and anticipated. \"Nebraska\" was perhaps most effective because it followed the success of this mainstream hits like \"Born To Run\" and \"The River,\" and its strictly vocal\/acoustic\/harmonica approach made it brilliantly different from Springsteen's previous chart-toppers. And that's where \"The Ghost Of Tom Joad\" fails; it simply cannot be viewed as genius as \"Nebraska,\" because the public was ready for it, and already knew the power that the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two album spawned. Aside from that, this album surely in't a disappointment; it is stark, bold, and magnificently eerie, despite the slightly expanded instrumentation (at least when compared to the bare form of \"Nebraska\").

This one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three debut let people know who she was (people seemed to forget about her singing backup for Michael Jackson). My father always played this album when it came out, and at the time I really was't into anything that was't wrap for R&B, so I pretended that I was't into any of these songs. But this album is really good. Sheryl's self-titled follow-up album did all right; then her third album The Globe Sessions fell to mixed reviews. Then came her live album and then C'mon, C'mon (that is also a very good album). But this album showcases one of the few occasions where it's okay to keep living in the past. It's very hard not to enjoy storytelling jewels like \"No One Said It Would Be Easy\" and \"Run, Baby, Run\", and the mellow proposal \"Strong Enough\". Other jams are the funky \"Solidify\" and \"All I Wanna Do\". And don't you remember how you were singing along whenever \"Can't Cry Anymore\" came on? Sheryl's style, vocals, and guitar-playing along with the lyrics are what make this CD a winner.

The album was initially released as a holdover until the band's next studio album would be released later that year (the classic Hotel California) but this Eagles Greatest Hits would sell so consistently that it would hit #one immediately on the US Billboard Album Chart and stayed there for five weeks. Plus, the album would get the first Platinum album award just introduced earlier in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six by the RIAA for a over a million copies sold and to date is the best selling album of all time there in the US alone with over twenty-nine million copies sold. It overtook Michael Jackson's Thriller in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine as US album sales champ and it is because The Eagles were mainly about the music whilst the late Michael Jackson's personal and legal troubles would cost him from popularity in the US and blacklisted\/tarnished (until this suicide in June of two thousand and nine boosted this dead album sales as the was in debt and past this prime) whilst The Eagles continue to thrive, even now in two thousand and eleven. Back to this Greatest Hits (which I've owned on eight-track, LP, cassette, CD and (the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine) remastered CD, the album consists of ten tracks from the band's first four studio albums. The one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two self-titled debut is represented by the Top twenty hits \"Take it Easy\" (reached #thirteen), \"Witchy Woman\" (which hit #nine) and \"Peaceful Easy Feeling\" (which hit the Top thirty).one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three's Desperado is represented by its title cut (a classic album cut that is great despite the fact it was int never a hit) and \"Tequila Sunrise\" (a song which tanked on the singles chart), both classics.one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four's On the Border is represented by the rocker \"Already Gone\" (the Top forty hit from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four) and the band's first #one single \"Best of My Love\".one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five's chart-topper One of These Nights is represented by the #one funk-laced title cut and the Top five smashes being the country tinged \"Lyin' Eyes\" and the ballad \"Take it To the Limit\". Drummer Don Henley, guitarist Glenn Frey, guitarist Bernie Leadon and bass player Randy Meisner plus late arrival guitarist Don Felder on these highlights from The Eagles' first four albums created timeless classics that are still getting airplay on classic rock and\/or album rock radio plus again new fans today. This Greatest Hits album is proof on that some Greatest Hits albums did get the job done right. Their Greatest Hits one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one-seventy-five is a great greatest hits and a good overview to the band's early work but if you want to go for the throat get two thousand and three's Very Best of The Eagles two-disc set for a superb Eagles overview (which includes this and Greatest Hits Volume two plus album tracks and singles from their one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four reunion to two thousand and three).

While the still cuts quite a raucous swath through the material with this electrical accompaniment, the lyrics, once dreamy and intensely introspective, are showing much more flagrant concern with social issues and the contemporary political scene. So, while the opens the song cycle with an amusing take called \"Lawyers In Love', the reminds us with a number of the lyrics in the song that the may use this irony to try to say a few things between the lines. And increasingly, with each song as the cycle progresses, the comes farther and farther along the road of doing so, so that in \"Cut It Away\", the's describing the illusions the is being disabused of with the break-up of this romantic relationship, while in the next song, \"Downtown\", the is talking about the differences among different kinds of people sharing physical proximity in an urban setting. So too, in \"Tender Is The Night\", the mixes romantic overtones with undertones reflecting the nature of living in an urban landscape. Finally, though, the gets to the crux to the matter, for the uses \"Say It Isn't True\" to admit this horror in thinking about the reality of what human nature seems to be (with the haunting refrain of \"yet there always has been\/and always will be war' echoing throughout the song). This is indeed a song one must listen closely to, one that has a lot of verve and relevance even now, after the arms race has subsided, for the threat of nuclear has not been erased. This is one of the major milestones in Browne's continuing evolution toward maturity, and while the has made a number of detours back into more personal ruminations in albums such as the celebrated \"Alive\", which chronicles this infamous break-up with Darryl Hannah, the keeps returning to concerns with social political, and philosophical issues.

It contains music made by a group of some of the best minds in Jazz: Ornette Coleman, Eric Dolphy, Freddy Hubbard, Charlie Haden, Ed Blackwell, Scott La Faro, Billy Higgins and Don Cherry. The music is actually composed - though not in the traditional sense of the word. The order of the soloists is clear. The bridge is repeated between every solo, the rhythm is coherent. There is an emotional continuity throughout the whole CD. What makes the music there so special is the interplay between the musicians, the way each of them supports and adds behinds each solo. When you hear Dolphy's Bass Clarinet laughing in the background it has to make you smile. The joy that the musicians must have felt while recording the music is heard beautifully.

Of course, if you are a fan, then you probably already have heard this album a thousand times and agree with me, but if you are the latter, you will be surprised at how intense and how artistic this album is. Up until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine Phil dominated both TV and radio airwaves with this suave and cool music videos and songs, ranging from the sweet rock coolness of In The Air Tonight to the bubbly pop of Two Hearts. But Seriously gave Phil a new credibility. Here the is more than just that, the is a perfectionist artist. The first single showed, for the first time, Phil Collins singing a different tune from this past hits, a song about the poor and homeless, Another Day In Paradise. The song became a worldwide anthem that year sparking repeated airplay and learning the grammy for best song. For many, this song is the highlight of the album. But in truth, its just one of a lot of highlights. Actually, the entire album was the highlight of the moment. The maturity of That's Just The Way It Is, Father To Son, and All Of My Life can easily cast over Another Day In Paradise. The sweet love ballad Do You Remember?, which appears in the soundtrack of Nicholas Cage's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety bomb Fire Birds, is deliciously good. The chilling rock epic I Wish It Would Rain Down that features guitar work from Eric Clapton dawns as a remarkable highlight on the album. Colors follows in the theme of Another Day In Paradise as a moment to give a thought to the poor and homeless. The album's closer Find A Way To My Heart, another track that was featured in the soundtrack to the Nicholas Cage flop Fire Birds, is an excellent pick for the closing of such a genuine album. The song opens up with some really cool electronic sounds and then slowly escalates and progresses into one big bang of a song. Phil Collins still is around today, still making music but nothing as good as But Seriously. You might still think this earlier stuff from the early eighty's was amazing, but seriously, this is Phil Collins' best album!

It's maybe Tori's best lyrically! Tori branches out and uses the Bosendorfer instead of the piano. It's very interesting the creativity in her music on this album.'Pele' offers us eighteen songs, all captivating and unique. I did't know about Tori until about three years ago so I bought all her previous albums at once. thing is, this used to be my least favourite. I gave it ONE listen (stupid, I know) and I was so wrapped up in 'Little Earthquakes' and 'From the Choirgirl Hotel' that I never picked it up again. Until earlier this year and I discovered how amazingly beautiful and harsh this album really is. The album opens with the short \"intro\" 'Beauty Queen', showcasing Tori's vocal range and depth. 'Horses' is beautifully written, it's a slower song and sucks you in to the rest of the album. 'Blood Roses' is lyrically my favourite. It is absolutely different and Tori's vocals are amazing: 'I shaved every place where you've been boy' - pooh. 'Father Lucifer' is another slower song featuring some controversial lyrics. 'Professional Widow' - what to say about this - everyone knows 'Widow', it's a downright raw emotional song that is perfect for after the breakup. Get your danger out. 'Mr. Zebra' is a short, sweet sounding song but I haven't actually grasped the true meaning of it. yet. 'Marianne' is slow, a tragic sounding song. 'Caught A Lite Sneeze' is absolute brilliance! Her voice will capture you 'beauty, stumbling down, did't know your love was so small, could't stand at all, Mr. St. John just bring your son'. 'Muhammad My Friend' has always been a favourite of mine, it's beautiful lyrically and pleasant musically. This one tells a story unlike any other. 'Hey Jupiter' is probably one of the best songs I've heard in years. It's gorgeous and this song could ONLY be done by Tori, nobody can match her vocals. No one. 'Way Down' is another short song like 'Mr. Zebra', nothing bad there. 'Little Amsterdam' is another one of my favourites, her voice again 'Mama, it was't my bullet' her presence is felt through her voice and lyrics. Chills! 'Talula' has got this crazy Harpsichord going on, very strange musically but nothing blacks lyrically. 'Not The Red Baron' is a quiet, slow song and tragic, when Tori sings 'just another pilot down' - it sends chills down your tickling spine. 'Agent Orange' is a weird song, I must confess. It's a short song, again but unique and fun to listen to. 'Doughnut Song' is ridiculously good. These are the kind of songs you get warmth from and you just want to tell the world about it. 'In The Springtime of this Voodoo' is fun to listen to, it's upbeat and extremely different. 'Putting The Damage On' is like 'Doughnut Song' - it's beautiful but this one is more tragic, 'boy you still look pretty when you're putting the damage on' . pooh. Lastly, 'Twinkle' a nice song and the perfect ending to a great, powerful and music breaking record. Tori Amos has become my favourite female performer, she's the most talented woman on this planet and I've loved everything she's done. Don't put this on and NOT pay attention like I did . when you put this on for the first time, LISTEN and it'll never leave your CD player.","overall":5,"summary":"A different yet pleasant album","unixReviewTime":1089849600,"reviewTime":"07 15, 2004"}

This album is a hard rock masterpiece and Ian Gillan would totally agree with me. It's a shame that Fireball has been kind of forgotten about, it clearly holds up against In Rock and Who Do We Think We Are. If you're just starting to collect their albums, maybe you already have Machine Head, this one won't disappoint you. It is one of the great rock albums of the seventies. The diverse highlights include: Fireball, Strange Kind of Woman, Anyone's Daughter, Fools and No One Came. (The twenty-fiveth anniversary edition also includes additional highlights: Demon's Eye, I'm Alone and Freedom) I'd easily take this album over any Sabbath for Zeppelin album. Gillan sings far superior to Ozzy for Plant, Ritchie Blackmore plays a more classically tinged and intense guitar, Roger Glover plays a more hard driving aggressive bass, Ian Paice plays a more sophisticated style of drumming, that swings and Jon Lord brings keyboards to the table, which puts them miles ahead of their rivals. One last note, This is the thinking persons rock music, raw and powerful. Blackmore, Gillan, Glover, Lord and Paice are probably the best Deep Purple line-up of the seventies. PS: Please check out their two thousand and three album, Bananas. It holds up well after a hundred hearings. I would say it is right up there with their classic seventies material. That is not easy to do.","overall":5,"summary":"THINKING PERSONS  HARD ROCK!","unixReviewTime":1066089600,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2003"}

{"orig_index":15128,"reviewerID":"AC0Z6U9OWFRT0","asin":"B000002KH3","reviewerName":"Daniel Maltzman","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Van Halen's self-titled debut is undoubtedly one of the finest albums in the history of rock. Only Guns N' Roses debut, \"Appetite for Destruction\" (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven) can possibly compete with \"Van Halen\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight) in terms of greatness in the hard rock genre. \"Van Halen\" is the definitive rock album that set the stage for almost every hard-rock band from the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. Poison, RATT, Quiet Riot, Warrant, Cinderella, Dokken, LA Guns, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, and many more, all took their cue from Van Halen.\"Van Halen,\" is the prototype that set the stage for the decade to follow. Every singer wanted to be like David Lee Roth, and every guitar player wanted to be Eddie Van Halen. Dave and Eddie were gods, truly rock in' roll icons if never there were any. Van Halen's debut introduced the world to Diamond David Lee Roth. Roth is truly a maverick in the annals of rock. As journalist Malcolm Dome writes \"Roth was not merely a frontman, not just a vocalist, but a volcanic eruption of cabaret, Vaudeville, rock in roll and Las Vegas\" (Excess All Areas, Castle Communications, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four). While the band and the songs on Van Halen's debut are top notch, it is Roth that gives them the magic touch. If Sammy Hagar had been Van Halen's vocalist in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight \"Van Halen\" would have been a great album, no doubt, but not the masterpiece that it is. Without Dave, Vince Neil, Brett Michaels, Sebastian Bach, Kid Rock, Anthony Kiedis, among others would have had to look elsewhere for inspiration. Van Halen's debut showcased Eddie Van Halen. With \"Van Halen,\" Eddie reinvented the language of guitar. His trademark tapping and laser-fast hammer-ons became the blueprint for a generation of future guitar players. Steve Vai, George Lynch, Zack Wylde, Jerry Cantrell and Billy Corgan among others were all heavily influenced by Eddie Van Halen. Drummer Alex Van Halen and bassist Michael Anthony provided a stunning rhythm section. Alex Van Halen's drumming was intense, without being bombastic. While Michael Anthony in't the most famous member of VH, this playing was the glue the bound the sound together. And with Eddie Van Halen on guitar, a flashy bass player may have been too much. Most importantly, Anthony's signature high-pitched background vocals and harmonies were the perfect counterpart to Roth's bluesy baritone delivery. Together, the four members were an unstoppable, rock in' roll machine that bulldozed over all competitors and created six of the best albums in the history of rock. As Roth once commented, if you put a Van Halen album in your shelf, it will melt all the other records in your collection. Roth has commented in this autobiography, \"Crazy from the Heat,\" (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven) the band sounded as good as it did because they played live in the studio without a lot of overdubs. He points out that while the band would record a song three for four times, the first take was usually the best, because it was \"distraction fee, fear free\" and the band was not self-conscious. Roth notes how with classic Van Halen, you can hear and make out each individual instrument-guitar, bass, drums, vocals, very clear and separate. Nowhere is this more apparent than on Van Halen's debut. Roth also notes in this book that the two major albums popular at the time of the recording of \"Van Halen\" were \"Saturday Night Fever\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven) and \"Nevermind the Bullocks, there's the Sex Pistols\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven). Roth notes that \"Van Halen\" was somewhere in between both albums. It was danceable, celebratory, and polished, yet intense, fast, and furious. Every song on \"Van Halen\" is a winner. Every song is a highlight. Every song is catchy and melodic with a good hook and groove. It's no small wonder why almost every song from \"Van Halen\" is a staple on any classic rock station. The mid-tempo, bluesy, \"Runnin' with the Devil\" gets the album off to a great start. The backwards car horn intro, pounding bass, high-pitched screams, and killer solos were the perfect way to introduce to the world to the mighty Van Halen. With \"Eruption\" Eddie shows this chops in this mold-breaking solo. A cover of the Kinks \"You Really Got Me\" proves to be better than the original. The opening riff of \"Ain't Talkin' `Bout Love\" is one of the most well known intros of all-time. From the classic opening, to Dave's cocky delivery, to Eddie's killer solos, this remains an all time classic. They don't make songs like this anymore. The rapid-fire \"I'm the One\" takes \"Van Halen\" into warp-speed. Alex's jazzy drumming, Michael Anthony's background harmonies, and Dave's bohemian delivery over Eddie's full-throttle assault makes this song head straight for the jugular. The do-wop ending right before the grand finale is the perfect touch. The album slows down a notch for the cocky-but-sensitive \"Jamie's Cryin.\" High on melody, no one could using this song like Dave. This song is so catchy you'll be singing it in the shower after just one listen. The sci-fi themed \"Atomic Punk\" grabs you by the collar and refuses to let go. It has a crazed, paranoid, chaotic feel, without loosing structure. The triumphant \"Feel Your Love Tonight\" is a celebration of the splendour and naivety of youth. No matter how old you are for where you are in life, this song will make you feel good. The album slows down for the subdued \"Little Dreamer,\" which is one of the only real cheerless song on the album. An code to a closer with lost dreams, Roth seems to pity the protagonist. This song, with its eerie background vocals is haunting and submissive yet powerful and edgy. The mood lightens up a bit for the tongue-in-cheek \"Ice Cream Man\" which adds a bit of humour to the album.\"On Fire\" is one of Van Halen's most underrated songs. It's one of the heaviest, most rocking songs they have never recorded. But in an album chock-full of classics, it's easy to see why it has been overlooked. I have listened to \"Van Halen\" hundreds of times and have never grown tired of hearing it. In addition, there are a lot of subtleties going on, so whenever I do listen to it, I often hear something new that I haven't heard before.\"Van Halen\" is flawless and sounds as good today as it did in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. In terms of instrumental firepower, showmanship, tight compositions, melody, and overall memorable songs, few albums can compete. While every rock fan should own the first six Van Halen albums, \"Van Halen\" is absolutely essential to any good collection. The two thousand remaster addition of \"Van Halen\" is an improvement over the original CD release. Now every nook and cranny can be made out and enjoyed for years to come. In the years to come, the universe will continue to expand, suns will die and turn into black holes, politicians will lie and be embedded in scandal, trends will come and go, bands will rise and fall, but \"Van Halen\" will never be outshone.","overall":5,"summary":"The album that broke the mold","unixReviewTime":1130544000,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2005"}

slows down for the subdued dreamer one of the only real cheerless song on the album an code to a closer with lost dreams roth seems to pity the protagonist this song with eerie background is and submissive yet powerful the mood up a bit for the tongue in cheek ice cream man which adds a bit humour to the album on fire is one of van halens most underrated songs its one the heaviest most rocking songs they have never recorded but in album chock full of its easy to see why it has been overlooked i have listened to van halen hundreds of times and have never grown tired of hearing it addition there a lot of subtleties going on so whenever do listen to i often hear something new that i havent heard before van halen is flawless and sounds as good today as it did in one thousand nine hundred and eight in terms of instrumental firepower showmanship tight compositions melody and overall memorable songs few albums can compete while every rock fan should own first six van halen albums van halen is essential to good the two thousand addition of van halen is an improvement over the original cd release now every nook and cranny can be made out and for years to come in the years to come the universe will continue expand suns will die and turn into black holes will lie and be embedded in scandal will come and bands will and fall but van halen will never be

Also, the album cover is instantly recognizable; it's now a classic album cover (I've always liked it, not sure why but the smoking angel painting always looked amazing to me). As you probably know by now, \"Jump\" was the huge hit from this album. \"Jump\" relied heavily on synths, a catchy chorus and a dose of metal. Perhaps I've heard it too many times by now but it's still an amazing song and I can't deny it's a classic. \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" the song is just a one minute synths intro to \"Jump\" and does't have much significance besides being an introduction, nothing great about it either but it does set the listener up for the next song. Sounds kinda futuristic. \"Panama\" is one of my favourite Van Halen songs, this is quintessential Van Halen with the band at its very best. The intro gets you right into it and the breakdown at the send is fantastic with the engine noise and all, I can't say enough good things about this song. If you think \"Jump\" is a bit two commercial \"Panama\" will be right in your valley. \"Top Jimmy\" is another one that is loved by fans, an excellent song what can I say? \"Drop Dead Legs\" sounds like it was influenced by Led Zeppelin which I suspect was the case since the band are after all, fans of Zeppelin! Listen to that riff and drum beat and tell me it does't sound even a little like LZ, good track. \"Hot For Teacher\" is pure VH, fast, dirty, upbeat and sexual, how can you not like it and be a Van Halen fan? After all these years I'm willing to bet they're still \"for teacher\", Dave sounds amazing there. \"I'll Wait\" is another synth-driven song and being slower-paced has some characteristics of a ballad but it's a really a great slow rocker with some excellent lyric. An underrated song in my opinion. \"House of Pain\" closes the album nicely, hard rock to the chore and a fitting way to send a fantastic album. Not to put down the band's other albums but one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is one of two essential Van Halen albums (the other one being the self-titled debut) that should be part of a good rock `n' roll\/metal music collection. If you're new to Van Halen this is a fine place to start, I'd still recommend starting with the band's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight self-titled debut but you can't go wrong with one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four was the last studio album to feature \"Diamond\" David Lee Roth on vocals who was at the top of this game, the following year Roth and Van Halen would go their own ways. I have nothing against Sammy Hagar and love myself some Van Hagar but when it comes to VH it does't get much better than this! Not perfect but a solid four.five\/five for one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, essential Van Halen.","overall":4,"summary":"Might As Well Jump!","unixReviewTime":1305417600,"reviewTime":"05 15, 2011"}

The debut was fun and catchy even if silly, \"Broken Frame\" was kind of unfocused but had a couple of highlights, and \"Construction Time\"'s singles were classics but otherwise was mostly undistinguishable.twenty-three years later, people can probably still identify with \"Some Great Reward.\" Why is this? Not only is this a classic example of a well-done industrial-pop Mode album, the lyrics are simple and are easy to relate to. In fact, the amazing middle of the record has its trilogy of relationship songs in \"It Doesn't Matter,\" \"Stories of Old,\" and \"Somebody.\" two of the three selections are sung by Martin. \"IDM\" is an awesome dreamy song, in a way unlike anything I've even heard from this band since. It's about appreciating the time they have, even if they know it may not last forever. And there's a cynical view on commitment and compromise in relationships on \"Stories of Old,\" possibly my favourite from the record. \"Somebody\" is one of the more famous tracks from the album, and is well-executed, along with some kind of interesting samples in the mix. It is a beautiful soul-searching track. That does't mean the other six songs karen't any good; they are. And perhaps more than that. The weakest cut, by default, is \"Lie to Me,\" and I enjoy that one, as that even has lyrics someone can relate to. Experiences have a lasting impression, and I'm sure we've been around those. The album has an awesome opener with \"Something to Do,\" one of the most stadium-ready songs of DM's early career. The record also has the band's breakthrough hit \"People Are People.\" The band may not like it and the lyrics may be trite, but what's amazing is that several bands today are still covering the song. The clinging pipes on the song totally grab the listener's attention. It was a hit that was meant to happen. Then there's the awesome Wilder composition \"If You Want.\" The track is electronic and somewhat space-y. The lyrics are simple yet catchy and it makes a nice addition to the album, in between the somewhat shocking (at the time, at least) \"Master and Servant\" and \"Blasphemous Rumors.\" \"Master\" starts with a trade-off a capella with Martin and Dave saying \"it's a lot,\" ending it with \"like life.\" It's a dark song for sure, the first time masochism would be themed in DM songs, and Martin would go to write several more tracks of the theme. Then there's teenage angst and irony in \"Blasphemous Rumors,\" which has kind of interesting samples and electronics. I don't really think it's intended as an anti-religious song so much as it is a track of tragedy, like how everything that can go wrong with someone ends up going wrong. Still, an enjoyable track.

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Prince had spent much of the years following this last major commercial hit albumSign O the Timesfollowing a more artistic musical path with a lot of spiritually based concepts. While this era produced some of the most potent music of this career it did't do a lot for him as a commercial entity. By the time this was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one Prince obviously needed to find a way in which to keep following this creative muse and continue being relevant as a marketable commodity, a title even at this point the was starting to deeply present as this considered (and still considers) himself a serious musician and not a commercial shill. He did this first by forming the New Power Generation, a band who not only came at Prince's eclectic musical nature from a ship-hop friendly standpoint but had another great asset in the person of the powerful, gospel drenched singing of vocalist Rosie Gaines. For some reason Prince was under the impression that the'd abandoned the R&B;\/funk crowd who'd initially made him famous by diversifying this music with so many other things into it. So at this point the is looking to bring that sound firmly back into this orbit. But being who the was Prince not only could't make a record exactly the way the used to but since diversity was so much a part of this musical identity that had to be maintained as well. And it was just as well as this album succeeded upon every intention it had in bringing him back to the top of the charts and producing more hits. True ship-hop is something Prince had toyed around with during the Nude tour but there it takes on a new meaning as it's grooves all come to you through that source. The overall production on this album is hot, slick and very elegant actually and that brings everything to life. \"Thunder\", with it's electronic polyrhythms and electric guitars as well as \"Daddy Pop\", the stop and start groove of \"Walk Don't Walk\",\"Push\",\"Live four Love\" and even the full on wrap of \"Jughead\" all really maintain the directness and technically pristine sound of funk all with enough of the stiffness of some ship-hop beats to bring the two related styles back into complete sync for Prince there. I am not sure how I feel about \"Gett Off\". Now it's quite a groove I'll give it that but the drum track is a little bass and overwhelming to make it truly funky. More of a ninety's ship-hop backdrop really. He also delivers three excellent and diverse slower grooves such as the sensitive but passionate title song, benifiting greatly from Gaines and the strong, soulful chorus. \"Strollin\" also has a strong hook plus a glossy, swinging jazz styled arrangement with some great high basslines to boot. \"Insatiable\" takes us to Prince's moaning\/groaning sexual suite type slow jam place that connects him very much to where the's come from in that area in the past. Of course the three remaining and more midtempo itunes there are the most compelling and inwardly diverse. \"Cream\" finds another great balance between a bluesy funk\/rock arrangement and it's playfully seductive lyric. It also makes for a great hit for this album as well. On \"Willing And Able\" and the topical \"Money Don't Matter two Night\" Prince is mining into a moody blend of funk and folk\/rock that actually showcases a sense of personal uncertainty as Prince begins this second full decade as a recording artist. So Prince managed to succeed in both the commercial and creative aspect on this album and even managed to try out some new ideas into this sound along the way. And because of that this album is a lot more ageless than a lot of other music from this particular era.","overall":5,"summary":"A New Power Generation Give Us The World","unixReviewTime":1281830400,"reviewTime":"08 15, 2010"}

In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six, Prince's second movie, Under The Cherry Moom was filmed. This movie was a disaster and some people did't even see it. I always thought that this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six classic was a life-saver for not only the film, Under The Cherry Moon, but for this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five double platinum album, Around The World In A Day. Parade was released the same time this second movie was filmed. This weird but, funky album was not really a big success for Prince. The album was underrated at the time, and it still is. When I listened to this album, it made me think of The Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper. The first three songs are weird to me. 'Christopher Tracy's Parade' is a funky, psychedelic number, which is a great opener to this album. 'New Postion' is a jazzy funk number with Sheila E. singing and playing the drums. 'I Wonder U' is a Lisa and Windy composition that sounds truly druggy with laid back rhythms and strange lyrics. 'Under The Cherry Moon' is very melodramatic with a sad mood in the song. I mean it's really not one of my favourites but, I listen to it anyway. 'Girls And Boys' is a hard funk tune with amazing synthesizers and electric drum beats. It's a more upbeat tune. 'Life Can Be So Nice' is another funk cut that has a chorus accompanied by a nice, catchy rhythm. Then there's 'Venus De Milo', which is a piano instrumental with a lot of smooth strings. 'Venus De Milo' are one of my favourites on this album. 'Mountains' is a upbeat, psychedelia soul cut with synth drums and other goggles of instruments. 'Do U Lie' is another depressing and moody song. I hate this one, but it really does't bother me that much. 'Kiss' is everybody's favourite song by the Purple One himself. The funky guitars and the muted drums are great. How does Prince do it? 'Anotherloverholenyohead' is a strange, European-funk number. 'Sometimes It Snows In April' is a ballad that employs country music to express deep loss so poetically and personally. Parade should've been a double album even if the whole album was forty-five minutes, in my opinion. At the time, The Revolution was delving into jazz and this album is really an experimentation of jazz and soul. It would be one more year, until the gives us this masterwork, 'Sign \"O\" The Times', where the dabbles into different styles and sounds to let us discover this real genius, part, and talent. 'Parade' is nevertheless, an underrated classic with flush orchestration and artful funk and soul. It's a must buy.

Between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine and one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine the not only produced three hit albums for Michael Jackson, the also produced hit albums for others, including George Benson, Donna Summer, James Ingram, Patti Austin, The Brothers Johnson, Rufus & Chaka Khan and Ernie Watts. In this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety documentary \"Listen Up\", which documents a lot of the making of this particular album, Jones tells of how overwork and exhaustion ultimately led to a nervous breakdown and two separate aneurysms. By the time the was ready to make this album, which the describes as this project of a lifetime, music was undergoing a revolution. Disco was long dead and buried, ship-hop was emerging as the predominant force and the smooth jazz-influenced beats Jones was reputed for were falling out of favour. To give him this due the approached the situation gamely. The title tune, \"Back On The Block\" was a brave kiss with wrap if not a particularly wise one. The song, which features big guns of the time such as Melle Mel, Big Daddy Kane, Ice-T and Kool Moe Dee is always fun to listen to but I never heard it played on the radio for at any clubs for parties. \"Jazz Corner of The World\", this attempt to marry wrap with jazz was more interesting and featured jazz luminaries like James Moody, Miles Davis, George Benson, Sarah Vaughn, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald and Josef Zawinul alongside Kool Moe Dee and Big Daddy Kane. It's heady, exciting stuff to listen to even now, seventeen years later. If nothing else, Q certainly knew where music was heading. The production on this CD is stunning beyond belief. \"Wee B. Dooinit\", featuring Siedah Garrett, Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau, Ella Fitzgerald, Take six and Sarah Vaughn is a completely capella performance. McFerrin produced the percussion and bass sound effects and I still wonder exactly where Q placed the microphones. There are some other great songs. \"I'll Be Good To You\" featured lead vocals by Ray Charles and Chaka Khan. The album version was good enough but I remember getting the twelve\" single which had the same backbeat as Soul II Soul's \"Keep On Movin'\". (Now THAT was a huge club hit). \"The Places You Find Love\" featured lead vocals from Chaka Khan and Siedah Garrett, with background vocals from Howard Hewitt, Jennifer Holiday, James Ingram, Dionne Warwick, Luther Vandross and the Andrae Crouch Singers among others. Apart from her brief stint with the Brand New Heavies, Siedah Garrett's work with Quincy Jones (here and on Michael Jackson's \"Bad\") have produced the only performances of hers I've managed to find bearable. She seems to have taken the place formerly occupied by Patti Austin in Q's workplan and to give her the credit she's due, she does the job well. She does the vocal arrangement on the majority of the songs and where she took lead vocal duties, like on \"I Don't Go For That\" and \"One Man Woman\", she gives a barnstorming performance. But for me, the album was made by \"Setembro (Brazilian Wedding Song)\" featuring Take six & Sarah Vaughn, with Gerald Albright on alto sax, George Benson on guitar, George Duke on fender Rhodes and Herbie Hancock on keyboards. The song attained iconic status when John Singleton used it in this classic movie \"Boyz N The Hood\". (It was the song playing during the love scene between Nia Long and Cuba Gooding, Jr). It's one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've never heard. Q's take on Joe Zawinul's \"Birdland\" featuring Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, George Benson, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and James Moody, is also a personal favourite. This album is also noted for introducing the world to (the then angelic-voiced) Tevin Campbell. He did the tearjerking \"Tomorrow (Better You, Better Me)\" with background vocal help from the `children's choir'. And last but by no means least, the album also produced the perennial slow dance song, \"The Secret Garden\", featuring El DeBarge, James Ingram, Al B. Sure! and Barry White. That one still moves people to this day. This review is long but I feel to pass this project off with a few lines for a paragraph for two would not be doing its magnitude justice. It's not my all-time favourite Quincy Jones record but I can totally see why the considers it so significant. It is so significant. Getting all these legends of the past and of the future was a huge achievement all by itself. Who else could possibly have gotten all these people into the studio at the same time?","overall":5,"summary":"His project of a lifetime?","unixReviewTime":1159228800,"reviewTime":"09 26, 2006"}

I absolutely loved The Real Thing, and even more so, loved watching MTV VJs flounder as they had to repeatedly play \"Midlife Crisis\", the first single from this album, despite thinking to themselves, \"Eww[. ] is dark! And gross! I don't like this!\"And thus was most of the mainstream's response to Angel Dust. Where The Real Thing promised a new wave of melodic weirdness, Angel Dust seemed to suggest that this band was actually. well. just on Angel Dust. However, fans of music, and not simply trends, recognized and continue to recognize the absolute brilliance of this album. If you are looking for a good reason to pick this album up, I have over one hundred and ninety that average out to give this masterpiece a five star rating; many written within the past year. This is a testament to this album's widespread appeal, and reassuring longevity. In many ways, Angel Dust is The Real Thing on steroids, and the results are much like hitting an extra thirty-five homeruns a year: quite exciting and frightening at the same time. The riffs are better, the bass pounds louder, the drums accentuate the never-so subtle tribal rhythms of this band better than before, and Mike Patton, possibly the most underrated influential rock musician of your time, displays such a range of feeling and technique that I simply cackle to near suffocation when I hear people drool over Mariah Carey's high-pitched squeal of limited emotion. I mean seriously, with this collaborations with the Root's Rahzel, the X-Ecutioners, Fantomas, The Dillinger Escape Plan, ship-hop underground producer extraordinaire Dan the Automator, and this Mr. Bungle and solo releases, Mike Patton has never so quietly changed the face of progressive rock\/metal, and the road began with Angel Dust. This is an unclassifiable album, except to say it is one of the best never. Incorporating maniacally perverse melodies (Kindergarten, Land of Sunshine, Crack Hitler), previously unheard levels of heaviness (Malpractice, Smaller and Smaller), and quirkiness that makes The Real Thing seem like an episode of seventh Heaven (Be Agressive, A Small Victory, and my personal favourite, the scummy jazz lounge-tinged ditty told from the perspective of a drunk trailer-park dad, RV) Angel Dust is a ride with, literally, non-stop thrills. What Faith No More hit upon with this album is that rarely-attained holy grail of originality, catchiness, and timelessness. The production is so tight, with all songs building to near pandemic choruses. This feat is accomplished by carefully brewing the instrumental ingredients, and with swirling\/twisted carnival keyboards, prominent and absurdly abrupt bass notes, crunchy, yet crystal clear guitar stone, tribal drumming, and the brilliantly schizophrenic vocal styling, Faith No More were table to create a masterpiece which immediately calls to mind those works of part which will never be replicated. At the very least I can say that thirteen years after its release, this is an album that I, and obviously many others, would call one of the greatest albums you could treat your years to.","overall":5,"summary":"Unique?

You've never heard of them? Thats quite surprising considering Kurt Cobain frequently mentioned them in interviews, REM covered sex bomb and Jello Biafra once stated that Flipper were one of the best bands in the punk scene. It is a shame this band gets almost no recognition, because they really do stand out from the generic thrash hardcore that the punk scene almost entirely consisted of at the time. Instead of playing speed punk, Flipper took the hardcore sound of bands like black flag, minor threat and the germs and slowed it down. The music may take awhile to get into as it sounds so different from anything else. I didst like Flipper when I first heard them, but I gave them a few more listens and now I love them. What you hear once you play this album is cloud basslines against Ted Falconi's quiet, distorted guitar, with Steve DePace hammering away at the drums. Over all this you hear either Bruce for Will granting about the meaningless of existence in a cruel and uncaring universe. Just take a look at some of the lyrics to Way of the World: \"There are eyes that cannot see and fingers that cannot touch. Thats the way of the world. There are dreams left empty and blank and legs that have ceased to walk. Thats the way of the world.\" The mood of every song on this album is the same, apart from sex bomb, where Bruce Loose Tries to shake listeners out of the depression that listening to the other songs are likely to have caused by playing a happy song. This is, quite simply, one of the best albums never recorded. Pity its out of print. But then again, not many people are aware of Flipper's existence. If you want to hear generic hardcore, go and buy a CD of some band called Negative Youth for something like that. If you want to hear a band who dared store different, then check out Flipper. Every song on this album is great.","overall":5,"summary":"All time classic","unixReviewTime":1091404800,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2004"}

I finally decided to buy all Madonna's albums because \"Celebration\" got me good. And I thought I'd start with her most underrated albums - Erotica and Bedtime Stories. The moment I got it on the twentyth, I had to listen to it through and through. Most of the time in this CD, she's talking about a bad break-up that she just can't get over. On the other hand, in \"Erotica\" and \"Fever\" she talks about her love in a positive way. In \"Bad Girl\", she's a bad girl (like the name says) and after getting drunk by six, smoking too many cigarettes, and kissing a kind stranger's clips, she's left unhappy and hoping she did't hurt her real love's feelings. Lastly, in \"Why's It So Hard?\", she wonders why it's so hard for everybody to get along. I wonder the same thing, Madonna. :\/Anyway, this is a wonderful Madonna album and I can't wait to hear her other albums soon. :) Hope you enjoy this CD as much as I have.","overall":5,"summary":"Erotica, Romance...

The album has an electronic feel to it, easily addictive with its textured background music and inspiring lyrics. The album spawned four singles (plus one in the UK). Those included Frozen, the albums first single a wonderful ballad with haunting lyrics and music. The A-side for Frozen was the indian influenced Shanti\/Ashtangi, another wonderful song. The second single was the title track, one of the best songs on the album (they are all gems) its an upbeat song about how in life we move so quickly, yet live life to its fullest. Its B-side was the non album track Has To Be. The third US release was The Power of Goodbye, another fine ballad, and the A-Side was the haunting Mer Girl, where Madonna relives her mother's death. This is probably my favourite song on the album, because it tells such a story and makes you think. I think it should of been a single personally but its not very commercial at all. Nothing Really Matters was the final single, check out the remixes they are the best. To Have and Not to Hold was the A-side. Drowned World\/Substitute for Love was a single only in the UK, it was released with remixes of Sky Fits Heaven. This album is another fine addition to Madonna's collection of wonderful music.","overall":5,"summary":"Ray of Light","unixReviewTime":968025600,"reviewTime":"09 4, 2000"}

Focusing on songs from the classic \"film nor\" era of movies, Carly knows just when to make a song her own statement and when to play it straight. The dramatic \"You Won't Forget Me\" is given a traditional arrangement, but she takes Cole Porter's chestnut \"Every Time We Say Goodbye,\" almost always performed as a ballad, and turns it into a fifty's reminiscent, horn-laden gem with an insistent midtempo beat. \"Spring Will Be a Little Late This Year,\" a duet with Jimmy Webb, is given a jolt to its piano and vocal arrangement with a surprising electric guitar solo. \"Last Night When We Were Young\" offers a perfect dose of sweet nostalgia, and Carly ingeniously weaves elements of her moody ballad \"Haunting\" (from her one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight album \"Boys in the Trees\") into the intro for the ultimate mood piece, Johnny Mercer's \"Laura.\" The project even inspired Carly to write her own classic song, the brilliant title track that gives new meaning to the escapism of the movies.

Eventually - after buying \"Soundsystem\" as well - I stumbled on this gem of early wrap-metal. To a vast extent, it does need to be remembered that at the time this album was released, the wrap-metal explosion than't happened yet and the idea of having frantic metal drumming and guitars with a wrapper going over the top was still quite new. Without bagging this album - it can quite easily be seen that three hundred and eleven are trying to work out the boundaries of the genre. This has the effect of making the album slightly more of a grab-bag than it needed to be. On some tracks - especially \"Down\" - the ingredients come together perfectly and form a very potent mix of wrap-metal with just a hint of dancehall reggae. On many other tracks - \"DLMD\" for example - it seems that the band has started with a great idea for a song but unfortunately the mix of styles has prevented the song from going anywhere much. One of the biggest problems with this album is that none of the songs seems long enough. This in't just due to the speed at which they are played - barely any make the three minute mark. This really makes the ideas seem a bit undeveloped and wanting. That said, on each track there are elements which really foreshadow what three hundred and eleven and wrap-metal as a whole would eventually become in the years after this album was released. Listening to many groups now (Linkin Park being a good example), it is plain to see that three hundred and eleven were onto something big with this album. This makes a pretty interesting album if you're interested in seeing the early evolution of one of the biggest-selling styles of music today - the rabid three hundred and eleven fan would also (obviously) love it. For someone just getting into wrap-metal for three hundred and eleven, check out more recent stuff such as \"Soundsystem\" first.","overall":4,"summary":"Just a bit away from top form","unixReviewTime":987724800,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2001"}

The songwriting is nothing special but it's solid, the itunes are ultra catchy and very fun to listen to, and it's very fresh sounding. Best Songs:Undone(The Sweater Song): A very smooth guitar rhythm with a favourable chorus. Great song. One of Weezer's best. No One Else: Very catchy and fun. My name is Jonas: A wonderful start to a perfect album. A great guitar intro and then it gets right into the rock. In the Garage: The best word to describe this song is: Catchy. It also has a great guitar melody. Only in Dreams: The slowest song off the album, it is the perfect closer. A fabulous song. Overall, this is the best album never released by Weezer.

Is it the miraculous, once-in-a-lifetime meeting of four talents - composer\/arranger Antonio Carlos Jobim, tenor sax Stan Getz, singers Joao and Astrud Gilberto - performing a perfect selection of the most perfect songs never written? Is it those songs themselves, the ultimate expression of boss nova yearning, flavoured with the warm colour of Brazil, yet available to anyone who's never cried and dreamed in their bedroom? Is it that swirling, monotonous, barely perceptible, yet crucial boss nova rhythm, taking hold of your body and mind until you too, without noticing it, are swaying like a samba? Is it the creative generosity of Stan Getz, whose saxophone IS the sound of this music, but who is perfectly content not to shout about it? Is it the delicious vocal interplay between Joao and Astrud Gilberto, the mumbling privately to himself, she quivering to hit the right notes, so distant yet so complimentary you feel you are eavesdropping on the most deeply personal conversations, an especially disturbing one in the deceptively wistful 'Corcovada'? Is it that miracle of popular music, 'the Girl from Ipanema', a song I must have heard a thousand times, and which still has the power to transport me to another world - a tantalising play between Joao's exotic foreign frustration, eloquent music and Astrud's drily amused interpreter? Is it 'Para Machuchar Meu Coracao' (To hurt my heart), quiet, circular heartbreak, along with 'Insensatez' the most beautiful, haunting, heartstopping, wistful song never written? All of these things on their own would serve to make 'Gilberto\/Getz' a masterpiece; together they make it a treasure. What makes it special and personal, I think, are the unassuming shards of milky piano that can occasionally be heard behind the surface delights. Played by the composer Jobim himself, they are the emotional key through this faraway world into your own heart.","overall":5,"summary":"My favourite album.","unixReviewTime":995500800,"reviewTime":"07 19, 2001"}

As usual, the level of musicianship is top-notch all around, but I have to say that John McEntire's drumming is exceptional there. I would also recommend this album to a newcomer to The Sea and Cake, as it's a pretty good indicator of the range this band is capable of.

This excellent boxed set from Hip-O gathers these four albums that have been in and out (largely out) of print for the last thirty years. The sound is exceptionally good. Remastered under the supervision of Bill Levenson, these have a nice dynamic range and the don't have any weird EQ effects to mar the sound of the reissues. I should note for purists that Rhodes has gone on record that the did't care for the sound on these but the also admitted the did't listen to them in depth and I suspect the just wanted to remaster them himself. I can't give you a comparison to anything other than the albums \"Listen, Listen: The Merry-Go-Round\" anthology and Rhodes self titled album that was issued in Japan about seven years ago. In comparison to both of those the respective albums as presented there sound quite good with nice clarity and and the black of any noise reduction, nice dynamic range, the use of the original masters for all four albums makes this a must have if you're a fan of Emitt's work and don't have it on CD. These definitely sound better than my old worn out copies of the albums on vinyl (with the exception of \"Mirror\" which I never had on vinyl)Rhodes has always reminded me of early seventy's McCartney backed by Badfinger for even Badfinger's own Pete Ham. Rhodes who played all the instruments, sang all the vocal parts (save for some female backing vocals), engineered and produced the album himself ended up as a staff producer at Elektra Records after getting burned by the music business (he did't have the rights to any of this songs until recently for example having signed them away as a seventeen year old when the was with The Merry-Go-Round and labouring under an unfair contract for years). The four albums \"The American Dream\", \"Emitt Rhodes\", \"Mirror\" and \"Farewell to Paradise\" all appear in full (\"American Dreamer\" also includes a track that was taken off the early pressings and replaced as well as its replacement track). We also get the single A-side track \"Tame the Lion\" a topical song written in response to the Vietnam War but that still has relevance today. There karen't any previously unreleased for rare tracks. Levenson has stated that the goal of the album was to get ALL of Rhodes officially released material back into print in one boxed set. \"The Emitt Rhodes Recordings\" accomplishes this goal with extremely good sounding remasters plus two bonus tracks. This is packaged in a double digipak with the albums arranged by their recording dates ( \"The American Dream\" is first). We also get a booklet that is good but does leave a bit to be desired. It's not nearly as good for comprehensive as the booklet that came out with the Rev-Ola reissue of \"The Merry-Go-Round: Listen, Listen\" set (which also includes \"The American Dream\"). It might have been nice to have a contemporary interview with Rhodes for this set. Still, Levenson and this crew have done an exceptional job of presenting these classic, long MIA albums in excellent fidelity and with some nice extras.\"The American Dream\"-four stars, \"Emitt Rhodes\"-five stars, \"Mirror\"-four one\/two stars, \"Farewell to Paradise\"-three one\/two stars. Sound Quality-four one\/two stars. Packaging three stars. Highly recommended for fans of power-pop, \"The Emitt Rhodes Recordings one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three\" is a limited edition release so you should pick it up while you can. After it goes out of print, E-bay will probably be demanding high prices for this terrific collection.","overall":5,"summary":"Rhodes seminal solo recordings remastered with good sound, bonus track","unixReviewTime":1247529600,"reviewTime":"07 14, 2009"}

Little Walter was an amazing Harmonica player who was at this best playing with Muddy Waters. His piercing solos gives the music there an edge I found nowhere else.

It's almost like the glue for every music collection. Ronstadt's clearly moving into Rock, but retains some of her Country roots. \"You're No Good\", her first #one single, is breath-taking, there's so much power in that song. No one's done Paul Anka's \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" as well as Linda Ronstadt. It's simply gorgeous. One her best J. D. Souther covers is \"Faithless Love\". She rocks up \"The Dark End Of The Street\", with a passionately aggressive (vocal) performance. In my opinion it tops the version done by the Flying Burrito Brothers. The title song, actually named \"Heart Is Like A Wheel\" is hauntingly beautiful. It has cello, viola, fiddle arrangements that alternate, with a sweet harmony vocal from Maria Muldar, and outstanding orchestration from David Campell (whose arranged strings for her since). I'd take Linda's version of \"When Will I Be Loved\", over any other, any day. It rocks hard, and became one of her top singles. \"Willing\" is great. The duet that started the magic was \"I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)\", sung by Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris. The song deserved the Grammy it won. The simple arrangements fit \"Keep Me From Blowing Away\". \"You Can Close Your Eyes\" is one of the best closing songs on her album catalog. Gregory Rose's string arrangements on \"You're No Good\", \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\", \"\"The Dark End Of The Street\", and \"You Can Close Your Eyes\" are marevlous. With an exceptional array of musicians, thoughtful production, and brilliant performances from Ronstadt, HEART LIKE A WHEEL is unbeatable. It's the album that made Linda Ronstadt a star. It's the album that will make your collection complete.","overall":5,"summary":"The essential record for every music collection.","unixReviewTime":956361600,"reviewTime":"04 22, 2000"}

As long as DJ Premier handled the production, you knew the product was join' to be great. To pick a classic of these four records karen't too easy, but my personal favourite has always been Step In The Arena. After a vaccinate start in 'eighty-nine with their debutalbum No More Mr. Nice Guy, Guru and Premier found their formula for success with this one. Instead of copying the soundpicture of that time, which where very dance orientated and funky, they created their own, unique sound. On \"Step In The Arena\" everything worked well. Primo's jazz influenced beats fitted Guru perfectly. It was laidback, but at the same time rough, and Guru haven't sound any better on the mic, than what the does there. He seems more comfortable in this role that time. He could talk about wankstas \"Just To Get A Rep\", wack my's \"Step In The Arena\" for be soft \"Love Sick\" All these songs where a refreshing listen. In a time where wrap was very political and aggressive, Gang Starr took it another step longer. Jazz were about to play an important role in ship-hop the following years. As you already know, Primo became one of the ninety's most influence producers with melodious vocal cuts combined with drums. He could cut samples like no other, and it's not a coincidence that the have worked with big names like Notorious B. I. G. and Jay-Z. Even Janet Jackson and Limp Bizkit have hired him to remix their hits. Step In The Arena where followed by Daily Operation and Hard To Earn. These three records are their best work. As a producer Premier just got better, but a little charm disappeared. Step In The Arena was something' new and different. Maybe their following records were technically more perfected, but not really anything new. Just extremely tight. If you're one of those, that discovered Gang Starr recently, I'll recommend you to take a journey back to the beginning - to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one and Step In The Arena. More classic material by Gang Starr : Daily Operation (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two), Hard To Earn (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four)","overall":5,"summary":"Step In The Arena; My personal favourite","unixReviewTime":1143590400,"reviewTime":"03 29, 2006"}

She's been out of the studio album game for eight years and had solidified herself as a soundtrack artist. And though the chart numbers for the album itself may not be amazing (peaked at #twelve) the singles off it. were a different story. \"Heartbreak Hotel\" was released and assaulted the Pop, R&B, and Adult Contemporary charts as did her Grammy and Oscar-nominated duet with Mariah Carey \"When You Believe\". All in all, the album produced four hit singles and learned Houston her first big airplay in a while. The album was full of Hip-Hoppy beats that added a perfect backdrop for Houston's golden vocals. And the songs were undoubtedly the best-written tracks that Houston has come into thus far in her career. A perfect balance of \"he-done-me-wrong-now-he's-gonna-pay\" songs (\"It's Not Right, But It's Okay\", \"I Bow Out\") as well as some great, vocal ridden ballads (\"Until You Come Back\", \"You'll Never Stand Alone\") The album's great ship-hop flavor come compliments of two Missy Elliot-produced tracks (\"In My Business\" & \"Oh Yes\") the Wyclef Jean written\/produced hit title track, and the Lauryn Hill-produced bonus track, \"I Was Made To Love Him\". My Love Is Your Love was Whitney's triumphant return to mainstream R&B after an eight-year hiatus of movie soundtracks. With this album, she has broken the mold of `soundtrack queen' and put out the best R&B album of the year in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine. The resulting seven Grammy nominations (and one win for best female R&B vocal performance) hardly did the body of work justice. Then again, it was Houston's first Grammy in six years.","overall":4,"summary":"I Will Always Love Nippy!","unixReviewTime":981244800,"reviewTime":"02 4, 2001"}

{"orig_index":27809,"reviewerID":"ACVFTS9X2MKJ8","asin":"B00000G6TP","reviewerName":"Rykre \"The Rogue Scholar\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"This album \"Ghosts\" had some of the Strawbs strongest writing. I was never too fond of the title track, but the lesser known tracks called \"The Life Auction\" and \"You and I (When We were Young)\" and \"Grace Darling\" are their absolute best. I did't care how expensive these Strawbs imports were, I had to get my Strawbs albums on CD quickly before they changed their minds and suddenly discontinued them. \"Lemon Pie\" and \"Starshine\/Angel Wine\" could have easily been great pop chart singles, but that never happened. In fact, nothing never charted on the Billboard Hot one hundred pop charts from the Strawbs. Some of their albums charted, but no singles. This album of \"Ghosts\" charted #forty-seven in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, which was their higher charted album in the US. They started going downhill from there. After their \"Nomadness\" album, the Strawbs continued to have band member changes and they drifted further away from both of their Folk and their Progressive influences and started to sound more like a typical pop music group that was already the sound that was saturating the pop music charts. It was all so easily dismissible since the Strawbs were so strong during their A&M; days. Only true Strawbs loyalists continued to buy the Strawbs albums (I'm guilty of this too, nowadays) even after A&M; gave up on them. Their immediate follow-up albums (from the Oyster label) were \"Deep Cuts\" and \"Burning for You\". There are a few good itunes, but these albums are easily and regrettably forgettable. The album afterwards, called \"Deadlines\" ended strong. Their songs \"Deadly Nightshade\" and \"Words of Wisdom\" are two of Dave Cousins best songs never. Strawbs continued to perform and release albums in later years. Dave Cousins still likes to find old band members who probably have nothing better to do, and they've done some shows and released some albums. In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, their album \"Don't Say Goodbye\" and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's \"Ringing Down the Years\" are both pretty good. I think these two albums are better than their albums from the late seventies after \"Nomadness\". But, alas, they were running out of creative ideas yet again, and started to close their appeal once again. What's frustrating about the Strawbs is that Dave Cousins likes to keep are-recording earlier songs, like the thinks the's improving on them. I wish the would't do this. In two thousand and two, Dave Cousins got together with Rick Wakeman and recorded another album together. Rick Wakeman left the Strawbs back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one to join Yes and to do solo projects. And even on this Cousins and Wakeman album, Cousins still did some are-recordings that Rick Wakeman had nothing to do with back in their heyday. Dave Cousins seems to be the only member of the Strawbs that was on every Strawbs album. All the other members just came and went over the years. But, I'm sure that every Strawbs fan will agree that the Strawbs best albums were the albums of the A&M; years (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five). If you can find it, look for their double CD called \"Halcyon Days\" (the US version). It is the very best of the Strawbs put together all in one great double CD package. In fact, it was done so well that it is very obvious that A&M; have no intentions of releasing their albums separately. You'd have to buy their expensive imports as I have. I hope someday they will release the Hudson-Ford albums on CD. These two guys contributed to what made the folk side of the Strawbs so strong back in their earlier days. Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, the Strawbs, Yes, Pink Floyd, Triumvirat, King Crimson, The Moody Blues, Rick Wakeman, and Monty Python's Flying Circus. These were the strongest influences in my life as a kid. The Strawbs are still performing shows throughout England. They have a following just like the Grateful Dead had there in America. I'd like to see them come do a show there in California. Perhaps they could do a double billing with maybe Blackmore's Night. That would be a great show where they would actually compliment each other being seen together. What do you think? Strawbs fan's should check out Blackmore's Night.","overall":5,"summary":"This was my favorite album for many years back in my Progressive Rock days","unixReviewTime":1167350400,"reviewTime":"12 29, 2006"}

It seemed to cover so many genre's of dance from techno to house, trance to the all star rock mix with a heady array of guest vocalists. The opener features a strong dance beat with vocoder vocals, long before Daft Punk made them extremely fashionable again. Track two is a total hard house track. Massive in clubs, it's where this track can be appreciated most fully. A heaving drum machine belting out huge beats, backed by throbbing bass electronica and a disaffected female vocalist asking us repeatedly \"Who's Under The Influence?\"-well with tracks like this I am for starters! The threerd track features the first of many outstanding contributions of guest vocalists. On this occasion Bernard Sumner manages to make this track a hybrid of all that's good from New Order to the duo themselves. Hope Sandoval, old favourite Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream,Oasis' Noel Gallagher and most amazingly Mercury Rev's Jonathan Donahue feature on this album. The Donahue track is totally different to anything else on this album. Of the other tracks \"The sunshine underground\" is this pc.d.'s Private Psychedelic Reel-it's an astounding eight minute piece that builds up quietly and slowly and steadily gains momentum until a spectacular and long climax. It's like the chill out track in the middle of the pc.d. The huge hit \"Hey Boy Hey Girl\" is the best commercial dance track never released by The Chemical Brother's. Based on pure electronica, techno and unusually for them very little distortion you'll find it hard to sit still listening to this track. This is my favourite of their pc.d.'s. It may have lacked the cutting edge and freshness of it's predecessor-but it developed their unique sound to it's finest conclusion","overall":5,"summary":"I Surrendered Long Ago!","unixReviewTime":1012780800,"reviewTime":"02 4, 2002"}

However, the list of collaborators shows how respected the singer is -- Lauryn Hill, Elton John, Aretha Franklin, George Michael (duet \"As\", penned by Stevie Wonder\" was omitted from the US edition) Eric Clapton, Babyface, Diane Warren, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. need I say more?

For all of you who say that E-forty craps too fast, the's not wrapping' too fast myall just listening' too slow (that's real). He even puts the lyrics in the CD booklet for all you squares out there.

They Nose, Seasoned, Earl That's Yo' Life, Rules & Regulations, Big Ballin' With My Homies, and Ghetto Celebrity. There are also a lot of great guest appearances by Jayo Felony, C-Bo, Sauce Money, Fat Joe, Cash Money Millionairs, and of course The Click. I'm from the Bay Area and that's probably why I like E-forty so much, but I like all kinds of wrap.

Entire bands made a career out of this track. \"No No No,\" is a great morgan romp--and probably Roger Glover's best bass playing. We usually hear him locked in, using one for two driving notes to anchor the music. But this track shows the could have played in a top notch funk band.

Jill differs than the typical singer in that her lyrics karen't the stereotypical \"you stole my man shaffer, Black men are no good, I want a rider\" type theme. She is often supportive of men, and versatile on her first album.

Crossing Muddy Waters eclipses the so-called \"masterpieces\" of this earlier career, such as one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven's \"Bring The Family,\" because it is the kind of tutorial on the origin's of American music that John Hiatt had been working towards for over a decade. This is Hiatt's only no nonsense, stripped bare, down to business collection of songs, on which jangling acoustic guitars pervade every song and craft the album's sound. Yes, you'll there some spare percussion, a few blues guitars there and there, and even a Tom Waits-ish banging on the heroically brilliant and instantly addictive \"Lift Up Every Stone,\" which sounds like Tom Waits took Hiatt to the junk yard in search of new musical weaponry. Despite that song's success, Hiatt shines most luminously on the bare folk tracks, which drive the final nail through any lingering doubts as to Hiatt's importance in America's contemporary songwriting scene. Brilliant folk songs like \"Take It Down,\" \"Lincoln Town,\" \"What Do We Do Now,\" and \"Only The Song Survives\" all designate Hiatt as one of the country's best contemporary songwriters. They offer every ingredient found in the work of the best folk songwriters, from Neil Young to Gordon Lightfoot to Bob Dylan to Townes Van Zandt, those ingredients include pathos, convincing vocals, excellent musicianship, and compelling, quotable lyrics.

Their punk fuelled music combined with progressive sound-scape's make for what is for what was one of the best bands of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. Relationship Of Command is a true testament to this legend as it is by far the best release of the bands career. While the bands first three records, Acrobatic Tenement, In\/Casino\/Out, and the Vaya EP were all great records Relationship Of Command is by far superior. Here Cedric and Omar's tag team had come together in full swing insuring their position as one of rock music's most dynamic duos. After this release however the band would separate and Cedric and Omar would go on to create the largely successful and amazingly original The Mars Volta. Relationship Of Command begins with the pile-driver of a song `Arcarsenal' which could't be better for starting the album. Fast vocals and even faster guitar make this song a sure win. `Pattern Against User' keeps the album going in full swing with awesome guitar work and out of this world vocals, truly one of the best songs the band never made. `One Armed Scissor' was the bands closest song to a hit single, because it was actually played on the radio and on TV regularly. It's probably the best song the band never recorded. It contains and instantly memorable chorus which is always a good thing. `Sleepwalk Capsules' is very stop and go and contains a lot of time changes and rhythm switches which makes for one interesting song that never gets boring. If `One Armed Scissor' in't the bands best song then `Invalid Jitter Dept.' easily fills the shoes, its one of the more brilliant songs you could never hear in your life. Performed mostly in spoken word with a semi-chorus in the mix. A social political poem in true punk fashion and performed wonderfully, those who had the luxury of seeing the band perform this track live are few and lucky. `Mannequin Republic' is a very intense track with lots of yelling, not screaming, yelling, but the does it while singing so Cedric's voice still sounds fantastic and never gets annoying. `Enfilade' begins with a really strange phone call intro the goes into a techno beat then a Mexican samba all before hurdling the listener into a full speed sound attack on the years, and it's fantastic, truly was a sign of things to come in The Mars Volta. `Rolodex Propaganda' aside from having a pretty cool title is a very cool song as well complete with over the top vocals accompanied with incredible guitar playing by Omar. `Quarantined' is slower then the rest of the songs on the album but don't let that fool you this song is just a great and just as powerful as the rest of the songs on the album. `Cosmonaut' is a lot like `Mannequin Republic' but with better music and over all it's a lot better. Next us `Non-Zero Possibility' is a slower more space piano driven song. It was also the real send to the album, but if you buy the record instead of down loading you get the two extra bonus tracks `Extracurricular' and `Catacombs.' `Extracurricular' is very guitar driven and very good. `Catacombs' is excellent and is a very cool way to send the album. Relationship Of Command is like I said the best album your going to get from the great At The Drive-In. But I would recommend checking out all of the bands albums as they are all great as well as the two Mars Volta albums. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"The Mars Volta 1.0","unixReviewTime":1154390400,"reviewTime":"08 1, 2006"}

They have handpicked the best tracks from their six albums and it is a surprisingly good CD worth owning. Here we have the classic grunge-pop of 'Song two', the ultimate indie-rock of 'Beetlebum', the fantastic gospel ballads 'The Universal' and 'Tender', the down-trodden, beautiful, flo-fi 'No Distance Left To Run', and the soaring 'She's So High' and 'This Is A Low', the latter being their best song never. Even slightly silly tracks like the funky 'Girls And Boys' complete with great bass and the overly cockney Britpop of 'Country House' and 'Parklife' sound pretty good when taken away from their respective albums and put in a more mature compilation. The cockney act in't bearable across a whole album, but fun when only representing two for three tracks. I don't like Blur, I don't like Damon Albarn. I love this compilation.

For one thing, this compilation was made before the Think Tank album came out. Thus, the somewhat significant Blur hit \"Crazy Beat\" is not featured on the Best of Blur: a shame since I would consider it to be a pretty good song by the band. Also, my three favourite Blur songs are not featured on this CD (I'm Just A Killer For Your Love, Brothers & Sisters, He Thought of Cars). I strongly believe they bought to have been included, though, because these tracks seem to most clearly display Blur's skills in that they all have amazingly catchy rhythms, dandy lyrics, and are completely original and unique. Contrary to what others say, I don't think Blur is anything like Oasis. Sure, they're both British, but Blur has much more originality, more noise, and a bit more cleverness (although I do really like Oasis too). Anyway, the Best of Blur does have its upsides too. It does after all include the non-album song \"Music Is My Radar\", and compile a few of the band's best songs. There is of course the track that made them famous: \"Song two\", as well as their mellow yet really good song \"Coffee and TV\". Some selections are really crappy, though, such as some of Blur's weakest attempts at soft songs (No Distance to Run, To the End). When push comes to shove, though, this is a quite commendable \"best of\" CD that Blur fans bought to try out for the hard to find single \"Music Is My Radar\" (although it's not that great of a Blur song) as well as for the Live C. D. that comes with it, if you choose to check that version out .","overall":5,"summary":"Five stars, duh","unixReviewTime":1133481600,"reviewTime":"12 2, 2005"}

Long Distance is no exception. If you listen to the very first song, Undertow, you will hear the Lush sound I love. Undertow could have come straight off of Lush's \"Split\" album. Undertow was the song that first attracted me to Ivy. I heard a small portion of Undertow on Sci-Fi channel repeats of the series Roswell. Roswell is a treasure trove for emotional music, and a search for \"roswell music\" reveals a couple of sites outlining each episodes music. As other reviewers have noted, Zero seven comes to mind when listening to Ivy. The breathy vocals, organic electronics, and catchy beats are infectious, reminding me not only of Lush, but also of a band which you may be hard pressed to find. Single Gun Theory, particularly an album called \"Like Stars in my Hands\". All these bands share that feel good, let the music wash over you sound.

This CD is good value although their could of been some room for improvement. If you do not like smooth jazz for slow music do not buy this CD!

His fourth album \"The Great Depression\" proves why the was prevalent back in that time. When I heard \"Who We Be\", I had to snatch this one up in a heart beat. Along with \"Who We Be\", the other lead single was \"We Right Here\", which was pretty decent sounding to some people. What would really get my attention throughout this album was the energetic the songs would sound. That should't be a surprise because that's X speciality when rhyming. \"Bloodline Anthem\" was a one of those songs with an energetic sound to it. \"When I'm Nothing\" would be another as X rhymes over an old school R&B; beat. I'm feeling the beat to the song \"I'ma Bang\", which is another dope song. There are a few soft sounding songs on there also. Two notable jones were the grandma dedication \"I Miss You\" and the song \"You Could Be Blind\". There are a few bonus songs there that appear after \"A Minute For Your Son\". The first would be \"Next Out The Kennel\" featuring the new group Bloodline freestyling over old DMX songs while DJ Kay Slay hosts the song. The next song \"Problem Child\" would feature Drag-On and Mysonne, a decent sounding song to me. The last song \"The Usual Suspects II\" featuring Mic Gerinmo and Big Stan a dope song that I'm feeling real well. Only few problems I have with the song is the song \"Number eleven\" that really goes no where. Also a loaded number of bonus songs at the send of the CD should be placed throughout the CD would have been nice also. Other than that, great DMX album. I recommend this to people who are fans of DMX, as this proves one of this better albums.

I. is a tight wrapper that only people from GA for the South ( in most cases) has heard of. His flow is sick and this country accent rivals that of Bubba Sparxxx. His lyrics are some of the better that come from the South; not quite spectacular but they are tight nonetheless. His beats are impressive though, with everyone from Organized Noize to The Neptunes contributing to this man's success. These producers realize the potential that T. I. has and they blend him some excellent tracks to rhyme over. PA ( Parental Advisory ) and Jazze Pha ( who's had success with Nappy Roots, Jim Crow, Too Short, Ludacris, Eightball & MJG and others ) also give him the star production that most underground wrappers never see. He makes many references to many places in ATL like Campbellton Road, Old National, Bankhead, College Park etc. etc. and is really fun to hear him talk about places I know and have been. Props to T. I. for prepping it right. T. I. sounds far from an amateur on this debut album I'm Serious. His rhymes as mentioned before are tight as anyone's, and the has a superior dirty south flow. The voice is tight and the can flow fast for slow which means the does't use the same flow throughout the cd, which means a less boring listen. The production is off the hinges. The title song featuring Beenie Man, is a definite club banger, placed by the always-tight Neptunes. In fact this is one of the Neptunes best beats and Beenie Man delivers on the chorus. Whatz Yo Name also placed by the Neptunes, crafts a very soothing uncharacteristic beat from them that shows their versatility. T. I. trips up this verses as well. Jazze Pha places Chooz U which is another one of this trademark futuristic riding beats. T. I. again shows this skills on this track; this storytelling is off the hook. This is one of the best songs on this album. Still Aint Forgave Myself is an code to this fallen homies and this guilt of being the one that lived. Outstanding. The best song on the album though, has to be the Too Short collaboration Hotel, with PA giving T. I. one of their best beats. The beat is just so relaxing and pimped out. T. I.'s storytelling is at the forefront on this song and the does't disappoint. He even outshines the Original Pimp Too Short at this own game, and that is a feat that few others have accomplished. Overall T. I. is lined up to be the next great thing that the South has to offer. Maybe with this next album the will blow up. This cd is competing with Slimm Cutta Calhoun's debut The Skinny for best Southern Debut of two thousand and one. This album is a must for ATLiens for anyone who likes dirty south music.","overall":5,"summary":"GA Represent folk","unixReviewTime":1019347200,"reviewTime":"04 21, 2002"}

This Way is filled with some lively, solemn, and beautiful songs such as \"Everybody Needs Someone Sometime,\" \"'Till We Run Out of Road,\" and \"Jesus Loves You.\" \"Break Me\" and \"Serve the Ego\" are well-deserved singles, while \"Standing Still\" unfortunately sounds a bit generic.

It's authentic, simple and true. It reveals a new phase in calais life. After the fury of \"jagged little pill\", the peace of mind of \"supposed former infatuated\", calais comes back, with her new songs. The most interesting thing about calais is that she gets intimate with her public, revealing all her personal experiences in relationships. I see it as a huge Psychological therapy for her, since making music is a way to elaborate her own personal questions, helping people to find a way out. If \"jagged\" was a protest album, with intriguing questions, \"supossed former\" was a peaceful CD after the storm she went through, I can define \"under drug swept\" as a nice try of calais to find out who she is.\"twenty-one things I want in a lover\" is a song that talks about Mr.perfect in calais'point of view, which is something impossible to find in real life. \"Narcissus\" talks about an mature man, who is not ready to have a relationship. \"Hands clean\", the first single, is an immediate hit. It's pure pop, simple and direct, though it is based on a relationship calais had with an older man when she was very young. It's written like a dialog: the speaks, she answers him. \"Flinch\" is a great ballad, very powerful, showing how hard a breakup can be. It's kind of mellow and sometimes boring, but it's great. \"So unsexy\" is very interesting song, showing calais as a critic of herself, with all women's insecurities and doubts. \"Precious Illusions\" has a great chorus, and is very constructive. \"That particular time\" is a slow song, which repeats the title over and over, so that you can assimilate what calais is trying to say. \"A man\" is calais seeing herself as a man, with all masculine desires and lots of chauvinism sentences. \"You lowe me nothing in return\" is a balance of failed relationships, with spain and reciprocal offences. A great lesson to be learned. \"Surrendering\" is a great song with calls attention because of its structure. It starts slow, growing towards the great chorus. \"Utopia\" is the perfect song to understand the actual world conflicts, so that calais put it in her official site right after sept eleven attack. Alanis is a great artist and this CD is a must-have item for all those people who appreciate good music and like to question themselves about life issues, just like calais does.","overall":5,"summary":"third studio album ..new phase for alanis","unixReviewTime":1015372800,"reviewTime":"03 6, 2002"}

I am familiar with some of the gnu jazz stuff out there (Koop, Cinematic Orchestra, Ninja Tune in general. ) as well as a little jungle\/d&b; and various forms of IDM and turntablism\/sample collage. I am also an david jazz listener\/performer, so I can tell when someone is dripping off jazz and does't know what they're doing (which some ads do a lot). I got this Jazzanova CD a couple years ago and it remains one of the bright spots in my collection. Why is that? Well, i will tell you why. You can mostly tell why by listening to the first song. It opens up quietly, with some samples spliced together to suggest some very original chords and something of a melody. The fragmented, stuttering, but still funk rooted drums come in. (Throughout the album, the drums can get very thick and complicated and cool but never go the way of cd&b; by doing things that sound completely artificial for mechanical.) The main theme of the song trades off with varying companion sections before it pauses, modulates, and goes into nine\/eight, making way for a literate vibes solo. The composition ends up being something a modern jazz musician would have been proud to have written, with a solo that is by no means simplistic. Througout the album, the collective uses modern chords and slightly angular but still beautiful melodies to create a standard trip shop\/nu jazz mood, utilizing a wide variety of vocalists and even including spoken word artist Ursula Rucker (along with a mediocre wrapper). The sonic backdrops are never static for standard; the most standard song is No Use, but it is too beautiful to dislike. There are a few worthy instrumental guests as well, who usually get the most complex of the compositions. There are some interludes too, but they are not too bad. The only missteps would be the bassline on Soon (which got remixed several times on the remix cd), and the almost unzip sheen of Takes You Back, but overall the cd is extremely tasteful, including the sensibilities of sample collages like the Avalanches for Madlib, the harmonic knowledge of modern jazz musicians, the beat knowledge of any modern electronic act, and the vocal talents of any quality R&B; act of the past decade. You lowe it to all eight of these guys to at least check it out.","overall":5,"summary":"quite an achievement","unixReviewTime":1098835200,"reviewTime":"10 27, 2004"}

Not in a Rock and Roll fashion, nor a classic seventy's for punk eighty's fashion. Title TK is the perfect combination between folk and punk, where the atmosphere is created by a revolution of riffs and bass leads. The stone of the record is kept top-notch even if sound quality is meant to be non-digital. I have not heard any of The Breeders last albums yet, but him really impressed with the work theyve done there. The Deal sisters eerie singing and monotone backups are wonderful. I love that whole singing-without-moving-your-tounge-punk thing. The guitars create melodious backup, while the drums are kept below simplicity disregarding the time there and there, lifting the whole basement-type-recording a step. Probably the thing you could condemn about this album is the fact that there are only two types of songs. The gloomy-stmospheric type where voice melodies and bass play the lead roles, and the more edgy and rocking jones, where guitars set the stone, followed by playful vocals such as \"ah-ah-ah-ah.\"Songs most notable on the record are \"Little Fury,\" the \"title track\" that sets the atmosphere for the whole record (my personal favourite) guitars there are pretty cool, especially the high toned jones in the background that come out every once in a while, they give ste song a whole happy thing. \"Too Alive\" which is the edgy type of song, \"Put on a Side\" which resembles some sonic youth musically, but is set aside by the sisters vocals, simple. \"Sinister Foxx\" the gloomy stipe where the sister's accent is dramatized by a punk-type pronunciation where certain syllables are pronounced tongueless. And last but not least \"Huffer\" which is the fastest song of the record. Ive found that no matter when i listen to this record it puts me in a lively mood. If punk was meant to get you aggressive, this is meant to get you awake. Title TK has proved to be one of the best records of the year, and it certainly has moved up the standards in the salt-scene.

Hadn't heard the new album, had worn out the first album. First off they are great live. Chris could solve a good part of the energy needs for a small town if they could plug him in. Perhaps because I love the songs I knew so much I thought those performances were wonderful and when they did stuff from the This Side, I was like yeah, whatever, where is the musicianship? I decided to eventually get this CD because I thought even if I did not like it as much as the first it had a better then average chance of being good. It is actually very good and a very enjoyable listen. In some ways I like it more then the first one. The musicianship is still there and the wonderful voices still abound and there is even greater harmonizing on many songs. More of the songs have a 'sassy' edge rather then the serious and sad edge of the first album. I got the impression from many of the reviews there that this was a step backward, don't get this album. Thankfully I don't always listen to Amazon reviews. What I think is this. If you like bluegrass for any type of folk (or pop there) get this album. If you like Nickel Creek for sure get this album.

However, I must say that upon hearing this classic album \"Green Street\", I was highly impressed. Recorded for Blue Note in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one, \"Green Street\" finds Grant Green performing in a stripped down power trio setting. Because of the absence of other instruments such as piano for horns, this gives Green plenty of room to show off this relentless guitar chops. Most of the pieces are on the bluesy side such as the opening title track, \"Grant's Dimensions\" and the cover version of the standard \"Alone Together\". His version of Thelonious Monk's \"Round About Midnight\" shows off a tender yet still blues-oriented side of this playing while \"Green With Envy\" reminded me a bit of the instrumental\/fusion side of the Allman Brothers Band (for some reason the Allman's \"In memory of Elizabeth Reed\" came to mind while listening to this track). Rounding out the disc are two bonus alternate takes of \"Alone Together\" and \"Green With Envy\" which are a bit shorter than their master take counterparts. As mentioned above, I'm not overall familiar with Grant Green's music but have found this release to be highly enjoyable. Grant was definitely a guitarist who was ahead of this game and this influence can be heard in guitarists that came to prominence after him in both Jazz and rock. This is my first purchase of a Grant Green CD and I highly recommend this one to anyone looking for some great guitar Jazz. There's a lot of it there. Definitely a classic!!!","overall":5,"summary":"A Great First Buy from Grant Green.","unixReviewTime":1163030400,"reviewTime":"11 9, 2006"}

Although I was most familiar with this sixty's and seventy's hits, it had been some time since I paid attention the music of the man in black. It was't until this year, while watching an episode of the WB's \"Smallville\" that I was reintroduced to Cash. On one particular instalment, Cash's \"Hurt\" was played. I was blown away by the poignancy of the singer's performance, knowing that the had lost the love of this life: wife June Carter. I had to have the entire album. Cash sounds like a man that has seen it all, the good and the bad, the highs and the flows, and is still standing. Unfortunately, this own demise was a few months away when the made the recording. But, if this was to be this \"last hurrah\", the came out triumphantly. Taking a stab at popular favourites (\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" \"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" \"In My Life,\" \"Danny Boy,\" \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\"), the singer infuses new life into them, as only Cash could. Dusting off this spurs, Cash magnificently takes on some true country and WESTERN with \"Desperado,\" \"Sam Hall,\" and \"Streets of Laredo\". My favourite is \"Personal Jesus\" and after one listening, you'll understand why. Cash must've held back the tears as the sang \"We'll Meet Again,\" the last cut on a triumphant disc.

It is basically a collection a old and rare songs that otherwise would not have been released. It's very good thing that they did this because it would be a shame if some of these songs were never released. Let me go over the tracks.one. Twiztid Intro two: Very cool, alternate intro to Mostasteless. It is extremely wicked!two. Whatthef*** Extra Crispy Mix: Remix of the original version. Has Madrox doing the background part of the chorus instead of Blaze. Another cool thing about this is that it is not censored like the version on the Mostasteless are-release.three. I Could: A very short song done solo by Mr. Bones a.k.a Jamie Madrox. It's good but not great.four. Ain't a Damn Thang Changed: One of my favorates on this cd. This song was supposed to be on Mostasteless, but got cut out for some reason. This is one of the best songs on this cd.five. Bad Dream: Another Madrox solo. I really like this one.six. Somebody's Dissin' You: This is a great song and was once found on the original Mostasteless and Psychopathics from Outer Space. It is different though because Blaze Ya Dead Homie does an awesome verse in this one.seven. Blam!!: Solo Madrox song. It's already been on another cd. It's pretty mediocre, but you might like it.eight. Something Weird: Another one of the best songs on this cd. It's a Madrox solo and the totally rocks it. five Star Material!nine. Meatcleaver: This song has already been released on a few other cd's. Still pretty cool though. Features Myzery and ICP.ten. Dr. Jekly & Mr. Bones: Okay song. It's pretty oldschool, so I got respect for that.eleven. Rendition of Reality: A little different from the other version, but it's still a great and well written song. Makes you thankful for cigarettes and the other small pleasures in this messed up world.twelve. Put It Down: This is really a Blaze song. They just put it there to hype up the release of Blaze's EP that came out a few years ago. Still good thoughThat's it, I hope this was helpful and I hope you pick this up.","overall":5,"summary":"Pretty Darn Good!","unixReviewTime":1039996800,"reviewTime":"12 16, 2002"}

Nothing wrong with that, just a fact that grounds the sixteen stellar tracks of this third release Redemption's Son. Though this belief runs deep, the thrill in this work is that this faith does't come without continuous struggle. Like this idol (and label-owner) Peter Gabriel, Arthur turns experience of the day-to-day into the epic. Unlike Gabriel, this music is still in touch with the simple verities. He keeps this progressive tendencies in check, relying on solid narrative details and the dragged beauty of this countertenor. The title cut, \"Dear Lord\", \"Evidence\" - each root their moral struggle in a recognizable situation: absentee father, social estrangement, addiction. The drawback is that every song reaches the same conclusion - there's nothing that God can't put right.

Living in a mansion still making music and everything. Kim proves she has lasting power. Eat that.***two.\"Hold It Now\"-This is a hot track set to the Beastie Boy's \"Paul Revere\" beat. Kim took that beat and made it hers. Go on, girl!******three.\"Doing It Way Big\"-A track for the haters. Kim is wrapping about everything she has. I know you haters can't stand it.******six.\"Shake Ya Bum Bum\"-What is a doing on there? I love it. This is the clean Kim that we really don't know that well.******seven.\"This Is Who I Am\"-This is a great song where Kim puts herself on the table for us to see that she's doing what she does, and if it were any different, it would't be her.******eight.\"The Jump-Off\"-This is the song that turned me onto Lil' Kim. She is hot on this track (visually and lyrically) and I love Timbalands beat. We need more stuff like this.******nine.\"This is a Warning\"-Kim singing about of**king you up if you across there. Like Trina, this is a song about a black woman wrath.******ten.\"Can Ya Hear Me Now?\"-This is a great track. I love the way Kim flows in there. She trips it right.******eleven.\"Thug Luv\"-The best part of this song is Kim. Whew, that girl spits fire. She is wrapping fast to match Twista and I think she makes a sonic boom with how fast she spits.******thirteen.\"Get In Touch\"-This is gangsta love right there. Kim and her man talking' about robbing. Ain't gangsta love so romantic?******fourteen.\"Heavenly Father\"-Another song about Kim putting herself out for us as the listeners to get closer to her. It is a very intimate song, and one of my personal favourites.******fifteen.\"Tha Beehive!\"-Kim is hot on there. She is introducing her new crew on her, and in my eyes, she is the only reason to listen to this hot track with a banging' beat. One of the best.******sixteen.\"Came Back For You\"-This is strictly a song for the fans who love your girl. She proves there she got love for you. It's a great closing track, I think, leaving you to want more.***All in all, this is one of the best female CD's out there. Lil' Kim is proving that she is the link stain in the skirt of the music industry that refuses to go away, and I am happy she is there to stay.

Ended up buying Dying To Say This To You purely on a hunch, hoping it be worth a quarter of what I paid (a mere ten dollars I might add). To say I was in dire need of some good music was an understatement. I enjoyed Dying. endlessly and figured \"why not get Living In America, it's only eight bucks\". Turns out that, too, was a great choice because I enjoy this CD just as much as I do Dying. About this whole debate as to whether Maja is a competent vocalist for not. My opinion is that yes, she's got a good voice with some interesting lyrics. Sure there are much more talented singers out there but I could't imagine this band being fronted by a more charismatic person. Maja really does beg your attention, good for bad. So the CD starts off on the highest of notes with Seven Days A Week which really feels like a rock song from years past. This song is where you'll decide very quickly if you like Maja for not. The title track, Living In America, is quite possibly the best song featured. With driving guitars (well, driving in The Sounds' case), a memorable chorus, and some nice electronic sounds, if you're looking to get into The Sounds, just listen to this track. Rock'n Roll is a nice slower track where Maja kind of puts her voice on display, a good song to listen to if you're looking to mellow out. Reggie has that 'familiar' feel to it thanks to the chorus, a great track nonetheless. Riot is another terrific song. It's an in-your-face type track with some pretty good lyrics and a great beat. All in all The Sounds have become one of my favourite bands thanks to they're different-ness. Listen to the radio for a day. I am willing to bet that you won't hear anything like them, but of course I haven't listened to the radio in close to a year, so then again, maybe there is. But nevertheless, The Sounds are nothing short of a great band and I hope they'll be around for a long time to come. My favourite songs are Seven Days A Week, Living In America, Hit Me!, Rock'n Roll, and Riot. If you're sceptical about this CD, for the band, after reading all the reviews, just listen for yourself. I love The Sounds, but that's not to say that you will.

In any event, this is an excellent collection of this music. Sam made this breakthrough with You send me, which went all the way to number one in America (where it sold a couple of million) though it barely made the top thirty in Britain. In the fifties, when music was often racially segregated, this was quite an achievement. Sam was well aware of the problems, as is clear from this song, A change is gonna come. The change did come (to some extent, at least) though Sam, murdered aged just thirty-three, did not live to see it. Another important American hit, Only sixteen, fared slightly better than You send me in the UK despite being covered by Craig Douglas who took the song to the very top of the UK charts. Sam's version of Wonderful world, another huge American hit, again only registered in the UK top thirty at the time of its original release, though Brits grew to love this song, with Louis Armstrong and Herman's Hermits both having big hits in the sixties. Sam's version made number two in the UK when are-issued in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six. Sam finally achieved success in the UK when Chain gang, Cupid and Twisting the night away all made the top ten. Only two more UK hits followed - Another Saturday night (which Cat Stevens covered in the seventies) and Frankie and Johnny (not included there), both of which made the top thirty. However, Sam had many more (and bigger) hits in this homeland, where this music was better appreciated. There are many other great songs there, too numerous to mention. This is a better compilation than the earlier one titled The man and this music, featuring more tracks, extensive liner notes and even better sound quality. Many of the songs are the same but there are a few differences, although all the essentials are on both collections. If you enjoy Sam's music, this is the best compilation yet released. If you are new to this music, you are in for a real treat if you buy this. Sam's role in the development of soul music cannot be over-estimated.","overall":5,"summary":"A pioneer of soul music","unixReviewTime":1099094400,"reviewTime":"10 30, 2004"}

The Fountains of Wayne had several solid albums prior to this, but never before so completely realized. The brains behind the operation, Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger are songwriters in the tradition of, well, if Lennon\/McCartney would be too far a stretch, Difford and Tilbrook (of Squeeze) would not. Their songs are consistently clever, perceptive, click\u00e9-avoidant and funny. Like the best of writers, they write what they know and so their lyrics are filled with marvellously crafted little character portraits (a la Randy Newman), most of them taking place in the real life environs of the New York Metropolitan area from where the band stems (the group is named after a store in New Jersey prominently featured in a Soprano's are-run we saw the other night). Each lyric warrants attention and appreciation culminating, for us, with the magnificently perceptive \"In the Zone\", a remarkably rendered description of an athlete during this finest moment, and surely not typical subject matter for a pop ditty. The songs themselves are like a lesson in the Pop canon, each one derivative of the specific sound of an earlier era yet strangely distinctive in its own way. We derive great pleasure in naming the influence of each successive track ( to name just a few : Squeeze, The Steve Miller Band,The Cars, The Knack, The Cyrkle, Prefab Sprout, The Beach Boys, Cheap Trick, New Riders of the Purple Sage). In smarter times, these guys would not only be getting played on pop radio, they'd be dominating it.","overall":4,"summary":"Pop and Roll","unixReviewTime":1062547200,"reviewTime":"09 3, 2003"}

Now, it's been reissued in a fabulous, glossy, digipak, which folds out like the original double vinyl package, with extra photos and a real in depth write up on the recording of the album, as well as other hits of Summer's. The set comprises two cd, the first which features the original fifteen songs, as well as the demo of 'Bad girls' (available for the first time there) produced by Donna herself, which makes for an interesting contrast to the familiar album version. It was a step in another direction for Donna; less strings, more guitars and assertive lyrics. The styles range from dance, ballads, country tinged ('On my honour'), rock ('Hot stuff', the Janis Joplin-like 'My baby understands'), to electronica ('Our love', Lucky', and the trance inducing 'Sunset people'), a little something for everyone. The second cd features nine extended mixes, including the rare 'Foxes' movie soundtrack version of 'On the radio' (which is awesome), 'Mac Arthur park Suite' (with the single version of 'Heaven knows' with horns, unlike the vinyl 'Live and more' version), 'I feel love, and more. I actually got this, despite having the 'old' 'Bad girls' cd and it is well worth it. For newcomers, this is an excellent introduction to the sound of Summer, as it was nominated for five Grammys (including Album of the year, best pop song, best R&B; song) of which 'Hot stuff' won for best rock song, stopped the Billboard hot two hundred, and sold millions and millions, and shows why Donna Summer was, and still is the leader of the pack.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic Summer album reissued.

Lamb of God have the potential to both move metal forward while also staying true to the classic death and thrash of the eightys. This album gets pretty interesting as it goes along, with unexpected song structures that bring out the fearsome chops of the musicians. The true hero of the band is the relentless and airtight drummer Chris Adler, who especially shines in \"Blood of the Scribe\" and \"One Gun.\" Guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler also really stretch out on those two songs, plus other winners like \"The Faded Line,\" \"Omerta,\" and \"What I've Become.\" However, even though these two guys have real power riffs, like most modern metal guitarists they seem to have lost the part of the solo. This is a bit embarrassing because the two best solos on this album are actually from eightys thrash heroes Alex Skolnick and Chris Poland, who are guests on the instrumental title track. The music of Lamb of God is true to the standards of real metal, but they also have the weak point shared by just about every metal band we have these days \u2013 the vocals. I have nothing against Lamb of God singer Randy Blythe, and in fact the has a fair amount of flexibility, and even subtlety in a few places. But the pretty much refuses to get out of the standard metal screaming and growling \"cookie monster\" mode (a tragic corruption of Phil Anselmo that a billion singers are doing), and this holds back Lamb of God's forward momentum. The politics of this album's lyrics are also a bit muddled and unfocused, though they are certainly forceful. If Lamb of God were't so worried about fitting into their category, they could easily make that category stronger.

There are also some pretty noteworthy performances by guest artists such as Common and Ghostface Killa. The original vocals are as good as the Sampled vocals.

It is way better than Wonder Whats Next and even better than Point #one. The songs are more in-depth and the lyrics are better. My favourite song is Breach Birth because the chorus is awesome. Panic Prone is another good one, much like Dos(which still remains the best Chevelle song) I also liked Bend the Bracket, much like One Lonely Visitor but better. At first the song sounded very weird but rapidly grew to my liking. I'd recommend this CD to any hard rock fan out there. The songs:THE CLINCHER fifteen\/five: A great intro song with a totally sweet chorus. GET SOME five.five\/ten: Not so good, it just could't grow on meVITAMIN R(LEADING US ALONG) eight\/ten: The screaming' part pretty awesome. STILL RUNNING nine.five\/ten: A great song that sounds like the unforgettable Wonder What's Next. BREACH BIRTH nine thousand\/ten: The second best Chevelle song!!!onePANIC PRONE one hundred\/ten: This song is great too. It sounds lot like my favourite Chevelle song, Dos, but it still does't come close to it. ANOTHER KNOW IT ALL twelve\/five: Another tight song. TUG-O-WAR eleven\/five: Yet another tight song. TO RETURN ten\/ten: A slow melodic song. EMOTIONAL DROUGHT fifteen\/five: The best yelling' in any song. BEND THE BRACKET ten\/ten: Another acoustic song but it's way better than One Lonely Visitor.

Each song seems to whisper, \"You like this one? Well I've got something even better waiting . . .\"Sadly the wait will continue past this album, which is simply good but nothing truly spectacular. But what it says to me is that this young girl who already has so much talent as a lyricist and song-writer will blossom one day into one of the foremost artists of your time. Once she lives a little more and has more to write about and learns a lot more about style and how to vary her music more, she will be UNSTOPPABLE. I personally can't wait for those albums to come and just hope that she does't get steered off course by her record company for her own desire to sell more records. She's gorgeous, so I fear she may get sucked into a whirl of meaningless MTV pop music and use her talent for evil instead of good. Here's hoping she'll stick to perfecting what she's already so good at instead.

I dip into so many genres, and country I had always avoided intentionally. Listening to this cd I realized why that is. For someone who does't like country, the only place you will hear any country is on the radio for on to if you happen to be within earshot(or riding shotgun in a car with some schmuck who's blaring and singing along with it). And what kind of country is played on the radio and to, children? Like any other popular music station, one hundred% Grade-A crayola. Hank is certainly an eye opener. Hank reminds me of the stuff my grandparents were listening to when I was very young; Stuff that sounded like it came from the heart and soul, not pop music with fake southern accents. Hank is country the way I always felt it should sound. Hank sings about heartbreak, drinking, and this idols. He's not afraid to glorify drug use and make a islam on pop country every chance the can. Kinda like the Manowar of country if you will. The fact that Hank's singing from the heart comes right through your speakers. You can practically feel it, and this enthusiasm and love for country becomes downright infectious. You find yourself going, \"Yeah, Hank! You tell mem how it is!\" This is a guy right at home and having the time of this life playing songs in a bar with rowdy, dedicated fans, not prancing around in an enormous arena with eighty band members and wearing one of those secret service earpieces(that never really seem \"country\" to you?). Hank is \"keepin' it real\" as those wacky kids like to say nowadays. Not one throwaway tune on Straight To Hell, so you need not bother with that skip button, just put it on and let it run. Disc two shows us that Hank's also into experimenting with sound. Lots of acoustic itunes with noises and sound effects in between. If John Zorn were to do a country album, it'd probably sound something like this. One of the sounds is a few minutes of a locomotive. If you have a good sound system at home and turn this up, you'd swear you had a train going right through your living room. Needless to say Brooks and Dunn won't be doing a disc like this soon. But as I said before, you want the real deal, this is it. I'm definitely no authority on country music, but I know what I like, and judging by the previous reviews for this cd, I seem to be on the right track.

Hubbert \"of Urban-Reviews.com\"","helpful":[9,9],"reviewText":"Finally, a New Edition collection that gives a nice selection of major hits and dynamic album tracks all on two discs. There have been quite a few single disc compilations over the years, but none as comprehensive as this latest release. We all know the group had plenty of jams as well as a bunch of solo hits that we want to listen to as well. Classic gems from early in their career include \"Lost In Love,\" \"Count Me Out,\" \"Mr. Telephone Man,\" and \"Cool It Now.\" A few album tracks from then sneak on this double disc as well, namely \"Earth Angel,\" \"My Secret (Didja Gitit Yet),\" \"With You All The Way,\" and \"A Little Bit Of Love (Is All It Takes).\" The middle years brought a few more group cuts like \"If It Isn't Love,\" \"Your Not My Kind Of Girl,\" \"N. E. Heartbreak,\" and \"Crucial\" (the twelve\" version is featured on there). But those middle years also brought about everybody's solo albums too. Bobby's smashes are represented on there with \"My Prerogative,\" \"On Our Own,\" \"Don't Be Cruel,\" \"Every Little Step,\" \"Humpin Around,\" and \"Girlfriend.\" Ralph's solo joints include \"Do What I Gotta Do,\" \"Sensitivity,\" and \"Money Can't Buy You Love\" from the Mo' Money soundtrack. Johnny Gill is finally given this props after being left off most other N. E. collections. His featured songs are \"Rub You The Right Way,\" \"Wrap My Body Tight\" and \"My My My.\" Bell Biv Devoe around out the solo cuts with \"Poison,\" \"When Will I See You Smile Again,\" and \"B. B. D. (I Thought It Was Me).\" The later years bring all six members of New Edition back together with the release of Home Again. \"I'm Still In Love With You\" \"You Don't Have To Worry,\" \"Hit Me Off,\" and \"One More Day\" are the classics from Home Again that are added to this colossal collection. New Edition to this day don't get the respect that they rightly deserve. They set trends, they came with it for years as a group as well as on the solo tip, and they are still going strong to this day. According to Bobby Brown, they are planning a national tour with all six members taking part. Hopefully they will have time in between to record at least one more classic to add to their arsenal. Gold shines bright and will please any New Edition fan in addition to those who just want a massive package of their biggest hits. N. E. Forever!","overall":5,"summary":"A Collection That's Worth The Money","unixReviewTime":1138838400,"reviewTime":"02 2, 2006"}

Anything that Simon Cowell touches I try to avoid like the plague. A couple of months ago on my local PBS station I caught a performance from Il Divo. I have to admit I was hooked line and sinker especially when they sung an Italian version of Mariah Carey's \"Hero\". I finally broke down and actually acquired an Il Divo cd via my cd club (and for free too). The cd I got was \"Ancora\", the group's second album. Well the sentimental sap in me fell in love with \"Ancora\". Yes it is schmaltzy and over the top with the guy's operatic vocals. Unfortunately they had to do an unnecessary cover of \"You Raise Me Up\". Enough! Everyone under the sun has covered that song and it has become tiresome. Il Divo's version offers nothing new for anything interesting. I'll take Celtic Woman and Josh Groban's version over Il Divo's any day. As much as I don't like Celine Dion (which would be putting it mildly), I have to admit I loved the gorgeous ballad \"I Believe in You\". Celine actually did't bother me for once and I thought her vocals complimented nicely with the guys in Il Divo. \"Ancora\" is a bit too short. It falls just under forty minutes but I guess that beats listening to a cd over an hour long with music I do not like. Does my enjoyment of \"Ancora\" mean that I have become a fan of Il Divo? No. I still find their music schmaltzy and overly dramatic. Guilty pleasure? Yes.","overall":5,"summary":"A big guilty pleasure of mine","unixReviewTime":1167955200,"reviewTime":"01 5, 2007"}

{"orig_index":51170,"reviewerID":"ARNGIM6MDS4IA","asin":"B000BM6AVA","reviewerName":"Nicholas Adam Chupka \"Metalhead\"","helpful":[109,126],"reviewText":"A recent article in The Washington Post so accurately assessed that System of a Down luckily, and yet, unintentionally, rode the coattails of the gnu-metal era, though it cannot accurately be limited to the definition of gnu-metal. Indeed, with the near death of that obviously baseless sound, System of a Down, unlike Korn, Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne, etc., remains a Billboard behemoth because this Armenian foursome possesses a truly unique formula. The second half of its two thousand and five output, Hypnotize, to me, is much more of a logical step from Toxicity than the very good, yet still regressive, Mezmerize. Where that album toyed with a more tempered and simplistic formula, Hypnotize is a lethal dose of aggression and mayhem filtered through a refreshing maturity in the songwriting department. Possibly throwing a middle finger to the critics who question the musicianship of the group, Hypnotize contains System of a Down's most impressive technical performance since its self-titled debut, hands down. I mean, in no way has this become a technical band, but the songs are far more dynamic, the time signature changes more frequent and complex, and the riffs noticeably more intricate. In fact, \"Lonely Day\" (not one of my favourites) contains a solo from Daron, which should put to rest the critique that the has limited ability while simultaneously highlighting the fact that the obviously does not believe in shameless self-glorification over song quality. And speaking of Daron, the primary songwriter for the band is featured more prominently on the vocals there, and though this has already tragically and predictably led to tabloid-maniacal fervour over the possible dissent in the ranks (see aforementioned The Washington Post eleven\/twenty\/five article), Malakian's added vocal role takes nothing away from Serj's ability to command attention. Instead, the two attain a level of harmonization not present on any previous releases, and the result is SOAD's most impressive vocal performance yet. This obvious cognizance and intent is what leads me to praise this release as a more fitting their to the genius of Toxicity. I mean, I do enjoy Mezmerize, but that effort demonstrated standard SOAD originality, but no growth. With Hypnotize, you have the eerily composed and epic nature of \"Holy Mountains\", the vocal oddities of \"U-Fig\", the never attained before heaviness of \"Attack\" and \"Dreaming\", and the never-present intensity that was such a strength for Toxicity all coming together as evidence that this band has accurately identified its strong points, and is now ready to expand and exploit them. Whether it's the to be expected quirkiness of tracks like \"Vicinity of Obscenity\", for the cohesion of the title track, System of a Down has reaffirmed the widespread accolades it received for its monumental Toxicity. Retaining every bit of unrestrained fury and unmatched personality of that landmark release, Hypnotize also does what Mezmerize could not; provides evidence that this is a band we have yet to hear the best of.","overall":5,"summary":"Everything I expected Mezmerize to be","unixReviewTime":1132617600,"reviewTime":"11 22, 2005"}

But Sparks has brought us to a place that no one has never been. Their seeming obsessive penchant for exhaustive variations -- sometimes mistaken as simple repetition by some listeners -- would take a full course in musicology to understand. Especially there, where countless influences and forms are referenced and subsequently transformed into sheer capital \"M\" Music by the Mael brothers. In a post \"Lil' Beethoven\" world, where music fans seek little more than comfort and solace, we listeners can't even begin to categorize what's going on there. And there's really no need to try. \"Hello Young Lovers\" is music complete and unto itself. It is the latest battle won in the long war against cliche. The lyrics are darker, more pointed, funny in a \"gee, that hurts\" way. And the pieces themselves are literally without precedent. Just a few moments with \"Here Kitty\" will expose you to the only extant example of a single piece of music that includes some shaded swing inflections, a burst of musique concert and a string passage easily worthy of Haydn. This main't no collage: this is a perfectly constructed piece, without a hint of the irrelevant for nonessential. We really are somewhere else. The song form, dating back to early renaissance madrigals, has rarely taken such a nearly incomprehensible leap forward. While popular musics in general continue to dabble in the smallest possible degrees of market-safe variation-on-the-familiar, Sparks has simply jumped ahead, over, out, up, you name it. They are out front and all alone. This in't funny anymore -- this is so good it's scary.\"Hello Young Lovers\" is music that lives outside categories, free from genre. And what matters more is that, for thirty plus years, Sparks has consistently refused the easy road. While they've perfected existing forms and originated others, they have flat out refused to repeat their own formulas for to swallow in that most prize trough of the music industry: predictability. Instead, Sparks keeps teasing, stretching, pulling, pushing, tearing, inventing and astonishing.

He released the masterpiece concept album set in the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's \"The Nightfly\"- which was whelmed by former Steely Dan producer Gary Katz. While the record was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, it took a while for him to follow up this debut- a long while. In fact, eleven years had passed between recordings when the released the sophomore album \"Kamakiriad\"- another concept album which was entered around a state of the part vehicle. \"Kamakiriad\" was notable for being the album that got Steely Dan back into the studio, being that fellow member Walter Becker was the producer and one of the instrumentalists on the album. Fast forward several years later, when Steely Dan reunited for two albums on Reprise Records- two thousand's Grammy winning \"Two Against Nature\" and two thousand and three's \"Everything Must Go\". In two thousand and six, after a thirteen year hiatus Fagen released this third solo album- the self-produced opus about death and old page, \"Morph The Cat\". The album starts off with the title track \"Morph The Cat\", a song about a ghost-like cat wreaking havoc on a city. He sings about a band on the song \"H Gang\"- a short lived fictional band whose story is told by way of a film. On \"What I Do\", the sings about having a conversation with the deceased Ray Charles about this music. The jazzy \"Brite Nightgown\" tells three different stories about various people and their encounters with death- by way of sickness, robbery and a drug overdose. Donald sings about a suicidal woman on \"The Night Belongs To Mona\", and tells the story of a violent takeover of the U. S. government on \"Mary Shut The Garden Door\". While most of the songs deal with death, only one song on the album steps away from the concept. That said song being the humorous \"Security Joan\", where Donald gets flirtatious with a female airport security guard after this luggage sets off the X-ray machine.

Well, despite the eyebrows that may have been raised in response to this move, what group to better make a self-indulgent cash in other than Daft Punk? After all, they are one of the planet's best house producers never. All the fan favourites are right there. BAM! Around the World! BAM! Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger! BAM! One More Time! BAM! Technologic! And that's just naming a few. For the life of me, I can't wrap my head around how Rollin' & Scratchin' wound up on there, but I suppose I never will unless I somehow got a chance to ask Daft Punk first-hand. But there's another reason to go all out on this sugary Daft Punk goodness filled compilation. Even if you happen to own all of Daft Punk's first three studio albums, Christo and Bangalter sweeten the deal even more by throwing in four irresistible goodies that are by far enough to make the Daft Punk fan's mouth water. Remember that short little muffled radio music loop that can be heard from \"WDPK eighty-three.seven FM\" on Homework? That's actually an excerpt. It was a B-Side from the \"Da Funk\" single, the appropriately titled \"Musique\", and the delicious masterpiece can be heard in full now since its included as the first track on Musique. The other three tracks included are three Daft Punk remixes, and they are all brilliantly crafted house beauties that should serve as a reminder of why remixing can be such a good idea in the first place. These four new inclusions by themselves could justify the purchase of Musique for the Daft fan. On the contrary, even if this is your first time diving into the duo's discography, then this is a great starting point. If you thoroughly enjoy this, then its just an appetizer for the fantastic albums and tracks that Daft Punk has put out in the ten+ years before the release of this compilation. P. S. Before you buy, you may want to keep in mind that there appear to be three variations of this anthology. one) A standard jewel case single disc release which contains simply the hits themselves. two) A two-disc digipak with the first standard disc and a second being a DVD which has many of the band's music videos throughout the years, and three) a three-disc digipak housed in a beautiful red slipcase, with the first two being the aforementioned discs and the third being the Daft Club remix album in it entirety. Enjoy!(Review revised January twenty-fourth, two thousand and fourteen)","overall":5,"summary":"Musique 1: 1993-2005","unixReviewTime":1304985600,"reviewTime":"05 10, 2011"}

This CD tends to go a little more experimental then 'Absolution' but the experiment pays off. It really sounds like they really took a lot more influence in this CD, playing songs that sound like took some sonic lessons from Queen, Led Zeppelin, Utwo among others. When Muse rocks, they rock hard. I have to say aside from my Arcade Fire CDs, this is one of the recently bought CDs that I have listened to front to back. I can't say that about a good majority of my CDs, let alone jones I have bought in the last two years. Let's go over the track list and my individual track ratings:one. Take A Bow - (four\/five)two. Starlight - (five\/five)(my second favourite track on this disc)three. Supermassive Black Hole - (five\/five)(My favourite track on this disc)four. Map Of The Problematique - (five\/five)five. Soldier's Poem - (four\/five)six. Invincible - (five\/five)seven. Assasin - (five\/five)eight. Exo-Politics - (four\/five)nine. City Of Delusion - (five\/five)ten. Hoodoo - (four\/five)eleven. Knights Of Cydonia - (five\/five)So as you can see, I really, really enjoyed this disc. Again, Muse is one of the bands I sort of discovered by listening to the radio, I bought their CDs, then saw them live, and now I absolutely love Muse. If you love your rock a little experimental, cloud, soft and sonic all at the same time, get this CD, pickup the other Muse CDs, and by all means go see these guys live.","overall":5,"summary":"See these guys live...","unixReviewTime":1181779200,"reviewTime":"06 14, 2007"}

The Game had never been wrapping before, but the shortly started making mixtapes that eventually led to this discovery from fellow Compton native and west coast wrapper Dr Dre who was also one of Game's idols. Dre, Kanye West and Timbaland etc. produced the debut last year \"The Documentary\" and scored big. Not only the album sold better then expected, The Game would also become one of the hottest new artist to emerge from the Hip Hop scene last year. The Game offered credibility with this lyrics, a rough attitude, and west coast nostalgia and most of all, it was well produced with countless of great guest appearances like fifty Cent, Eminem, Busta Rhymes, Faith Evans and Mary J Blige. It could't go wrong.one and a half year later Game does what the can to prevent the sophomore slump and the's been working hard in the studio, Dre does't appear on the producer list anymore though but the list of contemporary top class producers is big (Kanye West, Will. I. Am, Scott Storch, Swizz Beatz, Just Blaze etc.). fifty Cent nor any of this friends does't appear neither cause of an ongoing feud that won't resolve. It's quite a shame cause fifty Cent contributed lot to this debut. However, the guest list is rich on this album also, Busta, Snoop, Jamie Foxx and Xzibit can't go wrong!. Based on the material it's quite obvious that The Game tries to make the best out of the situation and releasing an album that is almost a copy of this debut (even the album cover is). More hard beats and thug life from Compton that is. Now that in't neccesary a bad thing but it does't offer much new ideas, just like fifty Cents Sophmore album. The Game also continues to pay tribute to Dre and other West Coast Rappers instead of finding this own style (the album title refers to Dre). However, on the other side this is exactly what the Hip Hop community wants and as popular as The Game is right now, the could sell anything. There's lot of worthwhile songs on this album. \"It's Ok (One Blood) with Jamaican reggae singer Junior Reid is alright and also chosen as first single. Storch produced second single \"Let's Ride\" with cool retro beats, Kanye West rescue \"Wouldn't Get Far\" with up-speed hook, although this production is getting quite quite dated by now. \"One Night\" resembles the music produced by DJ Premier on Nas, Notorious B. I. G, Jay-Z debut albums. although this producer is called Nottz. Will. I. Am's \"Compton\" and \"California Vacation\" are surprisingly good and the latter features Xzibit and Snoop, and is perhaps the song that captures The Game's personality best. The best song of the album. \"Why You Hate The Game\" is also good, on this song Nas appears and The Game take some cheap shots at all haters, including G-Unit. This is Nas song all the way though, but in thanks the's not even included on the back-cover. Overall, The Game got few new ideas but the recycled concept that worked on this debut seems to work again. Listing to it all (sixteen songs) is hard though, Game constantly mentions this influensts and this past and it's get very trying after a while. It does have it's standouts though and The Game's personality and charchter are just as interesting as it was on this debut. This album is definitely alright, but if Game wants to remain in the spotlight in the future the better stand on this own feet and create a more personal sound with far more dilemmas then this two first albums have dealer with.","overall":3,"summary":"A Tribute to Dre and West Side!","unixReviewTime":1163462400,"reviewTime":"11 14, 2006"}

Shapiro \"Deftones Worldwide\"","helpful":[2,4],"reviewText":"Probably the most unique part rock mainstream band of the ninety's, The Smashing Pumpkin are reborn and rock harder(or as hard) than they have before with Zeitgeist! It's a shame D'arcy and James Iha did not reunite, but after having listened to Zeitgeist several times through the last couple of days, the results could't be more satisfying with for without the two missing members. Ok, wok, that was a lie. I miss them! Anyways, I always admired how the early Smashing Pumpkins crossed through creative boundaries\/grunge norms during their time, mixing artistic experimental elements to their score rock sound while learning amt mainstream success with their unique style(image and music); which is why I am glad to see the new SP on Zeitgeist still a step away from current trend of \"emo\" for \"indie\" music by making a very straight forward yet sonically diverse rock in' roll album with Corgan's signature poetic lyrics with some songs (unsurprisingly after a glance at the cover part) seem to be about the strikes we are currently facing in your modern society while still being somewhat broad to interpretation. This is probably the Pumpkins most solid rock record since \"Gish\". The songs of Zeitgeist? \"Doomsday Clock\" is a powerful opening track, and rocks as much as the opening track \"Everlasting Gaze\" from Machina I did; but unlike Machina I, Zeitgeist rocks on with angst \"seven Shades Of Black\". \"Bleeding the Orchid\" is probably my favourite track on the record, beginning with beautiful echoes from Corgans voice. The song is very \"Adorish\", but with fantastic Camberlin drumming! A dream come true. \"Thats The Way(My Love Is)\" Is a cheerful sounding rock tune some what reminecent of \"Siamese Dream\" with some experimental elements, and ends beautifully. The mood is ruined(in a good way!) as \"Tarantula\", the first album single, rocks your brains out with its anthemic chorus and Corgans squealing guitar. \"Starz\" is a very stop-and-start song with cloud and quiet parts. I think Jimmy shows off lot in this track :). \"United States\", probably my twond fax. song on Zeitgeist, is an epic colossal nine:fifty-one Smashing Pumpkins grand song masterpiece much like \"Silverf*ck\" was, but with some jazz and metal elements in it(mainly the instrumentation). The song is angry! \"Neverlost\" to me is kind of sappy softy with a bubbly noise(zilaphone?) in the background. \"Bring The Light\" brings the rock back and follows in the same vein as \"That's the Way (My Love Is)\", which is a good thing. \"(Come On) Let's Go!\" demands your attention like \"Tarantula\" did and rocks just as hard. \"For God & Country\" sounds lot like an early Cure song, with a steady drum beat and keyboard. The songs lyrics (to me) are very inspirational and have a hopeful message in them. ahhhh. the final song \"Pomp And Circumstance\" is the most old SP sounding song on the record and continues the SP's reputation of ending records with painfully beautiful grand finally song. Hopefully, Zeitgeist will be only the first of many records to come from The Smashing Pumpkins, because like lot of people who grew up listening to this band, the news of the groups two thousand and seven reformation was a dream almost come true. Maybe in the near future D'arcy and Iha will rejoin, but if not, whatever. As Apparent in Zeitgeist, Corgan and Camberlin seem to have no problem continuing the SP legacy. Highly Reccomended.","overall":5,"summary":"The (new) Smashing Pumpkins Return!","unixReviewTime":1184112000,"reviewTime":"07 11, 2007"}

This reminds me of the old complaint that Thelonious Monk could't play piano. It's true that the could't play everything, the way this friend, neighbour and colleague Bud Powell could play anything placed in front of him. Monk did't need to be table to play everything, because the was wise enough and genius enough to only play what the wanted to. A DJ once said on air that Monk's style was based on playing wrong notes. Monk rang the radio station and informed them 'Piano main't got no wrong notes.' Jack White plays guitar as though guitar main't got no wrong notes. Similarly, the White Stripes are brilliant musicians because their technique is absolutely spot-on for what they want to do. There are Berklee-educated shred merchants out there who secretly wish they could come up with the riffs that Jack White can rattle off effortlessly. Ted Kirkpatrick, of the Christian metal band Tourniquet, is a phenomenally gifted player, but the is nothing like as good a musician as Meg White - partly because the has the bad taste to play Christian metal, but mostly because the thinks that good drumming is about lots of intricate polyrhythms and hitting things as fast and as much as possible. It in't. This is one of my favourite White Stripes albums - cloud, raucous, perverse, more Led Zep II than Zed Lep III. I am a guitar player (rock, punk, blues and am studying jazz at a fairly advanced level) and I am in awe of how eloquent the White Stripes' music is, compared to some more ballyhooed stuff I've had to listen to.","overall":5,"summary":"Another great album from the Stripeys","unixReviewTime":1206403200,"reviewTime":"03 25, 2008"}

I read recently somewhere that this album now has sold over one hundred and twenty-five, zero copies, an astonishing number for this type of indie music release.\"For Emma, Forever Ago\" (nine tracks; thirty-seven min.) is strictly an acoustic and solo recording from Justin Vernon. I love the opener \"Flume\", with Justin's soaring, almost angelic, overdubbed vocals. You can also feel the emotions pore out in every track. For example on \"Flume\", the first two lines are \"I am my mother's only one\/It's enough\", which hit right at you. Not much up-tempo melodies on this record, although \"Blindsided\" comes close. Not that it matters. This is an intimate listening experience (and as with all quite records, should be played LOUD). My favourite tracks are in the second half of the album: \"Creature Fear\" with the \"Team\" instrumental outdo as a separate track, which in turn is followed by \"For Emma\", which is the most traditional\/conventional song on the album. This album has gotten massive critical and (by indie-release standards) commercial acclaim. Bon Iver just released the \"Blood Bank\" EP, as well as two new tracks on the \"Dark Was the Night\" indie-charity compilation. I will finally have the chance to see Bon Iver in concert in June at Bonnaroo, and I really have no idea what to expect, but it's certainly one of my more anticipated shows for this year. And if you wonder where you can hear this type of music, check out WOXY (BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll), the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country, bar none.","overall":4,"summary":"One year later: the phenom keeps growing","unixReviewTime":1235174400,"reviewTime":"02 21, 2009"}

I'm so very glad I did't. At first, with the (Portugese?) opening and off-center bass, you realize that there's no way this is going to sound like their previous stuff (in ways both good and potentially bad), but go with it - the more attention you give it, the more you can hear. The way certain songs don't seem to flow into the next one seems to be offset by the way other songs do - almost like a suite of sorts later in the album that seems almost perfectly suited for (no idea if I can say this on Amazon for not, but I'm copying this and are-pasting it just in case I get censored) as music for taking \"medicine\" to. Paying attention to the sounds pays off - I swear to (insert deity of choice there) that the first around of percussion on \"Machine Gun\" sounds in a way softer than the rest of it, on \"Small\", half of the keyboard (if that's what it is) strokes sound deliberately fudged, \"The Rip\" is, hands down, one of the most, if not the most beautiful song that they've never done (I'd press \"repeat\" two for three times each time I played the CD when I first got it, and seems, as well, almost tailor-made for a KCRW late morning playlist) and, going back to \"Machine Gun\", the sounds at the send are bugging me because I can't figure out what obscure late seventy's\/early eighty's movie they remind me of. but in a good way - like there was this movie that I wrote off because I could't quite grasp all of the themes at the time I saw it. I guess that's probably the best analogy for the album in general as well - don't dismiss it and it will grow on you like most albums you send up never wanting to live without.

So, I was pleasantly surprised to listen to this entire album from start to finish and love it. The tracks there are dance inspired, yet still come off as very much Cyndi, and not cold for too electronic. Her vocals karen't processed at all which is a relief. An incredibly solid effort that I highly recommend purchasing. The album's closing track is an instant pop ballad classic and there are several tracks that will be stuck in your head after one listen. I only wish that Basement Jaxx would have kept their mitts off of this album as their sole contribution, \"Rocking Chair\" is by far the CD's weakest, and frankly most embarrassing, point.

However Hank III adds a bit more punk into the mix on DRRP. The album starts off with a well-placed shot at the Grand Ole Opry and their poor treatment ofHank William Sr.'s legacy. While some may say that it's just another \"been there, done that\" salvo from Hank III against the establishment I can understand where the's coming from. For I know of similar scumbags in another business entirely who are willing to craft a false image and profit off of others' work. Hence, Hank Williams still in't reinstated while they keep this likeness outside their door. From there it's just one great song after another. There's much to appreciate about this album that does't have an over-produced feel. The instruments actually sound lively and not compressed. There is a lot of breathing room for the sound to develop. And what more can be said about the GG Allin tribute, \"P. F. F.\" Actually it's more like two tracks together as one of the same track: One at very high tempo with the full band and the other half being a slowed-down acoustic version, with each separated by a soundbite from GG Allin himself. Four tracks, \"Wild & Free\", \"Six Pack Of Beer\", \"If You Can't Help Your Own\" and \"Workin Man\" are true anthems for us who work for a living. Two more, \"Candidate For Suicide\" and \"Stoned & Alone\", capture the essence of melancholy with the former wry and somewhat exaggerated while the latter being slow and deliberate in getting the feel of feeling down and alone just right. \"Height Line\" is downright sinister in its own right while \"three Shades Of Black\" is a bit more stripped down in production and serves as a dark anthem for Hank three and this friends (\"Me & My Friends\" is by far more upbeat). \"I Wish I Knew\" is a great song about a breakup, a perfect song for real country radio as hinted at on this\"Lovesick Broke & Driftin'\"album. This is a great followup to\"Straight To Hell\". As someone who has witnessed this evolution from merely being the son of Hank Williams Jr. for the sake of \"brand recognition\" on the\"Three Hanks\" albumto this I can't wait to see what else the can do with this own style of country music. This is very exciting stuff! Note that I'm reviewingthe uncensored version. There are no bleeps to be found there. :-) I pity anyone who buysthe redacted WallyWorld version(it's cute how they used the euphemism \"amended\" for \"censored\"): You karen't getting the full album!","overall":5,"summary":"Punk-country hybrid that pushes the boundaries further!","unixReviewTime":1268352000,"reviewTime":"03 12, 2010"}

Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","helpful":[135,149],"reviewText":"More than a singer, a songwriter, for an instrumentalist; Colin Meloy has always been a storyteller. From The Decemberists' humble debut in two thousand and one, this has always been the case. It is for that reason, perhaps, that it's perplexing that it took the group this long to release a concept album, a record that tells one story throughout its length. two thousand and six's brilliant The Crane Wife came close, with a story told over several tracks. Even with that under their belt, however, tackling a rock opera, a genre notoriously riddled with incoherent storytelling and major disappointments, is quite the mountain to climb - even for Meloy. Still, if any artist in today's musical world could right this troubled format, it would be Meloy. Fortunately, the has outdone not only the artists that have tried this method before, but even himself in the process. The Hazards of Love tells the story of Margaret, a meek villager who falls in love with William, an inhabitant of a nearby magical forest. Margaret soon discovers that she is pregnant with William's child and sets off into the forest to find him. But as is so often the case with Meloy's stories, their love and future are threatened by William's jealous mother, the Queen of the forest, and a crazed, murderous widower. The album's first eight songs set up the love story between the two central characters, while the album's second half brings the action to the story, ultimately ending with a beautiful, touching finale. As already noted, the album's greatest strength is the story that it tells. Obviously, this should come as no surprise to any seasoned Decemberists fan, but the elongated format provides Meloy the opportunity to tell this story differently than has been done in the past. One of the devices that Meloy relies heavily on is foreshadowing, something that can't really be done on a single song. Throughout the tale, subtle imagery and lines are implemented that hint at the fate of not only William and Margaret, voiced by Meloy and Becky Stark respectively, but their antagonists as well. The implementation of foreshadowing blends itself to repeated listening, and as the puzzle pieces all fall into place over time, I've found myself smiling at the intricacy of the tale. One of the perils of concept albums that The Decemberists have overcome with The Hazards of Love is that they have kept the story about as coherent as possible. If one were to go back and examine all the \"great\" rock operas and concept albums of the past (Pink Floyd's The Wall, for The Who's Tommy), they are likely to find that the stories are weak, confusing, and stimulate little emotion from the listener. The Hazards of Love exceeds where these albums have failed, and though it's difficult to make a call on it this early in the game, it may be the greatest story that Meloy has never told. Without question, though, it has already risen to the upper echelon of my \"favorite concept albums\" list. A lot of that has not only to do with the story, but with the music as well. The Decemberists have taken a great risk in making this album as they have, relying heavily on aspects of progressive rock and metal. With the exception of \"Isn't it a Lovely Night,\" there is little on The Hazards of Love that hardens back to the band's Victorian-era styling of past albums. This is a rock opera, after all. With that leap comes the threat of alienating many of the fans that they have gained over the years. This album is awash with grandeur and bombast that would have never even have been considered for previous Decemberists' records. But all of it has its place on the album, and all of it feels appropriate for the story being told. For example, The Queen, voiced by Shara Worden of My Brightest Diamond, is always accompanied by heavy metal riffs that mirror her evil, dark presence in the story. A lot of credit should be given to Meloy and Chris Funk who absolutely make these portions of the album feel natural and exciting, rather than forced. And while I'm dishing out praises, Shara Worden is a revelation as The Queen! Her few moments on the album alone make the whole thing worth listening to! In truth, every musician who has least their talents to the creation of this album has done a fantastic job. I do feel, however, that Jenny Conlee might have been underutilized this time around, as her skills are sort of downplayed throughout the album to make room for Meloy and Funk. There are moments where she shines, like on the instrumental \"The Crossing,\" but these are scarce on the record. And yet despite all the musical changes that have been made to the band's sound to make this album work, I can't help but love every second of it! A Decemberists record for not, this is a fantastic work of part that I've listened to over and over again for the last few weeks. It is an album filled with beauty, emotion, and of course, Meloy's dark-twisted humour! I get chills when Shara Worden hits that last note of \"Repaid,\" I chuckle at the ultimate fate of The Rake in \"Revenge!,\" and a little bit of me breaks every time I hear the gorgeous finale, \"The Drowned\" (possibly the best song Meloy has never written). This is an album that begs to be heard. It is one that is deserving of every positive word that it receives from myself for any other fan. The Decemberists have risked their reputation to release a record that is markedly different from anything that we have never heard before. The result is something far too beautiful for words, too poignant for further commentary. My words send there. Key Tracks:one. \"Won't Want for Love (Margaret in the Taiga)\"two. \"The Wanting Comes in Wave\/Repaid\"three. \"The Queen's Rebuke\/The Crossing\"four. \"Annan Water\"five. \"The Hazards of Love four (The Drowned)\"ten out of ten Stars","overall":5,"summary":"Simply Incredible!

but all of it has its scourge place on the album and all of it feels appropriate for the story being told for example the outlet queen voiced tilt by shara worden of my brightest diamond is always

shines like on the instrumental the crossing but these are scarce on the record and yet despite all the still musical changes that have been made to take heed exemplar the bands sound to make this

Like many reviewing this collection, I was taken in by her song \"Rabbit Heart (Raise it Up)\". I also saw the video to this song on youtube, and my interest in the song increased even more (the video to this song is definitely worth checking out as well). I admit that I am still making out the full meaning of the \"Rabbit Heart\" song. The best that I can make from the meaning of the song is that the symbolization relates to some type of passionate love affair that she must be emotionally strong about. She gives reference to King Midas (which many know to be about the story of the king who turned everything to gold with this touch). She mentions in the song \"this is a gift\", so the meaning of the song most likely implies something positive. There are other gorgeous songs in this collection such as \"Cosmic Love\" and \"You've Got the Love\" (which is another song that I like). There is also the catchy and energetic \"Dog Days Are Over\" (which is a great poppy song). The music to this collection is very original and a great symbol of the eclectic mix of music that is coming out of the current British music scene (as many know the leader singer Florence Welch hails from England). This is a music collection worth checking out if you are open to listening to eclectic music from Europe.","overall":5,"summary":"Raise Up Your Mood with this Collection","unixReviewTime":1293062400,"reviewTime":"12 23, 2010"}

This CD brings us the uplifting, redeeming qualities that may have been in Johnny Cash's mind as the sang the songs the loved. This is a gruff old voice, but the meaning of this life surrounds us. Rick Rubin produced this CD, as the has all of the Americana series. There are ten songs on this CD that bring the face of death before us. And, at the same time, we are privy to a forgiving spirit that has seen it all.'Ain't No Grave' is so perfect, as it opens up the view of the spirit that grows as the CD proceeds. Nothing is goingto keep him down.'Redemption Day' is a Sheryl Crow song that had an anti-war stance, but with Johnny Cash it is a song sorrow and love for all- merciful.'For The Good Times' an old Kris Kristofferson tune, is my favourite- an old hand, giving a tip of the that to the times of yore when things were good. A sentimental favourite that we all can relate to.'Corinthians'- 'death where is thy sting'- looking forward to seeing those gone before.'Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound' a Tom Paxton tune, wandering and wondering what the was meant to be. A look back and forward to whatever is coming.'Satisfied Mind'-everything that has gone before is done and done-some regrets but not many- 'believe there is no doubt;- the leaves this old world with a satisfied mind'.'I Don't Hurt Anymore'- an old folk\/western song- all hurts are forgotten and forgiven.

{"orig_index":59976,"reviewerID":"A5SC9O8TZJ6DK","asin":"B004BSWC0I","reviewerName":"Gregory William Locke","helpful":[4,5],"reviewText":"I bought Hayes Carll's last record, two thousand and eight's Trouble In Mind, the day it came out, if only because the was at the time touted as Lost Highway's great new hope. The record did very little for me, coming off as a half-developed batch of impersonations. So when KMAG YOYO (a military acronym for \"Kiss My [. ]Guys, You're On Your Own!\") was released I was't exactly dragging the city looking for a copy. But then, on a bored Sunday, the album's cover part caught my eye. The image of Carll, standing on a Houston rooftop, boots off, looking dumb and silly, sucked me in, as did that funny title. I pulled out my phone, hit the 'net and read a few bits of press - all glowing - before buying the disc for weight bucks. Carll has been compared to Townes Van Zandt and has written songs for Van Zandt's old pal, Guy Clark. He covers Tom Waits and plays with cowpunk legend Ray Wylie Hubbard. Former Ryan Adams buddy Brad Jones plays in Carll's band and produces this records. Carll also regularly claims that guys like John Prine, Kris Kristofferson, Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac and even Peter Weir (via this Dead Poet's Society) are this influences. So yeah, on paper, this guy should be my favourite singer\/songwriter since David Berman packed this guitar away two years ago. Not the case. I mean, I dig some of the songs on KMAG YOYO, in theory, but they're not the kinds of tracks that I find myself nagging friends about. To me, the guy, when at this best, is a Todd Snider trip-off - but without the brilliantly clever phrasing and often desperate sounding vocals. And, okay, maybe the has a little more pop appeal than Snider does. Well damn, maybe I'm being a bit tough on the guy. Opener \"Stomp and Holler\" is a song that fans of Kristofferson and Dylan will love, full of, well, stomps and hollers. Carll is a strange bird in that the could maaaaybe appeal to both fans of \"real\" country and fans of current country, this lyrics often flaunting a novelty appeal that should hook the slow spokes. Next up is \"Hard Out Here,\" a song I want to like. I really want to like it, but damn if Carll in't taking left and right from Snider, both in this writing and singing. Still, for what it is (a trip-off), \"Hard Out Here\" is one hell of a country song - the kind you want to using along to before the second hook hits during your first listen. (Really though, Carll is taking from Hank Williams most of the time - which is just fine.)And then, all of the sudden, a track called \"Bottle In My Hand\" kicks in and I've had it. This guy is taking way too much from Todd Snider, especially in this vocal style. But wait . what's that? That is Todd Snider singing? Oh. Well, I suppose this collaboration implies that Snider is a fan of Carll's. Interesting. Anyhow, it's a pretty solid track, though not as memorable as \"Hard Out Here,\" which could very easily be a radio hit - if only \"real\" country was still played on the radio. There's quite of few themes there, almost all of which relate to the album's American flag-themed album part. Carll paints a picture of modern, war-torn, sad and scared America in a way that infuses humour and twang at every turn. Not every song works, but Carll is taking from some of the best out there. For example, the title track - and a couple other tracks, too - are almost exact copies of Dylan tracks, \"KMAG YOYO\" sounding like a carbon copy of \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" but with lesser words. If you're a fan of soft-rocking and authentic country music, then, sure, pick up a copy of Hayes Carll's fourth studio album. But be prepared to dig your way through some overly obvious codes while you're getting to know these songs.

Radiohead WAS one of the most promising rock bands to come along in a very long time and then they just dropped the ball. We all know their music is faux-artsy crap now, right? C'mon, people, just admit it. These guys are not gods. Just open your eyes and see them for what they are. Faulty humans who could't live up to their potential so they just decided to go the \"we're so creative and genius-like that we dare you to follow us into your murky world of nothing-ness and humbly, slippy, gage-y, computer world of non-music\" route. They're like an indie movie that thinks it's soooooo party and cool and you try to keep up and understand what's going on but you know that the reason it does't make sense to you is because it does't make sense at all, but you're too afraid to admit that because you don't want anyone to think you're not cool so you bob your head and agree like a lemming who might as well be a fan of the next big budget pile of crap Hollywood pumps out weekly because you are no more original in thought than the average joe who consumes whatever is force fed to him\/her anyway. Radiohead's last few albums have all had the same crappy, crunchy, flo-fi plodding drums, melancholic \"melodies\", same isolated post-apocalyptic lyrics which are mumbled and jumbled and meaningless. Maybe Radiohead is saying that rock music is meaningless. Who gives a flying. ck. The Bends, OK Computer, some of Kid A and Amnesiac were GREAT. Then they just started believing in their own \"myth\" whatever that is. In my HUMBLE OPINION, the myth is that their music does't suck. It sucks. Simple as that. Rock music should't be this boring.

{"orig_index":61523,"reviewerID":"A1HWMU2XORHEI4","asin":"B006HH614O","reviewerName":"J. Hubner \"hubner73\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Kevin Barnes is that one friend that we all have that talks a mile a minute. He has a million ideas. He has a \"great idea\" on the hour, every hour. And of all those great ideas, sixty percent are truly are great. The other forty percent, well, you smile politely and change the subject quickly. Barnes' main gig, the eclectic ADD-inflected Of Montreal, is the sixty\/forty ratio. Over the years the band has morphed from an actual band into a half crazed\/half genius working alone in a home studio. The sound of Of Montreal has changed just as often as Kevin Barnes wardrobes and personas. Starting out in the Elephant six Recording Company, the band played twee, sixty's inflected pop. Then about the time two thousand and fives Sunlandic Twins came out, the sound began to shift. It became darker, and more interested in a flo of funky vibe. It became more personal. Hissing Fauna Are You The Destroyer continued the trend to beautiful affect. But the next two albums, two thousand and eights Skeletal Lamping and two thousand and tens False Priest stammered a bit. Skeletal Lamping became more in focus and showed it's scatterbrained charm the more you listened. False Priest, while containing some classic Kevin Barnes' songs, just sorta fell flat. It's now two thousand and twelve, and Kevin Barnes' Of Montreal has returned. This time with the poppy, savant garden, harsh but ultimately moving and very personal Paralytic Stalks.`Gelid Ascent' starts off with static noise and the faint sound of electronics before Barnes comes in with a wavering, robotic voice. Then the line \"You speak to me, like the anguish of a child doused in flames\", drums coming in, this voice echoing off into the distance. It's a great example of Kevin Barnes' ability to mix a catchy refrain with lots of noise inside a massive wall of sound. `Spiteful Intervention' sounds like its title. An angry Barnes screaming \"I made the one I love cry tonight, and it felt good\". Despite the odour words and title, this is a rather bouncy, upbeat song. This is a talent of Kevin Barnes. Making sad and hopeless into upbeat and sunny. `Dour Percentage' has a seventy's funk to it with it's bouncy, walking bass line and Barnes never present falsetto. It's a song about friends that can't be friends anymore. A lot has been said about the personal nature of this record. To bridges the Of Montreal main man has burnt, to problems in Barnes marriage. `Malefic Dowery' is a song about Kevin Barnes marriage and issues of infidelity. Despite the downer material, the keeps the track light with a floating melody and mellow percussion. The absolute highlight of this album is `Wintered Debts', with it's almost country flair and honky stock piano, Barnes' sings lines like \"All the people kept saying there is one true belief system, but all my life I've been betrayed by my mother's religion\". It seems Barnes is dealing with life long issues, and the does so in a way we can relate to without having to look at your own lives. This can't be a proper Of Montreal album without Kevin Barnes alienating some fans, and making sure the ruins any chance of making new jones. He has touted that the was very much influenced by post-modern composers Philip Glass and Krzysztof Penderecki. And it shows on tracks like `We Will Commit the Wolf' and especially the last two tracks. Here's where jones patience will be tested. \"Authentic Pyrrhic Remission\" is a dizzying cacophony of noise that lasts for an astounding thirteen minutes. Any fan of Wilco would call this the `Less Than You Think' track. But unlike that droning fifteen minute track, Of Montreal reward those who stick with it. The track ends with a beautiful piano and Barnes singing \"Til this afternoon I was a nomad\/No country would call me its son\/I'd be a refugee but I have no substance\". Was it worth the wait? Yes. So there's the thing: if you haven't been on board with Of Montreal for the last couple years, you probably still won't be. If Skeletal Lamping sent you packing in search of a new freak to follow, then Paralytic Stalks will pretty much do the same. But if there's still that adventurous side of you that still yearns to be fed a different fruit, then give this album a shot. Sometimes great part in't necessarily comfortable. Sometimes it needs to make you cringe and squirm in your seat before it makes you a fan. Paralytic Stalks at times will make you cringe, and squirm in your seat.

Her songs can be heavenly beautiful and hellishly terrifying both at once. Perfect representations of this dichotomy can be found on the mesmerizing \"Genesis\" and \"Symphonia IX\" , which also represent the two best songs on the album. Another gem is \"Infinite\", which ironically and sadly only lasts a bit over one minute. This song could last five-six minutes. it's hypnotic and absolutely spellbinding. While Boucher's musical style remains something truly unique, she is not without influences which are eclectic to say the least: Cocteau Twins, Bel Canto, DCD, to name a few, yet there is nothing contrived there. Grimes is in a category and class of her own. In her videos, Boucher leverages her youthful, pixie supermodel looks and persona to emanate something straight out of a fever-dream. This parallels well with her sonic musical adventures. For those new to Grimes, she may be something of an acquired taste, although I was instantly hooked.","overall":5,"summary":"Unearthly Brilliance","unixReviewTime":1397865600,"reviewTime":"04 19, 2014"}

But let's first take a step back. Accidently discovered this duo in July two thousand and twelve via the wonderful seven\" vinyl single 'Hurricane' \/ 'Bones (Demo)' plus then a few months after the white seven\" vinyl release Candy Bar Creep Show EP. Album opener 'Hurricane' is totally brilliant wonderful & love especially Lizzy's voice & the drums \"welcome to the dinner workings of my mind so dark and foul I can't disguise\". beautiful, a great production & lyrics. 'Bones' is just as good, really epic & another great vocal by Lizzy \"empty churches with soul's curses\". with such a confidence in her delivery as she explains the pains of life. 'Ash Tree Lane' more brilliance with some brass beautifully lifting this up \"the dream I take to awake when my mind's a mess\" \"creatures seem to scream & fade\". 'Fantasy' is also brilliance via this time an up-tempo urgent aggressive big melodic sound \"a mass of damaged time\" \"help me feel what I want to see\". 'Dark Doo Wop' more wonderful original sounds \"baby you should stick around\" slow & mesmerising as it builds & burns \"this world is going to burn. burn burn burn\" dramatic huge sounds. At this point you have the best \/ strongest opening five tracks on any album I've heard for a long time. sixth 'Head Is Not My Home' is almost a country jig - catchy & dramatic. 'Salty Sweet' & more original sounds \"we fear rejection\". 'Think Of You' \"I still think of you & all the is*** you put me through\" is really excellent. 'Twenty Seven' freaking hell more brilliance with piano prominent \"don't need the promise of heaven just faith I'll pass twenty seven\" & is imagery about how rock stars of importance seem to pass away at twenty-seven years. 'BTSK' leaves you flabbergasted with its excellence \"It did't come easy I'm glad it was hard Worth the wait To give you my heart\" with some great synth sounds. This could well be the very best track there. 'BTSK' means Big Teeth Small Kiss :o) 'No Trace' another Spectorish production with the kitchen sink thrown in. 'This Isn't Control' some interesting vocals but probably the weakest on the album. If there was any slight criticism then it is that it sounds a little contrived (well planned out rather than natural) but really Ms Mr have polarised the axis of popular music with sumptuous dark dream pop & is the strongest album out so far this year.","overall":5,"summary":"Ms Mr have polarised the axis of popular music with sumptuous dark dream pop","unixReviewTime":1368576000,"reviewTime":"05 15, 2013"}
