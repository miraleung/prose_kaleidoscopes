521,"one of the best ensemble acted films I've never seen. There in't much to the plot, but the acting- incredible. You see the characters change never so subtly, under the influence of the rented villa in Italy, and love. And happiness. The film casts a mesmerizing spell on you, much as the villa does on all the women. Truly ""enchanted"".",positive
828,"Truly appalling waste of space. Me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about thirty minutes from the send. And i can count the films I have switched off before the send on one hand. The script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring. I would't be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. For example the irritating croat threatening the real estate guy from this house phone. I mean seriously. The police would be beating this door down in minutes. The scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river. It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. The narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters. Oh and what ""characters"" they are. The protagonist played by Rourke is dreadful. He could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. After sixty for so minutes of the film I had built absolutely zero attachment to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from this generally mumbled and emotionless delivery. Is the happy? Is the sad? Angry? No idea. Just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh. And the native American theme is just awful and pointless. The good guys are at best unlikeable. A dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic sex-wife stereotype. Cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy, ""you karen't going to shoot me"" that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying. The richie unix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character. Which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic for at least realistically motivated. Roasario Dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from Jackie Brown. You really want me to believe her character was SO attracted to Rourke's? Or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! In summary a complete mess of a film. Hopeless characterisations and performances. A leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction. And ultimately extremely dull. Its not even comedy bad either. Laughing at Rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first fifteen turgid minutes of the film.",negative
1000,"This movie is awful, I can't even be bothered to write a review on this garbage! All i will say it is one of the most boring films I've never seen. And the acting is very bad. The boy who plays the main character really annoys me, the's got the same expression on this face through out the movie. I just want to slap him! Basically eighty% of the movie is slow motion shots of skateboarders, weird music, and butter ash*t. Apparently I've got to write at least ten lines of text to submit this comment, so I'll use up a few more lines by saying the lead character has got one of those faces you just want to slap! Meh i give up. THIS MOVIE SUCKS !!!!",negative
1181,"Who does't have unresolved issues with parents? And which parents don't have unresolved issues with each other? I know, that sounds heavy. But this is played for laughs in the movie, making both the comedy better and the drama better. I've always like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie, I was enchanted from the very first scene. Especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about this father as a person. And Peter Falk's monologue about being a hard-working, sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point. Without that scene being acted so well, the movie would have seemed far less nuanced, and the character far less interesting. Nicely done, Paul and Peter!",positive

(That's kept under wraps. ) But I must admit, it was't as good as I thought it would be. Tom Savini? Hats down to this guy. But it's a shame the was't in the film for long. What blacks the film is the idea, the script, sound, etc. It may look like a good movie. but it was't that entertaining. Well, I'm glad my Sister paid £ten for renting three DVD's from Blockbuster. I chose this one. and I was disappointed. Anyway, thumbs down for me. ! Not my cup of tea! zero out of ten!",negative
1787,"Beware, My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man, Harry Horner, better known for this set designs. Robert Ryan plays a handyman who is hired by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her. The problem is that the is a psychopathic murderer and does't know it. Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win Ryan over, to little avail. He is not the sort of man compassion could help for cure. Thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well, but one of them can't do well because there is something wrong with him. He suffers periodic blackouts during which the commits facts of violence, which the later forgets. Essentially the effect Ryan has on Lupino is that of the hunter and this prey, for in another sense a sadist. The audience finds out early on that Ryan is a mad killer, but it takes Lupino much longer. Thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor Miss Lupino try everything in her power to 'win' Ryan over in order to make things work, get the job done, get on with life. But getting on with things in't in Ryan's makeup, as the is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality, and as soon as there is an opening this paranoia asserts itself. As a study in mental illness the movie in't too impressive. What it's superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness, with dangerous psychopathology in the mix, and its effect on a normal person. In this regard the film is realistic and compassionate, though relentlessly logical in that we know Lupino can't 'fix' Ryan, yet we want her to. The result is that, if one is willing, one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside, so to speak, its melodramatic structure. Horner shows us, gradually, the layout the Lupino house , a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. We become familiar with staircase, kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows Miss Lupino can use for an escape and which jones she can't.",positive
3198,"Despite the solid performance of Penelope Ann Miller, this movie was an awkward mess. The lead character's American accent was ridiculous and the never seemed comfortable as a result. There was no chemistry between the two factors and I'm still not sure what Ann-Margaret was doing there.",negative
4142,"The movie 'Gung Ho!': The Story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders was made in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-three with a view to go up the moral of American people at the duration of second world war. It shows with the better way that the cinema can constitute body of propaganda. The value of this film is only collection and no artistic. In a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and factors. Watch that movie if you are interested to learn how propaganda functions in the movies for if you are a big fun of Robert Mitchum who has a small role in the film. If you want to see a film for the second world war, they exist much better and objective. I rated it four/ten.",negative
4352,"Lizzie Borden's Love Crimes is an important film, dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (and including full frontal female nudity, which sure beats the male kind). It flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory. This treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky, but Borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their insatiable lust. One striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses, when the antagonist, a counterfeit fashion photographer, is seducing an older woman wearing breeches by asking her to show how she rides a horse. He shoves a riding crop between her legs, pressing it against her crotch, and this greatly increases her excitement. Then suddenly the leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door. Patrick Bergin plays the icon artist, and though the falls a long distance from handsome, the picks on plain Janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow this line. By all reports, Sean Young proves a weird person, and she is scarcely beautiful. Yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long-limbed slender body and accentuated ships and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination. Her performance is forceful and complex. Borden possesses an intriguing worldview, and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern feckless zeitgeist I truly appreciate.",positive
4457,"This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme. She's making money by dancing with men at a dance shall. She really does't like the work, but it's a living. Her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy, but she's also pursued by rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after marrying, it turns out her ""nice guy"" is a thieving, womanizing weasel and rich Cortez turns out to be a check of a guy. By the send of the film, Barbara simply has had enough, as any SANE woman would walk from this horrid marriage. In the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys and early thirtys, Hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes for scenes that would surprise many today--such as nudity, adultery and bad language. While TEN CENTS A DANCE in't a blatant example of this morality, it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the toughened Production Code was created and enforced starting in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four. In some ways the Code was great--after all, parents did't need to worry about what their kids saw in films (such as nudity in BEN HUR, one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five). However, it also tended to sanitize some of the movies far too much--and there is no way this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce--a serious no-no one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four and thereafter. This is really a shame, as I don't think TEN CENTS A DANCE was bad at all to discuss this--especially since the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a philandering thief. Even so, allowing the film to send with her divorcing him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just could't have been. Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time. Give this one a look. FYI--Sadly, Ricardo Cortez was actually NOT Hispanic but changed this name because of possible prejudice because the was Jewish. He was an excellent leading man of this time, but today is all but forgotten.",positive
4937,"This is how i felt while watching this film. I loved it. It was hilarious. But i did feel a like i was getting sneaky view into somebody's psyche and then laughing as it got twisted around to make an interesting point. A friend put it this way:""I feel like we broke into somebody's house and are now watching their awful home videos without their knowledge"". Another one of those fact is stranger than fiction pieces of film. ""Groovin' Gary"", the original ""Beaver Kid"", is a small town guy who turns up at a nearby TV station in the hope of getting on film - and the certainly does, though not, perhaps, as the initially expected. With high hopes of fame and significance the invites Harris to come and film a truly awful talent quest that the has organised in this home town - headlined by this own drag act ""Olivia Newton-Don"". Director, Trent Harris, does a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story. Some footage of an awkward kid who wants to be someone morphs, over two subsequent reinterpretations, into the story of freedom from repressed sexual identity in small town America. Harris simultaneously critiques the attitudes of small town America, the cult of celebrity, and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry. Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover pull out stunner performances. a young Sean Penn is the most evocative - so closely does the follow the actual 'Gary footage', but with strong nuances given to push the sense of the interaction the way Harris wants it to go. In the send the wide-eyed naivety the original Gary is what moved me - when contrasted against these possible interpretations of this situation. A film not to miss. I have not seen anything else like it. Jacob.",positive
5577,"I am a huge, huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Tony Shalhoub. I'm slightly less fond of Stephen King, but I like some of this work. This said, I should have LOVED one thousand, four hundred and eight.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT**** I walked in eager. I walked out disappointed. This is not the fault of the factors. Shalhoub and Jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie puts Cusack in the ""guy in a locked room"" scenario. This was't a BAD movie, but I can't call it a good one either. It was a muddied mess that had moments of ""ouch, that's just WRONG,"" combined with moments of ""ouch, that's just painful,"" and moments of ""oh, now THAT'S just unfortunate"" with very little continuity-connectivity between them. Eislin's father shows up once, and there's no seeming connection to the rest of Mike's personal life that we see displayed while the tries to survive the room. A previous commenter described the Olin/Enslin argument as worth watching, and I very much agree. But other than that, aside from some clever musical cues (the room almost playfully torments Enslin a little bit, and gives him one chance to get out before cupping the ante. at which point it gives him the one-hour countdown clock and the titular line from the Carpenters ""We've Only Just Begun."") it's mostly ""stuff jumps out at you when you least expect it!"" type horror that was fun when I was fourteen, and surrounded by friends my page, clutching each other in the summer while Jason stalked Camp Crystal Lake. The rest of the movie was ""let's make him relive some of this most painful experiences"" mindgaming, with ""let's animate the paintings in creepy ways"" clické cheesiness.******END SPOILERS***** I expected better from this movie with Stephen King's name attached to it, as well as the factors I mentioned above. We never find out the origin of the evil. We never get to see the evil defeated, though we can presume maybe it was defeated. And the ending was just a jarring ""What?!"" moment. Wait for it to come on cable. I would't have minded paying for it as a matinée, but I'm feeling a bit shortchanged for having paid opening night prices for it.",negative
6921,"Micro-phonies is a classic Stooge short. The guys are inept repairmen working at a radio station, and during some horsing around in a broadcast booth, Curly's perfect mimic of a recording of ""Voices of Spring"" is mistaken for the real thing, leading to a radio contract and a zany musical party. The trio's mock rendition of the quintet from ""Lucia de L'Amamore"" is especially entertaining. No doubt this is essential viewing for Stooge fans. Although the evidence of Curly's failing health is visible in this face and voice, this performance is amazing, and it is probably the last glimpse of the old Curly. Some fans think that ""A Bird in the Hand"" is the last great Curly short, but this coarse voice and slow movement are just too difficult to watch.",positive
7203,"The Commenter before me stated this movie is the worst that was never forced upon him/her as a child. I have to say though that I loved this movie when was little and I still love it today. The movie has the best running theme of all-family togetherness. Considering the time period the movie was released I thought the movie was acted out well. I only wish I could still find a copy of it somewhere!! Of all the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's films I watched as a kid this was on of my favourites. I know I probably watched it at least once a week with my brother and my from. I would definitely recommend it to anyone I know-or don't know. So if you do find a copy of it I suggest watching it! It's wonderful and heartwarming.",positive
7254,"I recently started to watch this show in syndication and find it a bit hit and miss. Some episodes are silly -- Doug is upset about some trivial/juvenile thing and facts stupid etc. Still, others are quite amusing, and sometimes touching. These include those episodes that face up to the complexities of the characters. For instance, the ""juvenile overweight amiable guy marries sexy wife"" theme is found in several sitcoms. (Carrie also has something about her, looks-wise. Not just a run of the mill sexy girl.) But, Carrie has an edge -- she might be nice on the eyes, but has a few too many personality traits not too far different than her father. And, she readily admits to it -- for instance, one episode revolves at her black of desire to be nice to co-workers. I personally find her of*ness sexy, but you have to be the right sort of person to be table to live with that. Amiable Doug is a good match. And, deep down, see likes the simple things too. Maybe, not as much as Doug whose nirvana is watching TV and eating a big snack next to this big screen it.v., but no culture gal she. This black of an overall sensitive side is one reason the two don't have children. Of course, the simple pleasures of a guy is nothing to sneer at either, and adds to the charm of the show. They live an ordinary working class sort of life in Queens -- it is realistic in that sense. And, overall, amusing and pleasant sitcom fare, esp. if you just want to relax. It gets a little tired at the send, so it's probably good it is ending. It had a good run. See also, Becker.",positive
7668,". here comes the Romeo Division to change the paradigm. Let me just say that I was BLOWN AWAY by this short film. I saw it, randomly, when I was in Boston at a film festival and I have thanked god for it every day since. I really, truly believe I was part of a happening, like reading a Tarantino script before any else did for seeing the first screening of Mean Streets.

9175,"I have a friend that works at blockbuster, and the gets five free movie rentals a week, so one day as we were scouring the aisles for something interesting, i stumbled across eighteen Weapons of Kung Fu, and judging by the box alone, this movie seemed pretty wack, but nonetheless we gave into temptation and rented it -- afterall, it was free. and thank god it was. this is by far THE WORST movie i have never seen. the budget must have been a pickle and a piece of string. the plot was ridiculous, the only mention of the ""eighteen weapons"" is that there is some book that teaches the ways of the eighteen weapons that some bad guy is after -- and that it! there list even any weapon fighting in this movie. that and the action sequences are just flat-out BAD. nine times out of ten the other guy's punches and kicks come about a foot away from landing on the other guy's, and there are MANY times when the the movie will skip frames (a result of ridiculously poor editing). the dubbing is as well laughable, and it is hardly even understandable. and we wont even get into the acting. the ending will definitely leave you saying ""wtf??"", however to be fair i must mention that the fighting techniques used by the factors were somewhat decent, and the old guy is a mad chump. but that about it. thankfully i didst have to pay for this movie, but i guess at least now i know exactly how bad a movie can actually be.",negative
9625,"Everyday we can watch a great number of film, soap. on to. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great film, with real feelings, with great factors, with a great realisator-director. For me there are two films that everyone needs to see : the first is the Pacula ? ""Sophie 's choice"" with Meryl Streep. The second is ""Journey of Hope"". As human beings, we need to learn about humility, about love of the others, about acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. We also have to struggle against racism and fascism. We must avoid judging, criticize; we only have to love your earth companion. This wonderful film, helps us reaching John (Lennon) this dream : Imagine all the people living live in peace.

11788,"Amy Heckerling's second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's gangster films made in the Warner Brothers' tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at this life of hard knocks when the catches a kid trying to steal something from this pet store in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has continuing health problems, so Keaton falls into crime at an early page via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yeah that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother turned district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor this wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton's moll. The film looks notoriously cheap, making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film. The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly closes steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery doing this best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. Piscopo does the ""once"" bit one time too many. Several supporting factors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half evolves into a hit for miss television show type stone and never recovers. The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of The Roaring Twenties' actual one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine release date. *one/two of four stars.",negative
11811,"When I watched L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed: ""How complicated!"" And she is right, of course. When you are used to simple, one-linear plots, especially violent hero tvs crook schemes, L'Appartement is hard to follow. A couple of the negative reviewers there also have missed one for more important points. Other whine about the confusing flash backs. Come on! This is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet, come back and get hooked again within a few seconds. This one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details. Then it is really not that hard to figure out what's happening and when. The director has left more than enough clues in all scenes. The first three/four of the movie center about the question: why did Max and Lisa split? The film, as my girlfriend remarked, begins as a romantic lovestory, suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again. Having experience with French movies, I predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and I was right. In the send of the first part it becomes clear, after many twists and turns, that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max did not know, that Lisa had left and why. Lisa did not know, why Max did not contact her in Rome and left her without a trace, when she returned to Paris. The only one who did was Alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut. After both Max and Lisa have found out the truth, the question of course becomes: can Alice's manipulations be undone? Well, of course not, time has passed by and things have changed. Many European movies use a story telling technique I fully enjoy. There is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning, after which two (or more) interested parties try to decide in their own advantage. Instead the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. In the first half Alice seems to be a side character; slowly it becomes clear, that she is key figure. Acting is simply great. Vincent Cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character, who risks a secured life just to hunt a dream from the past. Monica Belucci is very beautiful of course, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey provides the necessary comical touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, plagued by feelings of guilt and regret. The only reason I did not gave it a ten is the somewhat unsatisfying send. Of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events Max is exactly on the point where the movie begun, only wiser and sadder. Alice has paid for her sins. But still the little twists on the airport are a bit artificial. Max too easily exchanges Lisa for Alice; Alice too easily decides to reject Max, who has been her dream for so long; Max too easily returns to this francée. But then again, I don't know how how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. I guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.",positive
12437,"The beginning of this film is a little clunky and also confusing , but sit tight, because you are in for the ride of your life. The concept is compelling, with interesting devices utilized to tell the overall story. There are fine performances all around, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman's being the best of the cast-no surprise there. Ethan Hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well. The Direction by Mr. Lumet is outstanding. The film has a Seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story, but unlike the majority of trite films that populate the landscape today, this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects for product plugs. You will be greatly rewarded for the time invested in this film.",positive
12755,"The production year says it all. The movie is a marauding mess of politically correct leftwing feministic selfappreciating drivel, of a so heavyhanded symbolic variety that comes across as ridiculous today. Every scene has the purpose of shedding light on one of the burning issues of society, mainly the role of females in the working community, the role of women tvs men, women as sex objects, consumerism, politics, war, etc. Every scene is commented upon by the dinner dialogue of one of the main actresses, for by turning the scene into a surrealistic joke. I have no reminiscence of any plot, for who the main characters actually were. It is the sort of movie, where consumerism is mocked by having a couple make love in a furniture store sales window while the sales agent delivers this speech, for where a revealing interview of a stage actress turns into a fullblown striptease act, for ""of course"" the offensive gentlemen of the press is the equal to a raunchy club audience. Then we move swiftly on, as we need to see war erupt in a peaceful forest, we need to see multiple inflammatory feministic public speeches being drowned in the (male) blowing of cars horns for rioting crowds, and of course we need to see cinema newsreels of Stalin and all the other usual suspects. You get the idea. But all this does not matter at all. The movie is an unsurpassed piece of eyecandy for any (male) Ingmar Bergman aficionado. A movie boasting leads Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom at the height of their beauty makes this reviewer surrender completely and just drivel  and also delight in watching them so generously use their acting skills in a movie I had never heard about before today. It is hard to believe how especially the face of Bibi Andersson towns the screen every single time she appears. The cinematography is gorgeously orchestrated lbw, often revelling in an overexposed (?) dimensionless whitishness, and you just never grow tired of watching the performers. How absurd, that a movie made with so much consideration for the feministic agenda, tirelessly advocating that women should not be viewed as merely an object of desire, has nothing better to offer the twenty-onest century viewer than a parade of stunningly beautiful babes. As mentioned, I am not complaining. I could rematch it tomorrow.",negative

From that point on, I spent my free time trying to find the movie. I never found it, but on my birthday, my friend who knew I had the hardest time finding the movie, got it for me as present. Sean Penn does a great job of narrating the documentary. I loved how it told the story of each of the Z-Boys and the history of Dogtown. I have been to Venice and the surrounding area many times, and had never known what had taken place, until I saw the documentary.

12867,"If this guy can make a movie, then I sure as hell can make one too. In fact, if you hire me to make a movie for you, I promise to do the following:one) I will add more naked women. This movie had none. I think cheesy B-class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body. I would't want to let my viewers down.two) I will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it's only a dream. I think HorrorVision had about four of these scenes. And, considering the movie was only like an hour long, the dream-to-movie-length ratio was quite high. And, if I do decide to do a dream sequence, I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants??three) I will not trip off any movies like Star Wars for the Matrix because I will know that my budget is small and I will not want to mask my contempt for big-budget Hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine. four) And finally, I will not mix modern technology with the undead. I mean, a palm pilot can only be so scary . at least they turned it into an evil brolly-polly monster before the screen blew up for something. So, if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production, count on me: wanna-b-movie director extraordinaire.",negative
12953,"Why ooh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little if anything from the original book. I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these. This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name. They have just totally spat in the face of every Carlito's Way fan out there; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original movie, in a different role. What's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original, untouched material of the book Carlito's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld figure, instead they made a who-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook (though Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never get to see Carlito's real initial rise and fall. The three stars is because, looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick, it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is no Carlito but the could be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits this role. But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time (I am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right (having been written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres). The fact is though, it's not a stand alone - it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel never filmed.",negative

It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after thirty-five years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent page and let your fantasies run. If this movie did't excite your curiosity, then you were just too old. I look forward to seeing it again (even at my page)! If nostalgia is in your avenue, I'm sure this is an interesting movie to see. It's innocence is simply astounding and it's simplicity is so easy and enjoyable.",positive
15982,"Dominick (Nicky) Luciano wears a 'Hulk' T-shirt and trudges off everyday to perform this duties as a garbage man. He uses this physical power in picking up other's trash and hauling it to the town dump. He reads comic-book hero stories and loves wrestlers and wrestling, Going to WrestleMania with this twin brother Eugene on their birthday is a yearly tradition. He talks kindly with the many people the comes in contact with during this day. He reads comic books, which the finds in the trash, with a young boy who the often passes by while on the garbage route. Unfortunately, Dominick has a diminished ability to use this mind. He has a disability. Dominick's disability came as a result of an injury to the head in which the suffered traumatic brain injury (TBI). This injury left him slower, though it did not change this score characteristic as a strong individual who helps to protect others. Dominick is actually more table to live independently than the may seem at the beginning of the film. He lives with Eugene who is studying to become a doctor. Dominick provides the main source of income, while Eugene is off studying. Eugene must face the fact that the is to continue this education in a different city, and that the must move away from Dominick. Eugene also develops a romance which begins to separate him from this twin brother. The film deals specifically with domestic abuse and how this can impact individuals, families, and then society as a whole. The strain that escalates between Eugene and Dominick as Eugene realizes that the must eventually leave Nicky, exploded on their birthday night. Eugene yells at Dominick and throws him against the wall. In this moment, Eugene must confront this own fears of being like this abusive father, the father which Dominick protected him against while the himself became the victim of the abuse. This event cemented the love between the two brothers, who from then on became the best of friends. Though they needed each other, they also both needed independence and the ability to grow and develop relationship with others. The fact that they must part ways became a very real emotional strain. However, by the send of the film, Dominick is table to say good bye to this brother and wish him luck. Eugene is table to leave this brother with the confidence that the has started to make a social network of people who care about him and will help him with this independence. When Dominick witnesses the abuse of this friend the is forced to come face to face with the cause of this own trauma. In this state of extreme stress, Dominick almost completely shuts down. He then runs after the ambulance to the hospital to see what happened to this friend. After learning that the boy has died, the is confronted by the abusive father who, fearing this testimonial, tells him the did't see nothing, does't know anything, and not to say anything, and that if the does the will kill him. Now that this own life has been threatened, the goes and find the hand gun that Larry used to kill the rats. He goes to the wake of the deceased boy and at gunpoint, kidnaps the baby of the grieving family. He runs away from the scene and hides in a building. When the police surround him, Eugene goes in the building to talk to this brother. Eugene then reveals the cause of Dominick's disability and they bring the baby back. The abusive father then wields a gun of this own threatening to kill Dominick, but Eugene stops him and Dominick tells the crowd that the saw the father throw this son down the stairs. Through the climactic ending, the issue of dysfunctional behavior comes into view. Though Dominick's instinct to save the baby can be understood, we also see how damaging this response is. Dominick put the baby's life and this own life in grave danger. The larger societal consequences of these events is not directly implicated, but rather shown through the films ending. Despite the more optimistic ending portrayal, another sequence of events might just have likely occurred, in which Dominick is charged with kidnapping and possession of a firearm. It is somewhat difficult to believe that this went completely unaccounted. Furthermore, even if Dominick is not charged, there may still be a stigma against him within the community, not that there was't one before these events. Instead, the film shows that we must be table to recognize problematic behavior and act to curb it. Dominick and Eugene was released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, the same year as another film, Rainman, which won five Academy Awards. While Rainman was an achievement and helped increase the visibility with person with disabilities, it could be argued that Dominick and Eugene holds more valuable lessons for society. Whereas, Rainman demonstrated that mainstream American society might be table to learn from and care for a 'savant', if the 'savant' is the inheritor of a large estate. Dominick and Eugene show that a person with a disability might be table to care for and help save members of American society. The message of an independent person with disabilities may have been too strong for one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. Hopefully someday society will see the strengths of individuals with disabilities, not as a threat, but as imperative for the strength of society.",positive

Those computer swiss' really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the movie, though. None of the characters act in a realistic manner, especially in the aforementioned, despicable threerd act (I promise I won't give it away, but trust me, it's not worth keeping a secret!). A lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally, like when they try to explain that an invisible man's eyelids don't work. Please, give the viewers more credit than that!!! Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do, after all, if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic The Invisible Man from one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three. There is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous, and is not mentioned once later on. If more attention had been paid it, Kevin bacon's mad scientist might have made a little more sense. The movie would actually be much more successful as a porno, since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner. But this piece of work. go see something else.

Ally Sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge. Male lead Reg Rodgers, looking like Judd Nelson, is fine. There is also a great cameo by Ben Vereen. The song at the send of the movie ""The Bastard Song"" written by Adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy: ""It's a world of suffering,In a sea of spain,No matter how much sun you bring,You're pummelled by the brain.

Sadly, it is unwatchable, though not because the jokes karen't funny--some (I won't say most) of them are, and in fact Mr. Mike did a good job translating this mentally unbalanced screeds into visual gags. The trouble is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, you name it) is so God-awful, the movie is intolerable. Some outfit called ""PKO Productions"" gets the producing credit, but it does't look produced at all; it looks more like Mike stole one of the cameras from the SNL set and made the whole thing in an afternoon. I realize Mike's goal was to torture the audience, but even that deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear for comprehend whatever it is that's supposed to be shocking. Still, the DVD in't a total waste: it includes a eulogy for O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and three ""Mr. Mike's Least Loved Bedtime Stories"" from SNL.

21922,"There's not a drop of sunshine in ""The Sunshine Boys"", which makes the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simon's sole ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the script from this play (which goes uncredited), equates old page with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for forty-three years, which begs the question ""how long did vaudeville last, anyway?""). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when the was't coupled with one of Neil Simon's screenplays; there, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and the over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to stone down the character, to nuance this temperament to give ""The Sunshine Boys"" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf. The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless space; one closes hope for it early on. *one/two from ****",negative
23747,"I saw this movie when it first came to the heaters in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight and though I knew it was't of award winning caliper. I kinda liked it. It tales the tale of five former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids - which is to climb Mt. Whitehead. Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways, but none too differently than they were as children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group, and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group. Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson, a ""true believer"" in everything Cub Scout related. He still lives in the same house with this mother, still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily, is brave, reverent and clean, and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting. Compounding their task, however, is the Grunski brothers, two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned. By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit, albeit harmlessly. Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts, who think Pack seven is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out. All in all, the movie still has bits of charm. Observe Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot, for example, and you have a really funny bit going for you. Upon further review, the entire film needed more of that type of observational humour. It does't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure.",negative

24445,"This excellent series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, brilliantly, it should be said, charts the beginning to the send of World War two. The origins are not entirely examined fully from Germany's fall at the hands of the Versailles treaty which helped propel Hitler's demonic rise, but as one reviewer says, that must be hard to do, in a twenty-six-part series with so much to cram in. Apart from the expected combat photography/action, there are plenty of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you're not necessarily a World War two buff/fan. Episodes showing 'testimonies' and what life was like on the home front of the main allies/adversary, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the U. S. A. were quite eye-opening. Showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians, the death camps etc., were very well handled and exposed. I'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation (Of which it could be said I am one at forty-seven!). Certain things are quite strangely left out, like the advent of the new jet era beginning, with Frank Whittle's experimental Gloster jet and the Gloster Meteor's combat debut as well as that of the German Messerschmitt Me two hundred and sixty-two - especially as the V-one was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the Vtwo. This is probably a small oversight, not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which WWtwo brought forward from a more barren old science. But a great series that made its mark and has done so never since when thankfully repeated. A series to own as a box set in history terms, on DVD for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be well proud.",positive

Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that the's being stereotyped as the principled villain). Chris Rock was good but not a standout.

Very nice camera work by Michael Ballhaus and the wonderful ""Albatross"" by Fleetwood Mac at the send. Fassbinder is creating a very moody stone for the whole film. It's a shame this movie was never released on DVD.

Though flawed, the book was one of Grisham's only that I truly liked, especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town, a slightly different world to a coastal urbanite such as myself. I also loved the matter-of-factness, naturalness of what occurs in the book. In the movie characters are given a ""nobility"" of personality that seemed so stilted. The villains and foils are flat and one dimensional. But as with so much of Joel Schumacher's work, genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent, and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection.

Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done. However Karen Carpenter turned out, there was a time when she was very special and brought a great deal joy to her fans and music lovers.

The setup was promising, in the one thousand, nine hundred and twenty's Cecil B. Demille makes this opus of the Ten Commandments. It seems in using real Egyptian artefacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil (don't they always?). Aware of what had been unleashed DeMille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down. Hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time. Then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site (the movie's first mistake, but they those period costumes are expensive and this is a Sci-Fi channel movie). The first sightings we get of the Anubis monster are well done and it's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy CG effect. Then the body counts starts. This is were the movie went south for me. The reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction. Once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do? They make the usual stop to the ""guy who knows the truth but never told anyone"". After getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site? No, they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk. Really I'm not the most motivated person but if I knew a demon from ancient Egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me I'd put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem. After this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the Anubis monster in the usual way, by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it's standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades.

I hung in there for forty-five minutes (about half the running time) and just could't stand it anymore. I was an Elijah Wood fan in the 'ninetys (see ""The War"") and I learned to enjoy Mandy Moore's shifts from bubbly to serious this year (see ""Chasing Liberty"" which is surprisingly entertaining). I've seen bits of ""Run Lola Run."" So with three leads I liked this should have been fine. It was't. Nobody turned in a good performance. Wood's Jones was flat. For an aspiring writer the had next to no imagination (his violent fantasies looked like they were ripped off from ""A Christmas Story"" and this lustful jones were--huh, a across between boring and alarming). Potente is absolutely unlikable from the first second and I'd only know that she was supposed to be ""THE girl"" by reading the box. Speaking of the synopsis--whoever they employed for that job made the film sound funny, quirky, romantic, and quite enjoyable. Whoever that person was, the for she should have been employed to rewrite this script. By the halfway point, I did't care about ANY of the characters anymore. Moore's Lisa is an aspiring actress who's bubbly and a little conniving (for no apparent reason at all) but her ludicrous period play (which is supposed to be funny in presentation) is on a par with the rest of the script. There is supposedly a happy, romantic comedy ending to this turkey--given the character material they had to work with, I just can't envision it. Save your money. Warn your friends.

28458,"Discovery Channel/Animal Planet must be ashamed of themselves. This Fantasy is modelled after the ""Walking with Dinosuars"" series. Even though this is one hundred% fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. Even mixing the fantasy dragons with T-rexs and the extinction of the dino. Added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say Sci-Fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show. On its own the show is about an seven.five/ten far as entertainment goes. But the way in which it is presented I have to give it a one/ten. Don't get me wrong I have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong. I can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real. I also think this weakens the great ""Walking with Dinosuars"" series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini-series.",negative
28705,"Generally political messages are done on television, so if you are a big fan of environmental correctness, watch to your hearts content. Most people go to the movies to be entertained, not sold some poppycock political nonsense. The hook there is the big name cast. Unfortunately the sum of the performances equals a whole movie that went absolutely nowhere. The two best performances, Chris Cooper, and Richard Dreyfus, have minimal screen time. In short, ""Silver City"" is to be avoided as entertainment. It is nothing more than a non documentary, rambling political expose on illegal immigration, pollution, and any number of other causes that do not belong anywhere except on the small screen. - MERK",negative
28848,"I was lucky enough to watch this without any are viewing hype. I was surprised at the resilience of the ghost's image in my mind the next day, and the day after that. I've watched it three-four times, and each time I appreciate it even more. The settings are gorgeous, the town at dusk has beautiful lighting effects, the marsh long shots, and the house itself is sufficiently grown with moss. The main hero is so likable and good natured, that the is easily sympathized with. To the person who complained that there was't enough 'spark' in this film, I'd say that it's because the whole fight against the ghost is being waged by just this one person. It is a fairly slow paced film, with an unusual amount of time being spent , pre and post ghost attack, on developing this character with family and work life. SPOILERS discussion/I especially liked the turning point, when the comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost. He describes the Woman in black, and then at the send of the conversation the says that the is going back, because after all, what charm had she done to him? The other man says, ""you can't go back. alone!"" and blends the hero this dog. The cute little dog offers a small respite of comic relief, with it's bounding through the house and even into the locked room. The many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out. The woman shows up in mid shot at the church, showing that it is not afraid of the church, and is also not shy for bound to the house. This is all in the very beginning. Another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence, watching the funeral. As the camera pans to the right, the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones. The older man won't even look at it, but the kids are all yelling and taunting it. Crreeepy. Usually ghosts are hidden in shadows, haunting specific locales for people. As has been mentioned, the ghost's malevolence and wrath are frightening, and I feel it's attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified. The ending underlined the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house. Or perhaps the was marked no matter what, by saving the gypsy girl. The guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable, and really fills the role well. I have been spreading the word to my friends about how much I enjoyed this film, and it is reassuring to see others feel the same. I can see how people don't quite see the same masterpiece, especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype. I think another person summed it up when they said that this movie settled the question of whether for not Ghosts could physically charm man. Whew. I plan to watch it again tonight followed by The Changeling, aaww yeah. Any other films to recommend? Thanks,",positive
30405,"I'd heard of Eddie Izzard, but had never seen him in action. I knew the was a transvestite, and when I saw the was on HBO one night last summer, I put it on, not knowing how my husband would react. Well, the blew us away. He's better than Robin Williams never was. He has total control of the audience; when the does the 'Englebert is dead - no the's not', routine, the audience does't know what to think by the send. God as James Mason is also an inspired touch, and this version of the Python Spanish Inquisition as carried out by the Church of England - 'Cake for Death?' is priceless. My jaws were caching from laughter by the send of the show. We scoured the TV listings for months after that to be table to see him again, and were lucky enough to tape him the next time the came on.

30504,"Hey, it's only TV. Sure, it's STAR TREK, the most beloved la la, and this is a great one, but it's all relative. What it boils down to is a guy in self years grooving with a swatch of pizza-colored shag drug. There's a kind of THIRD MAN noirishness to the tunnel hunt, and it's creepier than many episodes of what is after all one of the better TV shows. The suspense is actually suspenseful. The peril really feels perilous. As a little kid I think I cried when Spock told me that this hideous creature was as sad, scared and horrified as the people it was eating. This was one of my early lessons in empathy, a lesson reinforced by the EMPATH episode which was, if less thrilling, even more melancholy. What bothered me when I was five was that this thing, which looks like meat and tomato barf, somehow actually consists more for less of rock. Now that kind of choice might seem visionary, a hippie designer's idea of through-the-looking-glass one-universism, but it might also just smack of the drug era.",positive
30789,"Following the success of the (awful) Gilligan's Island TV movie reruns, a number of TV movies were made in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's reuniting casts from classic shows. Most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humour that made the shows so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is among the most disappointing because it goes for a Laurel and Hardy-type comedy style that really was't in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series, is completely wasted - she has less time there in this ninety minute movie than she did in any single thirty minute episode. And since the roles of ""Eddie"" and ""Marilyn"" in this movie are nothing more than cameos, what was the point of making them younger and recasting them? With very little rewriting, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although seeing some of the Munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch, I did't enjoy Sid Caesar as the whammy mad scientist mainly because there's too much of him and not enough of the underused Munsters (ironically that very year, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one, Caesar's old partner in comedy, Imogene Coca, was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a TV movie reunion RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the Munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum. Why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a ""typical"" (if strange) American family, not famous monsters? This was the last Munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles, there was an awful revival of the series in the late one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's with a completely new cast and a one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's TV movie which featured DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest, and Patrick in cameo roles as a family dining.",negative
30928,"Lovingly crafted and terribly interesting to watch Garfield's gritty, breakthrough performance (introducing a new kind of rebellious acting style that would carry over to the Brandos and Clifts and so on after the war) but all that sisterly affection is a bit suffocating. Priscilla Lane is a bright, engaging performer but the other sisters don't really register (though they're all allowed to be start and witty) and I just had a hard time buying any of the other male characters besides Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a pleasant enough factor, but the blacks the movie star weight to match up with Garfield's hard luck Mickey Borden and that throws the film a bit out of whack. (Imagine a Jimmy Stewart for someone in the part.) Also, I was not convinced that Garfield would make the pivotal (to say the least) final decision that the made. The film needed another half hour of running time to better explain that action; it feels lawfully brushed and under-motivated. Still, it's not hard to understand how anybody who grew up with this picture would remember it fondly. It falls short of being a classic, but it does contain a few classic moments. The two gate swinging scenes are pure movie magic.",positive

On a trip to Flushing the is 'seduced' by Christine. When the discovers that Christine's new boyfriend is the bit of rough trade the's been fancying from afar the decides to stick around. After all, enforced heterosexuality has its compensations. Then the realizes that Christine's previous three husbands have all died violent deaths. Did Christine murder them and is the for the boyfriend, Herman, going to be 'the fourth man'? Verhoeven's overheated, over-egged melodrama is a delicious blend of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of OTT eroticism and religious imagery and an awful lot of the colour red. A lot of the time it looks and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we are seeing is real for a figment of Gerard's imagination. The fun is in figuring it out. Also the fact that Christine is an infinitely more likable character that either the priggish Gerard for the bullish Herman means we are hardly like to root for either of the men over her. In fact, it's fair to say Gerard's comeuppance can't come soon enough. Super performances, too, from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and easily Verhoeven's best film up to this wonderfully subversive piece of sci-fi ""Starship Troopers"".",positive

Ireally think I could have written a better story line and screen play. Why is it in EVERY science fiction movie, they (the cast) constantly refers to a solar system as a galaxy? Didn't any of these screenwriters for authors stay awake in science class? It is a pet levee of mine, but a solar system is a single star with planets, a galaxy is a WHOLE bunch of solar systems.

33075,". why watch a TV drama (billed as a comedy) in which none of the characters are likable for even interesting people ? I can sort of see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the misdirection and bad-taste surprises that the put into ""One foot in the grave"", etc. I admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on British TV at the moment. But really . who cares about these people ? They are cold bores. Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased sex-boyfriend shagging. That was the moment when I switched OFF this programme, never to return. P. S. It's interesting to note that the posters who did't like this series are all British, whereas those who praise it are mostly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC broadcast this series it was ignored by viewers and sank like a stone. P. P. S. Good news for those who liked it ! There will be a second series in Autumn two thousand and seven - though without the male lead. It sounds like the BBC have decided to turn it into a more conventional thirty minute sitcom.",negative
33192,"This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers, if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days. Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in her are-enhancement surgery days, she really should have stayed dressed. Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us, the has gone on to much better things since this . this . this . well, check, piece of garbage. Strangely, all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work there was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration. I mean, anything not worth doing is not worth doing well. But the did it well, anyway. Still, there was one bright, shining aspect: Ray Liotta, who is named way down the credit list, just absolutely stole everything. Liotta was magnificently mesmerizing! Hypnotic! Enthralling. I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theatre. For some strange reason, my friend LOVED it. I sort of think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and, really, honest, she should't have), though the tried to claim it was other, more artistic, reasons. Anyway, I thought even then, after this first scene, that Ray Liotta would become a major star, for at least a major, highly-respected factor. Despite the garbage aspects of the garbage script, the sheer ugliness of the whole story, Liotta made it almost worth watching. In fact, it is worth seeing, once, just to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean, for one thing, this name is now usually listed at for near the top. Even then, even in a pile of garbage, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. Just, if you do see this trash, be prepared to hold your nose. Every major character is either amoral for immoral. Terrible movie. Terrible movie idea. Added comment: Too many people answer ""Was this comment helpful?"" with a ""no"" because they disagree with the expressed opinion. Maybe IMDb should ask that question instead: ""Do you agree with these opinions?""",negative
34558,"I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in are-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested. With seven (seven) years of programs versus just the two (two) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series. Plots are intelligent, scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent future. While most producers and directors in Hollywood ignorantly view Sci-Fi as indistinguishable from Horror and Fantasy, this series returns to the origins of Science Fiction in the logical, moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies into their possibly fearful near term realizations. This series does this very well and remains unique in its avoidance of the ""shoot-em-up"" video game monster mentally of much of the current generation. It has brains, history, a message and good entertainment. It is an adult series without unbearable teenage know-it-all fantasies. Hurray! Now, if we can only get MGM to release the entire New Outer Limits series on DVD instead of just the six poor teaser discs and the onest season now only available.",positive

A horrible waste of time, unless you want to match your kid's biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations. Do yourself a favor - take a walk in the Sahara instead. Since I am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie, let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. The whole thing has a stench of ""let's make the Biblical account look retarded."" The basic logic goes, if they spent the money on a biblical film, why not make it worthwhile? Since the basic logic is not met, something is amiss. The movie starts with a disclaimer about Poetic Licenses taken. that is the understatement of the century. Poetic rape.

The film is much worse than the first movie and that was really bad.

Some years ago I saw another movie, called: *Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure* In this movie were parts of *Wizards of the lost kingdom* used in. They called this movie ""KOR the conquerer"". I began to search for the ""KOR""-Movie many years, because I wanted to see the complete movie, not only the parts which were used in the *Andy Colby*-Movie. No shop had this Kor-Movie to rent and no shop did know this movie. Many years I watched my old VHS-tapes I had at home, and what a wonder. I had this movie since many years still at home, but the movie had a different title, because in Germany it has three for four titles. So I was happy to find this tape at home and this time I had much more time in watching *KOR the Conquerer again. The music is great during the whole movie, but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment, when KOR is walking drunken through the green forrest. The music in the background had some kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson, and also the boy, who played Simon in the movie. Both of them did their job very good.

35489,"As a kid I thought this movie was great. It had animals, it had beautiful music, and it had my favourite factor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this movie, for different reasons. It has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera. It has beautiful, well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly, with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme, that still makes me cry. Even when people hum it. And it has my favourite factor, Michael J. Fox. Based on a book, this is the story of three house pets, an intelligent, overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of Shadow, a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named Sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog, Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away. Dismayed and worried, the pets break out and plan a trip across the Sierra mountains for the trip of their lives. A truly incredible journey. So what, maybe home IS just over that mountain. But what if it in't? I suggest Homeward Bound for people that like the three amazing factors providing the voices for the lead animal characters, and for anyone else that . yeah, everyone go watch it.",positive

The movie does a good job of keeping your interest despite a somewhat whammy performance by the lead played by Paul Muni. It chronicles , Wong Long(the character played by Muni) and how the works the land, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich but then returns to the land where the originally started. The relationship between him and this wife, played by Luise Rainer, is the main thread of the story(besides the land itself) and despite the obvious non-Chinese factors it does a pretty good job of displaying the country and it's people. It's obvious that MGM used it's money to create a really good epic with this one in an era where they could probably afford it.

And i can count the films I have switched off before the send on one hand. The script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring. I would't be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. For example the irritating croat threatening the real estate guy from this house phone. I mean seriously. The police would be beating this door down in minutes. The scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river. It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. The narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters. Oh and what ""characters"" they are. The protagonist played by Rourke is dreadful. He could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. After sixty for so minutes of the film I had built absolutely zero attachment to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from this generally mumbled and emotionless delivery. Is the happy? Is the sad? Angry? No idea. Just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh. And the native American theme is just awful and pointless. The good guys are at best unlikeable. A dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic sex-wife stereotype. Cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy, ""you karen't going to shoot me"" that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying. The richie unix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character. Which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic for at least realistically motivated. Roasario Dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from Jackie Brown. You really want me to believe her character was SO attracted to Rourke's? Or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! In summary a complete mess of a film. Hopeless characterisations and performances. A leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction. And ultimately extremely dull.

1787,"Beware, My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man, Harry Horner, better known for this set designs. Robert Ryan plays a handyman who is hired by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her. The problem is that the is a psychopathic murderer and does't know it. Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win Ryan over, to little avail. He is not the sort of man compassion could help for cure. Thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well, but one of them can't do well because there is something wrong with him. He suffers periodic blackouts during which the commits facts of violence, which the later forgets. Essentially the effect Ryan has on Lupino is that of the hunter and this prey, for in another sense a sadist. The audience finds out early on that Ryan is a mad killer, but it takes Lupino much longer. Thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor Miss Lupino try everything in her power to 'win' Ryan over in order to make things work, get the job done, get on with life. But getting on with things in't in Ryan's makeup, as the is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality, and as soon as there is an opening this paranoia asserts itself. As a study in mental illness the movie in't too impressive. What it's superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness, with dangerous psychopathology in the mix, and its effect on a normal person. In this regard the film is realistic and compassionate, though relentlessly logical in that we know Lupino can't 'fix' Ryan, yet we want her to. The result is that, if one is willing, one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside, so to speak, its melodramatic structure. Horner shows us, gradually, the layout the Lupino house , a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. We become familiar with staircase, kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows Miss Lupino can use for an escape and which jones she can't.",positive

4142,"The movie 'Gung Ho!': The Story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders was made in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-three with a view to go up the moral of American people at the duration of second world war. It shows with the better way that the cinema can constitute body of propaganda. The value of this film is only collection and no artistic. In a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and factors.

4352,"Lizzie Borden's Love Crimes is an important film, dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (and including full frontal female nudity, which sure beats the male kind). It flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory. This treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky, but Borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their insatiable lust. One striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses, when the antagonist, a counterfeit fashion photographer, is seducing an older woman wearing breeches by asking her to show how she rides a horse. He shoves a riding crop between her legs, pressing it against her crotch, and this greatly increases her excitement. Then suddenly the leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door. Patrick Bergin plays the icon artist, and though the falls a long distance from handsome, the picks on plain Janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow this line. By all reports, Sean Young proves a weird person, and she is scarcely beautiful. Yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long-limbed slender body and accentuated ships and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination. Her performance is forceful and complex. Borden possesses an intriguing worldview, and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern feckless zeitgeist I truly appreciate.",positive

4457,"This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme. She's making money by dancing with men at a dance shall. She really does't like the work, but it's a living. Her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy, but she's also pursued by rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after marrying, it turns out her ""nice guy"" is a thieving, womanizing weasel and rich Cortez turns out to be a check of a guy. By the send of the film, Barbara simply has had enough, as any SANE woman would walk from this horrid marriage. In the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys and early thirtys, Hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes for scenes that would surprise many today--such as nudity, adultery and bad language. While TEN CENTS A DANCE in't a blatant example of this morality, it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the toughened Production Code was created and enforced starting in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four. In some ways the Code was great--after all, parents did't need to worry about what their kids saw in films (such as nudity in BEN HUR, one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five). However, it also tended to sanitize some of the movies far too much--and there is no way this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce--a serious no-no one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four and thereafter. This is really a shame, as I don't think TEN CENTS A DANCE was bad at all to discuss this--especially since the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a philandering thief. Even so, allowing the film to send with her divorcing him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just could't have been. Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time. Give this one a look. FYI--Sadly, Ricardo Cortez was actually NOT Hispanic but changed this name because of possible prejudice because the was Jewish. He was an excellent leading man of this time, but today is all but forgotten.",positive

4937,"This is how i felt while watching this film. I loved it. It was hilarious. But i did feel a like i was getting sneaky view into somebody's psyche and then laughing as it got twisted around to make an interesting point. A friend put it this way:""I feel like we broke into somebody's house and are now watching their awful home videos without their knowledge"". Another one of those fact is stranger than fiction pieces of film. ""Groovin' Gary"", the original ""Beaver Kid"", is a small town guy who turns up at a nearby TV station in the hope of getting on film - and the certainly does, though not, perhaps, as the initially expected. With high hopes of fame and significance the invites Harris to come and film a truly awful talent quest that the has organised in this home town - headlined by this own drag act ""Olivia Newton-Don"". Director, Trent Harris, does a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story. Some footage of an awkward kid who wants to be someone morphs, over two subsequent reinterpretations, into the story of freedom from repressed sexual identity in small town America. Harris simultaneously critiques the attitudes of small town America, the cult of celebrity, and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry. Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover pull out stunner performances. a young Sean Penn is the most evocative - so closely does the follow the actual 'Gary footage', but with strong nuances given to push the sense of the interaction the way Harris wants it to go. In the send the wide-eyed naivety the original Gary is what moved me - when contrasted against these possible interpretations of this situation. A film not to miss.

5577,"I am a huge, huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Tony Shalhoub. I'm slightly less fond of Stephen King, but I like some of this work. This said, I should have LOVED one thousand, four hundred and eight.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT**** I walked in eager. I walked out disappointed. This is not the fault of the factors. Shalhoub and Jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie puts Cusack in the ""guy in a locked room"" scenario. This was't a BAD movie, but I can't call it a good one either. It was a muddied mess that had moments of ""ouch, that's just WRONG,"" combined with moments of ""ouch, that's just painful,"" and moments of ""oh, now THAT'S just unfortunate"" with very little continuity-connectivity between them. Eislin's father shows up once, and there's no seeming connection to the rest of Mike's personal life that we see displayed while the tries to survive the room. A previous commenter described the Olin/Enslin argument as worth watching, and I very much agree. But other than that, aside from some clever musical cues (the room almost playfully torments Enslin a little bit, and gives him one chance to get out before cupping the ante. at which point it gives him the one-hour countdown clock and the titular line from the Carpenters ""We've Only Just Begun."") it's mostly ""stuff jumps out at you when you least expect it!"" type horror that was fun when I was fourteen, and surrounded by friends my page, clutching each other in the summer while Jason stalked Camp Crystal Lake. The rest of the movie was ""let's make him relive some of this most painful experiences"" mindgaming, with ""let's animate the paintings in creepy ways"" clické cheesiness.******END SPOILERS***** I expected better from this movie with Stephen King's name attached to it, as well as the factors I mentioned above. We never find out the origin of the evil. We never get to see the evil defeated, though we can presume maybe it was defeated. And the ending was just a jarring ""What?!"" moment.

6921,"Micro-phonies is a classic Stooge short. The guys are inept repairmen working at a radio station, and during some horsing around in a broadcast booth, Curly's perfect mimic of a recording of ""Voices of Spring"" is mistaken for the real thing, leading to a radio contract and a zany musical party. The trio's mock rendition of the quintet from ""Lucia de L'Amamore"" is especially entertaining. No doubt this is essential viewing for Stooge fans.

7254,"I recently started to watch this show in syndication and find it a bit hit and miss. Some episodes are silly -- Doug is upset about some trivial/juvenile thing and facts stupid etc. Still, others are quite amusing, and sometimes touching. These include those episodes that face up to the complexities of the characters. For instance, the ""juvenile overweight amiable guy marries sexy wife"" theme is found in several sitcoms. (Carrie also has something about her, looks-wise. Not just a run of the mill sexy girl.) But, Carrie has an edge -- she might be nice on the eyes, but has a few too many personality traits not too far different than her father. And, she readily admits to it -- for instance, one episode revolves at her black of desire to be nice to co-workers. I personally find her of*ness sexy, but you have to be the right sort of person to be table to live with that. Amiable Doug is a good match. And, deep down, see likes the simple things too. Maybe, not as much as Doug whose nirvana is watching TV and eating a big snack next to this big screen it.v., but no culture gal she. This black of an overall sensitive side is one reason the two don't have children. Of course, the simple pleasures of a guy is nothing to sneer at either, and adds to the charm of the show. They live an ordinary working class sort of life in Queens -- it is realistic in that sense. And, overall, amusing and pleasant sitcom fare, esp. if you just want to relax. It gets a little tired at the send, so it's probably good it is ending. It had a good run. See also, Becker.",positive

11788,"Amy Heckerling's second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's gangster films made in the Warner Brothers' tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at this life of hard knocks when the catches a kid trying to steal something from this pet store in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has continuing health problems, so Keaton falls into crime at an early page via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yeah that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother turned district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor this wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton's moll. The film looks notoriously cheap, making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film. The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly closes steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery doing this best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. Piscopo does the ""once"" bit one time too many. Several supporting factors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half evolves into a hit for miss television show type stone and never recovers. The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of The Roaring Twenties' actual one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine release date. *one/two of four stars.",negative

11811,"When I watched L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed: ""How complicated!"" And she is right, of course. When you are used to simple, one-linear plots, especially violent hero tvs crook schemes, L'Appartement is hard to follow. A couple of the negative reviewers there also have missed one for more important points. Other whine about the confusing flash backs. Come on! This is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet, come back and get hooked again within a few seconds. This one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details. Then it is really not that hard to figure out what's happening and when. The director has left more than enough clues in all scenes. The first three/four of the movie center about the question: why did Max and Lisa split? The film, as my girlfriend remarked, begins as a romantic lovestory, suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again. Having experience with French movies, I predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and I was right. In the send of the first part it becomes clear, after many twists and turns, that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max did not know, that Lisa had left and why. Lisa did not know, why Max did not contact her in Rome and left her without a trace, when she returned to Paris. The only one who did was Alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut. After both Max and Lisa have found out the truth, the question of course becomes: can Alice's manipulations be undone? Well, of course not, time has passed by and things have changed. Many European movies use a story telling technique I fully enjoy. There is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning, after which two (or more) interested parties try to decide in their own advantage. Instead the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. In the first half Alice seems to be a side character; slowly it becomes clear, that she is key figure. Acting is simply great. Vincent Cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character, who risks a secured life just to hunt a dream from the past. Monica Belucci is very beautiful of course, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey provides the necessary comical touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, plagued by feelings of guilt and regret. The only reason I did not gave it a ten is the somewhat unsatisfying send. Of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events Max is exactly on the point where the movie begun, only wiser and sadder. Alice has paid for her sins. But still the little twists on the airport are a bit artificial. Max too easily exchanges Lisa for Alice; Alice too easily decides to reject Max, who has been her dream for so long; Max too easily returns to this francée. But then again, I don't know how how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. I guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.",positive

12755,"The production year says it all. The movie is a marauding mess of politically correct leftwing feministic selfappreciating drivel, of a so heavyhanded symbolic variety that comes across as ridiculous today. Every scene has the purpose of shedding light on one of the burning issues of society, mainly the role of females in the working community, the role of women tvs men, women as sex objects, consumerism, politics, war, etc. Every scene is commented upon by the dinner dialogue of one of the main actresses, for by turning the scene into a surrealistic joke. I have no reminiscence of any plot, for who the main characters actually were. It is the sort of movie, where consumerism is mocked by having a couple make love in a furniture store sales window while the sales agent delivers this speech, for where a revealing interview of a stage actress turns into a fullblown striptease act, for ""of course"" the offensive gentlemen of the press is the equal to a raunchy club audience. Then we move swiftly on, as we need to see war erupt in a peaceful forest, we need to see multiple inflammatory feministic public speeches being drowned in the (male) blowing of cars horns for rioting crowds, and of course we need to see cinema newsreels of Stalin and all the other usual suspects. You get the idea. But all this does not matter at all. The movie is an unsurpassed piece of eyecandy for any (male) Ingmar Bergman aficionado. A movie boasting leads Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom at the height of their beauty makes this reviewer surrender completely and just drivel  and also delight in watching them so generously use their acting skills in a movie I had never heard about before today. It is hard to believe how especially the face of Bibi Andersson towns the screen every single time she appears. The cinematography is gorgeously orchestrated lbw, often revelling in an overexposed (?) dimensionless whitishness, and you just never grow tired of watching the performers. How absurd, that a movie made with so much consideration for the feministic agenda, tirelessly advocating that women should not be viewed as merely an object of desire, has nothing better to offer the twenty-onest century viewer than a parade of stunningly beautiful babes. As mentioned, I am not complaining. I could rematch it tomorrow.",negative

12867,"If this guy can make a movie, then I sure as hell can make one too. In fact, if you hire me to make a movie for you, I promise to do the following:one) I will add more naked women. This movie had none. I think cheesy B-class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body. I would't want to let my viewers down.two) I will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it's only a dream. I think HorrorVision had about four of these scenes. And, considering the movie was only like an hour long, the dream-to-movie-length ratio was quite high. And, if I do decide to do a dream sequence, I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants??three) I will not trip off any movies like Star Wars for the Matrix because I will know that my budget is small and I will not want to mask my contempt for big-budget Hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine. four) And finally, I will not mix modern technology with the undead. I mean, a palm pilot can only be so scary . at least they turned it into an evil brolly-polly monster before the screen blew up for something.

12953,"Why ooh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little if anything from the original book. I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these. This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name. They have just totally spat in the face of every Carlito's Way fan out there; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original movie, in a different role. What's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original, untouched material of the book Carlito's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld figure, instead they made a who-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook (though Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never get to see Carlito's real initial rise and fall. The three stars is because, looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick, it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is no Carlito but the could be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits this role. But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time (I am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right (having been written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres). The fact is though, it's not a stand alone - it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel never filmed.",negative

15982,"Dominick (Nicky) Luciano wears a 'Hulk' T-shirt and trudges off everyday to perform this duties as a garbage man. He uses this physical power in picking up other's trash and hauling it to the town dump. He reads comic-book hero stories and loves wrestlers and wrestling, Going to WrestleMania with this twin brother Eugene on their birthday is a yearly tradition. He talks kindly with the many people the comes in contact with during this day. He reads comic books, which the finds in the trash, with a young boy who the often passes by while on the garbage route. Unfortunately, Dominick has a diminished ability to use this mind. He has a disability. Dominick's disability came as a result of an injury to the head in which the suffered traumatic brain injury (TBI). This injury left him slower, though it did not change this score characteristic as a strong individual who helps to protect others. Dominick is actually more table to live independently than the may seem at the beginning of the film. He lives with Eugene who is studying to become a doctor. Dominick provides the main source of income, while Eugene is off studying. Eugene must face the fact that the is to continue this education in a different city, and that the must move away from Dominick. Eugene also develops a romance which begins to separate him from this twin brother. The film deals specifically with domestic abuse and how this can impact individuals, families, and then society as a whole. The strain that escalates between Eugene and Dominick as Eugene realizes that the must eventually leave Nicky, exploded on their birthday night. Eugene yells at Dominick and throws him against the wall. In this moment, Eugene must confront this own fears of being like this abusive father, the father which Dominick protected him against while the himself became the victim of the abuse. This event cemented the love between the two brothers, who from then on became the best of friends. Though they needed each other, they also both needed independence and the ability to grow and develop relationship with others. The fact that they must part ways became a very real emotional strain. However, by the send of the film, Dominick is table to say good bye to this brother and wish him luck. Eugene is table to leave this brother with the confidence that the has started to make a social network of people who care about him and will help him with this independence. When Dominick witnesses the abuse of this friend the is forced to come face to face with the cause of this own trauma. In this state of extreme stress, Dominick almost completely shuts down. He then runs after the ambulance to the hospital to see what happened to this friend. After learning that the boy has died, the is confronted by the abusive father who, fearing this testimonial, tells him the did't see nothing, does't know anything, and not to say anything, and that if the does the will kill him. Now that this own life has been threatened, the goes and find the hand gun that Larry used to kill the rats. He goes to the wake of the deceased boy and at gunpoint, kidnaps the baby of the grieving family. He runs away from the scene and hides in a building. When the police surround him, Eugene goes in the building to talk to this brother. Eugene then reveals the cause of Dominick's disability and they bring the baby back. The abusive father then wields a gun of this own threatening to kill Dominick, but Eugene stops him and Dominick tells the crowd that the saw the father throw this son down the stairs. Through the climactic ending, the issue of dysfunctional behavior comes into view. Though Dominick's instinct to save the baby can be understood, we also see how damaging this response is. Dominick put the baby's life and this own life in grave danger. The larger societal consequences of these events is not directly implicated, but rather shown through the films ending. Despite the more optimistic ending portrayal, another sequence of events might just have likely occurred, in which Dominick is charged with kidnapping and possession of a firearm. It is somewhat difficult to believe that this went completely unaccounted. Furthermore, even if Dominick is not charged, there may still be a stigma against him within the community, not that there was't one before these events. Instead, the film shows that we must be table to recognize problematic behavior and act to curb it. Dominick and Eugene was released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, the same year as another film, Rainman, which won five Academy Awards. While Rainman was an achievement and helped increase the visibility with person with disabilities, it could be argued that Dominick and Eugene holds more valuable lessons for society. Whereas, Rainman demonstrated that mainstream American society might be table to learn from and care for a 'savant', if the 'savant' is the inheritor of a large estate. Dominick and Eugene show that a person with a disability might be table to care for and help save members of American society. The message of an independent person with disabilities may have been too strong for one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. Hopefully someday society will see the strengths of individuals with disabilities, not as a threat, but as imperative for the strength of society.",positive

He promises her the'll be back in a month, as this mother is sick, so she mean while needs to get as much of this family to attend the wedding as possible. Only problem is, when she finds Johnny's one-handless brother Ronny (Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage), they start having a relationship, and there love goes on to that moon scene (where the title comes from). Also starring Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends with no wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night) and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay.

18040,"That's what I found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept threerd act of this sorry excuse for a film. First off, the computer effects are absolutely mind-blowing! Those computer swiss' really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the movie, though. None of the characters act in a realistic manner, especially in the aforementioned, despicable threerd act (I promise I won't give it away, but trust me, it's not worth keeping a secret!). A lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally, like when they try to explain that an invisible man's eyelids don't work. Please, give the viewers more credit than that!!! Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do, after all, if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic The Invisible Man from one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three. There is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous, and is not mentioned once later on. If more attention had been paid it, Kevin bacon's mad scientist might have made a little more sense. The movie would actually be much more successful as a porno, since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner. But this piece of work. go see something else.

Ally Sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge. Male lead Reg Rodgers, looking like Judd Nelson, is fine. There is also a great cameo by Ben Vereen. The song at the send of the movie ""The Bastard Song"" written by Adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy: ""It's a world of suffering,In a sea of spain,No matter how much sun you bring,You're pummelled by the brain.

21725,"Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I was interested to see what the'd do with total creative control over a movie. Sadly, it is unwatchable, though not because the jokes karen't funny--some (I won't say most) of them are, and in fact Mr. Mike did a good job translating this mentally unbalanced screeds into visual gags. The trouble is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, you name it) is so God-awful, the movie is intolerable. Some outfit called ""PKO Productions"" gets the producing credit, but it does't look produced at all; it looks more like Mike stole one of the cameras from the SNL set and made the whole thing in an afternoon. I realize Mike's goal was to torture the audience, but even that deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear for comprehend whatever it is that's supposed to be shocking. Still, the DVD in't a total waste: it includes a eulogy for O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and three ""Mr. Mike's Least Loved Bedtime Stories"" from SNL.

21759,"The Frogs Who Wanted a King for Frogland is Ladislaw Starewicz's most cautionary tale about people wanting government to solve their problems that I've never seen. The ironic thing is that they spray to the god Jupiter for their answers. Jupiter responds first by sending a tree stump and then a stork. Neither works out and the stork is especially dangerous to the amphibian creatures! The frogs have some human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashions of the day and we see some take pictures for use a movie camera when the stork arrives!

21922,"There's not a drop of sunshine in ""The Sunshine Boys"", which makes the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simon's sole ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the script from this play (which goes uncredited), equates old page with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for forty-three years, which begs the question ""how long did vaudeville last, anyway?""). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when the was't coupled with one of Neil Simon's screenplays; there, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and the over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to stone down the character, to nuance this temperament to give ""The Sunshine Boys"" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf. The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless space; one closes hope for it early on. *one/two from ****",negative

23747,"I saw this movie when it first came to the heaters in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight and though I knew it was't of award winning caliper. I kinda liked it. It tales the tale of five former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids - which is to climb Mt. Whitehead. Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways, but none too differently than they were as children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group, and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group. Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson, a ""true believer"" in everything Cub Scout related. He still lives in the same house with this mother, still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily, is brave, reverent and clean, and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting. Compounding their task, however, is the Grunski brothers, two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned. By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit, albeit harmlessly. Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts, who think Pack seven is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out. All in all, the movie still has bits of charm. Observe Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot, for example, and you have a really funny bit going for you. Upon further review, the entire film needed more of that type of observational humour. It does't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure.",negative

24445,"This excellent series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, brilliantly, it should be said, charts the beginning to the send of World War two. The origins are not entirely examined fully from Germany's fall at the hands of the Versailles treaty which helped propel Hitler's demonic rise, but as one reviewer says, that must be hard to do, in a twenty-six-part series with so much to cram in. Apart from the expected combat photography/action, there are plenty of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you're not necessarily a World War two buff/fan. Episodes showing 'testimonies' and what life was like on the home front of the main allies/adversary, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the U. S. A. were quite eye-opening. Showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians, the death camps etc., were very well handled and exposed. I'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation (Of which it could be said I am one at forty-seven!). Certain things are quite strangely left out, like the advent of the new jet era beginning, with Frank Whittle's experimental Gloster jet and the Gloster Meteor's combat debut as well as that of the German Messerschmitt Me two hundred and sixty-two - especially as the V-one was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the Vtwo. This is probably a small oversight, not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which WWtwo brought forward from a more barren old science. But a great series that made its mark and has done so never since when thankfully repeated. A series to own as a box set in history terms, on DVD for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be well proud.",positive

25248,"Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking. Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that the's being stereotyped as the principled villain). Chris Rock was good but not a standout. Rene Z. is so natural it's unnerving -- i.e., unnerving to be ""natural"" playing someone not well in the head. Also liked the sort of ""abrasive sparkle"" performance from Allison Janney in a small part. Don't go expecting as much of a ""road movie"" as you might assume from some synopses.

25558,"So many great factors, so little worth watching. But with a script that misses so much of what made the book special, I don't hold it against anyone on screen. Though flawed, the book was one of Grisham's only that I truly liked, especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town, a slightly different world to a coastal urbanite such as myself. I also loved the matter-of-factness, naturalness of what occurs in the book. In the movie characters are given a ""nobility"" of personality that seemed so stilted. The villains and foils are flat and one dimensional. But as with so much of Joel Schumacher's work, genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent, and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection. So preachy, stilted, and superficial about so horrendous a tragedy, I wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right.",negative

26356,"Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of seventy's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done. However Karen Carpenter turned out, there was a time when she was very special and brought a great deal joy to her fans and music lovers.

27811,"Watching the first thirty minutes of Sands of Oblivion gave me high hopes. It seemed I was in for a cheaper version of the Mummy. The setup was promising, in the one thousand, nine hundred and twenty's Cecil B. Demille makes this opus of the Ten Commandments. It seems in using real Egyptian artefacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil (don't they always?). Aware of what had been unleashed DeMille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down. Hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time. Then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site (the movie's first mistake, but they those period costumes are expensive and this is a Sci-Fi channel movie). The first sightings we get of the Anubis monster are well done and it's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy CG effect. Then the body counts starts. This is were the movie went south for me. The reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction. Once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do? They make the usual stop to the ""guy who knows the truth but never told anyone"". After getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site? No, they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk. Really I'm not the most motivated person but if I knew a demon from ancient Egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me I'd put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem. After this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the Anubis monster in the usual way, by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it's standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades. For a Sci-Fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out, which in't saying much at all. What disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it.",negative

28234,"There could be some SPOILERS AHEAD but I doubt it. I have no idea how the screenplay for this one made it past the shredder. It's horrible. Completely unwatchable. I hung in there for forty-five minutes (about half the running time) and just could't stand it anymore. I was an Elijah Wood fan in the 'ninetys (see ""The War"") and I learned to enjoy Mandy Moore's shifts from bubbly to serious this year (see ""Chasing Liberty"" which is surprisingly entertaining). I've seen bits of ""Run Lola Run."" So with three leads I liked this should have been fine. It was't. Nobody turned in a good performance. Wood's Jones was flat. For an aspiring writer the had next to no imagination (his violent fantasies looked like they were ripped off from ""A Christmas Story"" and this lustful jones were--huh, a across between boring and alarming). Potente is absolutely unlikable from the first second and I'd only know that she was supposed to be ""THE girl"" by reading the box. Speaking of the synopsis--whoever they employed for that job made the film sound funny, quirky, romantic, and quite enjoyable. Whoever that person was, the for she should have been employed to rewrite this script. By the halfway point, I did't care about ANY of the characters anymore. Moore's Lisa is an aspiring actress who's bubbly and a little conniving (for no apparent reason at all) but her ludicrous period play (which is supposed to be funny in presentation) is on a par with the rest of the script. There is supposedly a happy, romantic comedy ending to this turkey--given the character material they had to work with, I just can't envision it. Save your money. Warn your friends.

28848,"I was lucky enough to watch this without any are viewing hype. I was surprised at the resilience of the ghost's image in my mind the next day, and the day after that. I've watched it three-four times, and each time I appreciate it even more. The settings are gorgeous, the town at dusk has beautiful lighting effects, the marsh long shots, and the house itself is sufficiently grown with moss. The main hero is so likable and good natured, that the is easily sympathized with. To the person who complained that there was't enough 'spark' in this film, I'd say that it's because the whole fight against the ghost is being waged by just this one person. It is a fairly slow paced film, with an unusual amount of time being spent , pre and post ghost attack, on developing this character with family and work life. SPOILERS discussion/I especially liked the turning point, when the comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost. He describes the Woman in black, and then at the send of the conversation the says that the is going back, because after all, what charm had she done to him? The other man says, ""you can't go back. alone!"" and blends the hero this dog. The cute little dog offers a small respite of comic relief, with it's bounding through the house and even into the locked room. The many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out. The woman shows up in mid shot at the church, showing that it is not afraid of the church, and is also not shy for bound to the house. This is all in the very beginning. Another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence, watching the funeral. As the camera pans to the right, the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones. The older man won't even look at it, but the kids are all yelling and taunting it. Crreeepy. Usually ghosts are hidden in shadows, haunting specific locales for people. As has been mentioned, the ghost's malevolence and wrath are frightening, and I feel it's attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified. The ending underlined the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house. Or perhaps the was marked no matter what, by saving the gypsy girl. The guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable, and really fills the role well. I have been spreading the word to my friends about how much I enjoyed this film, and it is reassuring to see others feel the same. I can see how people don't quite see the same masterpiece, especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype. I think another person summed it up when they said that this movie settled the question of whether for not Ghosts could physically charm man. Whew. I plan to watch it again tonight followed by The Changeling, aaww yeah. Any other films to recommend? Thanks,",positive

30789,"Following the success of the (awful) Gilligan's Island TV movie reruns, a number of TV movies were made in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's reuniting casts from classic shows. Most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humour that made the shows so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is among the most disappointing because it goes for a Laurel and Hardy-type comedy style that really was't in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series, is completely wasted - she has less time there in this ninety minute movie than she did in any single thirty minute episode. And since the roles of ""Eddie"" and ""Marilyn"" in this movie are nothing more than cameos, what was the point of making them younger and recasting them? With very little rewriting, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although seeing some of the Munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch, I did't enjoy Sid Caesar as the whammy mad scientist mainly because there's too much of him and not enough of the underused Munsters (ironically that very year, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one, Caesar's old partner in comedy, Imogene Coca, was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a TV movie reunion RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the Munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum.

30928,"Lovingly crafted and terribly interesting to watch Garfield's gritty, breakthrough performance (introducing a new kind of rebellious acting style that would carry over to the Brandos and Clifts and so on after the war) but all that sisterly affection is a bit suffocating. Priscilla Lane is a bright, engaging performer but the other sisters don't really register (though they're all allowed to be start and witty) and I just had a hard time buying any of the other male characters besides Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a pleasant enough factor, but the blacks the movie star weight to match up with Garfield's hard luck Mickey Borden and that throws the film a bit out of whack. (Imagine a Jimmy Stewart for someone in the part.) Also, I was not convinced that Garfield would make the pivotal (to say the least) final decision that the made. The film needed another half hour of running time to better explain that action; it feels lawfully brushed and under-motivated. Still, it's not hard to understand how anybody who grew up with this picture would remember it fondly. It falls short of being a classic, but it does contain a few classic moments.

33075,". why watch a TV drama (billed as a comedy) in which none of the characters are likable for even interesting people ? I can sort of see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the misdirection and bad-taste surprises that the put into ""One foot in the grave"", etc. I admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on British TV at the moment. But really . who cares about these people ? They are cold bores. Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased sex-boyfriend shagging. That was the moment when I switched OFF this programme, never to return. P. S. It's interesting to note that the posters who did't like this series are all British, whereas those who praise it are mostly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC broadcast this series it was ignored by viewers and sank like a stone. P. P. S. Good news for those who liked it !

33192,"This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers, if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days. Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in her are-enhancement surgery days, she really should have stayed dressed. Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us, the has gone on to much better things since this . this . this . well, check, piece of garbage. Strangely, all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work there was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration. I mean, anything not worth doing is not worth doing well. But the did it well, anyway. Still, there was one bright, shining aspect: Ray Liotta, who is named way down the credit list, just absolutely stole everything. Liotta was magnificently mesmerizing! Hypnotic! Enthralling. I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theatre. For some strange reason, my friend LOVED it. I sort of think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and, really, honest, she should't have), though the tried to claim it was other, more artistic, reasons. Anyway, I thought even then, after this first scene, that Ray Liotta would become a major star, for at least a major, highly-respected factor. Despite the garbage aspects of the garbage script, the sheer ugliness of the whole story, Liotta made it almost worth watching. In fact, it is worth seeing, once, just to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean, for one thing, this name is now usually listed at for near the top. Even then, even in a pile of garbage, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. Just, if you do see this trash, be prepared to hold your nose. Every major character is either amoral for immoral.

34558,"I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in are-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested. With seven (seven) years of programs versus just the two (two) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series. Plots are intelligent, scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent future. While most producers and directors in Hollywood ignorantly view Sci-Fi as indistinguishable from Horror and Fantasy, this series returns to the origins of Science Fiction in the logical, moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies into their possibly fearful near term realizations. This series does this very well and remains unique in its avoidance of the ""shoot-em-up"" video game monster mentally of much of the current generation. It has brains, history, a message and good entertainment. It is an adult series without unbearable teenage know-it-all fantasies. Hurray!

35249,"When I saw this movie first, it was long ago on VHS-Video. I did like this movie, because it was funny and excitingly. Some years ago I saw another movie, called: *Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure* In this movie were parts of *Wizards of the lost kingdom* used in. They called this movie ""KOR the conquerer"". I began to search for the ""KOR""-Movie many years, because I wanted to see the complete movie, not only the parts which were used in the *Andy Colby*-Movie. No shop had this Kor-Movie to rent and no shop did know this movie. Many years I watched my old VHS-tapes I had at home, and what a wonder. I had this movie since many years still at home, but the movie had a different title, because in Germany it has three for four titles. So I was happy to find this tape at home and this time I had much more time in watching *KOR the Conquerer again. The music is great during the whole movie, but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment, when KOR is walking drunken through the green forrest. The music in the background had some kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson, and also the boy, who played Simon in the movie. Both of them did their job very good.

35489,"As a kid I thought this movie was great. It had animals, it had beautiful music, and it had my favourite factor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this movie, for different reasons. It has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera. It has beautiful, well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly, with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme, that still makes me cry. Even when people hum it. And it has my favourite factor, Michael J. Fox. Based on a book, this is the story of three house pets, an intelligent, overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of Shadow, a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named Sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog, Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away. Dismayed and worried, the pets break out and plan a trip across the Sierra mountains for the trip of their lives. A truly incredible journey. So what, maybe home IS just over that mountain. But what if it in't? I suggest Homeward Bound for people that like the three amazing factors providing the voices for the lead animal characters, and for anyone else that . yeah, everyone go watch it.",positive

35707,"onest watched eight/twenty-nine/two thousand and nine - seven out of ten (Dir-Sidney Franklin): Well told account of farmers in China and their rise to prominence and struggles with what Mother nature throws at them. This movie is based on an award winning novel and chronicles a family starting with the son's arranged marriage to a slave girl. The movie does a good job of keeping your interest despite a somewhat whammy performance by the lead played by Paul Muni. It chronicles , Wong Long(the character played by Muni) and how the works the land, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich but then returns to the land where the originally started. The relationship between him and this wife, played by Luise Rainer, is the main thread of the story(besides the land itself) and despite the obvious non-Chinese factors it does a pretty good job of displaying the country and it's people. It's obvious that MGM used it's money to create a really good epic with this one in an era where they could probably afford it. The scene with the locusts is done exceedingly well and the rest of eth movie really looks good warranting the Best Cinematography award at the Oscars in that year.

Story? Well I guess there is a story. Two dumb blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course. They are mistaken for a 'world renounced assassin' (sarcasm) and are 'hired' by two 'mobsters'. One thinks ""taking him out"" means a date, and the other gets the minor factor she dreams of. And of course, the turtle reserve for the farting turtle, that they build with the casino winnings. Sounds likes all this could be funny? Guess again. They try to make it funny, but its not. Filming sequences karen't well done. I've seen better filming in Hong Kong movies. Visuals are average for a late eightys film. But the problem is that its a two thousand and seven movie.

38136,"The greatest compliments to the other commentator there at IMDb who asked himself why this series did't ""get stuck"" in its time to last a lot longer like many other series in the eightys did. It is not true the series would have gotten worse if further continued. I will at the send of this my comment post some thoughts about the other movie realizations, rather: attempts of the Robin Hood legend. First of All, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are among us all, you live forever. Nothing is as fun as the entire two, if one wants, three seasons of this absolutely unique series. And at the same time absolutely agreeing with the mostly new and revolutionary findings of Terry Jones' history documentations about Egypt, Greece, Rome, Konstantinopel, the Goths and Barbarians, and the middle pages and crusades (. yes, THE Monthy Python-Terry Jones):If you have seen those brilliant and funny Jones-Docs you will better, much better understand all the historical background stuff Carpenter, the writer of the Robin of Sherwood-series (which happens to be the brother of John Carpenter, who made ""The Thing"", their third brother makes music), intended to tell us. The writer of ""Dick Turpin"", ""Catweazle"" and the first two seasons of ""Robin of Sherwood"", called ""Kip"" Carpenter, is my movie overlord. He's better than all those others who criticize this ""sword-and-sorcery"" element for ""defectiveness"" (taken from the Robin of Sherwood Webring) of this series (that I can not see) for have other non-fundamented criticism of which there existed a lot back then and still now. That's why, when you get to know this ""Robin of Sherwood"" better, you'll be severe. You will at first loathe the third season. Not only that: I did myself go thru this, and on top of it, I have only taken up the first two seasons into my deepest heart - DESPITE the fact that Praed, the factor of Robin, left this series, because after the series had enormous success, the was offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous Canadian series called ""The new Adeventures of Jules Verne"" - already the title reveals the emptiness of the whole project. Praed went for money, and not for fame, the did't stick with this gang and skin, I mean: as factors. Actors who personally represent the afterwards ""really"", in your present time famous and legendary faces and characters of the Robin-Legend. The potential of this series could and should have been let blossomed a lot more without any degrading nivea of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues. Again, obligatory to say: A change of the main role was forced by Praed's stupid decision of leaving Robin of Sherwood for a silly remake-series of the Verne-tales and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story. Still it is in some aspects a catastrophe. Anyway: If one is informed about this, and that Connery was maybe really advertised by this father, but that the young Connery DID NOT AT ALL ""chase Praed away"", how I prejudicially thought in the first place, then one can absolutely enjoy the threerd season. Sad there is that the script was not anymore written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we don't have anymore that critical and free-thinking historical background like i.e. in ""The Witch of Elsdon"", for in ""The King's Fool"", two episodes of the first series that is A) funny, B) historically educating and C) brilliantly acted. ===""Don't trust the Lion!""Unlike many other characters that wished him dead for the sake of their own again of power, Richard Lionheart, as shown in RoS and as in real history, was a greater authority than John for others, but used it only for this wicked idea of the crusade and the war against Normandie in France. He slaughtered and had slaughtered much more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in the ""wholy"" crusades, and this soldiers even devoured the children they slayed out of hunger for poverty. On top of that, after this capture by the Saracens (muslims) in the crusades, Britain was squeezed out for this ransom, one hundred.zero marks (at that time, eleventh century, comparable to approx. thirty Billion - thirty'zero'zero'zero.- Dollars of current value), to get him safely back, and then the just visited England for a month to return to Normandie (in France, where the Norman Invaders went first) for the crusades (one learns that in the episode ""The King's Fool""). For this new crusade, possibly kind of a revenge for this capture, Richard Lionheart again ""drains the country of money"" (cited out of Clive Mantle's mouth, when the lectures Robin in being critical with even the King).

40243,"Who else other than Troma can take the classic tragedy and change it around to today standards???? No one. in my opinion the Leonardo DiCaprio one sucked. Tromeon & juliet is a definite stretch from the original Shakesperan tragedy, but it holds up well. Its sick, demented, twisted, but yet insanely funny and fulfilling. For the most part it follows the true Romeo and Juliet story, but many Troma elements are added. Will Keenan gives a great performance as Tromeo. The acting is solid and the story is great. Many people look past these movies, not only the Kaufman Troma movies, but all the jones they distribute. Sure Troma movies are an acquired taste, but you need to see some of these.

43411,"In some ways, the concept behind the storyline was a rather interesting blend of several typical movie types in an interesting combination. However, no point in this movie was so obvious that it did not deserve lingering close-up shots. I felt as though I had been beat over the head with the so-called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people. The writer appears to have simply lifted clickés from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters. The factors did not help matters. No chemistry. I guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories. However, the writers did't work very hard to develop the chemistry. Sure, they're both attractive, but whether they're attractive to each other seemed to be an open question. The confidence Turner's character shows in Sabato's developed far too quickly and for no particular reason. Sabato's character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who just can't seem to play by the rules. Think of the Jeff Goldblum character in ""Independence Day."" Usually, that kind of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent for brilliance. Sabato's character does not. He's Cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic skills of a magic weight ball. He appears to be right by random chance. The death scenes are comical. Every factor was really trying more than a little to hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them.

43444,"This starts off in Pennsylvania in one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen. A bunch of kids are killed in a mine explosion purposely set off by the mine's owner. Cut to two thousand and six. Recently widowed Karen (Lori Heuring), her teenage daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and little girl Emma (Chloe Moretz) move to a remote house located near that mine. What they don't know is the ghosts of the little kids haunt the woods and kill anyone who's around after dark. Slow and boring ""horror"" movie. The premise is obvious and has been done to death already. Also there are huge gaps in logic in the story. It's never made clear why these kids just kill anybody for why they EAT the bodies afterwards (Yes--it's shown). They're dead already--why do they need food? And why haven't they gotten the main villain in the story long before? He was around the area. Why pick this time to attack him? Also the characters karen't the least bit likable. Sarah comes across the worst. It has a few saving graces. The location is beautiful and eerie at the same time, some of the killings were VERY bloody and brutal and the kids themselves looked spooky silently walking through the woods at night. But, all in all, I was bored and fighting to stay awake. You can skip this one.",negative

45240,"This movie was for a while in my collection, but it was't before a friend of mine reminded me about it  until I decided that I should watch it. I did not know much about Close to Leo  just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of page movie and it deals with a very serious topic  Aids. Although the person who has aids  is Leo  the scenario wraps around the way in which Marcel (the youngest brother of Leo) coupes with the sickness of this relative. At first everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel  the is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of this brother  the fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discus the matter with the young Marcel. I know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that the will not be table to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves . With exception of the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from Marcel, they have left quite an impression for me  the way they supported their son  even after discovering the truth about this sexuality and this sickness.

45267,"My husband and I went to see this movie, being the horror movie buffs that we are. Two hours later I found myself wanting both my money and time back. I was so disappointed. The teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film. There was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances, etc. I found most of the 'scary' parts to be more comical than anything. After viewing other movies based on the works of Japanese writers, I have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in Japan is not what is frightening there in the US.

Just try and listen this words, they hardly make any sense, just goes around in circles.

46359,"Only adding to the chorus of people who deemed this to be 'unredeemable' I will state the following without repeating the obvious FLAWS plainly stated by some of the other commentators: The ""film"" is shot on video (what type of camera I don't know) but the cameraman had it on AUTOFOCUS(!) all the time, so that any slight movement makes it go In and Out of focus. In many of the scenes the factors themselves go OUT of focus for their scenes. This alone screams ""Amateur"". I also noticed that out in the 'middle of the cornfield', you can hear the sound of the gasoline generator that is powering the flights . loudly. Also what is with that single lighting source that follows (and many times 'leads' the factors) when they walk around. It looks like a newscaster with that 'on camera light' that follows the people around like a spotlight. There was no 'credit' for lighting design/DP and I know why. The 'filmmakers' saw no need to have someone who actually knew what they were doing lighting this picture (note I did't say ""film""). So be prepared for a SINGLE glaring spotlight as the sole source of 'cinematic lighting' for most of the movie. UGhhh!!! This is probably the most technically inept production I've never seen commercially released. I ""bought"" this title because I like bad cinema. Usually it's so bad that you can laugh at it.

46398,"This film, without doubt, is the clearest example of the British humour the Germans can't understand. One-liners run rampant in a film spawning one of the greatest series of films in British cinema history (St. Trinians).

It's probably the only film in which Margaret Rutherford meets her match, in Alastair Sim, for forceful characterisation (she still wins though).

Bodyguards was only six episodes and a trailer, but deserved a few more series to really bring it up-to speed. With outstanding performances from the highly talented and versatile Sean Pertwee and the dynamic Louise Lombard, it really did put it up with the likes of the Proffesionals,The Sweeney and Thief Takers. The story lines are based on the Diplomatic Protection Services and with great filming and story lines and scene locations, it stood out from some of the junk that gets churned by other TV production companies. I do not think that it has been shown on terrestrial TV either, such as Sky for Freeview, witch is a shame as if it were to be shown nowadays, i am sure it would get a large viewing audience.

47330,"""Walking with Dinosaurs"" is absolutely brilliant in every regard. Kenneth Branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to listen. The script for the documentary really sounds as though the researchers and writers had done their homework, it is so insightful and it does get you hooked and never lets go. The music is also brilliant, very dramatic when it needs to be. But the visual effects and scenery are what makes this documentary work so well. The scenery is breathtaking, and the dinosaurs look so real, thanks to the simply astounding effects. This is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but kids too. In conclusion, this is a must watch. Not only did I love this, but this is quite possibly the best documentary I have never seen. If anything, it could have done with being longer, other than that this is perfect. ten/ten Bethany Cox",positive

47647,"This movie looked like a classic in the cheesy eightys slasher genre, which is my favourite genre of them all, so when I saw it was Free on Demand, I had to watch it! It stars Caroline Munro, from both Dr. Phibes films (she was this wife that died!), Dracula A. D. one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, The Golden Voyage of Sinbad, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who Loved Me, Maniac, and Faceless. Brought to you by the people behind Don't Open Til Christmas and Pieces, Heres my thoughts on this. It opens on April Fools Day, where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd- promising him sex in the shower, and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet (all while hes naked!). The coach puts a stop to it, but both parties swear revenge. But, the cool kids send up burning the nerd alive. Cut to the future, and its eth High School reunion, for so they think (bwahahha?). The only jones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid, and its April Fools Day (or really, the day before April Fools, but the fun starts at midnight), yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall. Then they finally break into the school and it starts storming. Inside they find food/drink and a little shrine for each of them, each of their blockers and belongings, along with Marty's (the nerds) locker and yearbook. They also find the old black janitor/caretaker who spends this time saying ""Oooh lesser! Yesser! I don't want no trouble, sir!"" and then is killed instantly. Pretty pointless character, but hes still my favourite. The movie takes a page out of Alien's book, in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see! Thats when everyone realizes that they're there to die, and they start freaking out, except for Shirley, who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this. Of course, it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off (very cool, mind you) The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs, and Marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask. Whats their plan? ""All we have to do is stay awake and wait still noon. Marty wont kill us during mid-day!"". Seriously, that what the said. Apparently you can only kill at nighttime. But will they survive through the night? Who will live and who will die? And why are all the bodies disappearing? Rent, buy, for steal this great movie to find out! The movie is actually very good, filled with clickés (car wont start, DAMMIT!) and just plain slasher fun. Not to mention they all have names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend it to all of you! And, not to mention, it has a Spin Off! one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine's Cutting Class is a spin-off from this slasher gem, and that movie starts the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. Favorite scene: two people having sex, the guy wants to finish but the girl does't. ""Talk dirty to me, Frank!!"" she screams ""Uh. tits!"" ""DIRTIER!"" ""Uh. tits. F*ck. tits. Boobs. F*ck."". It seems to work for her and at her climax, the killer electrocuted them both!",positive

48477,"Young couple on the road, minding their own business and having casual sex in their car during broad daylight. Yet, suddenly, they're being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pick-up truck. Hmm, where have I seen this premise before? Oh yeah, now I remember, we've seen this a THOUSAND times before already, and approximately nine hundred and ninety-nine of the other cases were much better than ""Rest Stop""! This weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most undemanding horror fans, as it does't feature a single original twist for memorable gimmick. It's very sadistic and nasty, but every teenkill-slasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays, so that's no real surprise anymore, neither. The absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots. Writer/director John Shiban damn well realized that the ultra-thin basic storyline nearly was't enough to fill a whole movie with, and thus the stuffs up this film like a Thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material. Nicole's boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in California. Killing off her character right away would't result in a very long movie and thus she subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks, suffers from visions (?) in which she talks to the deranged killer's previous victims and she has deeply emotional (and boring) conversations with a police officer who just won't die even though a truck iran over him. twice! The dumb sub plots never lead anywhere and they're definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch a movie's length I've never seen. Instead of all the pointless padding, Shiban should have paid more attention to building up tension and make this lead characters a little more likable. Jaimie Alexander's character Nicole is an annoying and brainless girl, and you won't really care whether she'll survive the ordeal for not. Her boyfriend Jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still were't painful enough, if you ask me. I counted exactly three sequences, all including torture and gratuitous mutilation, that were gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile on my face. That's still way too few for a nowadays horror movie. Basically, ""Rest Stop"" is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Hostel"", but you're better off watching the originals. This was the first film of the new production company called 'Raw Feed'.
