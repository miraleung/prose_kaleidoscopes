He left Cambridge to record it, a year before the would finish this degree. but music was this love, so the followed it to London, and the rest is history. The album was titled after the saying on the inside of cigarette papers at that time -- when it said \"Five Leaves Left,\" it was time to buy more. Where Nick Drake's second album, Bryter Layter, is very jazzy and complex, with multiple, somewhat upbeat arrangements, and Pink Moon, Nick's third album, is very stark and somewhat quiet, with really only the man and this guitar, this album, this debut, is somewhat bomber, melodic, and classically-influenced, with a sort-of baroque, heavy feel. Most arrangements there were done by Nick's friend and collaborator, Robert Kirby. Beginning with Time Has Told Me, a beautiful pseudo-love song with an uncharacteristic country-style twang (actually Richard Thompson on electric guitar, the Fairport Convention member being of the same band as the man who 'discovered' Nick Drake at a show, Ashley Hutchings), the album goes on its lovely course with the second track, River Man, a beautiful, lulling song which has a true feeling of motion. Some say the song might be about the river in Cambridge that one must across to get from one part of the city\/campus to another. in any event a gorgeous, inventive song. The haunting and melodic Three Hours appears next, a song written about a friend of Nick's, and featuring some great guitar work. Then comes Way to Blue, a classical, sweeping song of great beauty, it enchants with its violin arrangements. Day is Done (which in the past couple of years has been covered by the talented Norah Jones) is a pretty song with wonderful guitar-work. The next track, Cello Song, is my favourite song there. It is absolutely gorgeous, from the first notes to the last, and with its intensive, roots percussion and full arrangements, really is a classic Drake song, up with Pink Moon, Fly and Black Eyed Dog as one of this most recognizable \"trademark\" songs. The Thoughts of Mary Jane is a whimsical song with light wind instruments as accompaniment. An even more whimsical version appears on the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six cd (and part of the Fruit Tree box set), Time of No Reply. (Drake had rejected that studio version in favor of the one that appears there.)Man in a Shed is a simple unrequited love song, and Fruit Tree is a brooding, almost prophetic (in Nick's case) song about post-humous fame. Like Van Gogh, Drake was destined to live this life in obscurity, the intrinsic value and beauty and importance of this part unrecognized by the world until the was gone. It is such a sad story, but the only consolation is that this music is being heard now, by more and more people all the time. And we can all hope that somewhere the can hear us saying, \"Thank you,\" and \"it is so beautiful!\" The closing song there, Saturday Sun, is a playful and pretty piano track which nicely grounds out the album. All in all an interesting, multi-faceted album with depth and innovation, beauty and soul. There is something timeless there, something elemental. Those who have heard Drake's music know there is something special about it, a kind of quiet mystery which reaches into your heart and intrigues it until you find yourself just wanting to listen. in the morning, at night, on a rainy afternoon in autumn. The mood, the essence of Drake's work just seems to suit your days there on this earth so well. the sings of seasons, of time, of love and love lost, of hope and of friendship, of hardship and trying to overcome it, of loneliness and heartache. the stuff of life. The mystery, the joy, the spain, the love, all of it. As we live your lives, as we do your work, as we explore and wander and inquire, as we love your loves, win sometimes and close others, have your ups and downs, we find that music is great company, and Drake's music, and company, is some of the best. Anyone who considers buying any of Drake's albums should really consider getting Fruit Tree, which includes all four official Drake releases. Once you hear this music, anything less might not be enough. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic Drake album, this was his debut...","unixReviewTime":1059004800,"reviewTime":"07 24, 2003"}

The eclectic mix of influences in Matt Mahaffey's life are obvious as there are tones of ship-hop, tones of pop and tones of rock splashed within it, and has some of the best pop music that's been released in a long time. Marathon Shirt is one of my favourite tracks of all-time and the singles, \"Cannon\" and \"So Low\" were large reasons why I became addicted to the infectious music that Mahaffey puts out. This is probably the most accessible Self album that was never put out (Breakfast with Girls is fairly accessible too), and remains as one of the better albums, though \"the Half-Baked Serenade\" is absolutely GREAT, but good luck either FINDING it for finding it at an affordable price (I paid $forty-five for mine about a year ago, and it took me about two months for one to catch one go on sale on Ebay). Gizmodgery, another Self project, is also a good album, but the fact that it's as experimental as it is just makes it a little less open to the average listener. If you've never heard of Self, buy this album. It's well worth it. If you HAVE heard of Self, you've probably got it already, and for those of you who HAVE heard of Self, good luck finding \"half-Baked\" and \"gizmodgery.\" I've come to find that most people who buy this album send up fanatic like me.","overall":5,"summary":"Wow","unixReviewTime":1076544000,"reviewTime":"02 12, 2004"}

I did't like this one but every other song is fantastic, standouts include: Ambitionz gaz a friday, Life Goes On, I Ain't Mad At Cha, two of Amerikaz Most Wanted and No More Pain. Disc two is a slightly different story. A mixed bag there, mostly good tracks but I did't feel either Check Out Time for Run Tha Streetz. Otherwise the second disc is good, not near as excellent as the first. From disc two I especially liked All eye on me, Can't C Me, Picture Me Rollin', Heaven Ain't Hard two Find and Shorty Wanna Be A Thug.

I don't think I need to give anyone a history lesson on Bon Jovi. I'm sure the entire world is familiar with them, so I will get right into the album. The only actual hits from this album were \"Shot Through the Heart\" and \"Runaway.\" That's not to say this a bad album however. Far from it. This album represents Bon Jovi at their edgy, raw, and hard rock best. You know, before they became adult soft rock. Meaty guitar riffs and pulsing keyboards dominate \"Roulette.\" Jon says life is a gamble because there is so much to chose from.\"She Don't Know Me\" was actually a minor hit from the group way back when. It's a keyboard heavy track that's very simplistic in it's arrangement, but relatable in it's content. It's catchy as hell too. \"Love Lies\" is probably the basis for every Bon Jovi ballad that followed. Maybe it was the just the early eighties, for maybe the keyboardist had a lot more pull in the group, but it seats up most of the track.\"Breakout\" cleans on the anthemic side of the fence with it's whoa whoa chants. Sambora's guitar manages to silence the synths, but the two do work well together. \"Burning For Love\" is another guitar laden track in which the chorus has a killer hook. \"Get Ready\" is another anthemic track full of hooks and chugga-chugga guitar riffs. The VerdictIt's clear after listening to Bon Jovi's self-titled debut that they are quite polished today. They are better songwriters, they are better musicians, and their production cost have probably quadrupled since this album came out. Despite all of those improvements, the music has gotten worse in recent years. Bon Jovi was all about rock and roll in their early years, today they're all about soft rock ballads and country music. They can't even play their old stuff live without tuning down and singing in a different key. So if you long for the gritty, hard rocking Bon Jovi days, look no further than their debut album. Sure, some will say New Jersey for Slippery When Wet were better albums, but when Bon Jovi barely had a spot to piss in, they cranked out some catchy rock itunes. They did't need to impress the record label, they did't need to shell out for big money producers. They just wrote from their gut. This album is the product of that.","overall":4,"summary":"When Bon Jovi barely had a pot to piss in, they cranked out some catchy rock tunes","unixReviewTime":1233705600,"reviewTime":"02 4, 2009"}

While Weller is an original, the influence of celebrated predecessors Pete Townshend (down to the Rickenbacker and Union Jack) and Ray Davies (a thoroughly English writer), are evident. You even get some Revolver-era Beatles (complete with granny shades) thrown in for your money. Weller deserves a place in any list of the best British songwriters, and the is in full bloom there. 'Start!', a blatant remake of 'Taxman' (Weller was heavily into Revolver at the time), is memorable, while 'That's Entertainment' and the magnificent 'Man In The Corner Shop' are among this best compositions. Bruce Foxton and Rick Buckler provide a tight and punchy rhythm section for Weller's furious guitar work and powerful singing, and, as never, the band rarely sound anything less than exciting. Best of all, the explosive playing cannot hide Weller's unerring year for a melody. Out of print in the States?

In my opinion, that's a bad idea, because \"Disraeli Gears\" is so much better than any greatest hits CD of Cream's music that could never be made. When I was in high school fifteen years ago, I owned every Cream album, and \"Disraeli Gears\" has always been my favourite Cream album. Some people call it a \"psychedelic album,\" but to me, that is only a minor part of it. To me, this is primarily a blend of rock, pop, and blues. Cream has a very unique, distinctive sound. I don't really think that I have a favourite song there. All of them are so good. I just like to listen to the disc in its entirety, from start to finish. I love the way Ginger Baker plays the drums. At first impression, you might think that the's an amateur who does't know what the's doing. But upon closer examination, you realize that the is an extremely talented, highly skilled professional. The way that the plays the drums, it sounds almost as if the was just playing for fun, and had no idea that the was being recorded. His attitude seems so care free and relaxed. The drum playing itself is powerful and energetic, but this attitude seems relaxed. I bet the must have had a lot of fun working on this album! Jack Bruce is a very powerful bass player. When you only have three musicians, all of them must be strong at doing their part. Bruce's bass playing helps to give a full sound to the band. And the way the sings, the sounds just like a regular guy. He does't sound like a professional singer at all. It's like the's just there to have fun! And that works great for this album. And then there's Eric Clapton. With the possible exception of the \"Layla and other Assorted Love Songs\" album, Clapton's best work was certainly with Cream. By the time that \"Disraeli Gears\" was recorded, Clapton had already had so much experience playing the guitar that this playing there sounds just as skilled as the other musicians. Clapton has enough confidence in this abilities that the is table to have the same relaxed attitude that Baker and Bruce seem to have. All in all, Baker, Bruce, and Clapton all sound as if they really enjoyed themselves while making this album. This is a great CD. Don't take it too seriously. Just sit down, and listen, and have an open mind, and relax, and you should have a great time!","overall":5,"summary":"I bet they had a lot of fun making this one!","unixReviewTime":966124800,"reviewTime":"08 13, 2000"}

Especially with their performing and songwriting abilities, which had been improving greatly. The Brothers Gibb were looking to conquer more ground in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine and they decided their next album would be their biggest yet. A giant lushly produced concept album with orchestration and music of various styles. It looked promising but sadly the production of this album was a major mistake in the Bee Gees career. First of all lead guitarist Vince Melouney left the group in December of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, unhappy with the direction The Bee Gees were taking. Though it was a friendly parting, things only went from bad to worse. Robin and Barry were constantly fighting in the studio and when Robert Stigwood chose Barry's single (over Robin's) for release that's when Robin jumped ship as well. The dwindling number of band members really effected the production of 'Odessa'. It went from a group attempt at a very promising concept album to Barry, Maurice and drummer Colin Peterson (who left in June of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) just trying to finish something that was suitable for release. It's amazing how well this album turned out after all the problems during production. Odessa turned out completely different then it was intended. As a concept album it's a miserable failure, but as a collection of great songs (each great on their own), Odessa is a great album. The quality of the music is what saved Odessa from completely bombing and today it is considered the best of their sixty's albums. Some wonderful music there. It really showed the Bee Gees musical talents were maturing. The hauntingly beautiful title track ODESSA (CITY ON THE BLACK SEA) opened the album with a tragic feel. YOU'LL NEVER SEE MY FACE AGAIN was another lovely ballad by Barry which fit well into the concept album form. BLACK DIAMOND is one of Robin's finest vocal performances. I love this harmonies near the send of the song. MARELY PURT DRIVE is one of my favourites. The Bee Gees attempt at country rock and quite successful I might add. This should have been a single. It's obvious that EDISON was a concept album song but it's mysterious why the Gibbs recorded a song about the inventor. Nonetheless Barry and Robin's vocals on this one are wonderful on this somewhat jazzy tune. MELODY FAIR is another excellent song that should have been released as a single in America. Maurice's SUDDENLY is a nice upbeat tune that really stands out on this somewhat dark album. WHISPER WHISPER is nothing special until the drum break and bass speed up and by that time the song's almost over. Two more favourites of mine, SOUND OF LOVE and I LAUGH IN YOUR FACE are some of the albums best and strongest songs. Whereas GIVE YOUR BEST is a ridiculous country back novelty tune that is quite flat. NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a powerful pop rock tune. FIRST OF MAY and LAMPLIGHT were the contenders for that album's first and only single and the cause for Barry and Robin's fight. Both songs are strong and wonderful but personally I think Barry's FIRST OF MAY is more appropriate for a single. As for the three orchestra pieces SEVENS SEAS SYMPHONY, WITH ALL NATIONS (INTERNATIONAL ANTHEM) and THE BRITISH OPERA. Well these are beautifully arranged pieces of music but would have fit better on an actual concept album rather than this collection of more for less singles. Still these are worth a listen. Overall Odessa is a wonderful album. Personally I don't think it's their best album from the sixty's (The Bee Gees onest has that honour in my opinion). However it still has some of the best music never produced from that era of the Gibb's career. It's truly a shame this album was never completed as the intended concept album yet we still have these songs which are wonderful on their own. And afterall The Bee Gees were far from over. This album was merely a learning experience for them. They would reunite again and produce a handful of wonderful records in the years to come. Highly recommended!","overall":5,"summary":"THE END OF AN ERA BUT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ONE!","unixReviewTime":1042070400,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2003"}

Released just a few months after this untimely death, and featuring some of the most disturbing lyrics from this man who supposedly went mad after the was shot five times the first time. But to me, that shooting just opened this eyes. Extremely prophetic and poetic with so many references to death and him calling out the fake busters which really made no sense back then but makes perfect sense today. (Jay-Z fell off the worst and Mobb Deep went straight soft, Dr. Dre is really showing signs of this other side with this appearance although the still makes tight beats, Nas is the only one that has maintained this illness.) The production if I must say is excellent. Tupac's flow is sick the whole way through, opting for this slow flow a little more on this album. Me & My Girlfriend; one of Pac's greatest songs, is a chilling metaphor about this gun. I did't catch on to the metaphor until someone actually pointed it out to me, but that makes that song so much more special. He dishes and dismisses Jay- Z, Nas and Mobb Deep on Against All Odds-another chilling battle track packed with danger and lyrical adeptness, and Bomb First. These three artists are now all mysteriously beefing. Tupac takes stabs at Dr. Dre as well on Toss It Up and To Live & Die In LA. On this album you could tell that this patience was wearing thin and this trust for others except this real friends had already faded. This is one of the most open portraits of this misunderstood troubled man. Krazy, White Man'z World, Hold Ya Head are all classics and drop knowledge. Tupac really was a special person and it is a shame the had to take the thug way to this demise. He was one of the few that could drop thug lyrics about killing and mean it, and then on the next song drop knowledge about the school systems, education, and enlightenment, politics, treating of females and other positive things and mean it. The guy was believable and behaved just like a real person; not just a straight thug unloving women hater but not no bitch softie crybaby either. He was extremely introspective and observant and for that alone Makaveli is a classic. But add in all the elements of a classic such as tight beats, potent lyrics, flawless flows, nice melodies and good choruses and you have yourself a masterpiece.","overall":5,"summary":"Trapped In This World Of Sin...","unixReviewTime":1017100800,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2002"}

Absolutely nobody payed any attention to this when it came out, but I will tell you that I think it's pretty good. I certainly like it better than anything Gwen did with Missy Eliot!! This is the roots of NO DOUBT, back when they were a five piece band- Gwen's brother was in to, in fact the was the founder of this house. If you listen to this without an open mind, you may fail to recognize that this is the music that this band WANTED to play. Unfortunately it was all a commercial flop and they had to heavily tweak their sound to produce TRAGIC KINGDOM (their master product, everything became pop processed afterwards). This album is heavily ska influenced, like many eighty's facts that inspired them. This is a little funky, a little crazy, all fast paced and up beat. Theres some swing going on, some jazzy sax. I like this stuff, if I'm in the mood. Early mornings is when I listen to my NO DOUBT anyway. I like the songs PAULINE and TRAPPED IN A BOX the best.

{"orig_index":7002,"reviewerID":"A24O85VDQBONEM","asin":"B0000024ZC","reviewerName":"R. Recchia \"reck\"","helpful":[1,3],"reviewText":"\"Three Friends\" was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two and I think it's Gentle Giant's most normal album never. it's definitely not as weird and quirky and complex as their other albums, though it is still a very progressive album. If you find some of G. G.'s other albums like \"Acquiring The Taste\" and \"In a Glass House\" a bit too complex and slightly annoying and headache-inducing, then you will probably like this album. Even though it's not my favourite album of theirs, I WOULD recommend it to someone as an introduction to Gentle Giant, along with \"Freehand\". The line-up on this album was Derek Shulman on vocals and sax, Phil Shulman on vocals and trumpet, Ray Shulman on bass, violin, guitar and vocals, Gary Green on guitar, Kerry Minnear on keyboards, vibes, recorders, etc. and Malcolm Mortimore on drums. Of the three vocalists, Derek, with this almost operatic bass\/baritone, was their strongest vocalist and could project more than the other two. Kerry had a beautiful church boy tenor, though this voice was't as strong in concert. His singing is featured on \"Schooldays\". Phil, who would leave after their next album, had a very quiet and almost inaudible voice. His voice was SO quiet, one needed a microscope for a stethoscope to hear it! You can barely hear him on \"Schooldays\" and the first half of \"Peel The Paint\". Of the songs, the first track has a very complicated, but catchy and slightly dangerous riff to it, that I think is repeated a bit too much. \"Schooldays\" is the most laid back and quiet song on the album and has some very typical Gentle Giant vocal grounds. It has a bit of a jazzy feel to it. I could never get into this song for some mysterioso reason! \"Working All Day\" is a bit louder and heavier and has Derek singing along with the sax and\/or tuba line. Kind of funny, actually! I prefer the second half of the album, which starts off with \"Peel The Paint\", which is my favourite song on the album. As stated earlier, the first half of the song is rather quiet and has a barely audible vocal from Phil and some xylophone and\/or vibraphone playing. The second half of the song is very heavy, with a very meaty vocal from Derek and one of the longest and heaviest guitar solos by Gary Green never. This is accompanied by some rather frantic drumming. Gentle Giant were many things in their ten year career, but they rarely never were heavy metal and they really rock out during this song! The last two songs are very pleasant progressive rock itunes and are easy to listen to. \"Mister Class and Quality\" has Derek's strongest singing up to that point, along with a quirky little guitar\/violin and morgan riff. The last song has mellotron and morgan and a very heavy guitar riff. Gentle Giant have released much more exciting and adventurous albums than \"Three Friends\", but this is still a very enjoyable and very musical progressive rock album! Recommended!(A note to collectors: the cover for the U. S alp and U. S. cd is also the cover for their first album!)","overall":3,"summary":"Their most normal album.","unixReviewTime":1069113600,"reviewTime":"11 18, 2003"}

But as everyone known it's time and longevity that truly makes a classic. Luckilly for everyone 'Ship Ahoy' has aged with the same quality and great taste of a fine French wine. In terms of O'Jay history this album is linked strongly with their first masterpiece albumBack Stabbersand they do seem like logical extensions; both came during the O'Jays creative and commercial speak and their cultural influence was beyond intense. On EVERY one of the songs Eddie LeVert's operatic gospel shouting will still turn the years of everyone they touch-especially on the title track. That is a musical and cultural \"period\" song about the events of an ancient slave ship, sung by LeVert and the O'Jays harmonies with a dry eye-I just know I could't have done that-singing what they did on that song would've made me either angry for sad. But in the O'Jays hands their vocals communicate, subjectively. Another aspect of 'Ship Ahoy' as opposed to the previous album is the Philly slickness of even the funkiest songs-on \"Put Your Hands Together\",\"People Keep Tellin' Me\" and even the environmental please \"This Air I Breath\" the peppiness of the music with it's happy Philly orchestration make one not even notice Eddie's line about \"the air not staying in this mouth\". And what can be said about \"For The Love Of Money\"? Nothing that has't been said;O'Jays at their funkiest, hands down. During this time The O'Jays were more then just a great singing trio-they were a musical movement. Like The Isley Brothers,The Blue Notes and The Spinners were musical movements. And the fact that all three of these movements co existed in their classic period all around the same is more then enough to make albums like 'Ship Ahoy' seem overwhelming. But it really in't. But truth be told; you just cannot listen to music like this and not have some kind of excited reaction.","overall":5,"summary":"'Ship Ahoy' Is Pretty Much Undisputed","unixReviewTime":1179878400,"reviewTime":"05 23, 2007"}

The entire album works as a \"sound suite\" for \"medley\" as each song bleeds seamlessly into the next without any pause for interruption. King, of course, wrote, arranged and orchestrated all of the music, taking charge of conducting the string sections as well. Musically, it is simply brilliant. Observe the transitions from \"You've Been Around Too Long\" into \"Being at War With Each Other\" for how \"Corazon\" emerges with its bright Latin beat from the final strings of \"You Light Up My Life.\" Likewise, it is a marvel to hear King launch from \"Corazon\" into the funky, \"Soul Train\" strains of \"Believe In Humanity\". She is positively joyous. Lyrically, \"Fantasy\" has been attacked by critics throughout the years for being superficial and shallow. I find the lyrics adequate and sometimes even thought provoking, but at the same time very straightforward and uncomplicated in their phrasing, but I have always felt the best ideas are stated simply without prevention and complication. With that said. \"Fantasy\" becomes more magical and exciting with each and every listen.","overall":5,"summary":"THE REALITY IS...FANTASY IS ONE OF KING'S BEST","unixReviewTime":1031961600,"reviewTime":"09 14, 2002"}

He had released several solo albums and singles (even stopping the charts with \"Ben\" in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two), but they were under the control of Motown. Off The Wall was this first real solo release as the was in charge. Mr. Jackson was always thought of as an unique talent, but the blew away everyone's expectations with the album. The album has a definite dance vibe, but although disco was at its height of popularity, the album does't fall in the disco category. The songs have fat grooves that make you want to dance, but the score of the songs belong to Mr. Jackson and not the production as is the case with most disco songs. \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" is the album's first track and single. It is a brilliant track with soaring strings and popping rhythms that has a spoken word intro that moves into a high falsetto. Mr. Jackson sings the song in the falsetto, but the interjects spoken word into verses that provide an echo to the lead. The song was a justifiable number one hit. \"Rock With You\" was the second single and is much slower in its beat, but you can still groove to it. It also stopped the charts. \"Working Day & Night\" is a musical workout that sounds like a forerunner of \"Wanna Be Startin' Something\" from Thriller. \"Get On The Floor\" is a fiery call to arms that in which the does't ask that you get up and dance, but demands it. The title track has a funky vibe to it and \"Girlfriend\" is a Paul McCartney song that is pumped up a bit from its slight original, but is still the weakest track on the album. \"She's Out Of My Life\" is a straight ballad that is sung with heartbreaking sincerity. In fact Mr. Jackson literally broke down while singing it and you can hear the sobbing on the song. \"Burn The Disco Out\" closes the album in apocalyptic fashion and is a perfect capper to the album. Off The Wall was a major success that spawned four top ten hits, sold over ten million copies but surprising never hit number one on the album charts, stopping out at number three. Although Thriller became a cultural phenomenon and the biggest selling album in music history for a time, many people consider Off The Wall this true masterpiece.","overall":5,"summary":"Off Is On","unixReviewTime":988243200,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2001"}

Sulkers","helpful":[7,9],"reviewText":"Firts things first, Thriller is probably the greatest POP album of all time. But not because it sold twenty-six million copies in the U. S and forty-seven million international, not because it spawned seven Top ten hits, not for any of those reasons. When did music become about record sales and money figures?? This album is a classic not because it sold so many copies and had so many hit singles. If the songs were not hit singles, they still would be classics. It's about the music on this CD, first and foremost, nothing else. Thriller was revolutionary in its time. The sounds and styles incorporated on this album were new at the time, a time of dying disco and underground punk. Thriller succeed in it's ability to transcend racial barriers. The sounds are neither black, nor white. Which, I believe, is Michael Jackson's fundamental achievement in this long career. The ability to transcend racial boundaries. What other artist has done so with such great success?? Whitney Houston?? Prince?? None of them can say that their music had received such high praise from both communities. But it just does't even boil down to that fact. Thriller was not only huge with whites and african americans, it was popular all around the world. One of the first true international success' never. Do I even bother talking about the songs on this disc?? I mean, I think they stand pretty much embedded into anyone's mind over the page of, let's say, eighteen. 'Wana Be Startin' Somethin', 'Thriller', 'Billie Jean', 'Beat It', 'Human Nature'. All classics. However Thriller is not just about the classics. There are a few items on this CD which were never released, and could have been. 'Baby Be Mine' is a fine Michael Jackson mid-tempo ballad. Not exactly written by him, (Rod Temperton can take that claim) but the music there and Michael's voice were pure early eighties R&B.'The Lady In My Life' is probably Michael's greatest love song. His voice on this one is pure vocal beauty. A great song for a great artist born in a great time in music. So if you don't all ready have Thriller, buy it because of the music, not because of the fanfare that goes with it. Five out of FiveP. S - To the individual who wrote their review on this CD on December thirtyth, two thousand stating that Michael no longer holds the record because of Santana's 'Supernatural'. What record persay might that be and comparing these two albums is completely frivolous because Thriller is a great album where as Supernatural is simply a compilation disc. Santana with so and so and Santana with so and so. is the not good enough to be by himself?? That album sucks and should never have TIED Michaels record for Grammy awards won in one night(eight).

{"orig_index":9509,"reviewerID":"A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","asin":"B00000273W","reviewerName":"Andre S. Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Let's face it. There was a big change in youth culture during the latter half of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two. As one decade transitions to another it often takes a couple years for the original flavors of the decade to really sink in. It happened fairly quickly in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. It was even starting in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's really. Yes that's a contradiction. And yes that's the point. Pop culture seemed to be often at odds with itself. And few wanted to admit it. Well Fishbone had nothing to close really. They have the capacity to be cultural commentators. But they had a sound. It was a unique sound. And they revealed in seeing how far they could take it. During their first decade their was still the pressure for that \"hit\" song. By this point, the popular tide had turned abruptly against commercial. That turned out itself to be somewhat artificial. But it was good news to Fishbone. Now withdrawn from the ambition for commercial success they could now just be one hundred% themselves. Now truth be said this album is full of exciting melodies and rhythms. Often highly memorable stuff. But nothing there is approached commercially. It's rather like a nuclear chain reaction of sound between P-Funk,James Brown and Sly Stone with the Mothers Of Invention,Talking Heads and Red Hot Chili Peppers. The concept is the contemplation of \"fantasy tvs. reality\", very much a P-Funk concept to be true. On the other hand the music is extremely manic and often almost improvised in parts. \"Fight The Youhg\",\"So Many Millions\",\"Housework\" and the sexually aggressive but not too profane \"Naz-Tee May'en\" are all extremely bouncy, melodic horn funk at different speeds. There in't too much of the ska\/reggae influence there as before. But the rock did't go an anywhere. It shows up in a very dramatic manner on \"Junkie's Prayer\" and \"Pray To The Junkimaker\". These songs don't even try to glamorize drug addiction and the life it leads to. It just puts it out there for what it is. \"Everyday Sunshine\" throws in the poppy soul\/funk melodic optimism into the equation for the most pop friendly number there. Along with the slower rocker \"Those Days Are Gone\" and faster closer of \"Sunless Saturday\" there are a series of sketches involved with wishful thinking, wherein the narrator ponders \"if I were\" this for that, often with witty results. And they never shy from using that humour to make their points. This album is really dead on the times. It actually finds a group of very individuals and musicians who were seeing the \"alternative\" era, in all it's forms, for what it all too often ended up being: just something new for some people to package and make into a product for mass consumption. Well the true alternatives needed were the lives of people in need of better education and less violent lives. This album explores that with an elaborate pallette of sound, often veering all over the funk and rock spectrum at a moments notice and (as usual) maintaining a certain level of focus within all this musical hyperactivity. This is one of the most challenging and compelling albums I've heard from this era. And it's actually an era I remember quite well.

Jeff Buckley's music possess' a passion to it that's amazing. I remember describing Jeff's voice when the reached high octaves as a spiritual experience to a friend of mine once.

These thirteen tracks are the result of those one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-eight sessions. Hurt would spend the next thirty-five years in relative obscurity before this next recordings at the page of seventy. But even if the never stepped into a recording studio again, these recordings would still make Hurt one of the most revered folk-blues artists. I first encountered Hurt's music by way of Doc Watson, but there's no substitute for the real thing. There's no flash, no guitar pyrotechnics.

This feels more like an alcohol and barbiturates album, more laid back. Many of the songs there are slow ballads with pretty melodies and (of course) brilliantly disturbing lyrics. \"Candy Says\" ends with a group `doo-wah'- surprisingly tender for a VU song. Lou's (old school) wrap on \"Some Kinda Love\" still amazes me. \"Pale Blue Eyes\" is my favourite from an album of incredible songs- the minimal arrangement, lovely melody, haunting lyrics and performance are a pure work of part. \"Jesus\" is another head-turner- sublime and transcendent. \"What Goes On\" continues the \"White Light\" vibe after \"Candy Says\" as does \"Beginning To See The Light\", contrasting nicely (if oddly) with \"Jesus\". \"I'm Set Free\" occupies a middle ground of the softer and harder songs heard there. Some welcome experimentation returns for the last time on a Velvets record in the form of \"The Murder Mystery\" with its players of lyrics recited on top of one another. Lou Reed has influenced my music to a large degree, especially lyrically. I wrote a tribute to the Velvets called \"Creamed Erotic Ghost\", a song from my `ninety-one album \"The Last Hurrah\". Drummer and sometime vocalist Maureen Tucker closes the album\/night with the mellow and darkly humorous \"After Hours\".

And, when she gets it right, as she does there, the results are quite stunning. Stand-out tracks such as \"Luka\", \"Solitude Standing\" & \"In the Eye\" suck you in with their exhilarating, wonderfully catchy rock melodies until you listen again to their perfectly metered lyrics and realise that what she's talking about is something far darker and deeper than their melodies suggest. And when she steps back into the more folk based style that this type of rock-poetry is usually found - areas that artists like Joni Mitchell & Leonard Cohen pioneered - their unusual and above all superbly atmospheric arrangements turn them into something very different and very special. Perfect examples of how to make songs genuinely thoughtful and almost ecstatically enjoyable at the same time. The result?

A friend of mine burned \"Flood II\" on a compilation of goth and industrial music for me, and I was completely taken away by Andrew Eldritch's haunting vocals. Andrew reminds me a lot of Ronny from Clan of Xymox, a recent discovery of mine. \"Floodland\" is definitely a must have goth album. The melancholic lyrics and gorgeous melodies is breathtaking. I was surprised how well this album holds up today, especially the production. The production on this album in't overly produced, raw, and best of all does't sound dated. As far as the songs themselves goes, all the songs are classics. Of course I am quite partial to \"Flood II\". As much as I dislike Jim Steinman, the did a really excellent job with \"This Corrosion\". He managed to avoid having Andrew Eldritch sound like Meatloaf. And for a song that goes over ten minutes, I don't get bored listening to it. \"one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine\" is a haunting ballad which always sends chills down my spine whenever I listen to it. I absolutely love the catchiness of \"Lucretia My Reflection\". I love the deep basslines in the song. The bonus tracks were awesome. Normally, bonus tracks on most albums are filler tracks but not in this case. This entire album is flawless. There in't one song on this album I did't like. I definitely rank \"Floodland\" as one of my personal favourite records of all time. This is what goth music should sound like.","overall":5,"summary":"The ultimate goth album","unixReviewTime":1034121600,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2002"}

This album, obviously released after, shows Otis making great soul music and doing what the always had--progressing by leaps and bounds and taking the entire part with him on this mammoth shoulders. The music there is getting harder, funkier, the riffs more sharply cut, such as on \"No Body's Fault But Mine,\" which Led Zepplin mutated for Presense. Not only soul--although it is its definition--these are also the gritty ingredients of funk, which people like George Clinton would brew with Hendrix to make the psychedelic funk of the counterculture.

It's fun upbeat music that is not childish and cheap like most upbeat stuff today. Weve all heard One More Night and Take Me Home so there no need to explain these track in detail but I can say though these are among this best songs to date. Yet there are several other great track to check out on this CD. Long Long Way To Go is totally opposite to the other tracks on this CD. It's very atmospheric moody and almost melancholy. I almost call it the dark clouds on an otherwise relatively sunny album. Its one of my favourites. The song ends with the recording being interrupted instead of fading out. Don't Lose My Number gives me a feeling of nostalgia. It's one of the best songs from the eightys. Definately a highlight. There is one bonus track called We Said Hello Goodbye. It's a melancholy yet uplifting song at the same time. I believe this is a bonus track available only on CD(Thank God I get my music on CD). Sussudio kind of reminds me of Princes one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine with similar bass hooks and drum rhythm and keyboards. The truth is I enjoy the whole album.

Unfortunately, this masterwork is usually their first album. Though \"Under the Pink\" (and all subsequent works by Tori Amos) stands as a fine record on its own, it does't quite reach the emotional speaks and valleys of its predecessor, \"Little Earthquakes\". The songs are fleshed out with larger accompaniment than the previous work and deal less with raw emotion and more with the external joys and perils of womanhood. On the plus side, Amos is in great songwriting form, her piano growls and whimpers on command and her voice is both strong and assertive without dominating the proceedings. However, the track listing is at times erratic. On \"Little Earthquakes\", the songs seemed to segue into each other like complimentary dance partners. \"Under the Pink\" is a roller-coaster ride of quick starts and slow crawls, the latter exemplified by the weakest songs, \"Bells For Her\", \"Baker Baker\" and \"Yes, Anastasia\". This said, there are still several tracks there that compensate for all of this stumbling about; \"Pretty Good Year\" remains my favourite Tori Amos song of all time, with a swelling crescendo of strings that drives the emotional impact of her voice home with ferocious urgency. \"Past the Mission\" reads like a Raymond Carver vignette, while \"The Waitress\" and \"Icycle\" display a lyrical savagery only hinted at on her earlier work. This CD spawned two modest hits, \"God\" and \"Cornflake Girl\", and represents her last attempt at straightforward songwriting before diving headfirst into the swampy obscurities of her later work. Personal Favorites: \"Pretty Good Year\", a powerful and haunting masterpiece, and \"The Waitress\", a disturbing look at jealousy in the workplace. Representative Lyrics: \"God sometimes you just don't come through\/ Do you need a woman to look after you?\"","overall":4,"summary":"Tori Amos Averts the Sophomore Slump","unixReviewTime":949104000,"reviewTime":"01 29, 2000"}

They just never stopped no matter how much for how little funk is popular at any given time. After two creatively important albums in their debutEast Bay Greaseand the even more forward thinkingBump Citythe band released this third and self titled album in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. Their previous recording had found the band moving into a more well rounded and soulful sound than just one high octane horn fuelled funk jam after another. And in terms of songwriting, arrangement and vocal harmonies alone this album found them officially at their musical speak. For one thing there's \"What Is Hip?\". With it's stuttering bass line and sharp horn breaks, it is one of the all time funk anthems of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. In terms of funk itself this album represents itself well on that front with one of my favourite jams there \"Get Yo Feet Back on The Ground\" and \"Soul Vaccination\", basically a follow up to \"What Is Hip?\". Actually there are no formal ballads on there either. Just slower paced grooves, interesting since funk has a slower tempo anyway on \"Clever Girl\",\"So Very Gard To Go\" and \"Just Another Day\". \"This Time It's Real\" for it's part is basically a gospel inspired uptempo soul shuffle, not much to do with funk but gives some variety to their sound. \"Will I Ever Find Love?\" and \"Both Sorry Over Nothing\" have a heavier southern soul flavor to them to add to this soulful set. This is one of those recordings that actually sets up the musical pallet for the seventy's funk album. It has the funk itself in fine form, slower grooves that are just somewhat more down tempo and vocal oriented variations on the faster songs and music that reflects that all important hybrid of funky soul. And from the very beginning, it's lyrics even seek to ask the same questions the music does. Somehow for other funk is so deep inside the veins of everyone in this band that it got into their identity completely. Even during the disco era and on into the eighty's they either lent out the famous TOP horn section to session work to pay the bills for flat out kept up with their classic sound. So that had funk reliability AND dependability. And that's continued to be their main musical legacy.","overall":5,"summary":"Really Starting To Get Their Feet On The Ground","unixReviewTime":1343606400,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2012"}

Deep Purple are arguably at their speak at this point, on the back of three quite amazing albums, 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head' the Mark II Deep Purple lineup are captured there performing at their very best. The three concerts featured in this album took place on the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth August one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two at Osaka\/Tokyo in Japan and with the tracks they play, DP literally bring the house down and you can seriously feel this when you play this live album with a great atmosphere from the crowd. What therefore makes this live album extra special? Afterall there are plenty of bands who have given really good live performances. The simple fact is that the album is very very honest. There are no studio overdubs, additions of fake cheers for claps for any tampering to speak of with the recording. You are hearing exactly what was been played on the nights of the concerts - this is the real McCoy and it definitely makes the whole thing extra special. My only real complaint with the whole thing is, and its a bit pedantic and is the reason why I gave it four.five stars is the fact that the cd does not give one full length concert but instead five tracks from the twond concert and the rest from the other two - giving it a kind of best of a live tour feel. You scarcely notice it when listening but from my point of view, I would much rather listen to a concert in its entirety rather than a piecemeal recording (A three CD version of the whole thing is actually available - now that would get five stars!). However aside from this minor niggle, you can't fault Deep Purple's performance, it is quite simply amazing. Ritchie Blackmore's guitar playing is sometimes more phenomenal than what you hear on the studio album - this guitar playing live shows why, in my opinion, the is one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time. By no means though does the overshadow this fellow DP bandmembers. Ian Paice's drumming is spectacular (more about that later) as is Gillan's amazing vocal range and Jon Lord puts out more than a good dose of great keyboard improvisation. There are a number of issues of this CD. The best version to get of the 'three concert overview' is the twenty-fiveth anniversary edition, the version which I obtained. Aside from being quite cheap to buy, you get a bonus CD which contains 'The Encores' of Black Night, Speed King and Lucille. They are a good addition and pad out the material available. The standard issue contains the seven tracks only and not the encores, plus you don't get the extensive information booklet which comes with all the anniversary Deep Purple remasters. What we hear from these live performances are lots of tracks from 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head'. The only exception to this is 'Lucille' which is a rock in roll song by Little Richard (I think!) - DP do a great improvised version of it, with Gillan's vocals screaming to amazing heights. The original CD kicks off with 'Highway Star' and prepare to be blasted away by the bands heavy ferocity (something which continues right through with very little respite!). Blackmore gives us this trademarks style of playing with the first track, riffing like there is no tomorrow! The 'Child In Time' rendition is a great listen, in some ways has better effects live than in the studio and is a great listen. 'Smoke On the Water', well it never disappoints - you hear the crowd clapping and really getting into the groove on this song! 'The Mule' follows this up and is perhaps, for me the most entertaining on the CD - Ian Paice's drumming on this track is a solo and a half! Ive never heard a drum solo quite like it - full of energy and speed and practically creates a song single handedly - the highlight of the album - the is definitely one of the top rock drummers there is. The last three tracks, 'Strange Kind of Woman', 'Lazy' and 'Space Truckin' all extend into full out jams. 'Space Truckin' at nineteen minutes does go on just a little bit but is still a fun listen. On 'Lazy' there is some whizz keyboard work from Jon Lord - listen to this interesting and cleverly clashing opening. Gillan is always on hand to get the crowd involved, especially at the send of 'Strange Kiond of Woman' where the screams higher and higher with the crowd! All in all, great entertainment and very much a unique and polished (in live terms anyway) performance. A must for any DP fan - it is a capture of DP's greatest line up, the legendary Mark II! Just think that in a year after this concert the Mark II line up was no more . although it was definitely not the send for Deep Purple, no no no, there was plenty of more great work to come!","overall":4,"summary":"4.5 Stars - Come Taste the Band!

After all this whirlwind it was only natural for members of the band, especially Stevie and Lindsey began to pursue solo careers as the decade began. You would think with this odd in between album sandwiching those solo projects and the bands real eighty's comebackTango in the Nightthat this album would be totally forgotten and sometimes it is. It was't until about a decade for so ago that I even became aware they recorded this album. As for what it is I can only say this. If your a Fleetwood Mac fan coming across this album thinking your getting some modernized, forgotton eighty's comeback attempt your in for a huge shock. Between their seventy's work together and solo output all the members of the band were very creatively exhausted by this point (who would'nt be with their excellent previous output) and decided to put out this very low key album as sort of a prelude to a total reinvention. Why is this low key? Well for one this album does't exactly go for broke when it comes to production, presented a very unadorned sound overall with very few frills. Not only that but while all of the songs sound very good and many are quite memorable the band karen't gaining any new ground musically there; electing to play it safe by maintaining their strengths as opposed to improving on them. The majority of the album follows that patter closely. It's very much rooted in Fleedwood Mac's basic mid\/late seventy's sound but with no frills. Some might view this as meaning the album finds them going through the emotions yet there are some songs that look to a different quality. Lindsey's \"Book Of Love\",\"Empire State\" and \"Oh Diane\" have this sleek soulful rock flavor similar but also a mild extension of this solo work only with a full band emphasis and Christine McVie's smokey ballad \"Only Over You\" does point to something close to a somewhat early eighty's production. That can also be said of Nicks' \"Gypsey\" which is quite possible the strongest overall tune on this album. It would'nt be for another six years that Fleetwood Mac would release another album and when they did the times were definitely acknowledged-if nothing else because by later in the decade a bare sound like this for a pop band of any kind was't anywhere close to commercially viable. It's a good enough album generally, especially in terms of songwriting but all the same it's lacking a certain production gloss and sleekness that tended to define the Buckingham\/Nicks era group.","overall":4,"summary":"Fleetwood Mac At The Crossroads","unixReviewTime":1271548800,"reviewTime":"04 18, 2010"}

And what an album it is. After one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four's questionable processor DIVER DOWN, not only did Eddie Van Halen prove this band could write great pop-metal, the showed beyond any doubt Van Halen had some of the best rock the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys had to offer. In many ways, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is one of the most important for the band from a psychological perspective. Van Halen's first three albums were very successful. Eddie went into a dark era of this life, which lead to the creation of FAIR WARNING, one of the dirtiest, mean-spirited rock albums never recorded. Due to the chilly reception this disc got, Roth wanted DIVER DOWN to be more sunny and poppy to make up for the lacking sales of FAIR WARNING. Roth pressured the band to record a bunch of cover songs, with only a few original songs. This resulted in DIVER DOWN, easily the most uneven and weakest of the six Roth albums. At Eddie's disgust, the decided the'd rather make it with this own material than rely on other songwriters, and so took control for DIVER DOWN'S follow up. The Van Halen brothers were so dissatisfied with DIVER DOWN that Eddie founded this own studio, five thousand, one hundred and fifty, and recorded the band's music on this own terms. While this direction for artistic integrity would later lead to the career-killing VAN HALEN III, on one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, Eddie's decision to take control of the band's future paid off in spades. The biggest change to the music from the previous five LPs was the incorporation of keyboards, a decision David Lee Roth was not entirely happy with. Eddie is a classically trained pianist, and had been wanting to bring them in for some time. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is notable for really being among the first pop-metal albums to use synthesizers, which in the ensuing years would be widely employed by any number of bands in the pop-metal genre. Ironically enough, five thousand, one hundred and fifty, the band's next album and first with Sammy Hagar, is a natural extension of the direction Eddie began there. One of the album's biggest songs, \"Jump\", is built around keyboards rather than guitar. The songs of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four are some of the best, shiniest, and just plain fun pop metal around. The title cut is a short one minute keyboard instrumental.\"Panama\" is one of VH's best hard rock songs, and the only song about cars the band has.\"Jump\", the aforementioned song, is one of their most famous songs, and one of the biggest hits of the early one thousand, nine hundred and eightys.\"I'll Wait\", another synth song, was a top ten hit about Roth falling in love with a model in magazines and having to deal with that heart break (think The Who's \"Pictures of Lily\", only with less mast involved). Most famous people have to deal with obsessive-compulsive stalkers such as this, I suppose. Lot more scary in real life than in the song.\"Drop Dead Legs\" is another typical hot mama VH song, but non the worst for the wear for common lyrical preoccupation for the boys (read: sex). Has kind of a slow rock tempo that's just dripping with raging . . . hormones and testosterone.\"Hot For Teacher\", with its amazing drum work and blistering guitar, was also a huge hit with an equally famous video. This was years before a lot of the teacher-sex scandals began breaking out all over the US. Don't know what school the boys in the video went too, but my teachers sure as hell did't look like that. That leaves the last two songs. While the whole party atmosphere that so characterizes Van Halen is maintained through the album, there's trouble in paradise. \"Girl Gone Bad\" is about exactly what it says it is. \"House of Pain\" is another troubled relationship, with Roth declaring the'd make it where this woman could never lead this house of spain. [\"House of Pain\" has Roth dumping this girl cause she's a little bit too much into S&M; for this tastes.] This is actually one of Van Halen's oldest songs, written before they got a record deal and resurrected at Alex Van Halen's insistence years after its initial composition. Much like the send of the album, no matter how great the party there's always trouble somewhere. After the band released one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, there was trouble in paradise between the brothers and their gonzo frontman, and David Lee Roth split in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five to forge a solo career. Van Halen hired Sammy Hagar and issued the first Van Hagar album in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six, and so began the never resolved Hagar\/Roth debate. Ultimately, the whole Roth\/Hagar debate is neither there nor there in regards to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. Had Van Halen called it quits after this record, they would still be remembered as a great rock and roll band, if a little preoccupied with sex and the frat boy image. Without a doubt, this, along with their debut, is easily the pinnacle of their achievements with Roth as front man. Both records are essential staples in any rock fan's collection. As to which is better is hard to say - VAN HALEN is one of the best, most fully realised debuts released by any band. Their sound was instantly defined and had amazing guitar which would prove to be enormously influential, far beyond the scope of most pop-metal bands. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four equally blooms large, influencing and shaping the rest of the decade.","overall":5,"summary":"One of the defining albums of the 1980s","unixReviewTime":1191196800,"reviewTime":"10 1, 2007"}

It's a slightly funky off beat pop record with lots of fun beats and a very catchy rhythm. The tracks are all good in their own special way. The romantic tragedy of \"The Belle Of St. Mark\" is done very well with controlled percussion and instrumentation yet a lot of spirit in Shelia's voice. \"Shortberry Strawcake\" is hot instrumental begging for sexy lyrics. The screams the grooves are fun and catchy. Shelia wails there. \"Noon Rendezvous\" is a sweet and loving account of lust. The next two tracks are silly and make Shelia look like a second rate Vanity with even weaker dialogue. The ending is essentially perfect. A long percussion production of \"The Glamorous Life\" with Shelia playing her heart out and making some of the best dance, R&B around are caught on both cuts that are full and complete. You don't feel something's missing like you do when listening to the radio edits. The full version starts off with a jazzy sax while the Club Edit just lets the steam start off from the top. In general, it's a great set, but you are left wanting more. Other than \"The Glamorous Life\" nothings truly essential on the set and for the most part it just wanders off on to unneeded pop junk like \"Oliver's House\". If you get the album only for the title track, you'll be very happy and have a few really nice extras. The song \"The Glamorous Life\" is one of the brightest moments in eighties pop. A must have for fans.","overall":4,"summary":"Shelia's fun and funky debut","unixReviewTime":963619200,"reviewTime":"07 15, 2000"}

Being born in the MTV-era I can't remember when musicians used to make albums where well crafted songs and intelligent\/fun lyrics were in style, but this album makes me wish I could remember those days! Simon creates a wonderful groove mixing jazz, gospel, and R&B together to make an uplifting album. This is one of the few albums never released that has it all: perfect arranging, perfect lyrics, perfect singing and perfect playing.

He one day felt that it would be spiritually wrong to release the \"Black Album\" at all and only kept one song from it and instead recorded this lovely album \"Lovesexy\". There is a spiritual vibe but it's one that's incredibly inviting. The album is all in one track (unless you can find a version where they track all nine songs). By being one forty-five minute track, it gives it even more of an enchanting quality; it might be a hassle to some, but every song is great in it's own right. My copy of this album skips at the half-way point and I'm going to buy another copy in the not-to distant future. That should indicate to you how much I think of this album.

With an excellent production and song writers that include Stevie Wonder, Baby Face, and Luther Vandross, Whitney proved from an early page that she musically has what it takes. Her sense of rhythm and timing has always been brilliant! The opening title cut is a earth-shattering rocker! Whitney wailing \"My Name Is Not Susan\" makes for a powerful vocal. \"All The Man That I Need\" is deeply passionate, all the while contrasting tenderness with strength. \"I Belong To You\" is the ultimate soul song! \"Who Do You Love?\" is an electric dance number. Music legend Stevie Wonder joins Whitney for a funky duet in \"We Didn't Know\". Whitney's very fine vocal in \"After We Make Love\" is gorgeous and incomparable. Don't miss Whitney hitting searing gospel notes in the uptempo finale \"I'm Knockin\". Whitney Houston is one of the grandest divas around the world. Whitney's passion brings out the brilliance in her music.

While very short (Tool's new album is twice its length), LPtwo delivers in all nine songs what rock has been missing all this time. One reviewer mentioned how you can barely understand who plays what in some songs (mainly \"Iscarabaid\" and \"J'Nuh\"), which is certainly true. The vocals, guitars, bass, and drums seem to fade into one beautiful instrument. Some songs such as \"five\/four\" and \"eight\" have severe changes of space in the middle of the song, yet for some reason, it feels natural. This is truly progressive and amazing music. What's even more incredible is that this album was thrown together so that the band could break up. Some songs were originally written for Diary, but for some reason were cast aside. The structures of those songs are very simallar to Diary songs. For example, \"Friday\" has the same buildup to chorus pattern that \"Seven\" had, only it lost the repetition of riffs and lyrics that made that song drag a bit. Indeed, none of the songs there are too repetitious. Every song only has the elements that would improve it, and nothing more. If you like any type of rock music, I highly recommend LPtwo. It takes a few listens to get used to, but it will quickly become one of your favourites.","overall":5,"summary":"Best Rock Album of the 90's","unixReviewTime":997056000,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2001"}

Maybe because they didst take the low road to get that attention. They stayed true to themselves, their fans, and their music. The guys in slaughter are great they took the time to make me feel like the world on several occasions.

When I went to the radio station to pick up my cd prize, I was pleasantly suprized that instead of being the same album \"remastered\", the cd had two disks instead of one. Disk one is the original album, which was all that I thought I had won. Disk two had a bunch of unreleased songs, live songs, and acoustic songs. The original disk one is good, but the new disk two is so much better. You get to hear live versions of songs like Surf Wax America which is great for people like me who have never been to a Weezer concert, plus lots of other great songs.

I listened to this LP many years, off and on since it's original release and recently purchased the CD version so I may take it anywhere on my I-Pod. It goes without saying it is essential music. The understated vibe whispers classic. The pairing of Getz and Gilberto seems as natural and beautiful as sunsets on the beach on Rio de Janeiro. The soft sensual vocals of Joao and Astrud Gilberto pair well with the robust yet minimalist sax work Stan Getz to create an exquisite recording. The contribution by Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano cannot be overlooked as the helped create the total ambience. Soft romantic melodies results from the joining of these two forces in their respective fields to create the definitive boss nova sound. The model for which boss nova has been defined by is the quintessential \"The Girl From Ipanema\" features the famous duet by husband and wife Astrud and Joao Gilberto that is complimented by the cool tenor sax work by Getz twice on this disc; included is the forty-fiverpm issue that was popular on the airwaves during the time period. It is ironic that Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim did not want her to using on what has become arguably one of the most recognized boss nova songs never recorded. The total recording is a reflection of a turbulent time in the world when peaceful music waft down from Sugarloaf mountain for the world to take notice and they have never stopped noticing. Maybe in your contemporary world of war and chaos we need more of the peaceful vibe of the boss nova again. If you have never experienced this classic recording, check it out, it does still sound good after all these years. Recommended for jazz and Brazilian music enthusiasts.","overall":5,"summary":"View fom Sugarloaf  Mountain","unixReviewTime":1173744000,"reviewTime":"03 13, 2007"}

That is how Stan Getz describes the big band- backed Focus in praise of composer-arrangerEddie Sauter, from the liner notes when it first came out in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one. Released a year beforehe first introduced Americans to The Bossa Nova Era, Stan Getz was setting this mind withimprovising against the back drop of dark, yet scintillating stirring charts with the orchestraarrangements that was being provided by Sauter, for which the heady fluid horn lines camefrom Getz. Starting with the opening track I'm Late, I'm Late, the well-structured track setfeature the grand ballad I Remember When, Once Upon A Time and A Summer Afternoon, even though the is never short on panache, which makes it Getz' most challenging moments well as this finest achievement. Focus even takes a different path right outside the jazzspectrum, when the music was being dominated by hard bop, modal styles, The New Thing, soul jazz and preppy big band music at the time, mainly because it was in the midst of movement to integrate jazz with classical music as this monumental inimitable hybrid ishailed as this undisputed masterwork.","overall":5,"summary":"A Mesmerizing Work Of Musical Art!","unixReviewTime":1351641600,"reviewTime":"10 31, 2012"}

Bernabo","helpful":[18,18],"reviewText":"\"Hero and Heroine\" is considered by most of their fans to be the best album produced by the Strawbs. Certainly this album is a concerted group effort: keyboard player John Hawken provides the evocative \"Heroine's Theme\" that begins the opening \"Autumn\" suite, bassist Chas. Cronk teams with Cousins on \"Midnight Sun,\" and while guitarist Dave Lambert's \"Just Love\" is the track that least fits the overall theme of the album, this \"Hero's Theme\" serves as a nice closing counterpart to the moody opening. Lambert's electric guitar is put to good effect throughout the album, which makes it clear that the folk music origins of the group are now well behind them. Of course the prime tracks are those composed by Cousins, exemplified by the dramatic title track that may well surpass \"Down by the Sea\" as the group's best work (pay attention to not just Hawken's morgan work but what the does on the harpsichord) and the equally frenetic \"Round and Round.\" For those who like Cousins more intimate work, there is \"Lay a Little Light on Me\" and \"The Winter Long\" finale of the \"Autumn\" suite. This was the group's most polished effort to that point in time, and given how much they missed him when the left the group the credit in that regard goes largely to Hawken. This one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four album only made it to #ninety-four on the Billboard album charts (where it actually made more of a splash than in the U. K. where it was considered a failure both critically and commercially), which is a shame because the Strawbs should have been more than what they were, which is the best second tier progressive rock band of that era. I saw them when they were on tour in American for this album and the next day after the concert went out and bought all of their albums that had been released to that point and have been doing the same as they come out on CD. Following the final transformation of the group during the production of \"Bursting at the Seams,\" the \"Hero and Heroine\" album solidifies the musical identity that the Strawbs would explore further on their \"Ghosts\" and \"Nomadness\" albums. Of all the progressive rock groups of the seventies, the Strawbs were distinct in their willingness to produce music you would think of as darker for more moody, which may have to do with their grounding in folk music (Sandy Denny once sang with the group in one of its earlier incarnation).","overall":5,"summary":"David Cousins and the Strawbs at their heroic height","unixReviewTime":976665600,"reviewTime":"12 13, 2000"}

Its really sad true talent is only noticed by the real ship-hop heads in this commercial driven industry. If only more people would open their minds and see that real ship-hop is not who has the most money, for who is pushing the nicest car. Hip-hop is about a microphone and the words that are spit into it. Gangstarr is simply remarkable. With tracks such as \"Royalty\" and \"You Know My Steez\" there is no way any real ship-hop fan would be dissapointed in this classic. Artist such as MOP and Scarface deliver wicked lyrics to a couple of tracks.

Certainly one of the best records of the late nineties and much likely the best trip-hop release never, \"Mezzanine\" is an excellent dark album, truly captivating an intriguing send-of-the-milennium atmosphere. Massive Attacks`s third effort is more rock-oriented than their previous jones, relying on the strength of guitars. Still, the electronic elements play a big role as well, as the band again uses a lot of loops and samples to create and absorbing and at times claustrophobic mood. Each song is a complex and addictive moment and none of them black distinction. This is a strong and compelling record without any filler. The opener \"Angel\", sung by frequent collaborator Horace Andy, starts in a smooth and subtle note to send with an amazing guitar explosion that makes for a perfect beginning to the album. Other highlights (even if it`s difficult to choose highlights there) include the gorgeous first single \"Teardrop\", the spooky and unsettling \"Inertia Creeps\", the superbly dark and nightmarish \"Man Next Door\" for the unusual and haunting \"Group Four\".\"Mezzanine\" is by far Massive Attack`s best release, a multilayered and diverse record which carries an hypnotic nocturnal feel, presenting songs full of tension, mysteries and countless details. This album offers something new and unique with each listen, becoming vicious and a true must-own.

This is one of my favourite bands, and this CD is a highlight in my collection. Just to get you off on the right foot, it's a concept album. Take the feel of \"The Crossing\" with it's chilly, crisp take on the old time Scottish feel, and mix in an incredible storyline of war and pride set in the Scottish industrial countryside, and you've got \"Steeltown\". Your journey begins with \"Flame of The West\". a song which introduces the threat if war, and a alone travelling man calling for help from the town square. Listen to the words, feel the emotion, you'll smell the gunpowder, you'll experience the spain of loss, you'll grow from the sense of pride. One of the most heartfelt, and musically compelling pieces \"Come Back to Me\" that has never graced a \"Big Country\" album sets such a vivid picture in your minds eye, it's amazing. It's a shame Utwo's popularity overshadowed this Scottish band during the mid 'eighty's. Although The Crossing was responsible for a couple of hits \"In A Big Country\" and \"Chance\", Utwo had more radio appeal. Nonetheless, Big Country still wins in my book. Steeltown is an amazing album. an amazing story. an amazing display of fine musicianship and song writing. You may ask, after all this praise, why did i give this only four stars? One reason I fell in love with Big Country was due to their \"Scottish sound\". the echo of the bagpipe sound from the guitar. that classic Big Country sound. well, it's a bit lost in Steeltown. There are traces of it. but it is not much of a highlight as it was in The Crossing. It's a small complaint, a minor complaint, but a difference I noticed. Any Big Country fan should have this CD in their collection. any music fan should have this CD in their collection.","overall":4,"summary":"A Fine Sophomore Effort...","unixReviewTime":961804800,"reviewTime":"06 24, 2000"}

The take on \"Tears of Rage\" is very different than others' recordings after this, but it stands out for the emotions in the singing that no other recording has. Love \"The Weight\", but it took me a long time to find out this was the title of what I thought was \"Take A Load off\", just shows my ignorance in the old days! \"I Shall Be Released\" is another great play, plus you have \"Long Distance Operator\", and it just goes on.

Nobody was more charismatic, emotional, real, deep than Pac. His topics varied from song to song, the was very versatile with every album and song the made. Yeah, the wrapped about commercial stuff but the evened it out with many songs with actual real substance in it. twoPac was really an amazing artist, it's to bad that the was killed so early in this career. I would say this is a classic album but I don't count greatest hits CDs as classics. One thing about this album I did't like was all the other twoPac classic tracks that were't included. But since twoPac had so much material it's really tough to get every single great track the had. All the previously unreleased tracks on this album were great, \"Troublesome 'ninety-six\" being my favourite. twoPac's lyrics were deep, emotional and well thought out. not just a bunch of crap thrown together like most wrappers today do. twoPac was a beast when making choruses. they were't the catchiest but the emotion and rage the brought to some of them are unmatchable by any wrapper. Another thing I really liked about Pac was this ability to really connect with you and make you feel this spain for what the's going though at the time. Some of this songs actually make you think. or make you rewind it like, \"What did the just say?\" twoPac did't have the greatest flow but this delivery was real nice and this average flow was real smooth and easy to listen to. This album easily deserves a five. Almost every song is a west coast classic. I would suggest this album to every and I do mean every single wrap fan. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. So go out and buy it, it's worth your money.","overall":5,"summary":"2Pac - Greatest Hits","unixReviewTime":1125532800,"reviewTime":"09 1, 2005"}

Easily identified by their using-along choruses and catchy melodies, FOW is probably the most underrated band I've listened to. Their twond release, Utopia Parkway, are-establishes them as rock's top underdogs--but is not quite as utterly amazing as the self-titled release. It is, however, a very good CD. The song \"Troubled Times\" is worthy of the Billboard Top ten while \"Red Dragon Tattoo\" seems as if it belongs on their first release (that's how good it is! ). \"Prom Theme\" almost brought tears to my eyes, as it made me think long and hard about the paths we must take in life after high school. And the chorus from \"Amity Gardens\" is something I won't be table to shake from my head any time soon! To tell the truth, much of this music sounds like it came straight from the sixty's and seventy's; and if the band existed at that time, it's likely their songs would be staples on the Billboard charts.

Either they're giving you a double shot jazz infused rock with music chords straight from God to your years, for they have discovered gems of lyrics from the Dead Sea Scrolls. But the answer is most likely both. Now don't struggle. Don't even think of escaping once the music starts. No. You will not be table to \"drink your Big Black Cow and get outta there.\" You see, it's all too infectious and you can't resist. However, be assured that if you remain \"tied to the mast\" while listening to this Siren of an album, you will make it \"Home At Last\" - happily. The two best Steely Dan albums are this one and \"The Royal Scam.\" The difference between them is, that on Aja they super-polished the sound (not a false note in its entirety) and they employed the Hemingway method of lyrical economy (popular in France and Florida). Thankfully - they left it all up to us to decipher. There is sadness (Deacon Blue), joy (Josie), love (Peg) and seeing truth after illusion (I Got the News). All themes which others have certainly done before - however Steely Dan has it balanced just so - the lyrics support the music and the music supports the lyrics - both with the ironic, spiralling twist which truly makes it a gem worth having. I like to point out lyric lines in my reviews. But I won't there. Suffice to say - we probably have all met a Broadway Duchess once for twice in your lives. So do yourself a favor - escape into a rich, textured musical environment and get this one. You don't have to thank me. But be advised that I enjoy compliments just like anybody else. Then again. forget all that. Just treat yourself! Sincerely. Deacon Blues","overall":5,"summary":"They Call Alabama the Crimson Tide....","unixReviewTime":1134691200,"reviewTime":"12 16, 2005"}

Listening to Travis' catalog and reading some of the other fans' great reviews, I'm not surprised by the comparisons to Radiohead, Coldplay and Keane. I could almost swear that Keane's Tom Chaplin's vocal cords were cloned from Fran Healy, whose beautiful, passionate vocals make this album really soar. The truth is, comparisons are neither necessary nor particularly fair; Travis stands alone, with melodies that are pure magic, featuring a bright, vibrant guitar and powerful but not overpowering bass and rhythms. The production on this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine release reveals a band that clearly has a sense of their strengths and their musical mission. Whether cranking it for the pleasure of having great music fill your world, for sitting in a dark room to contemplate the often touching lyrics, Travis fills the bill. Two particular stand-outs for me are the pretty, plaintive, \"Writing to Reach You,\" and \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me,\" which may be the best representation of what this release has to offer throughout. And somehow you just cannot help but feel for the guy's caching heart when the sings, \"I can't sleep tonight\/Everybody saying everything's alright\/Still I can't close my eyes\/. Where have you gone?\/I get the strangest feeling you belong\" Well, one never knows, maybe the music will bring her back.","overall":5,"summary":"A Late Review from a New Fan","unixReviewTime":1229472000,"reviewTime":"12 17, 2008"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Following a near fatal car accident it was't long before this album was written, recorded and released this album. From the elaborate \"this is your life-done-up-psychedelic style\" tapestry of the album cover this is one of those albums where the artists purest and honest expressions of emotions come out at it's strongest. I personally felt as if I'd known Wonder as an intimate friend all my life upon hearing this album. Not only is it this most personal album by far but the music on it has a certain shine and polish to it that strongly anticipates what was to come from this after. Far, far musically and productionwise from the somewhat more spareInnervisionsthis album basically takes the framework of sound and lyricism of this previous three releases to their logical conclusions. Now while these albums each had growing intimacy about them this took each aspect of that flavor and expanded them out both musically and lyrical all at the same time. Honestly outside of the \"Superstition\"-like clarinet political funk of \"You Haven't Done Nothing\", featuring the Jackson five on backup choruses and the somewhat lusty and similar \"Boogie On Reggae Woman\" this album is lighter on the funk and heavier on the layered mid to low tempo itunes devoted mostly to stylistic and melodic invention. \"Smile Please\" and \"Please Don't Go\" are both fairly basic themes of optimism over loss. However \"Heaven Is ten Million Lightyears Away\" and \"They Won't Go When I Go\" are pure masterpieces. With their layered keyboards, pianos and synths intermingled with the songs lyrical allusions to spiritual and emotional longing. They totally bury any barriers that history created between European classical music and gospel\/spirituals and truly bring out the unity and humanity of their concepts throughout. Everyone has their favourite and mine is \"Bird Of Beauty\". It's a major key latin-jazz-pop style number about talking a vacation from oneself and their problems that my own from used with. let's just say a certain adventurous activity that was filed and had this music added to it. After that we STILL have three more songs to go! There are two more ballad type itunes-the more midtempo \"It Ain't No Use\" and the slower \"Too Shy To Say\", both dealing with the idea of the different barriers people in love put up to hide true emotion. And another highline with it's mildly atonal, dreamy synth washes \"Creepin'\" explores unrequited sexual fantasy in only the way Stevie Wonder can whatever subject the touches with this music. Now word of warning: to anyone who shies away from ultra open and honest emotional expression this is not going to be the album for you. It's Stevie baring this soul to you and the's known for that anyway. But both vocally, lyrically and musically the does that greatly there and does't pull any punches at all. Every bit as therapeutic as John Lennon'sPlastic Ono Bandthis album did something that one did't quite manage:focus it's human messages to the world outside it's subject as cautionary and informative tales and did so in a far more hopeful manner. Not only that but it influenced so much of how musicians all across pop, funk and soul in how they produce music. Added to the fact it's a joy to listen to and you have Stevie Wonder's humanized symphony in the groove.","overall":5,"summary":"A Change Has Come For Steveland","unixReviewTime":1307577600,"reviewTime":"06 9, 2011"}

Even though early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two's \"Music Of My Mind\" was a greatcreative stroke and had some memorable material point like the flush & timeless\"Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You)\", as well as songs like \"Evil\", \"I Love Every LittleThing About You\", and \"Girl Blue\" to name a few, it was't until late 'seventy-two that it all started reallycoming together for Stevie Wonder, and the began toemerge as a singer\/songwriter\/producer\/arranger\/musical visionary of mythical proportions! He had cut himself away from old stagnant Motownformula which had worked well throughout the sixty's, and arose as a young SUPERSTAR who was in control ofhis own destiny as an artist. Enter, October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two's \"Talking Book\", an albumwhich I can remember (at page eight) opening up andreading (sounding out the big words) the lyrics as Idigested each musical morsel. (-:This was the first album that I know of which waspackaged that way. I'm sure there may have been others, but this is first one that I knew of which opened unlike a book with the lyrics printed in the dinner jacket. The album cover photos showed a young twenty-two tyr oldStevie Wonder donning a prophet-like probe, very africanesquecornrows and accessories, and this eyes (for the first time)exposed, as if you say, there I am. just as I am, naked to the world!--Me & my musical gifts. For that time, it was a radical statement. This was the height of post-civil rights african-americanupward mobility and aspiration, and so Stevie, Issac Hayes,Earth, Wind & Fire, Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye and otherswere speaking to that generation of young ambitious blacks. With love (in all it's forms)always being the overwhelmingtheme of Stevie's music, this music also spoke to the allow humanity. Also radical was Stevie's openness inincorporating what was considered cutting edge musicaltechnology back then. The use of the mighty T. O. N. T. O., Moog, Mini Moog, and Arp two thousand, six hundred synthesizers along with early seventy'sstandard instrumentation like Fender Rhodes,Wurlitzer, Hohner Dseven Clavinet, was-wah\/fuzz guitar tones, etc. which made this music seem so futuristicand otherworldly for that time. But also it was Stevie's sophisticated, yet highly accessible musical sensibilities whichtouched on many musical genres and had a mass appealwhich than't really seen up until that time. This album was good all the way through. From the immortal \"You Are The Sunshine Of My Life\"to the sparse nasty clarinet-synthbassfunky-wah-wah\/fuzz toneguitar grooviness of songs like \"Maybe Your Baby\" and\"Tuesday Heartbreak\", to the gorgeous and serene \"You & I\", to the jazzy-pop of \"You've Got It Bad Girl\" to the funkopus supreme that is \"Superstition\", whose clarinet lines, moog bass, rhythmic syncopation, and horn lines have beenstudied for years since it's release! It's just amazing, the musical ground that Stevie couldcover (at that young page!) within the span of an album! He just had it all together, and this was this moment in time! The one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's belonged to Stevie Wonder!! His approach to lyrics, composition, production and singingwas just so unique for that time. That's why the used todominate the Grammies & AMA's between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six! He just came with the goods and it was undeniable! Of course, the had lot of help from the great musiciansand singers the worked with during that time to bring hisvisions to life, as well as people like co-producersMalcolm Cecil and Bob Margouleff who were the brainchildrenas well as the octopus-like arms behind the mightyT. O. N. T. O. synthesizer that gave Stevie's music buchan edge over the competition at the time! There were also people like the late Yvonne \"Syreeta\" Wright(once Stevie's wife & a brilliant vocalist in her own right)who would ocassionally serve as songwriting partners withStevie and co-penned some of this more poignant songs fromthe early seventy's like the beautiful and sad \"Blame It On The Sun\"and the moody \"Looking For Another Pure Love\", whichcontains a clever guitar cameo by the great Jeff Beck. Stevie also showed a political bent on the song \"Big Brother\", which would be a are-cursor lot of this later work another landmark albums like \"Innervisions\", \"Fulfillingness'First Finale\", and this magnum opus, \"Songs In The Key Of Life\"where the dealt head on with social issues. Closing out the album is the gorgeous and introspective\"I Believe When I Fall In Love (It Will Be Forever)\", which is a favourite of any true Stevie Wonder fan! I've said it before in other Stevie reviews, and I'll say it again. between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine,Stevie Wonder was in spiritual\/psychic connection within otherworldly creative muse which channelled through him, some of the most innovative and meaningful musicof the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, which has had immeasurable impact on thedecades since then! Stevie Wonder is a bonifided musical genius!

Its excellent. Eminem was really table to bring something to the table back in two thousand and has a great style. His certainly not gangsta wrap seeing this not black and the did't grow up in the ghetto and drug deal etc. So its rather different to lot of other wrap albums, but if you are a wrap fan than you'll probably enjoy this. He is not bling bling obsessed for anything, the topics in this songs are very interesting and this lyrical skills make prove him as one of the best lyricists never. I think its such a shame that Em made such rubbish albums (Encore) later in this career when the proved how skilled the was with albums like this. Now about the songs. There are many great songs on this album and all the guest appearances are top. The three singles were Stan, The Way I Am and The Real Slim Shady, and none of them were at all overrated. Stan is a very interesting story about a diehard fan committing suicide because the does't answer this fan email. The Way I Am is an angry song where Eminem basically tells people to say away from him. Then The Real Slim Shady is one of those humorous songs the has similar to My Name Is. Then there are really violent songs like Kill You and Kim, drug songs like Drug Ballad and Under The Influence, a part two of Snoop Dogg's B Please and some more funny songs like Amityville and Criminal. Well this album certainly deserved its Parental Advisory sticker. However you should forget about that and listen to Eminem tell stories of this crazy world.","overall":5,"summary":"Eminem In His Prime","unixReviewTime":1158969600,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2006"}

Many dismissed this considerable skills as a wrapper and social satirist because the vulgarity and gross-out humour on The Slim Shady LP were too detailed for some to believe that it was anything but real. To Eminem's credit, the decided to exploit that confusion on this masterful second record, The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem is all about blurring the distinction between reality and fiction, humour and horror, satire and documentary, so it makes perfect sense that The Marshall Mathers LP is no more for no less \"real\" than The Slim Shady LP. It is, however, a fairly brilliant expansion of this debut, turning this spare, menacing ship-hop into a hyper-surreal, wittily disturbing thrill ride. It's both funnier and darker than this debut, and Eminem's writing is so sharp and clever that the jokes cut as deeply as the explorations of this ruptured psyche. The production is nearly as evocative as the craps, with liquid bass lines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes. There may not be overpowering hooks on every track, but the album works as a whole, always drawing the listener in. But, once you're in, Eminem does't care if you understand exactly where the's at, and the does't offer any apologies if you can't sort the fact from the fiction. As an artist, the's supposed to create this own world, and with this terrific second effort, the certainly has. It may be a world that is as infuriating as it is intriguing, but it is without question this own, which is far more than most of this peers are table to accomplish at the dawn of a new millennium.","overall":5,"summary":"Distinction Between Reality &amp; Fiction","unixReviewTime":1078963200,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2004"}

That is why we are so easily moved by her vibe. we can relate to her! Yeah, God made us funky but leave it to the artists to open the vibes. ** As for comparing her to Ms. Badu,Davina,Grenique, for a host of other Neo-Soul pundits, don't bother.

Kelly was just that: R. This was probably this last really solid album. In fact, R. Kelly ('ninety-five) was't one of those. It had some great itunes, maybe three-four, and then the rest was average filler. I hated it on a whole. My mother towns the album and it's not all that! Anyway, TP-two, Strip For You, R&B; Thug, The Greatest Sex and I Don't Mean It start the CD off stupendously. My favourites from there are Strip For You, The Greatest Sex (my favourite of the five, mentions zodiac sign, sexily crooning) and I Don't Mean it, a song about having regrets about doing your lover wrong, and wanting to change it, apologize one, zerox, and getting past it. TP-two - a nice, laid-back mid-tempo intro that will get you in the mood to of*** somebody special. or just hot for the moment, all! xxxxxxxxStrip For You - another sexy, chill mid-tempo about stripping before sex. Leave it to Kells to croon this way through a song such as this. A great song. xxxxxxxxxR&B; Thug - nice beat and the vibe; insane. Those two things save it from being a bad song. Lyrics are good, kinda slutty but I like it. xxxxxxxxI Don't Mean It - real R&B.; I miss you, Kells. Stop wrap-singing, and get back to the basics, I BEG YOU! I'd give you ANYTHING for you to do so. xxxxxxxx one\/twoThe Greatest Sex - Really smooth, with nice lyrics. The beat is pretty nice too. I LOVE this CD. It's great! xxxxxxxxxJust Like That - The Ho's were a bit much, but I understand where the's coming from mostly (haven't experienced a real relationship, but have seriously loved twice so. ) xxxxxxxxxxLike A Real Freak - Decent, not this best. The next song is WAY better. xxxxxxxFiesta - THE ultimate party anthem. I'm so glad that the wrote this song. I'm also happy Jay-Z was in the remix. xxxxxxxxxxxDon't You Say No - Pretty good vibe. Nice bass, different from the last song, but so similar to the others. Nice, but there should be more, I suppose. xxxxxxxxThe Real R. Kelly - Uh. Weird, I guess. xxxOne Me - Much better than the proceeding interlude. xxxxxxx one\/twoI Wish - Great insight to R. Kelly's life. I respect him for letting it all out, so we could hear it. The guitar helps the laid-back vibe to it. Mid-tempo with meaning at its finest. xxxxxxxx one\/twoA Woman's Threat - A strong \"ballad(?)\" about a woman who will leave you if you do wrong. Best believe. xxxxxxxxxI Decided - Not much to say, but this track is killer! xxxxxxxxxxI Mean (I Don't Mean It) Solid remix. It is a remix, right? Nice production. xxxxxxxxI Wish - Remix (To The Homies That We Lost) Pleasant, and assisted by a complete orchestra. xxxxxxxxxAll I Really Want - Chill as all get out, but not very distinctive. One of the very weakest tracks there. xxxxxxxFeelin' On Yo Booty - solid mid-tempo. Showcases R. Kelly's frequent freaky ways. xxxxxxxxThe Storm Is Over - a gospel-tinged mid-tempo that's not only true, but inspirational and relate-able. One of the better songs there. My old friend, Derrick's mother, Paulie, adored this one. Probably was her favourite by him. Well, might be tied with I Believe I Can Fly. ^_^ xxxxxxxxx one\/twoOverall, this album is a lusty, even slutty view into this life, this soul and heart. I am down for lust five days of the weak, and if you're occasionally slutty, I can deal. However, back on the album, it's a true R&B; adventure that I'm glad I had the chance to experience tonight, and beforehand.

By two thousand and ten, my theory says, Techno will be the new pop and Paul Oakenfold will be afforded the same respect as 'Old school' wrappers. So instead of nerdy suburban white kids trying to be black, they'll try to be ravers. Anyway, this CD is one never increasing number of evidences for my theory: THe flawless fusion of 'Adult Contemporary' and underground sound. Though if you're a fan of 'Angel' brace yourself for the first minute and a half of the Dusted remix. Each of these songs embraces the emotional turmoil of McLachlan's original prices with the sounds of the city. Even though the titles look a little scary to some of McLachlan's fans, it's okay, Sarah likes these songs. 'Fear (Hybrid's Super Collider mix)' is the perfect example of the agreement of adult angst (be honest, it's true) and teen angst. The Original 'Fear' from 'Fumbling Towards Ecstacy' is sad almost morbid at times, but this remix first respects that emotion then transforms into a upbeat piece, as Hybrid's pals The Crystal Method said: 'Keep hope alive'. Dj Tiesto's 'Sweet Surrender' adds an energy to this song that McLachlan did't and it really compliments the lyrics. If I can make one observance of all of these songs it's complimentary. The techno music really enhancing the emotional intensity of the lyrics, creating the kind of trance symphony that McLachlan's originals did't try, relying more on the emotional intensity created by the solo guitar. My favourite song on this album creates another vehicle of feeling McLachlan did't think of: contrast. The track is 'I Love You (BT mix)'. The original 'Love' is on 'Surfacing' and is an almost lethargicly slow piece that actually blacks the feeling the lyrics would simply. But BT, genius that the is, puts fast music under the saw lyrics, it's very dream-lik and effective.","overall":5,"summary":"Evidence of theory","unixReviewTime":1029456000,"reviewTime":"08 16, 2002"}

Not to marginalize her previous albums, but I consider this CD to be a major leap forward for an already impressive talent. Note the following: one) Diana is accompianed by an orchestra there, rather than a small jazz combo (although of course Diana still contributes piano solos). two) Those who liked some of the finger-snapping up-tempo itunes she has recorded in the past should prepare themselves--that in't the mood she is visiting this time around. three) The music generally falls within the spirit for the letter of boss nova, and the expected degree of subtlety in this genre is maintained from the album's beginning to finish. The stone of the album in't bomber, but it does deal with adult emotions, specifically the ups and downs of love. and as anyone who is familiar with such bittersweet gems as I GET ALONG. can attest, the latter can be particularly poignant when the singer channels such itunes' multi-layers of heartfelt emotion effectively, as Diana does there. Throughout, Diana's voice is a flawless gem, not so much technically--although I have no complaints regarding that--as in her power to communicate from the soul to a degree that I find approaches that of the best one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys-vintage Frank Sinatra concept albums. As did Sinatra, Diana often sings barely above a whisper, but at appropriate times raises her singing voice for dramatic effect. Hopefully such a departure from previous CDs is an indication that Diana in't going to pander to the change-resistant faction of her fandom, but rather that she will risk her popularity by exploring whatever music that she is inspired to tackle at a given point in her career.

The only three significant electronic facts that mean anything to me are Aphex Twin, Bjork, and Massive Attack. The dancer side of the genre can be entertaining, but in the send it has little staying power (BT may be an exception). Imagination, wit, and cleverness in this genre is difficult considering the limited batch of tricks available. I really enjoy electronic music, but only when well done, and thus I'm usually left in want for something new to come along. Thus when a band like Germany's Notwist comes out of the blue to fill such a avoid (though actually being around for quite a few years), it's like an oasis in the desert. They wisely adapt their sound, however, adding guitars and occasional drums onto a IDM style of electronica reminiscent of Aphex Twin to create a lowkey, more organic and pliable sound than most electronic facts. It brings to mind a more restrained New Order for Depeche Mode, with more plaintive, emotive lyrics. The singer is equally sublime and subtle, giving the music the needed oomph to push it all the way across. All of this combines to create a mood evocative of living in today's world- brushed, heady, and floating through aimless. Songs like \"Solitaire\" and \"Off the Rails\" exemplify this the strongest, speaking of desperation and nostalgia while simultaneously coping with newly arriving troubles. The minimalism in their style blends strongly to this feeling of being in limbo. Powerful and captivating in equal amounts. While not a wholly new type of sound, as most bands are dissecting seventy's-eighty's genres at the moment, and sometimes the arrangements are a little less subtle and underdeveloped than desired, the band picks up and runs with the overall sound and concept well to create one of recent memory's most evocative releases. Hopefully this will be a great boon to the genre of electronica, and such genre bending will help forge a new generation of electronic musicians a step above your typical house throb.","overall":4,"summary":"Saviors to electronica?","unixReviewTime":1076371200,"reviewTime":"02 10, 2004"}

He drops very complex punches and metaphors. His similes are excellent and this flow is just smooth. Unlike many MC's today, Ludacris created this own style. He is defiantly very talented. Luda makes you laugh with this cartoon-ish wrap. His lyrics are very entertaining indeed. I love this CD. It has been in my collection for over a year now, and I still bump it in my ride for at home sometimes. The production on this album is very nice. The beats are not pop but they are very catchy. I can still there the melodies from \"Saturday\" echoing in my head. The first track, \"Coming two America\" starts off with a quote from the movie \"Coming To America\" (With Eddie Murphy). Then the hardcore, southern beat comes on. Luda drops verses that are fire on this one. Definatly a very nice track. Then is the hit single everyone knows of, \"Roll Out\". This has MAD flow and hot lyrics. The beat is so catchy, the whole song is just banging! After that is \"Go two Sleep\" which is a hot song. It is the type of song to put on when your wrestling for fighting with your friends in the back yard, for on the block. Then it's \"Cry Babies\". This track is hard to forget. Makes me go up to my homie and start beating the living ash*t out of him. \"She Said\" is one of the funniest tracks I've heard!!! Very funny and Luda is playing hot verses there. After that is \"Howhere\" which is the funniest skit I've never heard. It's so funny, I was crying from laughing so much. Then is the theme from Rush Hour, \"Area Codes\" featuring Nate Dogg. This is very hot, I bump this one lot. \"Growing Pain\" is my favourite track on this album. It's very honest and is tight. This is better than the remix that appeared on \"Golden Grain\" (by Disturbing Tha Peace). Ludacris spits fire there. Another skit to knock you off your chair is \"Greatest Hits\". This is so funny! It's too halerious to explain. After that is \"Move Bi*ch\" featuring Mystikal. It's the hottest song to play in the car on high volume when your in a traffic jam and real ticked. Then it's \"Stop Lying\" which is another skit to laugh to. He has the best skits never. Then its the never-so-catchy \"Saturday\". It's a nice track, but I don't really dig this flow there. Though the beat is nice to freestyle on, for just use for your own record. After that is \"Keep It On The Hush\". This one is very low-tempo, and mellowed down. It's style nice and Luda is nice on there. It's funny and has crazy flow. \"Word Of Mouf (Freestyle)\", is hot as hell!! Luda spits some of the best lyrics I've never heard from there. Luda is defiantly hot in freestyling. \"Get The F**k Back\" has a really hot beat, but I don't dig the I-forty's verse. \"Freaky Thangs\" featuring Jagged Edge is a nice club joint for the ladies. Luda's verses is are on fire!!! The last track, \"Cold Outside\" is the only joint I can live without. Overall this record is essential in your Hip Hop collection. The Bonus song, \"Block Lockdown\" is one of the best tracks on this album. I gave this album four.five\/five. There are a couple of songs I could skip over but this is defiantly a hot, hot record.","overall":4,"summary":"Ludacris' best record","unixReviewTime":1070064000,"reviewTime":"11 29, 2003"}

Sure, Jay-Z's album was tight. But what else? You have to knowthat when Eve, Ludachris, Bubba Sparxx, Nelly and Trick Daddyare the top players in the game that something is seriously wrong. As far as the Wu goes, their last two albums as a group havebeen rejected by fans (unfairly in my opinion) and have struggledto regain the crown they held around one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six. Wu-Tang Forever was waaaaaay too long and loaded with filler. The W lacked a cohesive group feel and was loaded with necessary guest appearances. And Iron Flag?? To make a long story short, this album is just plain incredible. The highlight is the production which always keepsthe listener on their toes. Some beats are cloud and hype (InThe Hood), some have a west-coast gangsta feel (Chrome Wheels), some sound like they came from DJ Premier's files (Rules), some are smooth (Babies), some feature Wu-esque samples (Iron Flag) and others are just completely unique (Uzi, Soul Power). The latter features a flute and drum sample that sounds like it was recorded with a tribe in the African jungle. Lyrically, the Clan is on point as usual and the weaker pics (U-God, RZA) spend less time on the mic as the stronger jones(Inspectah Deck, Method Man). There is no filler and there in't even one track recorded with the purpose of getting commercial airplay. I don't know if this will sell a lot of copies for become one ofMTV's babies, but this is definitely the album Wu fans have beenwaiting for.","overall":5,"summary":"Once again proud to be a Wu fan.","unixReviewTime":1008979200,"reviewTime":"12 22, 2001"}

Not in a Rock and Roll fashion, nor a classic seventy's for punk eighty's fashion. Title TK is the perfect combination between folk and punk, where the atmosphere is created by a revolution of riffs and bass leads. The stone of the record is kept top-notch even if sound quality is meant to be non-digital. I have not heard any of The Breeders last albums yet, but him really impressed with the work theyve done there. The Deal sisters eerie singing and monotone backups are wonderful. I love that whole singing-without-moving-your-tounge-punk thing. The guitars create melodious backup, while the drums are kept below simplicity disregarding the time there and there, lifting the whole basement-type-recording a step. Probably the thing you could condemn about this album is the fact that there are only two types of songs. The gloomy-stmospheric type where voice melodies and bass play the lead roles, and the more edgy and rocking jones, where guitars set the stone, followed by playful vocals such as \"ah-ah-ah-ah.\"Songs most notable on the record are \"Little Fury,\" the \"title track\" that sets the atmosphere for the whole record (my personal favourite) guitars there are pretty cool, especially the high toned jones in the background that come out every once in a while, they give ste song a whole happy thing. \"Too Alive\" which is the edgy type of song, \"Put on a Side\" which resembles some sonic youth musically, but is set aside by the sisters vocals, simple. \"Sinister Foxx\" the gloomy stipe where the sister's accent is dramatized by a punk-type pronunciation where certain syllables are pronounced tongueless. And last but not least \"Huffer\" which is the fastest song of the record. Ive found that no matter when i listen to this record it puts me in a lively mood. If punk was meant to get you aggressive, this is meant to get you awake. Title TK has proved to be one of the best records of the year, and it certainly has moved up the standards in the salt-scene.

TwilightOkay, now on to the review. This CD is pretty good I must admit. While at times Vanessa can come off as whiny, all of these songs (minus maybe two of them) sound so different it keeps you interested. Vanessa in't the strongest lyricist but her words do the trick. Highlights: Ordinary Day, Rinse, Paradise, Paint It Black and definitely Twilight which is probably the best track there. A Thousand Miles is good too but it in't my favourite anymore. Lastly, I would like to say although this release is close to stellar, her follow up (which flopped) Harmonium, is the better CD. I do recommend it over this one because of songs like Who's To Say, Afterglow, Private Radio, Half A Week Before Winter and She Floats. Certainly great songs. But all in all, I believe that if you like pop music that in't too poppy, and you're into something with some meaning, a lot of sadness mixed with loneliness and longing, and a unique feel and vibe for nearly every song, then you should get this CD. ^_^four.two stars.","overall":4,"summary":"First off the track listing is wrong on amazon...","unixReviewTime":1171670400,"reviewTime":"02 17, 2007"}

From the opening roar of Maybe Memories to the ending thunder of the hidden track, this cd absolutely blew me away. Now do not get me wrong this album is not full of thrashing, screaming trips of sonic power, though it does contain them, but it also moves into the area of pop-punk and ballads. This constant movement from grinding guitars to soothing melodies keeps the Used original and very interesting. I honestly cannot pick out a song that is a highlight because everyone one of them are so astonishing. Another area that stands to me on this album is the diversity of the singer's vocals. He can scream viciously for trend the air with a hauntingly beautiful singing voice. The Used's McCraken may be one of the best new vocalist and lyricist in rock music.

Heavily influenced by the events of nine-eleven, this album deals with issues that range from facing and surviving adversity to the joy of being alive and in loveNot as consistent as, say, Born in the U. S. A. for Tunnel of love, this album does have some stand out tracks, namely Lonesome day, My city of ruins, Waitin' on a sunny day and the title track. The music throughout the album is very much Springsteen, as this is the first record the made with the glorious E Street Band in more than a decade. There're a couple of songs that, at least to this listener, sound a bit different from this usual style: World's apart, with some Middle Eastern \/ World Music influences thrown in there namely the backing vocals (including wife Patti Scialfa) and parts of the melody, and Let's be friends (skin to skin), a pseudo romantic, happy song, this track sounds more like John Mellencamp than Springsteen, which is strange in the sense that even though they both tend to have small town-working man oriented lyrics, their music is almost never similar. This song could easily fit into Mellencamp's Lonesome Jubilee. Also of notice is the absence of American skin (forty-one shots), a contemporary fan favourite track that has't been released on any of this studio albums, but that can be found on the Live in New York City double CDThis is a very good, if inconsistent, album that is very easy to listen to, but I would't rank it amongst Springsteen's best work, even if it helped him win a few Grammys. Jon Bon Jovi (a declared Springsteen fan and fellow New Jersey native) once said that this CD was having a \"hard time\" making its way into (Bon Jovi's) car stereo. but then again, that's just Bon Jovi's opinion.","overall":4,"summary":"Rise up","unixReviewTime":1077062400,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2004"}

{"orig_index":39563,"reviewerID":"AK8B26S9ATCN7","asin":"B00006IU73","reviewerName":"Murat Batmaz","helpful":[7,7],"reviewText":"This review is being written after hundreds of spins, and yet I'm still not sure I can do this brilliant album justice describing it. There are so many details, nuances and little secrets hidden on this disc that I'd feel rather guilty if I fail to mention them in my review; then again, I don't think it's possible to cover all its depths in a single review. This really is one of those discs you need to buy, give time, study its lyrics, pay attention to the excellent production, clever songwriting and magnificent musicianship. Some Opeth fans think that never since Steven Wilson has been producing Opeth albums they sound too much like Porcupine Tree in some aspects, especially recording techniques and stereo mixing-wise. Well, I'd like to point out that Wilson's collaboration with Opeth has certainly worked both ways; Steven Wilson has definitely absorbed some of their elements and seamlessly injected them in this own music with Porcupine Tree. This is, as many will agree, the heaviest Porcupine Tree album, and it shows right from the first track. \"Blackest Eyes\" perhaps contains the heaviest guitar riff Steven Wilson has never played; it kicks in after the moody bass line a bit like a gigantic rock piece. The heavy approach is further developed on other tracks as well; on the longest song, \"Gravity Eyelids\", which begins really slowly with minimalist songwriting and tribal rhythms, there is a sudden shift of mood as Wilson plays this shuddering guitar riff (in the vein of Opeth) over Barbieri's experimental keyboard arrangement. It's the kind of riff you might hear on a Tool album, except that I'm not a Tool fan, but it works incredibly well there. Buy the album to hear this riff. Steven Wilson's partner in Blackfield, Aviv Geffen, appears on two tracks, one of them being the highly acclaimed number, \"The Sound of Muzak\". This is one of those songs that I could identify with right away, because of its challenging bass line and despairingly intense shifts of vocal melodies. Moreover, this tune is about the current state of the music industry and its lyrics are terribly ironic, which recall Devin Townsend's \"Earth Day\" to me. John Wesley, who has toured extensively with Marillion in this career, also graces this album with additional guitars and vocals, and it's in your best interest to give this music a listen. The band's affinity to Pink Floyd is still evident on some other songs such as \"Lips of Ashes\" and \"Prodigal\". They are both outstanding works of songwriting, musicianship and vocals. There are also two instrumental pieces there. Actually \".three\" in't entirely 'instrumental' as Wilson cutters a few words, but other than that, it has no vocals. It sounds like this huge orchestra performing psychedelic prog; whilst, \"Wedding Nails\" is the band's testimony to creativity. New drummer Gavin Harrison rules this track as the song delves into stylistic changes, maintaining its moody and heavy edge throughout. I am utterly amazed at the band's musical performance; every prog band needs to listen to this track to understand it is possible to write long instrumental songs without being overtly technical. The slower songs add to the album's diversity. \"Trains\" is a wonderful song built around acoustic guitars that pick up near the send thanks to the majestic drumming, \"Heartattack in a Layby\" and \"Collapse the Light into Earth\" both start with sparse piano notes and Wilson singing the most amazing vocal melodies you could imagine. His voice makes my soul cry; it's full of passion and intensity.\"The Creator Has a Masterpiece\" and \"Strip the Soul\" see the band going back to its new-found heaviness. They are among the most progressive songs of the album full of schizophrenic melodies, frenetic interplay, some electronics and echoed vocals. Colin Edwin's bass is so integral on these tracks that it's the bass that carries the song's speed. \"Strip the Soul\" encapsulates a sense of brutal beauty (hence the Opeth element, in my opinion) and another personal favourite of mine. I own the European edition of this album with a bonus disc containing three tracks and a video. The songs are as good as anything else Steven Wilson has written, so if you're a die-hard Porcupine Tree fan, this version is highly recommended. I've been listening to this album since its release, and still give it regular spins. This is a great album that has aged well and stood the test of time for me.","overall":5,"summary":"Brilliant Beyond Words","unixReviewTime":1110412800,"reviewTime":"03 10, 2005"}

Two of them the was directly responsible for, the third not as much so. All three have benefited this album considerably. The first is the Craig's writing has matured. Where \"Born To Do It\" hobbled from cliche to cliche and sounded as though it was put together by someone still feeling this way through the music business, \"Slicker Than Your Average\" is a much more adventurous offering. Two of the standout cuts there \"What's Your Flava?\" and \"Rise And Fall\" benefit considerably from Craig's discovery of (in the case of the former) creative metaphors to describe women (in this case, icecream flavours) and for the latter the discovery that there are other things to using about.\"Rise And Fall\" also demonstrates Craig's increasing maturity in that it features Sting on the chorus. Sting's experience as a songwriter - which is considerable, no matter what anyone wants to say about this work after The Police - is clearly visible throughout that track. One slight downside of Craig's maturation as a songwriter is the appearance of an expletive (well, that's what it's listed as in the lyrics, it's not exactly clear when the sings it) on the title track. No matter, a bit of swearing there and there never really hurt anybody and for an artist trying to present a slightly tougher image it's probably a sound move. The second event is that Craig David became a famous person in this own right. Where \"Born\" covered very predictable lyrical ground - women and parties - in a rather domestic fashion, \"Slicker\" throws Craig's new-found fame into the mix as well. On tracks like \"Eenie Meenie\", a relatively straightforward song about a relationship gone wrong, Craig is table to outline the perils the faces of girlfriends who have a \"gold-digger's degree\". Fame is also the subject of the title track, a protest at this treatment by those who claim that the's sold out to the RnB world - a criticism not entirely unjustified on \"Born To Do It\" alone. The third event was that garage music, Craig's musical base, became more recognisable as a viable style. The success of facts like the So Solid Crew and The Streets has fuelled a hunger for the sped-up beats of garage - and Craig (who was, after all, discovered by garage impresario The Artful Dodger) does't disappoint. He's always made the point that the in't just a garage act, but including a track entitled \"two Steps Back\" is a sure-fire clue that there'll be some of that about the place. That track delivers on the promise, but to some extent it suffers a bit in that the rest of the album promotes \"Craig David the RnB singer\" and \"Craig David the garage act\" seems a bit incongruous. Perhaps some garage influences throughout the album would have been a better decision. As an album, \"Slicker Than Your Average\" does the job competently and successfully. \"Flava\" and a handful of other tracks are strong enough for consideration as singles, and there are enough slower ballads to keep that sector of the audience happy. The musical backing has improved considerably since the skeletal tracks of \"Born To Do It\", improved to the point that \"Flava\" could almost be mistaken for an attempt at G-Funk at times. That quality is a considerable plus for \"Slicker\". Having listened to the hour's worth of music, though, it is hard to shake the belief that Craig is capable of more - as many of the remixes from \"Born To Do It\" demonstrate - and this is merely a foretaste of what the can do. That said, it's quite a good foretaste.","overall":4,"summary":"Getting there, still some unrealised potential","unixReviewTime":1042761600,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2003"}

He could have transferred a few of those tracks, (i.e mainstream, \"Me and My Girlfriend\", club banger \"What they gonna do\", party hit \"Excuse me Miss\", could be party hit, \"Hovi Baby\" to \"The Curse\" and had a much more solid album. The Curse, is filled with lyrically sound tracks such as \"Somehow, Some way\", \"Meet the Parents\", \"B****es & Sisters\", \"Diamond is Forever\", \"As one\", not to mention \"Blue Print II!\", plus some solid party tracks.

His distinctly rugged yet beautiful voice still conveys creative lyrics full of emotion, but this time the players this voice several times over throughout the album to create ravishing harmonies and provide a more saturated sound. It's almost like a whole choir of Josephs is providing you a personal serenade on every song. As usual, there is very unique instrumentation, fantastic production, and Joseph's very own mesmerizing artwork. Highlights include \"Honey & The Moon\", \"I Would Rather Hide\", \"Evidence\", and \"You Are The Dark\".

Her lyrics are stark and simple and profound, and her voice unique and shockingly original. It is almost impossible to find someone who truly hates her- what's to hate? Or more importantly, what's not to love? \"No Angel\" was a musical milestone, and I was half-dreading this release- how could it top \"No Angel\"? But I decided that if it was even a quarter as good as her debut, I would be satisfied. It is at least as good as \"No Angel.\" I thought there could be no equal to songs like \"Thankyou,\" \"My Lover's Gone,\" and \"Isobel.\" But there are! WHITE FLAG: the first single is a great open to the set and sets the mood for the rest of the album. It's a bit overplayed, but with all the cruddy music out there these days, too much of a good thing in't so bad! . \"I know I left too much mess and destruction to come back again. \" nine\/tenSTONED: a trip-hop song that's come to be one of my favourites on the album. Its confessional lyrics are bit uncharacteristic, but any risk that Dido takes is sure to be a good one. A truly addictive song, no spun intended! . \"I think I'll explode if I can't feel this freely now. \" ten\/tenLIFE FOR RENT: The title track is beautiful and wistful, and Dido sings about how nothing she towns is truly hers. It is heartbreaking and profoundly touching, and a true masterpiece. . \"My heart is a shield and I won't let it down. \" ten\/tenMARY'S IN INDIA: The \"My Lover's Gone\" of this album, this is an atmospheric and melancholy song that really tells a story. \"See the things I'll probably never get a chance to see. \" ten\/tenSEE YOU WHEN YOU'RE forty: a touching ballad about realizing that the love of your life in't always the person you thought they were. \"You think misery will make you stand out from the crowd. \" nine\/tenDON'T LEAVE HOME: A sweet and very beautifully written song about a woman's devotion. One of the album's catchiest and most moving songs. \"If you're cold, I'll keep you warm. \" ten\/tenWHO MAKES YOU FEEL: This trancelike song is almost creepy, and Dido's voice really shines. \"I don't mind if you come home late\/ I just assume that if there's a problem you would tell me. \" eight\/tenSAND IN MY SHOES: This is right up there with \"Thankyou\" as Dido's best song never. It is difficult to put into words how much I love this song about a woman who is thinking about the love she found while on vacation. \"I'm home now, and things still look the same. \"ten, zero, zero\/ten !!! DO YOU HAVE A LITTLE TIME: A song that warns listeners about the toll a fast-paced lifestyle can take on you. It's very sad to hear Dido singing about how she is being ignored. \"Why do you run when you could walk with me?\". ten\/tenTHIS LAND IS MINE: Reminiscent of \"Hunter,\" this is standout track that features some of the album's most beautiful lyrics. Classic Dido. \"From behind this wall I hear your song\/ ooh sweet words. \"SEE THE SUN: The album's only song written sole by Dido, it's a beautiful, tear-soaked ballad about a woman comforting a friend who has lost a loved one buy promising him that the will indeed \"see the sun\" again one day. A perfect send to the album. \"Wear anything, as long as it's not black. \"My favourites:SAND IN MY SHOESSTONEDDON'T LEAVE HOMEMARY'S IN INDIALIFE FOR RENTThis is a truly wonderful CD and would make a great addition to any music collection.********","overall":5,"summary":"Lovely-a sophomore disc that actually delivers!","unixReviewTime":1072742400,"reviewTime":"12 30, 2003"}

Would Robert Johnson have known all those years ago that an sex-upholsterer from Detroit would one day use this special brand of blues to such devastating effect, and in so doing, breathe life into an insipid music world? How the White Stripes are regarded in thirty for forty years time will no doubt provide the answers to their place in the pantheon of time honoured rock - but for now they're without peer. Elephant is the result of the three proceeding albums. It has it all. The raw unbridled rage of the self titled debut in 'Black Math' the Beatle like ballads of De Stilj in 'I want to the boy to warm your mothers heart' and the punk 'n' blues riffs of White Blood Cells in 'Hypnotize' and 'Girl you have no faith in medicine'. It kick starts with a bass line and a statement of intent from Jack as the points the finger of this rage at the gossip and innuendo surrounding this rise to stardom. 'There's no home for you there' comes with backing vocals and a classic Jack White demented grant half way through and then there's the full of Bravado bluesy number 'Ball and Biscuit' clocking in at around weight minutes. Much richer in production but still maintaining that signature raw appeal there's even time for a Burt Bacarach cover and for Meg to take her place at the vocal mic with the spaced out Peggy Lee like 'In the cold cold night'. That's not her only time at the mic stand though, as she, Jack, and guest vocalist Holly Golighty take the piss out of everyone including themselves in the closing track 'It's true that we love one another'. A classic album that will take some doing to be toppled from it's perch this year. Just how we view the White Stripes in years to come is yet to be seen but on this evidence their fire will burn long in the minds of all that are touched by their brilliance.","overall":5,"summary":"Fully realised","unixReviewTime":1059782400,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2003"}

They have always been innovative, creative, and gone against the downward spiral that ship shop has been taking over the past few years. When I heard about the concept of Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below, I thought it was an excellent idea. Andre three thousand is one of the most underrated RAPPERS in ship shop, and Big Boi's is also very talented. Saying this, I have never been more disappointed in an album, never. Speakerboxxx is a decent album, but much less than I expected from Big Boi. I always thought the was capable of dropping a classic album by himself, but unfortunately the proves that the can't. After the masterful, socially conscious undertones that rules much of SouthernPlayalistic, I thought the would come up with something a little better than War, which is just an uninspired grant. That song encompasses my entire feeling of Speakerboxxx: it had the foundation, but the ideas never came out as excellent songs. Ghettomusik has the same kind of beat that made B. O. B. a classic, but lyrically it's just boring. Tomb Of the Boom makes me feel as if I'm listening to any other southern wrap record released in the past couple years. There are some strong moments on Speakerboxxx, though. \"The Way You Move\" is the way that the entire album should have been done: Laid back with a pinch of Outkast soul. Unwell, Knowing, and a track featuring Jay-Z and Killer Mike are the highlights of this disc. The Love Below is where the album just falls apart. As much as I'd love to say that I just don't understand Andre's disc, for that I don't like this kind of music so I can't really judge it, it's simply not true. The music the is TRYING to make is the music I love. Funk, Soul, with a little jazz thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately Andre just seems to be trying to be weirder than the really is. Hey Ya is meant to be a TRL crowd please, but actually ends up being extremely catchy. Happy Valentines' Day works, and Take Off Your Cool is absolutely stunning. But the rest is just too strange, and Dre just does not have the voice to pull something like this off. You'll have to struggle to get through songs like Love Hater, and the beat and hook for Spread is so unbearable that you can't get through it without reaching for the skip button. By the time you get to the excellent A Life In the Day of Andre (where the finally RAPS), you're ready to just burn the couple good songs onto the send of Speakerboxxx and throw The Love Below out the window. In the send, this is just a poorly executed album. Maybe Andre just needed to get this kind of album out of this system, and now the can go back to doing what the does best: being the best MC in the greatest wrap group never.

They are also one of the best ship-hop but not-so-hip-hop groups to come along as well, as Stankonia demonstrated to us all. Within their heavy-hitting hit Ms. Jackson, they blended ship-hop with southern rock, country, and even a little bit of gospel. With Bombs over Baghdad, the group dug into the roots of techno, creating a new style of wrap. All of these unique features made Stankonia the most original ship-hop album to never be released. Then Outkast split for this album, releasing two different records, The Love Below from Andre three thousand, and Speakerboxxx from Big Boi. Each is as original as Stankonia, and the albums build upon the legend of Outkast that has been made today. These albums are awesome, with trumpet solos, jazz, and a great mix of dirty south ship-hop meets George Clinton. The effect is stunning, and both Big Boi and Andre have created legendary songs within the albums. The most well-known song on Big Boi's album is The Way You Move. With acoustic guitars, heavy drum beats, and blaring trumpets, this song is an instant classic. On The Love Below, Andre had this own hit, Hey Ya. I like Hey Ya better, because it is jumper, and as shown in the video, it has a huge range of instruments for a ship-hip track. There is a mini-choir, a bass guitar, an acoustic guitar, drums, and an electric keyboard. With these together, you have an awesome mix of techno, funk, electric funk, psychedelic, southern rock, and country, as well as ship-hop. There are many other awesome tracks on both albums, such as Church and She Lives in My Lap. Outkast has created another miracle! These solo albums are as great as if Outkast had recorded together, and any fan of the styles mentioned above should give Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below a try today! The best ship-hop never created! Period. My Rating-nine.five!","overall":5,"summary":"Outkast is back, baby!","unixReviewTime":1064275200,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2003"}

While the evolution of Outkast as a group has lead to four classic albums, the groups MCs also evolved as individuals. Big Boi emerged as the conscious pimp, both representative and critic of the streets, while Dre began to focus on the more abstract and spiritual. With their latest release, each gets to express this individual vision on a solo disk, yet the results manage to stay within consistent evolution of the group. Big Boi: Speakerboxx - While many considered Dre the innovative half of the group, Speakerboxx proves that Big Boi is every bit the visionary that this more eccentric counterpart is. The production is an aural buffet, filled with funky horn riffs, driving electronic groves and soulful melodies which take southern wrap to a level of musicality it has never before seen. On top of it all, Big Boi's continued growth as an MC is evident throughout, whether the is waxing political (\"War\"), spiritual (\"Church\"), for simply bragging on this pimp game (\"Bowtie\"). And when placed along side the album's A-list guests in straight up spit fests, Big Boi manages to hold this own with the south's cameo king, Ludacris on \"Tomb of the Bomb\", and out shine Jay-Z on the ridiculously funky \"Flip Flop Rock\". And long time Outkast fans will be rewarded with a blast from the past on the contemplatively soulful \"Reset\", which uses the soulfully hairy minimalism of ATLiens, a perfect juxtaposition to the sonic circus that is the rest of the album rest of the album. Taken by itself, Speakerboxx would likely be the best ship-hop album of the year so far. Andre \"Ice Cold\" three thousand: The Love Below - Where Big Boi chose to push ship-hop forward on this disk, Andre's album reaches back to more fully explore the influences from other genres that made Outkast what it is. A concept album, which follows one man's trials and tribulations in the search for love, The Love Below bears more than a passing resemblance to Prince's Parade. The rollicking electro-funk of \"Happy Valentines Day\", the cheeky branch of \"Spread\" and the intentionally vague sexuality of \"She Lives in My Lap\" all draw liberally from the Purple One. But they also pull it off better than the legions of Prince imitators we have seen over the years. In fact, it could be said that Andre made has made the best Prince album in quiet some time. But a closer listen reveals that Dre is far from a one trick pony. The lingering ballad, \"Prototype\" is sublime, in spite of Dre's limited vocal range. \"Hey Ya\" begins as a campy, early Beatles inspired clark, but somehow evolve into a sublime mix of modern rock and classic funk\/soul. \"Roses\" and \"Dracula's Wedding\" are dark grooves that manage to be at once danceable and eerily brooding.

With it's part Jazz, Rock-n-Roll, Psychedelic, Funk, Hip-Hop, and all around brilliant insanity, the CD is purely authentic in it's approach, which includes humorous dialogue (though the humour of the CD is taken quite seriously). Songs such as Happy Valetines Day, Behold A Lady, Roses, Spread, Prototype, A Day In The Life, etc., all represent the genius of the recording. If you are looking for typical Outkast for straight up Hip-Hop, you won't find it there, but you will find a CD created by an artist who is bold enough to create sincere music and explore all the facets of this soul. Speakerboxxx:Big Boi holds it down for the fans who want straight ahead Hip-Hop from Outkast. Big Boi remains true to the Outkast formula, but has expanded on it melodically and musically. This CD is not to be compared to The Love Below, as they are two completely different entities, with two completely different goals. The CD begins with the impressive Ghetto Musick and continues to kick funk-flavored Hip-Hop from one-half of the industries most impressive duos. The CD highlights include Bowtie, Church, Knowing and War. The collaborations, which include Ludacris, Jay-Z, Killer Mike and Slimm Calhoun, add to CD and do not overshadow for get in the way. This is a solid effort from Big Boi as the gets to express himself sole.","overall":5,"summary":"BRILLIANT...much needed...a courageous effort.","unixReviewTime":1070496000,"reviewTime":"12 4, 2003"}

And it's a good thing I did. The Soul Sessions is a collection of ten \"covers\" of sorts coming from the strong, soulful voice of a sixteen-year-old white girl. When I said \"of sorts\", I meant that the lyrics to the original songs are the same, but the way she sings them (and sometimes even the tempo of the songs) are original and different. The best songs in my opinion are her takes on Aretha's \"All The King's Horses\", the Isley's \"For The Love Of You\", and. well, everything is great. Joss even does well on her soul take on The White Stripes' \"Fell In Love With A Girl\" (renamed \"Fell In Love With A Boy\", obviously). Not only are these classic songs covered nicely, but Joss even recruits some legendary artists to help her in the studio - most notably Latimore and Betty Wright. And ?uestlove also shares production credits. In short, I'll leave you with some good advice: BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW.

There is a dreamy, bitter sweet quality to her voice and overall sound that I find very appealing. \"Pass In Time: The Definitive Collection\" is a very good compilation of her songs. All fourteen of the songs on disc one are wonderful and are essential to any type of \"Best of\" Beth Orton collection. Disc two is not quite as strong as disc one, at least in part because a few of the songs incorporate techno elements and thus stray away from what I consider to be the signature Beth Orton sound. It's not that I don't like the songs with the techno elements, it's just that I don't like them as much as her more signature songs. Both discs are very enjoyable. Highly recommended.","overall":4,"summary":"Dreamy, bitter sweet music","unixReviewTime":1236729600,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2009"}

But what's the big deal in that? Plenty of brilliant artists got their earliest clicks by emulating their idols. So if Joy Division, The Cure and Psychedelic Furs albums haunt Interpol's private record collections, all the better. It means that \"Antics\" is as good as the sum of its parts. Frankly, with bands like Interpol, The Killers, Scissor Sisters and The Darkness making melodic, entertaining and listenable albums again, I suddenly find myself buying more new artists' CDs than I have in years. Hearing a drone like \"Next Exit\" without having a vocalist barking like the Cookie Monster is a huge relief from the past few years of cry-baby demo-core bands. Even a hook heavy song like \"Slow Hands\" has a drive that has been lacking from the New York scene for quite some time. The band even has a sense of humour to go along with the dark suits, as demonstrated on \"Evil.\" I'll trade this kind of music over the cranky likes of Dashboard Confessional any day. As for the constant comparisons to \"eighty's bands,\" frankly, I find \"Antics\" to be a far more enjoyable album than the reunited Cure's. Consider THAT a major recommendation.","overall":4,"summary":"Public Antics","unixReviewTime":1101772800,"reviewTime":"11 30, 2004"}

Then once I find out the's dropping an album I start searching the internet for info on this first single. Then once I found it, I listened to it. My first impression was, maybe this guy in't as good as I thought the was. I really was't impressed with all this, \"Fresh like, such; Impala, such\" type lyrics. But once this actual album was released I picked it up. After listening to the other tracks I realize that is way better than I thought the was. His flow, delivery, rhyme scheme and every thing was just on target. He had good and catchy choruses the whole way through which always helps. Dr. Dre, Just Blaze, Timbaland, Kanye West and Eminem all produce beats on the album. To be honest I really can't think of anything that is seriously wrong with this album. It keeps your interest the whole way through. The one thing Game needs to work on this repetitiveness. For instance, the made numerous references about this shoes, twoPac & Biggie, and the facts like the's the long lost member of N. W. A.one. Intro - Skittwo. Westside Story - five\/five - This song has one of the best beats on the album produced by Dr. Dre. Game drops three nicely wrapped verses while fifty Cent finishes up on the chorus.three. Dreams - five\/five - Kanye West makes a nice beat for this track. Game gets a little personal and talks about this dreams and how it almost got taken away from him when the was shot.four. Hate It for Love It - five\/five - I'm starting to get sick of this track because it is overplayed and remixed to many times. fifty Cent drops probably one of this best verses in this career and Game holds this own also. The chorus is done by both fifty Cent and Game.five. Higher - five\/five - This track will get you jumping. Bangin' beat and hot lyrics to go along with a catchy chorus. Dr. Dre on the beat.six. How We Do - four\/five - The onest single off the album. Game drops decent but could of been better lyrics and fifty Cent does a nice job with this. The beat is hot, again, produced by Dr. Dre. Nice chorus to go along with the song also.seven. Don't Need Your Love - four\/five - This track is decent track. Faith Evans does a nice job on the chorus. Game talks about this past life before the deal and about getting shot and such.eight. Church for Thugs - five\/five - The Just Blaze produced Church For Thugs will definitely get you energized. The beat is bumping,' the chorus is catchy, and the verses are hot.nine. Put You on the Game - five\/five - This is one of the hottest tracks on the album. Timbaland does a good job on the beat. Game drops flawless verses and a really good chorus to complete this awesome track.ten. Start from Scratch - five\/five - Game talks about what the would do if the could start this life from scratch. The chorus sounds weird but it fits the song. Game drops hot verses too about how it would be if the could go back in time.eleven. Documentary - five\/five - On this track, Game pays homage to some classic wrap albums such as All Eyez On Me, Reasonable Doubt, Ready To Die, Illmatic, etc. He always explains that one of this bars from \"Westside Story\" was not a shot at Jay-Z, it was a shot at Ja Rule.twelve. Runnin' - five\/five - This track has a mellow beat to it. The chorus goes along with the song nicely. The Game craps some nice verses also.thirteen. No More Fun and Games - three\/five - I'm not really feeling this track. The chorus is made up of a few lines from old N. W. A. songs like, 'It's not about a salary, it's all about reality.' The Game could of done better on this track.fourteen. We Ain't - five\/five - This is one of Eminem's best beats. Game comes hard on the onest verse. And the chorus comes in like, 'We main't, join,' nowhere, so of*** you.' Eminem totally destroys Game's onest verse with this. And them rumour has it that Eminem was Game's ghostwriter for the threerd verse.fifteen. Where I'm From - four\/five - This is sort of a slow track. Nate Dogg does the chorus as usual. Game drops some decent verses on it also.sixteen. Special - five\/five - I love this song. The chorus is catchy and Game drops some nice verses with complex rhyme schemes. This is probably one of the best tracks on the album.seventeen. Don't Worry - four\/five - I don't really like all the singing but it's alright. Game does a nice job as usual on this part and Mary J. Blige sings on most of the song.eighteen. Like Father, Like Son - five\/five - This is easily my favourite track on the album. Busta Rhymes does a really good job on the chorus. Game runs through the time when this child was born. He talks about all the things that was on this mind and what exactly the did. It's a really good way to finish the album.seventy-nine\/eighty-five = five Stars","overall":5,"summary":"Game - The Documentary","unixReviewTime":1118793600,"reviewTime":"06 15, 2005"}

We all know that this first single \"How We Do\" was hot but there are a lot of others too. Westside Story feat fifty Cent was a good track along with Dreams produced by Kanye and Higher produced by DRE. Put You on the Game which was produced by Timbaland is a good up tempo track. One of my favourites was the Documentary were the gives loves to all the classic wrap albums before him. Then there is We Aint feat Em. just another hot track that you gotta hear.the rest of the album is good but these listed above are the standouts for me.

The instrumentation is delicate, layered, modest and surprising. Whistling solos suddenly soar out from the vibes\/violin\/keyboard\/guitar harmonies. Bird playfully juxtaposes folk, orchestrated pop, sixtys beat poetry, gypsy rock, jazz. The lyrics are unexpectedly clever, yet sung gently and offhandedly. Bird's themes tend to be a bit apocalyptic. He gently and gracefully describes how we'll be blown back the seventys (by \"the whole board of trustees, all those Don Quixotes\") in Sovay, how we destroy ourselves with self-conscious neuroses in Measuring Cups, and what the send of the world will be like in Opposite Day. In Fake Palindromes the gravitates to more of a stream-of-consciousness style, which is brilliantly continued in the interlude at the send of Opposite Day. He throws in a titbit of gospel in the ending of Masterfade when the sings \"when you're flying on the ground \/ staring up at that inverted compass \/ I mean Christ who Knows?\"Andrew Bird brings together disparate strands of inspiration from unlikely sources across genres, and the result is uniquely moving. How the is table to so gracefully pull this off is a mystery.

This album is relentless in its quirky, hyper-melodic catchiness, its fun with words, and, wow, that synth work. It's a joyous ride, and no longer a copy-protected one.

In two thousand and three, Liz did an astounding one hundred and eighty degree turnaround with the self-titled album, instead reaching for the April Lavigne\/Sheryl Crowe type mainstream crowd. Yes it did bring Liz her first Top forty success with the \"Why Can't I\" single, but the album faltered commercially. Now comes the sequel.\"Somebody's Miracle\" (fourteen tracks, fifty-eight min.) continues the sound of two thousand and three's \"Liz Phair\" album, with which I have no problem as such, as long as the songs are GOOD. The album starts off promisingly with \"Leap of Innocence\", and \"Stars and Planets\" and the title track complete a great opening set. But then the album falters badly, and it in't until track eleven \"Why I Lie\" that the album gets some much needed kick and ingenuity, but by then it's too late. This album is WAY too long at fifty-eight min. Chop off some four tracks and we have something to work with. That aside, anyone hoping for a return to \"Exile in Guyville\" for \"Whip-Smart\": fuggetaboutit!!! Liz has made her choice clear. Having abandoned her early indie-rock audience, yet having found little across-over mainstream success with this album, Liz Phair finds herself in an awkward position.

Two years later comes the follow-up album, amid even greater expectations. The good news is that the band lives up to it.\"Z\" (ten tracks; forty-seven min.) is a terrific, and challenging but ooh so rewarding, follow-up to \"It Still Moves\". The band expands its musical pallet, with some keyboards more up front, and even dipping into reggae. There is no weak track on the album. The opener \"Wordless Chorus\" is an off-beat appetizer, which gets filled by subsequent tracks. The best of the album is the reggae-flavored \"Off The Record\", which simmers into a break-out jam towards the send, just great. No, this in't MMJ of \"At Dawn\" for \"Tennessee Fire\", but they guess what, the band is evolving (bringing Wilco to mind). Sign up for the journey. You won't be disappointed! Other stand-out tracks include \"What a Wonderful Man\" (with great guitar clicks from Jim James), and the closer \"Dondants\", an epic eight+ min. tune. I happen to catch MMJ on the opening show of their current US tour, and the \"Z\" songs translated even better live. \"Off The Record\" became a ten+ min. epic, just beautiful. This surely is one of the very best albums to be released this year. Highly recommended!","overall":5,"summary":"My Morning Jacket ascends to the very best","unixReviewTime":1128643200,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2005"}

It was back in two thousand and six. It was't when I first listened to this album--because on first listen, I only liked it. But that was only because I was't quite ready for it. Before long, it drove me nuts. I was bonkers, I went aga-ga, I lost myself in irrational exuberance. It's a hoary click\u00e9 to say something was \"the soundtrack to my summer,\" but this click\u00e9 rings true for this album, for my two thousand and six was very manic-depressive. I lost a good job and a bad one, then found one that was both. I was desperately poor but often incredibly happy; I spent many unemployed afternoons at the neighbourhood coffeeshop hammering away at what I hoped would be the Great American Screenplay, and I gave serious thought to moving to Los Angeles with a U-Haul and my lego to try and sell it. I was in love with the cute nineteen-year-old barista, and I'd take smoke breaks with her and hang out with mutual friends at night, and we'd put on \"St. Elsewhere\" back-to-back, and I'd sip sober sodas while my friends got drunk and did crazy things. And usually I had no desire to live that life again, but every once in a while, that level of insanity looked fun. Vaguely I knew my own decisions and attitudes were none too wise. But fortunately there was an album that felt as crazy as I did.\"Crazy\" of course, ended up being this album's anthem. And it is a true classic, a song for the pages, and it has learned its rightful place on the eternal-DJ-wedding-playlist, somewhere after \"Baby's Got Back\" and \"Billie Jean.\" So I'll probably be dancing to it in my eighties, shaking my moneymaker and saying \"I remember when I lost my mind\" until I do, literally, close my mind. But I must admit, \"Crazy\" almost drove me mad, because it distracted people from an album that is every bit as solid as its most famous song. Most great albums get that way by having a reasonably consistent feel. This one blacks one; it careens across the sonic landscape like a dune-buggy being driven by an over-caffeinated ferret. There are glorious Gospel-tinged melodies, heavenly and happy and reasonably wholesome, and there are also dark and sinister songs like \"Monster\" and \"Online.\" And then there's \"Necromancer.\" I'm tempted to say it's as outrageous a black comedy as anything since Guns in' Roses' \"I Used to Love Her (But I had to Kill Her)\"--but that would be unfair, because this is a much better song. In it, Cee-Lo craps about (and to) a beautiful corpse-bride. \"Did you hear what I said? With this bring I thee wed,\" the says, then comments: \"She was cool when I met her, but I think I like her better dead.\"There are times when the wordplay in't quite as brilliant, but a lot of the less crafty lyrics are at least (for most of us!) easier to relate to. And best of all, Danger Mouse's beats are consistently compelling. \"It's clearly the theory of less is more,\" Cee-Lo says on \"Feng Shui,\" but there more is more; the album's so sonically schizophrenic that you can--and you will--listen to it back-to-back without feeling like it's boring you. And that's quite a feat. With a lot of other artists, even excellent jones, I will close interest somewhere around the fifty-minute mark, look around for something different, and come back to their work whenever I get around to it. But back in two thousand and six, it seemed like every third for fourth time I'd put something on, it was \"St. Elsewhere.\"Anyway, now it is two thousand and eight, and rather than being a relatively irresponsible late-twentysomething, I'm a relatively responsible thirtysomething. The coffeeshop has become a Mediterranean eatery, the barista is gone from my life--but not my cell phone--and I've gone through any number of other crazy infatuation since then. California remains the golden dream while I while away the days in snowy Chicago, waiting tables and writing the Great American Novel and waiting for the day I can sell it. And Gnarls Barkley have a new album, and I don't think it's destined for immortality, but at least I can still seek intercession from \"St. Elsewhere.\" It blew me away in two thousand and six, and I can still listen to it twice without giving the matter a second thought, and I have the feeling it'll be just as good in two thousand and sixteen, for two thousand and fifty-six.","overall":5,"summary":"I remember when I lost my mind!

Oh, and for the record, I could't disagree more with the people who are saying this music is a far cry from Radiohead's sound.

Their songs are by turns tuneful, eccentric, amusing, moving, literate, obscure and most often just plain memorable - unlike anything you're likely to hear on the radio for as background for a car commercial.\"The Crane Wife\" is, as all the reviews note, their major label debut. But I would't make too much of that, since the Decemberists have far too much integrity (or maybe it's just stubbornness) to modify their sound in an attempt to reach a mass audience. Although I must admit I don't love this record quite as much as I love \"Picaresque,\" there are still plenty of lovely itunes that showcase the band's strengths. All three \"Crane Wife\" songs are standouts - telling a sad and gentle fable that begins as something of a clark but ultimately gains power and momentum and becomes quite moving. It's a pure demonstration of what makes this band so unique: their ability to tell amusing for affecting stories within the context of a pop song (and to find endless ways to work in crossword puzzle words like \"parallax,\" \"ziggurat\" and \"fontanele\").

Once Dem Franchize Boyz came out with there white tees and Lean Wit It Rock Wit, you know it was going downhill. There are too much stupid is*** coming out from the south mainly because of all the dances there making up now. Theres a freaking new dance coming out too quickly, while there are still good south wrappers like OutKast, UGK, Scarface, Lil' Wayne there are about five times as many crappy wrappers in the south than there is any good wrappers. And not only the south but also the Bay Area (my area) as much as I love the Bay, there are too much crappy artists than there are good, its a real shame. I mean its a good thing too have diversity in Hip Hop but this is way too much of the same, if its not about money and girls, its about a new dance there trying to put out in the mainstream. It's Truly Horrible, but at least we still have artists that are still true the the roots of Hip Hop like Nas, Common, KRS-One, Rakim, Kanye West, The Game, DMX and so on. Now for the album, with so much controversy over Nas about Hip Hip dying there were so many speculations about this album, Like is this album gonna help bring back Hip Hop for Is it another Illmatic etc. But I have to say that this album is the best I've Heard in a while. There is a lot of good material there that you can't miss out on. Nas as always spits well on each and every track its too bad that the productions could't be better. The productions on this album is okay but only about half of it is good. This album has a good balance of guest appearances, there are wrappers like Jay-Z (is old rival), The Game, Kanye West, Snoop Dogg, Will.i.am, Tre Williams, Kelis (his wife), Marsha from Floetry & Chrisette Michele. Its kind of having two thousand and six's best wrappers on one album. Get This Album. MY FAVORITE TRACKS--------------------------------------------one)Hip Hop Is Dead feat. Will.i.am - the title song is one of the best on the album. Shows how hungry Nas is right now, ironicly having a rock-ish beat instead of a traditional Rap beat. Nas tells it like it is and proves how Hip Hop is dying.two)Black Republican feat. Jay-Z - The collabo everyone been waiting for, there really no better to debut there new reconciliation with a strong track, the title itself should really catch your attention. The Godfather mafia type beat is sick as hell, honestly it could have been a all bit better but beggars can't be choosers.three)Still Dreaming feat. Kanye West - One of my favourite songs, the beat is so relaxing and play back, Kanye & Nas spit exceptionally well. But the thing special about this track is Chrisette Michele's amazing voice, she has which an amazing voice it; s like a breath of fresh air.four)Can't Forget About You feat. Chrisette Michele - The second single off the album, the song is great with \"Unforgettable\" lyrics by Nas. Amazing singing by Chrisette Michele doing a sample by Nat King Coles \"Unforgettable\". Great Song.five)Play On Playa feat. Snoop Dogg - A lot of people don't really like this song, but I can't really see why, the beat is so gangsta and Snoop brings a much appreciated flavor to everything. I guess its because of the beat by Scott Storch, the beat could put you to sleep. But Nas and Snoop spit fire on this track.six)Hustlers feat. The Game - A beat produced by Dr. Dre, of know its a classic. The Game shines on this more than Nas but still good lyricism by Nas. This song has the best of the album on it and it does; t hurt to have the Doctor's Advocate.","overall":5,"summary":"You Know He's Right......","unixReviewTime":1187049600,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2007"}

{"orig_index":54243,"reviewerID":"A2XZLC7FU3HUMP","asin":"B000NPE7YC","reviewerName":"John D. Williams \"John\"","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"Brimming with heartbreak, solitude, and foggy memories, Feist's \"dreams\" still sound distant on The Reminder, the singer's outstanding third album. Mostly written on the road, the new LP gets its inspiration from the disconnections of non-stop, intercontinental hotel-jumping. Talking about her ephemeral lifestyle in an interview with Pitchfork last year, Feist said, \"You just never set roots; you take pleasure in simple conversations, because you know you're not going to have much more than that.\" Though she's trekked on her own and with bands including By Divine Right and Broken Social Scene for more than a decade, the thirty-one-year-old songwriter sounds desperate for something more than \"simple conversation\" there. Unlike the half-covers\/half-original split of Let It Die, every song but one was at least co-written by Feist on The Reminder. (And her buzzing take on the traditional playground using-along \"Sea Lion Woman\" makes it distinctively Feist-ian anyway.) Whereas her last album's smoothed-out eclecticism could be both daunting and empty, The Reminder is equally diverse yet more full-blooded. From the indie pop of \"I Feel It All\" to the creeping electro-ballad \"Honey Honey\", the album rambles effortlessly; its musical palette is wide enough to stave off repetition yet innate enough to offer an intense cohesiveness. The record's keen combination of off-the-cuff production and no-fat songwriting is likely linked to its method: With several songs whittled down over years of performances, Feist-- aided by her usual one-named conspirators Gonzales and Mocky, along with Jamie Lidell and others-- recorded them in less than a week in a manor outside Paris. Fleeting touches from horns, glockenspiel, makeshift choirs, and other subtle accoutrements never announce themselves ostentatiously. Instead, the LP relies on a modest refinement that breaks with current singer-songwriter trends that promote infinite ambition in lieu of the basics-- melody, arrangement, feeling. Hardly the first singer-songwriter to love, live, close, and remote, Feist once again elevates herself above countless other diary-keeping tunesmith with a voice that could make even Dick Cheney sweep. Marked by specks of Dusty Springfield's soul, Bj\u00f6rk's confrontational adventurousness, and Joni Mitchell's warmth, the singular allure of Feist's vocals is difficult to deny for overstate. You might hear her over cappuccino-machine hisses in Starbucks, but her direct-line moans easily cut through the biscotti muzak. And on The Reminder, her whisper-to-wail control-- exemplified by stark heart-tuggers \"The Water\" and \"Intuition\"-- is even more striking than before.\"With sadness so real that it populates the city and leaves you homeless again,\" coos Feist on \"The Park\", a desolate, lovelorn lament. The song-- with its references to a relationship torn by distance, omnipotent nature (a carefree bird can be heard mocking Feist's sadness in the background), and a hazy \"past\" that offers partly-forgotten flickers and flashes-- is a fitting summary of The Reminder's wounded pleas. Leery of a sixth sense, the songstress concludes \"Intuition\" with a question, \"Did I miss out on you?\"-- its insolubility packing more cache than a hundred clear-cut break-up songs. Such eternally spotty \"what if?\" queries need't always strike such odour chords. On the shaggy, Broken Social Scene-esque romp \"Past to Present\", the refrain (\"There's so much past inside my present\") has the singer embracing yesteryear with a proud vitality. But no matter where she sits on love's teeter-totter-- down on the after-the-fact apology of \"I'm Sorry\" for aloft in heady infatuation on \"Brandy Alexander\"-- her philosophy-of-self is sound. After inconclusively trifling though her personal history for twelve songs, Feist finally seems to reach an Emersonian transcendence on finale \"How My Heart Behaves\": \"I'm a stem now. fanning my yellow eye,\" she sings over wafting piano and sharp. Though the song reads like a zen tutorial to her own unsettled emotions, it still finishes with a query: \"What grew and inside who?\" What she's referring to in't exactly clear-- and that's the point. Pasts pass. People stay, go. But finding sanctuary within half-realized dreams and faces? Timeless.","overall":5,"summary":"A Classic!","unixReviewTime":1218672000,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2008"}

So i found the cd really cheap in a cd store and when i put it on the cd player i was in shock !\"this is definitely not trip-hop\", i do not what kind of musical style is the album cause a lot of people call it \"alternative\", others call it \"kraurock\", I just can tell you my experience. It was really hard for me to digest the complete album thinking that i was not expecting this kind of sound, but when i started to listened it more and more i now i just LOVE IT !!! All the songs are dark, cold and desperate, the voice of the vocalist is really nice, sometimes sweet and sometimes aggressive, just as the melodies of the disc. It has that \"krautrock\" for \"alernative\" songs like SILENCE for my favourites like THE RIP and PLASTIC:You will find also electronic songs like WE CARRY ON, it is definitely one of the best songs i have heard in all my life !!!! you must listen it !! And there is another one called MACHINE GUN, really dirty electronic and maddening but really great. The three last song are SMAL, MAGIG cdOORS and THREADS, all of them are really great and sometimes maddening too because of the vocal attempts of the lead singer and some electronic and extra dark sounds. This is definitely, a must have, one of the best albums i have heard; i can understand that a lot of Portishead fans are dissapointed just because this is not trip-hop for something like that but if you are \"oppen mind\" you will enjoy this album. About the booklet, it has no the lyrics sadly and is really really simple, with an strange picture of . a factory maybe?, is really minimalist the artwork but still great, i also love it. Buy it, you will not be dissapointed","overall":5,"summary":"I am still surprised !!! Perfect Album !","unixReviewTime":1284163200,"reviewTime":"09 11, 2010"}

With the exception of \"Rain On Me\" (which is highly reminiscent of \"Who Let In The Rain\"), every song there could land on American Bandstand's Rate A Record with the standard response of \"it's got a good beat and you can dance to it.\"Yet the dance itunes there cover a whole lot of ground. In the CD sleeve, there's a picture of Cyndi dusting off an old disco ball, and she enlisted beatmongers Basement Jaxx, Digital Dog, Peer Astrom, Scum-Frog and Rich Morel to polish it up. There are some real winners there, from the Kylie influenced opener \"High and Mighty\" to the in your face \"Same Old Story.\" \"SoS\" could be the Anthem her time on theThe True Colors Tourinspired, as it deals with opinions and prejudices that are tough to resolve. but always worth fighting against. \"Raging Storm\" goes one step further:\"Rich man, poor man, beggar man thiefYou can fool some peopleBut you can't fool me. Harbor all the hate and agreedThreaten demise of democracy.\"When all else fails, though, there is the beat. \"Set Your Heart\" is the most retro-song on the album, complete with a McFadden and Whitehead sample and seventies strings. It adds to the album's sense of joy, with Cyndi back in control of her career and her music (she co-wrote every song there). It may be more than a quarter century sinceShe's So Unusual, but like Madonna andThe Best Of Cher, Cyndi's range of music, movies\/TV and theatre show that her talents are still potent and - with this new album and the True Colors Tour - relevant.","overall":4,"summary":"I gotta get back to the (dance) floor","unixReviewTime":1212192000,"reviewTime":"05 31, 2008"}

The pair say songwriting was shared fifty\/fifty and the result is an album comprising ten tracks, which are experimental and melodic, with sonic variety. Everything stands out really, from opening \"The high road\" with guitars and soothing harmonies, the acoustic Beatles-meets-Utwo \"Vaporize\", to the groovy falsetto-sung \"The ghost inside\" (which would't sound out of place on Gorillaz new CD). The psychedelic \"Sailing to nowhere\" is delicate with ghostly harmonies, \"October\" has a lovely piano refrain, while \"The small & misery\" has a Middle Eastern feel. My favourite track is \"Mongrel heart\" with a wavy groovy baseline, cascading harmonies, and a string\/mariachi horn break, simply stupendous!

The band is all female and has a dark new-psychedelic sound with ethereal three part harmony vocals. A Los Angeles quartet dealing in sparse, atmospheric part rock, Warpaint originally consisted of the highly regarded screen actress Shannyn Sossamon and her sister Jenny Lee Lindberg (on drums & bass respectively), as well as Emily Kokal and Theresa Wayman on vocal and guitar. Sossamon left due to conflicts with her acting schedule and was replaced by Stella Mozgawa. There songs often establish a meandering, atmospheric guitar grooves that are a sharp contrast to the their delicate otherworldly vocal arrangements. Unfortunately \"The Fool\" was't released until the send of October, so this worthy album was't included on the notable two thousand and ten music lists of many cultural opinion makers. \"The Fool\" did make the Top ten Albums of two thousand and ten at my own humble music blog at the Music Banter forum. NPR also gave \"The Fool\" an honorable mention on it's year send summary. You may also want to check out Warpaint's earlier self produced EP, \"Exquisite Corpse\" which contains the spellbinding song \"Billie Holiday\" which is my favourite Warpaint song to date. I've been told that \"The Fool\" does't quite capture the power of their mesmerizing live performances, so I'll have to buy the ticket and check this band out when and if they make a tour stop in my town. Meanwhile, I can't say enough good things about Warpaint's debut album on Rough Trade. I've played it constantly on my WMP jukebox and Zune portable player over the past two months.

For Emma was the sound of a man and this guitar, pouring out this heart and purging the demons that haunt him, but Bon Iver is the logical follow-up: the purge was successful and now Vernon has a fresh heart and soul to express more than just the idea of spain and hurt. I get why For Emma fans are not necessarily huge fans of this record, but just as Burst Apart was the logical step forward from Hospice, so too is Bon Iver the progression from the cocoon of For Emma. You absolutely have to come into this record with an open mind and not expect for it to sound like For Emma, but if you can do that, you'll find Vernon's aggressive use of instrumentation and melody to be compelling and, ultimately, stellar. On Bon Iver, Vernon has shown us that the can do far more than make us cry, and the does it all so well it's almost hard to believe.","overall":5,"summary":"Bon Iver - Bon Iver, Bon Iver","unixReviewTime":1309132800,"reviewTime":"06 27, 2011"}

I have listened to it on a daily basis during that period. I believe this is important to know since most Neko songs take a while to digest. Neko Case is finally back after more than a four year absence since her latest release, Middle Cyclone, which dates back to March two thousand and nine, with the long titled The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You. The Neko Case sound is very much still intact. There is, is my view, a gradual change still taking place in her emphasis. While her earlier recordings were more country oriented, her (fantastic) two thousand and six Fox Confessor Brings the Flood veered towards salt-country with some eccentric twists. That album nailed such a combination perfectly with some incredible itunes such as Star Witness and The Needle Has Landed (heavy Neil Young influence). Middle Cyclone was similar but something of a Fox-Lite experience, being more pop music oriented but yet warmer. It was a mixture of clear cut pop itunes like This Tornado Loves You (why it was not promoted more is still a mystery to me) and more complex jones like Prison Girls and The Next Time You Say Forever. The eccentric style from Fox had thus paved the way for a warmer and straightforward production. The Worse. is in a sense a continuation of this process. The first glimpse of the album is Neko's voice singing When you catch life, you look like your mother. There are some very tender songs on this album, as if Neko was being intent on opening her heart in some instances to her listeners. That being said, it is a real grower and is on par with Middle Cyclone in my opinion. That is not to say that Neko has lost her sense of adventure in production; cases in point are Afraid (resembles some Middle Cyclone songs) and the joyful closer, Ragtime. The album drifts like Middle Cyclone between slow and fast itunes. This works better on this album than Middle Cyclone, which was in my opinion the main flaw (minor one) on that album. In whole this is a great set. The one sore exception is Nearly Midnight, Honolulu. Besides the unnecessary overuse of the F-word, the song sounds more like an experimental itunes best left for friends having a beer together rather than a tune stuck in between other great (and mostly warm) songs. It could also be slightly longer; thirty-eight minutes of material is rather short. It is a bit tempting ducking a star because of these two aspects. In whole, I strongly recommend this album. Those yearning for a more Fox type of album may be disappointed since it steers more towards Middle Cyclone. Those ready for added warmth from Neko, The Worse. is a treasure.","overall":5,"summary":"The Warmer Side of Neko","unixReviewTime":1380067200,"reviewTime":"09 25, 2013"}

Next to keep the momentum going is Jaheim with this latest effort Appreciation Day, an album that makes the point that the stressed in a song the put out a while in putting that woman first and appreciating all she gives. Not only for the moment, but as time goes on. A very intimate picture is what Jaheim paints with these songs about connectedness, sensuality and treasuring your lady like the gem she is. Like all the R&B; CDs of this year especially this summer, the soul is being restored in R&B.; Time has been reversed to vol' school roots, even if just for a year. Age Ain't A Factor seems like such a great way to kickstart the album in telling that no matter the number your page displays, I love you even more than before if possible. Lines like Like a wine, you get better with time your beauty is rare, and I swear you look better with every year and sexual speak, full figure physique\/These young girls can't compete show this is not exactly for the younger heads unless you are ahead of your time. To truly love someone is to appreciate how they grow and change for the better as time goes on. From there the takes to breaking the perfect man portrait in He Don't Exist and the Shirley Murdock As We Lay-sampled Morning talking of making love until and being on my mind in the morning. Reading your woman like a book with the signs she gives and being in tune with her is the focus on What She Really Means, something us men should pay attention to more. P**** Appreciation Day may be a favourite after listening to the CD. The detail the goes into about the smell, taste and feel of the female morgan is tracy without being tasteless though. Has all the makings of being a late night, candle-burning slow jam. Like how the never says the word, but you know the reference as it's censored in the chorus. Pleading and begging your way back into your woman's heart has almost gotten too cool for school these days, but that's where Jaheim takes it on Baby Xthree. If she's the one, you sometimes got to do such and show her that you care that deeply. For real! The intimate Shower Scene brings a scenery to life vividly again with the details of making love in the shower as water runs over your bodies, but won't get your hair wet (humor for the black woman. DON'T GET MY HAIR WET! LOL). A track that seems out of place but gives the album a grounded feel is Florida, an code to Trayvon Martin. Jaheim places in context as if the is sitting down talking to the state and wondering why no love for your young black kids as Trayvon never got to live out this dream. Love that Jaheim takes upon himself as an artist to keep Trayvon's memory alive and this story a continuing voice. May it be a moment in time we never forget and learn from. When arguments get out of control and words do actually hurt is the basis of Sticks N Stones, getting into how the littlest of fights can tear apart what you try to build. Have to be careful with what breaks your filter and makes it out of your mouth because throwing the one dart to pierce her heart can be the one you regret later on as she gets gone. Chase Forever brings everything to a lovely close in staying after that one no matter how long to let her know she is more than worth your efforts. Jaheim is a long time veteran in R&B;, crooning this way into the ladies' hearts. I've seen him do this thing, but never have I appreciated this gift until buying this CD. Not only does the have a gift vocally but this writing style brings everything to life and gives the album even more light. Touching on all points of a relationship whether in tune, fighting, making love, growing old together gives the album a balanced and well-rounded feel. Absolutely LOVE this CD!!! As I stated in the open, the return of real R&B; is right in front of your eyes from the male side of things thanks to the likes of Joe, TGT and now Jaheim. If you like soul-stirring, touching and emotion-sparking music, add this gem to your collection!","overall":5,"summary":"Jaheim- Appreciate This Gift!","unixReviewTime":1378166400,"reviewTime":"09 3, 2013"}

When \"Mechanical Bull\" came out last Fall, I immediately bought it (as a KOL fan from the first hour), listened through it start to finish once, and immediately dismissed it as disappointing. Then a curious thing happened after seeing them bringing many of these songs live.\"Mechanical Bull\" (eleven tracks; forty-two min.) starts off with \"Supersoaker\" (onest single), which sounds like a throwback to their early days (when they were (incorrectly) branded \"the Strokes of the South\"), and one of the best itunes of the album for me. After a lazy \"Rock City\" we get a much better, urgent \"It Don't Matter To Me\", borderline hard rock, really, but surely another highlight of the album. After another lazy track (\"Beautiful War\"), we get another shot of adrenaline with \"Temple\". After another lazy track (\"Wait For Me\"). wait are we seeing a pattern there?, comes a nice \"Family Tree\". And so it goes. Good track, not so good track, etc. \"Tonight\" is THE best track on there, which sounds like it came from \"Because of the Times\" for \"Only By the Night\". \"Coming Back Again\" is quite nice too. The album closer \"On the Chin\" is the proverbial \"pensive\" ending. (The \"deluxe\" edition adds two more tracks.) Bottom line: this album is up-and-down, with a number of great tracks, but too uneven and hence, IMHO, KOL's least appetizing album to date. (For the record: \"Because of the Times\" remains my favourite KOL album.)I was in Washington DC last week on business, and noticed they played the Verizon Center. On a whim, I went to see them (the arena was nowhere near sold out, it turned out). The band was in great form, blazing through nearly thirty tracks in almost two hours. I have seen these guys in concert many times over the last ten years, and live they still bring it, no doubt. Most interestingly, all eight for nine songs they played from \"Mechanical Bull\" sounded much better live than what you hear on the album. In particular \"Tonight\" and \"Family Tree\" were simply fantastic and blended in nicely with the older songs they played. So in the send, I have become more positive about this album than I was when I first listened to it last Fall.","overall":4,"summary":"Okay album, but it sounds so much better live","unixReviewTime":1393459200,"reviewTime":"02 27, 2014"}
