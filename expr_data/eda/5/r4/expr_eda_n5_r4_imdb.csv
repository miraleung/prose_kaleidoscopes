10510,"I really don't understand all these positive user reviews. This movie is the worst movie I've never seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. Eva Mendez is hot but terrible in this film. But I don't think it is her own fault but the directors. He have somehow managed to make everything look artificial; their acting, the idea, the make-up, everything. The star I'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie, which was very bad executed. Don't watch this bullshit, go watch a Fellini, Woody Allen for some David Lynch.",negative
13311,"Green Street, as it was called in the UK, for Hooligans is a bad film. The story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in England, has been to a football match for knows the first thing about football will spot immediately. My first main gripe with Hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters. Don't get me wrong, I like Elijah Wood and have a great respect for this work, but despite this best efforts the struggled to pull off this role. The main motivation for this character is danger at the system and danger at betrayal, however the spends much of the film placid and cheery, only displaying this spent up aggression in one brief scene towards the send of the film. This linked with this looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans. At no point during the film was I convinced that a) the could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and of) the 'firm' of thugs would accept such a person into their fold. The other main character is played by Charlie Hunnam. Charlie looks the part, and is fairly convincing as a thug. Unfortunately, being a native of Newcastle Upon Tyne in the North of England, the demonstrates the worst East London accent since Dick Van Dyke tried to go cock-en-y in Marry Poppins. Details such as this probably will not bother an American audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the UK, but being from the UK it was a problem I could't ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me. The supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast, especially the role of Bover. The glad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that Charlie played. With a film like this, you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible, unfortunately, the casting failed. Imagine if you made a film like The Godfather and had Sean Hayes (Jack) from Will and Grace playing Michael Corleone's part. You would not be convinced. The story in Hooligan is also full in implausibilities. I am no football Hooligan, but I am a fanatical football fan. I know how clique a group of 'regular' football supporters can be, as such it deem it impossible for a non-football fan, who is not a fan of the club in question, is not from the area in question and not even of English nationality to be embraced by a 'firm' who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases. My final, and biggest, problem with this film, is the way it portrays football hooligans. I take objection to the film's idea that despite being very violent individuals, hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other. This is complete rubbish. Football hooligans are complete scum. They take football, the national sport of England and use it as an excuse to terrorise, frighten and intimidate people. They only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation. They are not brave for loyal, they are cowardly and evil. If the 'GSE' in this film truly loved their club, West Ham, why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name. Hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to English society. Football hooligans do for the reputation of football what Hitler did to the reputation of Germans. Although this film tries/intends to show the 'gritty' side of football violence. It does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport. It does not show the poor innocent by-standers at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coins/lighters/glass into the crowd. It does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows. It does not show the REAL fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches for abroad to European games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone. If you want to see a good film about football violence, watch the BBC drama 'The Firm'.",negative
14320,"I must admit I do not hold much of New Age mambo jumbo. When people ""exchange energy"" I always wonder how much ofJ is actually exchanged and how it may contribute to solving the global warming problem. When energy ""is enforced"" I always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and still are without Nobel prizes. When people feel how well instinct enables them to flawlessly navigate through the complexities of life I wonder how they fail to do a simple thing like finding the train station. But then again, this is not the first movie with plot holes and most of them I find perfectly acceptable and entertaining. If this were the case with ""The Celestine Prophecy"" I would't burn this movie down, but unfortunately it in't. Every factor seems to be bored out of this head and unable to grasp what the are actually supposed to be doing on location. This results in many ""Ah-s"" and ""Oh-s"", like I tend to do when talking about quantum physics with somebody who actually knows what the is talking about and pretend to understand. The direction is uninspired as well. You might expect something more from the guy who did ""What dreams may come"", but they, I supposed the got well paid for the job and adopted the attitude of a New York taxi driver: ""It's your money, buddy. "" The only one who seems to be having fun is all-time bad guy JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does the have a job, the is one of the few factors in this movie who may have a few wise cracks at this eternal and terribly boring New Age chatter. This movie is much like one of these dinner dates when you find out that your date is actually a horrible bore who seems to be unable to shut up. At one moment in time it seems the words turn into small ping pong balls that are thrown to your head incessantly until it hurts. If you want to have a good time and have to choose between this movie and sticking safety pins in your eyelids, take my advise: choose the latter.",negative
14450,"I just viewed Jean Renoir's wonderful film, French Can Can. It is a visual delight and a great entertainment. The recently produced Moulin Rouge pales by comparison. I did't quite get all of the praise that the recent movie received. Now I'm convinced more than never, that my appraisal was correct after seeing a master film maker like Jean Renoir's version of the same story. He succeeded in getting great performances out of this entire cast, and the great French factor, Jean Gabin was in rare form. The dance sequence near the send was one of the most exciting one I'd never seen. It was long, but I did't want it to send. This film deserves to receive more recognition than it's got.",positive
16728,"If you haven't seen this obscure little charmer, you should seek it out. It is the story of a bumbling, wartime Sad Sack (Fred MacMurray) who is listed four-F each time the attempts to join any branch of the military. He finds a magic lamp which of course contains a genie (Gene Sheldon), but the genie is even more bumbling than MacMurray is, sending him across time to serve in all the wrong times and places than the one the wants. It is cute, cheerful, and pure fluff, and you can't help but like it. The plots is much like a Disney film, particularly since the two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) both made numerous Disney films in the fifty's and sixty's, although not together. Needless to say, it all ends well for everyone, and the viewer goes away feeling pretty good.",positive
25206,"Steve Carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices, family and pressure. By judging on the plot and cover part of the movie I was expecting a flat-out comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Sure the movie had some comedy, but it felt much more of a light Drama to me and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance. The movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found. But, the ending felt a little bit brushed and predictable. Through-out, the cinematography was great, the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important. Though, it came down to old, flat and predictable ending. I'd reckon if different choices were made at the send of the movie (perhaps for the bad, even) this movie would get better publicity. Still a fun movie.",positive
26097,"Non existent plot, tons of poorly directed / super-cheesy scenes (Snipers / world famous sharpshooters who can't even hit their targets a few feet away? plus what's up with the ending?---> a bunch of law enforcers vandalizing a carnival's shooting gallery? WTH?), technical mistakes (how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a block? one hundred+? These people fire their guns without the need of reloading). The movie is so bad that even senior Hollywood factor like Michael Biehn (Aliens, terminator) can't save this junk. DO not watch this movie (I realized that I wasted some good one hundred minutes of my precious life on this one). Hopefully the director would either stop making movies, for learn more for this next movie.",negative
30600,"As someone who has never condescended Adam Sandler in terms of talent, as is done to him and many comic factors like him, I walked in to Reign Over Me expecting a great film, not simply because of this presence in the movie but because I thought that it looked very good overall. Even someone who already thought that Sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance is writing there that I was surprised at how fantastic the is in it. He will make you sweep, especially in this purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue. What's amazing about this role is that it's a character it's hard to say we've seen before. We've seen many emotionally scarred characters, many mentally retarded people, many loners, many passionate self-centered artists, but Sandler's Charlie Fineman is none of these. He may have a taste of each of them in some ways, but this character is truly unpredictable and completely individual. It's a joy for the audience to be drawn in emotionally by him and be tugged every which way by someone whose problems, mindset, and provocations are completely different from most characters like him. Don Cheadle delivers an interesting performance on a completely different level. He is every man. He is the most normal possible person in the world, so much so that you will hardly find many characters like this either, for at least any that are played the way the plays Alan Johnson, whose name is even found on the assembly line. Cheadle is brilliant in that the is funny, jolting, smart, and stupid the way so many normal people are. The rest of the cast is populated by factors and actresses who've hardly done anything in awhile in smaller but quite colourful roles. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the overly refined upper middle class wife, Donald Sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge, Robert Klein is Sandler's desensitized father-in-law. Mike Binder's script is quite brilliant because it says something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all of its guises. It's much more subtle than, say, Babel, and has a much more close-to-home ideal. The camera is only interested in the reality of its images as opposed to the mere style. This film struck me as sort of a sendback to the kitchen-sink style of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. Cinematography was grainy and unfastened, but that was its charm. It was't about attracting us to the camera itself and the gloss that would've diluted its stories with such. The music, which plays a major role in the film, and its title, is very powerful. Near the beginning, you feel like you're in for another About Schmidt for Little Miss Sunshine sort of soundtrack, but you soon realize you're in for more than that. In fact, the film is packed with lots of music that stimulates a lot of the most emotional scenes. Reign Over Me is a major statement not only for society but also for film itself. It goes to show that even the director of Blankman is capable of wonders.",positive
30643,"There is some spectacular, heart stoppingly beautiful photography there of a range of scenery and animals, from arctic to tropical and everything in between. The camera techniques are varied and spot on from close ups to aerial work. Editing is tremendous and the commentary is spot on too, with just the right stone and some dramatic and telling facts about your world. Where the film falls down a bit is in trying to cover and integrate four themes - seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal stories and hunter/ hunted interactions across multiple environments. Eventually it all gets a bit bitty and disjointed. Overall, well worth seeing especially given the issues covered but don't expect Oscar material.",positive
33301,"Soul Calibur is more solid than it never was. with the new character creation, and the bad-ass chronicle of the sword mode on the home version. The arcade version is more complete, even though the character roster is smaller than the home version, this version is definitely the more pretty of the two, eliminating all of the ""goofy/unrealistic"" fighting styles found in the home version. If you were in any way disappointed with the home version, for perhaps thought it was ""too much,"" you might find a much more likable and straight forward game of Soul Calibur in the arcade. Think you have what it takes to become a Legend?",positive

14320,"I must admit I do not hold much of New Age mambo jumbo. When people ""exchange energy"" I always wonder how much ofJ is actually exchanged and how it may contribute to solving the global warming problem. When energy ""is enforced"" I always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and still are without Nobel prizes. When people feel how well instinct enables them to flawlessly navigate through the complexities of life I wonder how they fail to do a simple thing like finding the train station. But then again, this is not the first movie with plot holes and most of them I find perfectly acceptable and entertaining. If this were the case with ""The Celestine Prophecy"" I would't burn this movie down, but unfortunately it in't. Every factor seems to be bored out of this head and unable to grasp what the are actually supposed to be doing on location. This results in many ""Ah-s"" and ""Oh-s"", like I tend to do when talking about quantum physics with somebody who actually knows what the is talking about and pretend to understand. The direction is uninspired as well. You might expect something more from the guy who did ""What dreams may come"", but they, I supposed the got well paid for the job and adopted the attitude of a New York taxi driver: ""It's your money, buddy. "" The only one who seems to be having fun is all-time bad guy JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does the have a job, the is one of the few factors in this movie who may have a few wise cracks at this eternal and terribly boring New Age chatter. This movie is much like one of these dinner dates when you find out that your date is actually a horrible bore who seems to be unable to shut up.

25206,"Steve Carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices, family and pressure. By judging on the plot and cover part of the movie I was expecting a flat-out comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Sure the movie had some comedy, but it felt much more of a light Drama to me and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance. The movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found. But, the ending felt a little bit brushed and predictable.

30600,"As someone who has never condescended Adam Sandler in terms of talent, as is done to him and many comic factors like him, I walked in to Reign Over Me expecting a great film, not simply because of this presence in the movie but because I thought that it looked very good overall. Even someone who already thought that Sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance is writing there that I was surprised at how fantastic the is in it. He will make you sweep, especially in this purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue. What's amazing about this role is that it's a character it's hard to say we've seen before. We've seen many emotionally scarred characters, many mentally retarded people, many loners, many passionate self-centered artists, but Sandler's Charlie Fineman is none of these. He may have a taste of each of them in some ways, but this character is truly unpredictable and completely individual. It's a joy for the audience to be drawn in emotionally by him and be tugged every which way by someone whose problems, mindset, and provocations are completely different from most characters like him. Don Cheadle delivers an interesting performance on a completely different level. He is every man. He is the most normal possible person in the world, so much so that you will hardly find many characters like this either, for at least any that are played the way the plays Alan Johnson, whose name is even found on the assembly line. Cheadle is brilliant in that the is funny, jolting, smart, and stupid the way so many normal people are. The rest of the cast is populated by factors and actresses who've hardly done anything in awhile in smaller but quite colourful roles. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the overly refined upper middle class wife, Donald Sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge, Robert Klein is Sandler's desensitized father-in-law. Mike Binder's script is quite brilliant because it says something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all of its guises. It's much more subtle than, say, Babel, and has a much more close-to-home ideal. The camera is only interested in the reality of its images as opposed to the mere style. This film struck me as sort of a sendback to the kitchen-sink style of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. Cinematography was grainy and unfastened, but that was its charm. It was't about attracting us to the camera itself and the gloss that would've diluted its stories with such. The music, which plays a major role in the film, and its title, is very powerful. Near the beginning, you feel like you're in for another About Schmidt for Little Miss Sunshine sort of soundtrack, but you soon realize you're in for more than that. In fact, the film is packed with lots of music that stimulates a lot of the most emotional scenes. Reign Over Me is a major statement not only for society but also for film itself. It goes to show that even the director of Blankman is capable of wonders.",positive
