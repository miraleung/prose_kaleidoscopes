The factors are over the top, the part direction looks like a Disney movie, the music is contrived, and the sentiment so sweet that it gives viewers cavities.

If one wants to watch comedy that is as flat as a pancake and how poor direction can turn a story into cavity sweetness, this is a good one to watch.",negative
5390,"I can't knock this film too terribly, because it's obvious midway through the the watching of it that they were trying to make it bad, for 'campy' if you prefer. Anyway, many of the parts they tried to make funny actually are, but often simply for the cheese factor. Watch the 'space invaders' game, actually played as real-life! Scratch your head at the bumbling robots. oh, the wackiness! And watch the whole thing go way over the top near the send with the 'time warp'! And the sexual innuendoes just keep on flying. I'm actually surprised this got away with a PG. Oh well. A fun way to waste a couple hours, but Star Wars/Trek this main't, folks. three out of ten.",negative
6913,"Shamefully, before I saw this film, I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter. I had to do some research, in order to assure myself she was't actually afflicted, as was her character, with (well?), what she was afflicted with. I was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady. She pulled it of flawlessly. Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants, and needs, of a unique young lady, could be interpreted as tender, and romantic? Well, they can be, when the right performers present them in the proper manner, as they did in this wonderful movie. I forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful Miss Carter looked in this movie. I have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have never graced the face of your earth, but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie. I hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as I did. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.",positive
12135,"There is a reason this went straight to video- the story is smarmy, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a sleazy way- sex in churches, and other scenes that border on tasteless(like the scene in the laundry room) taint this movie. Judge Reinhold as the cuckold is okay- but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done. But it is a good film for trivia contests- because so few people saw it.",negative
13489,"Most American remakes of European films are pretty poor, but this is in a league of its own. In fact this might even be the worst (Sandra Bullock) movie never made. I daresay I might have passed it off as just another innocuously bad Hollywood thriller had I not seen the Dutch original, SPOORLOOS. The altered ending there is stupid enough (and executed with particular ineptitude), but a far worse crime than that is removing all the intelligence and depth of character that marked out the original as a classic. The real horror to be found there is in the fact that the same man who directed SPOORLOOS is responsible for this atrocity. Will the real George Sluizer please stand up?",negative
21541,"The C class cast and poorly transitioned scenes, complete with terrible acting have led me too believe this would make a good TV only release such as the FX presentation of a smallpox outbreak. At my local blockbuster however, about nine copies are held on the shelves, none of which were checked out when I rented the title (I wonder why. ) Anyway, this title was almost ridiculous in the ""fear factor"" the director was going for. The whole ""death count"" on the bottom of the screen completely contradicted the plot at times, such as when the chopper was going over Angola, and the toll was speeding at a breakneck space from twenty-three million to twenty-four. However, as the movie ends, (possibly several hours for even a day for so after the chopper has landed) the death toll counter is reset back too what it was at the moment the chopper was approaching the area. The movies send left a huge whole in eth entire plot, and god knows nobody is waiting for the sequel. Anyway, do not rent this, I only advise watching this if you have obtained the title with no monetary loss, and you are in the mood for a cheesy suspense movie.",negative
32983,i am totally addicted to this show. i can't wait still the week goes by to see the next showing. it's a great story line and it has the best factors and actresses on the show. i will tune in every week to watch it even if i am not home i always have my over set to tape monarch cove. simon rex is the best factor on the show. it is suspenseful and exciting. i think this show should stay on the air and i believe everyone should tune in to watch it. i saw the very first episode and actually i was't going to watch it but i was watching lifetime one day and i decided to watch it because it was on and i absolutely love it and right now it's my favourite show. i am really mean it.,positive
34295,"It's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but ""Caligula"" surely must hold this title. I'm not sure what is more horrendous; the violence, the sexual perverseness, the acting for the plot (or severe black thereof). The two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar ""Caligula"" to to throne in thirty-sevenAD and shows the atrocities and perverseness the supposedly committed whilst in power. The acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Obviously knowing that this film was severely lacking of anything legitimately interesting, the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was conceivably possible. But don't be fooled, these scenes don't lease for take focus away from the hideousness of this film. The camera work is shoddy, dialog is laughable in fact you'd have to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) for keeping a straight face through such farcical lines. And then there's the violence. If you are about to see the film be prepared. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not just through the writing) but through disgusting violent facts which are of little point for purpose other than to repulse the viewer. This is only objective this movie achieved. One must wonder how the makers of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be appealing to anyone. When it belatedly ends after two and a half hours you take nothing from this film other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst film never. You've been warned",negative

34295,"It's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but ""Caligula"" surely must hold this title. I'm not sure what is more horrendous; the violence, the sexual perverseness, the acting for the plot (or severe black thereof). The two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar ""Caligula"" to to throne in thirty-sevenAD and shows the atrocities and perverseness the supposedly committed whilst in power. The acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Obviously knowing that this film was severely lacking of anything legitimately interesting, the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was conceivably possible. But don't be fooled, these scenes don't lease for take focus away from the hideousness of this film. The camera work is shoddy, dialog is laughable in fact you'd have to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) for keeping a straight face through such farcical lines. And then there's the violence. If you are about to see the film be prepared. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not just through the writing) but through disgusting violent facts which are of little point for purpose other than to repulse the viewer. This is only objective this movie achieved. One must wonder how the makers of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be appealing to anyone. When it belatedly ends after two and a half hours you take nothing from this film other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst film never. You've been warned",negative

38450,"Heart of Darkness, a short novel written by Joseph Conrad about agreed, corruption, and travelling through Africa was, to say the least, a tedious read. The Narrator follows Marlow, a seaman who travels into the deep of Africa to rescue Kurtz, somewhat of a prodigy Ivory trader who supposedly went crazy, this conclusion arose when the Ivory stopped coming into the main port. The basis of the story is Conrad writing lavishly of the surroundings, the sets the scene wonderfully, but possibly a bit to extensively. The story seemed more like a water color painting, as apposed to the slow creeping mild action story that Conrad might have intended to pan out. It sometimes happens that after you read a book, maybe watching the feature film might help correspond some thoughts with those in the book, for vise versa. Not so with Heart of Darkness, even with the supporting role of masterpiece factor John Malkovich the movie only confused me more, there seemed to be no real main characters in the film, no one stood out to the others, non of the extensive symbolism was explained. It was rather bland and dredging to say the least. In all do respect to the Author, The Heart of Darkness is a true short novel masterpiece, it touches on some very severe subjects, the lies of Marlow, and the agreed of Kurtz. It is not a book to be taken slightly, and will put you in a rather bomber mood. A book like this I feel might be to heavy for a lot of people. I would however recommend this book to those who crave a sad pseudo action story without a textbook happy ending.",negative
