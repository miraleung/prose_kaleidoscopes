The tragedy of it, is that this fine artistic achievement would prove to be Roy Orbison's swansong. Though Orbison enjoyed a successful career spanning back decades, listening to Mystery Girl you almost sense that the saved this best effort for last. These are songs that sound utterly timeless and universally appealing, and they fit Orbison's voice like a glove. In anyone else's hands a song like the momentous ballad 'A Love So Beautiful' might sound cheesy for mawkish, however Orbison delivers it with such conviction, such sincerity, that you can't help but fall under it's spell. Mystery Girl is spearheaded by three brilliant singles in the unforgettable 'You Got It', the quite wonderful 'California Blue' and the spine tingling Bono-donated 'She's A Mystery To Me'. These singles are indicative of the quality of the rest of the album - such is the consistency of it. Also, miraculously, for an album released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine it escapes unscathed from some of the more dubious production qualities of that era. Quite simply, Mystery Girl is the kind of album that speaks to the heart, and would hold up beautifully in any era, any environment, anywhere in the world. It remains one of my favourite albums of all time, and I would heartily recommend it to anyone.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic material.","unixReviewTime":1062979200,"reviewTime":"09 8, 2003"}

Of course the has written so many great songs that this is simply a skimming of the absolute best songs. I had no real James Brown albums before I bought this one, but I had heard enough of this stuff to know I wanted at least one CD and this is it, this is the best CD there is with respect to this work, and may well be one of the best Soul CDs of all time. I love it because the songs just want to make you jump out of your seat and start boogieing. It really makes you want to dance. It also has very emotional songs that are filled with energy. There are of course the songs everyone has heard from \"Papa's Got A Brand New Bag\" which is an absolute great song that makes my foot tap involuntarily every time it comes on, to \"Get Up\" which has that weird over the top sexual innuendo that James Brown is so good at, to \"Super Bad\" which might very well be the best song on there, \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\" which might be the most well known song. But there are also a lot of songs that are awesome and not heard nearly as much like \"Get On The Good Foot\" with those sexual plays again, \"It's A Man's Man's Man's World\" which at times seems almost to be ironic, and \"Think\" which is an emotional appeal. I highly recommend this CD to everyone! This is the one James Brown CD you have to own. And if you really like this though they have a lot more funk going on I recommend Parliament's \"Best of Parliament\" as well for some more of this funk-soul sound.","overall":5,"summary":"Essential Soul and Funk","unixReviewTime":965088000,"reviewTime":"08 1, 2000"}

I mean, the two albums of this I've heard (Natty Dread and Rastaman Vibration) are both solid works, but I don't really like how the insists on dragging so many early tracks back into the fray. I also find myself scratching my head whenever the involves Rastafari, seeing that I am not a Rasta. But this live album, it's a whole different story. The setlist in't really all that creative (Other than Kinky Reggae and Burnin' `n' Lootin', anyway), but that's what's good about it-just a bunch of Bob Marley classics, no more, no less. Trenchtown Rock is one of this early songs. As I mentioned before, I usually don't care for most of them, but this is really an exception! Then there's Lively Up Yourself, which puts a whole lotta energy into the album. An instantly catchy riff and lyrics about either a) sex, of) partying for pc) riots (depend on who you talk to), this is definetly a classic! The second side does a heckuva job in lining up Bob's three best-known songs (in my opinion, anyway). First, we have this album's president classic, in the form of No Woman No Cry. If the only version of NWNC we had was the Natty Dread take, I'm sure the song would've been forgotten. But this, to use an enormous click\u00e9, immortalized it. Another good tune is I Shot the Sheriff, one of the best-known reggae itunes never composed. Doing away with the funkiness of the original, we instead get a swaggering morgan riff and great backup singers. And, of course, there's Get Up Stand Up. This one's sang almost like a wrap, only about fifteen years before wrap sadly became mainstream. In the meantime, this is a good song. Lastly, we have bonus track Kinky Reggae. A light-hearted romp about sex and ganja, it eventually evolves into a loose jam and an introduction of the band.

For years I have lived with the strange contradiction that one my favorate songs, and one of my most hated have the same name. I just reviewedHoney: The Best Of Bobby Goldsboro. This and the Ohio Players song are two totally unconnected prices of music. But if you enjoy playing as much as I do with extremes, keep reading. Bobby Goldsboro's \"Honey\" is the epitome of clean white pop. Boy marries girl, boy buys girl cute little puppy, boy comes home from work and find girl is a stiff. Did they never have sex before she inexplicably croaked? Listen to the song and you'll highly doubt it. That was in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, and even then the track sounded painfully out of place with the times. Now: fast forward to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, the high of African American funk and up-front sexuality. A perfect example of both is this wonderful album. Look at this cover and you main't seeing how big the tree has grown. Maybe something else is growing from looking at the sleeve photo, but enough said. The Ohio Players actually started as a jazz group. Listen to this album and hear the evidence. This may be funk, but on the steamy title track, \"Love Roller Coaster\" and all the other itunes have jazzy chord changes. The horns, unlike in most funk, do far more than punctuate. They run complex lines that form the bones of these songs. Deconstruct \"Sweet Sticky Thing.\" and the cadences sound like Charlie Parker. Obviously, I was just having fun with this whole Bobby Goldsboro thread, but really, The Ohio Players Honey album is one of the best and most complex funk records of this era. All kidding aside, you really need to get this. And you know the best part. This chick does not die.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic","unixReviewTime":1254873600,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2009"}

I'd say Bad is probably the best way to do it. Released eight years after MJ's debut, Off The Wall, and five years after this massive worldwide success, Thriller, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven's Bad showed that Michael Jackson could survive in the music industry and continue to grow musically and break records. Bad is very different from its predecessor, it's not a total departure from the sound of Thriller but it has a very different sound as well. MJ did not fossilized after Thriller, Bad certainly proves this point. Bad contains many memorable songs from the King of Pop and it's safe to say you probably heard a few of these songs before. Thriller deserves recognition, so does Bad. I'll be honest, as much as I love Thriller and enjoyed it, Bad might just be my personal favourite Michael Jackson album. Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of just about anything the man has done, and I've got to say that Thriller has undeniably Michael's greatest hits and this best-known songs but Bad should not be overlooked. A lot of my favourite Michael Jackson songs are there. There is of course the excellent and catchy title track with a quite memorable video that showed Michael's new \"Bad\" look. Smooth Criminal is one of the highlights of MJ's career; the song is instantly recognizable and to me remains Jackson's best music video! I like the melodic Dirty Diana, MJ sounds so passionate there and I love the rock' in roll guitars thrown in. It's an amazing ballad that impressed me the first time I heard it, I think this song should get more recognition as it certainly deserves so. I like how personal Leave Me Alone is; the lyrics are terrific and show a lot of emotion. The Way You Make Me Feel is a great upbeat pop song, it's another excellent song. Man In The Mirror is one of MJ's most beautiful songs in terms of well. just about anything! Lyrics, music, singing are really powerful. The same could be said for I Just Can't Stop Loving You. Today after hearing so much about Michael Jackson's achievements in the music industry with all the record sales, the awards and current state of record sales it's a little funny to think that Bad was initially considered a failure because it did't match Thriller! Thriller, as you know is the best-selling album of all time it sold over fifty million albums (thought I'm not sure about the exact number, it's hard to say exactly), Bad sold thirty million copies which is quite an impressive feat, however, it did not match the sales of Thriller (and Dangerous while we're at it, which sold thirty-three million copies if I am correct). This special edition of Bad is a neat one because it gives bonuses like interviews and extra material. It's always nice to get extras, especially when you're a fan. As much as I enjoyed MJ's enthusiastic debut Off The Wall when everything seemed possible, the titan that is Thriller, Dangerous and this latter work, Bad is a special one for me, but then again it can be tricky to pick MJ's BEST album (I say enjoy `em all). If you're a MJ fan you should strongly consider (if not buying immediately) add this album to your collection. five\/five, very recommended, excellent album.","overall":5,"summary":"How Do You Follow Up An Album Like Thriller?","unixReviewTime":1287187200,"reviewTime":"10 16, 2010"}

Moore","helpful":[58,59],"reviewText":"If there were any justice in this world, this album would've sold the eleven million copies that Born In The U. S. A. did, due in no small part to its widely misunderstood title track. Alas, as Springsteen proposes on this album, there is no justice. While Springsteen's best-known and best-selling music may always remain this early songs filled with cars, girls, and the dreams of youth, and while that may be the image that most people have of the man, this album is undoubtedly the work of a mature genius. Not since the early Bob Dylan records has the seamy underbelly of the American life been explored so thoroughly and heart-breakingly in popular song. Influenced, obviously, by John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath (actually, the movie adaptation, as one sees in the linear notes) as well as other literary and news items focusing on immigrants, the working class, and the downtrodden - as well as drawing upon previous songsters who have explored this territory, such as Dylan and Woody Guthrie - The Ghost of Tom Joad is a set of story songs, done in the heart-breaking and plaintive way that only Springsteen could do them. The stories are mostly set in California, often near the Mexican border, and involve the deeds of illegal aliens and other working class heroes involved in America's secret economy. Musically, this album is bleak and involved mainly Springsteen alone on acoustic guitar and occasionally punctuated with harmonica, as on this Nebraska album; however, a few songs feature other players, including some intriguingly subtle keyboard work that fits the mood so well you hardly know it's there. Springsteen sings these songs in the slurring drawl that they deserve, paying little heed to pitch for meter, and they can be hard to understand at times. This album does't make for easy listening. One cannot play this as background music, driving music, for at a party like one can many of The Boss's records with The E Street Band: this is definitely an album that you must devote your full attention to. It is one of the few records that truly deserves to be listened to when you're alone at night in your room with the flights off. Be prepared to cry, be prepared to feel your heart cache - be prepared to be moved. One of the true masterpieces of American rock music, and a criminally overlooked record which I hope some day will receive the praise it is due.","overall":5,"summary":"A stark, dark brooding masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1032739200,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2002"}

{"orig_index":22906,"reviewerID":"A129YBX5BVNW2","asin":"B000003BCX","reviewerName":"Mark Barry \"Mark Barry\"","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"Recorded across three nights in February one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-three, \"Night Beat\" is an unusual album for Sam Cooke in that it features slowed-down, paired-back Blues itunes with a slightly Soul-Gospel tint - and man does it work. Originally released September one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-three in the USA on RCA Victor LSP-two thousand, seven hundred and nine - the piano and morgan centre a lot of the songs - each with a midnight-lounge languid feel that suited this voice to a tee. And of the twelve-tracks there's barely a clunker in sight. In fact it feels like you're listening to \"Elvis Is Back\" from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty - an album that's good all the way through - rather than being just patchy. Here are the CD details. US-released in September two thousand and five, \"Night Beat\" on RCA\/Legacy eighty-two thousand, eight hundred and seventy-six sixty-nine thousand, five hundred and fifty-one two comes in a card digipak with an attached eleven-page booklet on the inside (thirty-seven:fifty-seven minutes). The detailed and affectionate liner notes are by noted writer PETER GURALNICK (author of the acclaimed \"Dream Boogie: The Triumph Of Sam Cooke\") while the CD itself rather prettily reflects the original coloured 'Dog And Gramophone' RCA Victor label of the original. BOB LUDWIG remastered the first generation tapes and the sound quality can only be described as BEAUTIFUL. It's always been a famous Audiophile treat on original 'Living Stereo' vinyl (one hundred and eighty-gram reissues of it are available to this day) - but little prepares you for the full range and clarity on offer there. Originally produced to perfection by RCA's president experts Hugo & Luigi, the instruments are razor sharp - as is this angelic voice. His phrasing and holding of notes is classy, effortless and smooth as a newborn's smooth parts. Cooke's voice on this album is fabulous - the stuff of legend - and this CD allows you to enjoy it to the full. Highlights include this own three compositions - \"Mean Old World\", \"Laughin' And Clownin'\" and \"You Gotta Move\" all of which feature the wonderful piano-playing of RAY JOHNSON with BILLY RESTON slinking it up on Organ. There are four Charles Brown cover versions (a Forties & Fifties R&B; artist on Aladdin and King Records) - one of which is the gorgeous \"Get Yourself Another Fool\". The remaster has kept the slight hiss at the beginning and throughout - it's 'not' been compressed out of existence for removed with a no-noise effect - which is good news because it allows the sound to breath - it's 'so' good.\"Lost And Lookin'\" was written especially for Cooke by this SAR Records associates J. W. Alexander and Lowell Jordan and apart from a alone bass line and single cymbal tapping - it's practically Acapella Blues. It's a stunning vocal turn by Cooke. The groove achieved in Willie Dixon's classic \"Little Red Rooster\" (a hit for Howlin' Wolf) is enhanced by Billy Preston wittily gaping the sound of dogs barking and hounds howling on this morgan. The album ends on an upbeat high - a cover of Big Joe Turner's wonderful \"Shake, Rattle And Roll\" - a version that does't dilute down the saucy lyrics of the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-four Atlantic Records original as Bill Haley's Decca remake did a year later (title above).\"Night Beat\" is the kind of album you can play on a Sunday morning and just drift away on its Mad Men cool and Church-like warmth.

Many fans thought this best days were over since the left the Blue Note label but Joe proven them wrong with this beautiful session of Jobim songs. It was originally to be a date with Joe and Jobim but unfortunately, the died of heart disease a few weeks before this session was to take place so Joe was teamed with two rhythm sections. On side one, we have a Brazilian musicians such as Eliane Elias on piano, Dom Um Romero on percussion backing him then on Side Two, American musicians such as Herbie Hancock, Jack DeJohnette and Christian McBride backing him. I prefer the first side since there is an easy flow and empathy between Joe and the Brazilians who intuitively understand the song's rhythms and nuances while the Americans in particularly, Hancock, tend to rush and overplay the songs though \"Triste\" is a nice track. At least they left out the over-played \"Girl from Ipanema\" but I would've like to have heard a version of \"Wave\" which is played less often.

Dirty Money came out when Pimp C was already locked up and it was still a notable release. Let Me See It is the dope opener and Choppin Blades is their code to rims. Look At Me is also noteworthy and the bassline on that song was crazy. Aint That A B**** with Devin The Dude is cool but I done understand why that song is edited. Dont Say S*** with Big Gipp is their rejoined to the haters and the fakers. Pimp C is at this best on Pimpin Aint No Illusion, Take It Off and Wood Wheel. The Duo also gets introspective on us in Dirty Money. Skip material would be Holdin Na with C-Note(boring) and P. A. N****(not bad but the hook was kind of flame). Bottom Line: Dirty Money is UGK's best album until they make another one that tops it. Pimp C did most of the production and it was pretty good and The Duo did their than on the mic. Definetely one of the best albums of two thousand and one. Standout Tracks: LET ME SEE IT, CHOPPIN BLADES, LOOK AT ME, GOLD GRILL, DONT SAY S***, WOOD WHEEL, PIMPIN AINT NO ILLUSION, LIKE A PIMP, DIRTY MONEY and TAKE IT OFF.","overall":5,"summary":"Country Rap Tunes at its finest (4 and 1\/2 stars)","unixReviewTime":1185926400,"reviewTime":"08 1, 2007"}

But that list true. When Drive became successful, this album was already almost done, so please, done accuse them of selling out. Its expirementation, its evolution, and in my opinion it worked out wonderfully. Bands evolve, just like us human beings. If Incubus had decided to make five S. C. I. E. N. C. E's instead of expanding their sound, they would have been long gone by now. Now, onto the review. Musically and lyrically, this album is very diverse. You have your pretty standard, angst type of lyrics on songs like \"Circles\" and \"eleven AM\", but other songs like \"Nice To Know You\" tread completely different territory. Nice To Know You is about Brandon Boyd breaking this farm, and finally regaining feeling in it. Only a band like Incubus could pull off a song like that. Musically, this album is very interesting as well. You have your straight up alternative rock songs like Circles and Warning, but there are also softer, acoustic guitar driven tracks like eleven AM, Mexico and Aqueous Transmission. The latter being particularly interesting, as it contains a 'Kyo-Ku'-an instrument with an interesting sound, that is very foreign to Incubus and rock music itself. Other standouts include \"Are You In\", a very light and calm song that has kind of a jazzy feel to it, and \"Blood On The Ground\". Textbook Incubus, but impressive nonetheless. Overall this is an album that I would recommend to anyone who was a fan of Incubus before and is willing to accept a little bit of change, for to anyone who's a fan of alternative rock. Hightlights: Nice To Know You, Circles, Wish You Were Here, eleven AM, Blood On The Ground, Are You In","overall":5,"summary":"Morning View","unixReviewTime":1105833600,"reviewTime":"01 16, 2005"}

Main reasons that the former flopped are Manny Fresh's beat has not being as strong and solid as they were in \"Tha Block Is Hot\", \"four hundred Degreez\", and \"Chopper City In The Ghetto\", second is Lil Wayne's weak lyrics. Both of those CDs were wack, so I was somewhat reluctant to check out this fourth album. After listening to it the first time, I realized that Manny Fresh's beat is back at the level of \"Tha Block is Hot\", and Lil Wayne's lyric really improved since five hundred degree. Although some punchlines are kind of ambiguous, there are many more that were great, \"Life is a bitch, and death is a husband\". I also noticed that there is a change of style in some of the beats, exp. BM JR. It's a song with Lil Wayne freestyling over the sampled Bone Crusher's Neva Eva beat. Also, you find more refreshing melodies in some of the songs, \"I Miss My Dawgs\" if you listen to the beginning intro melody of that song, you would have thought it was an Eminem joint. One down point is that Lil Wayne still has a rough delivery, other than that, it definitely a MUST COP. Pretty well done overall, Wayne's lyrics were better, Fresh's production is back, worth the money.

Swinney \"Marc My Words\"","helpful":[36,40],"reviewText":"The last time I can remember getting this excited about a musical discovery (I always think they are my secret discoveries and then I go on Amazon and find so many others have had similar personal secret discoveries) was The Samples \"No Room\" and Josh Joplin's \"Useful Music.\" I have had Pinback's \"Summer in Abaddon,\" on repeat play since Amazon sent it may way seven days ago. I really haven't wanted to listen to anything else finding new discoveries and additional players to the music with each listen. These guys are solid musicians and have made some incredibly textured music. I think of albums from my listening history that were the only things I listened to for weeks on send and (this dates me) Utwo's \"Under a Blood Red Sky,\" AC\/DC's \"Back in Black,\" Rush's \"Moving Pictures,\" and REM's \"Automatic For the People\" all come to mind. not to mention Def Lepard's \"Hysteria\" because that one is kind of embarrassing in hindsight. Not that Pinback's music parallels any of those in style for sound but that it strikes a similar chord of repeated listen desire. For those initiated let me take a swag at what this music is about. it is hard to categorize. There is a little of old REM vocal interplay, there's a little of the Clash, a little of the Police in places, some of the Stone Roses vocal styling, and a few of the eighty's pop new wave punk in places. for some reason the Motels come to mind. These guys hail from San Diego and are headed up by Rob Crow, who I've learned in't new on the music scene. Rob Crow has been a part of Pinback for awhile (at least four CD\/EPs) and has been a frontman for some group called Thingy and another called Heavy Vegetable, and yet another called Optigonally Yours. He must be a big fan of one of my favourite bar games. inane creative band names. What makes this music so great? Each song has this repeated flow and has continuity from song to song with uniqueness and originality to each piece. The vocals and instrumentation are multi-layered beautiful and seethe with an understated intensity. It takes the best parts of indie underground and sugar-spun popper and meshes them together into something truly unique and powerful and bottomline infectious. There is so much there. From the opening track, \"non-photo blue,\" and it's Police-like guitar chop, to the Motels\/Berlin Synth and killer refrain of \"Sender,\" to the repetitiveness experimental\/minimalist mathematic and Tripping Daisy vocals of \"Syracuse.\" Then there's the Modest Mouse-ish \"Fortress,\" that belongs on radio play in heavy rotation and on to the head bobbing cool breeze of \"This Red Book,\" sounding like Papas Fritas in places. There's the vocal interplay worthy of the Beach Boys for old-style REM in \"threeXzero\" with some beautiful piano highlighting the up and down of muted picked guitar and bass. It's hard to say they saved the best for last because the album is all so solid all the way through but Pinback caps it with \"AFK,\" that shows some fierceness and pop-punk shouting, \"Protect, Embrace, Engulf, Protect, Enslave, In-love. remember the summer in Abaddon.\"I'm waiting for the buzz to catch up with the brilliance of this music but secretly hoping it can remain my find (and a few others). Word will get out. I used to think the Pixies and Throwing Muses were my finds but others now know and appreciate. Pinback will get some mass recognition. it's unavoidable. Don't take my word for it, stick this one in the shopping cart and get addicted like moi.--MMW","overall":5,"summary":"As excited as I've been about music in a while","unixReviewTime":1108166400,"reviewTime":"02 12, 2005"}

Hell, just to hear her vibrantly soulful vocals further enliven R&B;\/Soul classics like \"Fallin'\", \"You Don't Know My Name\" & \"If I Ain't Got You\" was well worth the money I forked out to purchase this album. \"Alicia Keys: Unplugged\", which temporarily revives MTV's long-gone \"Unplugged\" series, further testifies to Alicia Keys' immense talent as a singer, songwriter and musician. Unfortunately, this album does not live up to the greatness of its two predecessors (\"Songs In A Minor\" - two thousand and one, \"The Diary Of Alicia Keys\" - two thousand and four). That does't necessarily mean that this album is terrible because it's anything but. Alicia Keys consistently sounds as soulful, powerful, emotional and captivating as she's always been -especially on \"Fallin'\", \"If I Ain't Got You\" & \"A Woman's Worth\"- but I was hoping that she'd apply some more creativity and\/or effort into the musical and\/or instrumental arrangements. Apart from the \"the stripped-down \"You Don't Know My Name\" and the insightful soul ballad \"Diary\", which chucks in a laid-back flute, the songs hardly sound any different from their original forms. I guess she preferred to stick to the \"if it main't broke, don't fix it\" theory this time `round. Another thing that I disliked about this album was its black of new material. Yes, lead single \"Unbreakable\" is a beautiful R&B;\/Soul tune, but with all the name-dropping going on in the lyrics, I find it hard to find out what she's really talking about. The only other solid new tune on this sixteen-track-long disc is \"Stolen Moments\", another beautiful R&B;\/Soul ballad where Alicia Keys ponders on the beginnings of her loving relationship and grandly urges to her lover \"lets get away\" over a beautiful assortment of horns, flute and percussion. Apart from hits and songs from her past, as well as a guest-festive celebration with Common, Mos Def, Damian Marley & others on the album-closing tracks \"Love It Leave It Alone\" & Damian Marley's \"Welcome To Jamrock\", the rest of the songs consist of covers (Branda Holloway's piano-driven \"Every Little Bit Hurts\" & \"Prince's \"You Don't Know My Name\"). However, there's no denying the sheer sublimeness and brilliance of her piano-driven duet with Maroon five's Adam Levine on their cover of the Rolling Stone's \"Wild Horses\", which beautifully converts a Rock song into a spiritually exploratory R&B;\/Soul classic. Ditto in terms of brilliance for \"Streets If New York (City Life)\", a stunning piece of deeply thought-provoking poetry over a beautifully arranged melange of moody instrumentals. The final problem I had with this album was with her lacklustre performances of \"Heartburn\" & \"Karma\". It's a shame that she started off a great show on the wrong foot by turning two beautiful songs into vocal trainwrecks, especially after beautifully opening the show with \"Alicia's Prayer (Acapella Intro)\". Nonetheless, this is a great CD and is well worth the purchase, despite its flaws. It's solid proof of Alicia Keys' raw talent to the haters and misinformed individuals who believe otherwise. four stars!","overall":4,"summary":"Another Solid Winner For Alicia Keys, Despite Her Faults!","unixReviewTime":1166054400,"reviewTime":"12 14, 2006"}

Then let 'em go, and grab hold of these guys! Charlie Starr and co. of Blackberry Smoke play music and write songs like the OLD Skynyrd of the 'seventy's! This is REALLY what southern rock is all about! Twin guitars, honky-tonk piano, a solid rhythm section, and Charlie's southern-soaked vocals are kicking some serious butt and taking names. including mine! all These guys rock it up, but they actually (and easily) slip to more of a country sound there and there with great harmonies and all. and there's nothing wrong with that, because they hearken back to REAL country, not the wrap\/metal-infected garbage you hear on country radio these days. I highly recommend this album and their previous effort, Little Taste of Dixie. Both albums are solid throughout, with great playing and great songs! Actually, if you're looking for long jams like the Allman Brothers are known for, you won't find them there, as the songs are their main focus. In concert, though, these guys jam, for sure, so check 'em out when they come around! In addition to catchy melodies and solid, guitar-heavy music, the lyrics in Blackberry Smoke's songs are fantastic!. not the same 'ol fist in the air \"I'm a redneck and proud of it!\" themes that you hear too much of in crappy country music these days. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for southern rock fans!!","overall":5,"summary":"The newest of my favorite bands!","unixReviewTime":1376438400,"reviewTime":"08 14, 2013"}
