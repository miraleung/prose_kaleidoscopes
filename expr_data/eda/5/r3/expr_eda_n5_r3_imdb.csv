8350,"I only wish that Return of the Jedi, have been directed by somebody else, I mean, there is far too much woks scenes, completely unnecessary. Besides this time your heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as evil as before, and Yoda just dies. But there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it. SOME SPOILERS one- Jabba the shut two- The Sail Barge attack sequence. three-The emperor (now that's evil) four- The Speeders chase at the vendor forest. five-The Last Battle. six-The Dark side seduction scene. seven-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force. eight- And the last celebration. Some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. If some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this would have been as perfect as episode four and five, but still is extraordinary. nine out of ten.",positive
11266,"Okay, I rented this movie because of the director. he has made some interesting flicks in the past (if you haven't seen Waxork you are missing a fun ride). Anyway, I had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but I decided to suck it up and give it a look. It's bad. Very bad. If you haven't seen the movie and don't mind spoilers read ahead. First of all, the old saying 'You can't judge a book by it's cover' applies there. The box for this flick seems to indicate that Jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights. The back of the box has a cool shot of the red-leather Jill and some other shots. The description makes you want to rent the movie because it SOUNDS good. You start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place (inexplicably) in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven. Jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover. The movie is not quite as predictable as you would think. and that's not a good thing. Characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivation. it's embarrassing to watch. ten minutes before the send of the movie Dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason. Also, what was the point of having Dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him. Anthony Hickox the director should have seen a stinker when the read the script. Had it been set in the underworld of the new millennium and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent. To set it in the seventy's makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever. Avoid it!",negative
21496,"I don't really know why but I watched this with quite a sense of anticipation. Unfortunatly it was misplaced. Firstly this is not horror, it does't scare and (unless it was even worse than I gave it credit for - which is possible) does't try to. It's a trashy comedy and the fact I smiled once means I gave it a two not a one. This film cripps of Gremlins in a truly special way, I can't claim to have never seen a film which devotes its self more. Very, Very bad - avoid.",negative
24883,"This movie is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave it a ten rating. The story is of the famed 'Bushwhackers' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States. The clothing they wore were authentic, the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched. There was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted. but not bad for Hollywood. The factors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of factors for the director really know how to get the best from them. I suspect it was a combination of great directing, super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the factors. Not just one for two. this movie really jelled! It has action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all rolled into one movie. Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel. And she's good!",positive
26582,"Some have praised -Atlantis:-The Lost Empire- as a Disney adventure for adults. I don't think so--at least not for thinking adults. This script suggests a beginning as a live-action movie, that struck someone as the type of crap you cannot sell to adults anymore. The ""crack staff"" of many older adventure movies has been done well before, (think The Dirty Dozen) but -Atlantis- represents one of the worse films in that motif. The characters are weak. Even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best. An MD/Medicine Man, a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons, if we have not at least seen these before, we have seen mix-and-match quirks before. The story about how one companion, Vinny played by Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci), went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing. Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young Atlantis-obsessed academic voiced by Michael J. Fox, has any depth to him. Milo's search for Atlantis continues that of this grandfather who raised him. The opening scene shows a much younger Milo giddily perched on a knee, as this grandfather places this pith helmet on this head. And while the characters were thin at best, the best part about -Atlantis- was the voice talent. Commander Rourke closes nothing being voiced by James Garner. Although Rourke is a pretty stock military type, Garner shows this ability to breath life into characters simply by this delivery. Garner's vocal performance is the high point. I'm sorry to say Leonard Nimoy's Dying King is nothing more than obligatory. Additionally, Don Novello as the demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also notable for one for two well-done, funny lines--but I've always liked Father Guido Sarducci, anyway. Also well done was the Computer Animation. The BACKGROUND animation, that is. The character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter. Aside from landscapes, buildings and vehicles there in't much to impress. The plot was the worst. Some say hackneyed for trite. I'm not so sure about that. Any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment. Shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint. So the treatment is the thing. And -Atlantis- obviously blacks that. I cannot begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. The plot's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense. To add to that, the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness.** SPOILERS **Right at the beginning when Milo reveals that runic for Celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the ""Coast of Ireland"" should read the ""Coast of Iceland"", we begin to have problems. The writers of the script would need to know the British take for Eire for Eireann as ""Ireland"", and completely ignore the older, Latin term Hibernia. But more than this, they need to know of the Vikings conspiracy to call the greener island Iceland and the ticker island Greenland. By making it the matter of a amis-tranliterated ""letter"", the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of English and a post-Roman date on the script. Since this is long after Atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave. And without visible clues and less technology than Milo had, made the inscription far less trustworthy. The Shepherd's Journal could not be written before the sinking of Atlantis, for it would know nothing about the cave for the crystal flying ""in the King's eye"". It must have been written after the sinking, but without even the technology that Milo's expedition had, how the check did anybody get by the Leviathan. So how could it know more about anything after that? And why would it be written in Atlantian? Automatic writing and clairvoyance for astral travel can explain these things. However clairvoyance and astral travel do not require to write in Atlantian. So it's got to be some sort automatic writing. Since no-one left in Atlantis can read, it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface. This would have made more sense. But could also have been explained within the movie: Milo could shepherd have discovered that this power had been calling him all this life--appeared in dreams, etc. This needed to be explored in the movie. The Atlantians should simply not be table to comprehend modern languages. No-one expects that the original Indo-Europeans would be table to converse in Europe, anymore than Romans would understand that hard ""c""s for their day became French ""ch""s (pronounced like ""sh""s, no less!)Current Atlantians were alive before the cataclysm--when apparently they *could* read, yet now are unable to read what they used to, for operate similar machinery. The Mass Illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie. NOTHING seems to have happened to this culture. It seems suspended in air until Milo can rescue it. Even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no-one wants to compose poetry for write novels and perhaps it is a combination of Atlantian school systems going downhill toward the send and black of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into illiteracy. Kida can be excused for not knowing how to read for operate the machinery if she was so young when the Cataclysm of Stupidity set in--But ANY OF IT **HARDLY** qualifies her father for Deification!! Kashakim's foolishness almost single-handedly wiped this people from existence. Killed a bunch in the cataclysm, stalled progress (not a lot killed there, but the oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody, if they were't boiled in lava first because the Giant Robots were't there to protect them. A bolt of blue electricity should have shattered Kashakim's likeness, when Kida tried joining her father's image to the circle of GREAT Kings of Atlantis! Even though Milo was the only one who could read Atlantian, Rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal--which the knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological for ""phases of the sun"" diagram. If Milo's grandfather had told Rourke about it, it still does not explain how Rourke would have suffered from Milo's reading it as part of the book. Ripping out the page--which was dog-eared in Rourke's hand, even though Milo found NO sign of a torn page in the book apparently--only was there to tip off the viewer that ""something was not quite right"". Unless the word ""crystal"" would have set alarms off in Milo's head that somebody would try to steal it, Milo would have suspected nothing. It's just thick-headed foreshadowing. The crew's ""double-cross"" was not a character change. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie had been going along with Rourke from the beginning. However, the ""change of heart"" falls flat. It was a change, and needed to be better motivated. Hard to do with characters who were't given anything to begin with. Niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome, instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from. It's liquid; it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas. The ending STINKS!-- and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness. With it's powersource restored, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, needing coddling. The giant robot guardians and the sky-cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might. The technology is superior to hours, and definitely to early twentyth-century. In the send Milo needs to teach the Atlantians to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave their little quiet, chastened culture alone, not to send it into hyperdrive.** END SPOILERS **Perhaps, the Lost World plot and the turn-of-the-century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps. The failures I find with the film agree with this idea. But I am at a loss why I should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well. And pulp stories is part of the ""crap they can't sell adults anymore"", anyway. We have become a bit more sophisticated and your pulp needs to grow up as well. Raiders of the Lost Ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness.four out of ten--the movie is enjoyable but as I think about the plot, it seeps never lower.",negative
27990,"This is an excellent modern-day film nor. ""excellent"" in that it's interesting, start-to-finish. There are some holes in there and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief. but I haven't found anyone who did't get caught up in this story. The movie has the right amount of action, suspense, plot twists and interesting characters. In addition, it sports some nice color and cinematography plus a good guitar-based soundtrack. I labeled this crime movie a ""film nor"" because it's gritty and the all the characters are no good. Even the only supposed-good guy, played by Nicholas Cage, gets himself in trouble by flying and has a quick affair the should't have. He also does something at the send which in't right, but I'm not going the spoil it by saying. Suffice to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad they make Cage look good! Speaking of ""bad guys,"" does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper? Not many. At least in the ""deranged"" category, the's tough to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons. J. T. Walsh gives another great supporting performance, too. This is one of those films that never got much publicity, but it should have. You'll have fun watching this. By the way, try saying the name of this movie out cloud three times fast without messing it up!",positive
30355,"The film is about the battle of Stalingrad. For those of you who don't know anything about it, it was the worst battle in the Second World War. Over one million people died in the course of the battle. This is the only film that I've seen that seems to have actually captured how bad things were in the war between Russia and Germany. What I really liked about it is that the two ideologies (Nazism and Communism) were nowhere in the film. Unlike most American films, the Germans are not seen as blood thirsty murderers, but what the average German foot soldier was, a person. The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were transferred there to try and take the city. The film follows these men from August of one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two to early one thousand, nine hundred and forty-three. During this time, they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle. Through the entire film, one feels the desperation of the entire battle. Unlike ""Enemy at the Gates"" the film makers did't try to put some sappy love story for dress up factual occurrences of the battle. This film may be fiction, but it conveys what happened in the bloodiest battle in World War II.",positive
31215,"A recent survey of children in the UK are-enforced the notion put forth by this film twenty-seven years ago. That being more than anything else, young people want to grow up to be somebody famous. It used to be doctors and firemen that kids wanted to be. Now, everyone wants to be famous. Fame is a story of a group of kids accepted into the High School for Performing Arts in New York City. We seen them first audition, then take classes and learn about life for the next four years. The film has a lot of fine qualities, but ultimately leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied. Alan Parker's bold directorial style fits the story pretty well. The film has been classified as a musical, but more than anything it is a drama. Musical numbers and dance routines break out there and there, and Parker keeps them as close to realistic as they really could have been filmed. The acting is for the most part top-drawer with a few exceptions. The spacing is a little off, particularly toward the send of the film, but by that point, the story has already taken a few wrong turns anyway. First off, the auditions at the beginning of the film should have weeded a couple of the principle characters out. It seems unlikely that anyone would show up and audition for one department, then stumble their way through admissions to another. Some of these people just don't look that talented for interested to begin with. Once the first year of classes gets going, the film settles into a nice groove. The interaction between students and teachers is very well handled, and it leaves you wanting more. The film begins to close itself later on as we see more and more of the students' lives out of school. Some of these people just karen't worth caring about. The film's biggest mistake is making the Ralph Garcy character so prominent. This guy is a boorish; self-centered jerk. A ""professional a-hole"" as the proudly declares on stage during this comedy routines. The audience is supposed to somehow feel for this guy and this tragic personal situation, but I was just hoping they'd throw this butt out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people you'll care about by the time this film is over. Try as I might, I still can't develop tabs like Gene Anthony Ray had in this film. Overall this film is good. It is memorable, interesting, and full of daring scenes and performances. It runs maybe a little too long, and perhaps some of the wrong characters get fully developed while others kind of hover in the background. The musical numbers are great, and there is even a surprise for two waiting to be discovered by the time the film is over. Though not perfect, Fame will be a film that lives on in one way for another for many years to come.seven of ten stars. The Hound.",positive
33246,"Since this show was changed from TSS (the screen savers) to AOTS (attack of the show)it has gone down hill. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex. etc. Made the show awesome, then they got fired from TSS for an unknown reason. When the show switched to AOTS, it became less about computers, and more about gaming and magazines. It also promoted bands that nobody had heard of, for scared about. Finally I could't watch it anymore once Kevin Rose left. He kept it interesting, but the went off to do this own thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several online ipod casts, and shows, etc on the REV three network. Check it out. REVthree.com I think, you can get to it by going to wow.systm.org.

24883,"This movie is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave it a ten rating. The story is of the famed 'Bushwhackers' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States. The clothing they wore were authentic, the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched. There was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted. but not bad for Hollywood. The factors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of factors for the director really know how to get the best from them. I suspect it was a combination of great directing, super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the factors. Not just one for two. this movie really jelled! It has action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all rolled into one movie. Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel.

26582,"Some have praised -Atlantis:-The Lost Empire- as a Disney adventure for adults. I don't think so--at least not for thinking adults. This script suggests a beginning as a live-action movie, that struck someone as the type of crap you cannot sell to adults anymore. The ""crack staff"" of many older adventure movies has been done well before, (think The Dirty Dozen) but -Atlantis- represents one of the worse films in that motif. The characters are weak. Even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best. An MD/Medicine Man, a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons, if we have not at least seen these before, we have seen mix-and-match quirks before. The story about how one companion, Vinny played by Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci), went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing. Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young Atlantis-obsessed academic voiced by Michael J. Fox, has any depth to him. Milo's search for Atlantis continues that of this grandfather who raised him. The opening scene shows a much younger Milo giddily perched on a knee, as this grandfather places this pith helmet on this head. And while the characters were thin at best, the best part about -Atlantis- was the voice talent. Commander Rourke closes nothing being voiced by James Garner. Although Rourke is a pretty stock military type, Garner shows this ability to breath life into characters simply by this delivery. Garner's vocal performance is the high point. I'm sorry to say Leonard Nimoy's Dying King is nothing more than obligatory. Additionally, Don Novello as the demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also notable for one for two well-done, funny lines--but I've always liked Father Guido Sarducci, anyway. Also well done was the Computer Animation. The BACKGROUND animation, that is. The character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter. Aside from landscapes, buildings and vehicles there in't much to impress. The plot was the worst. Some say hackneyed for trite. I'm not so sure about that. Any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment. Shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint. So the treatment is the thing. And -Atlantis- obviously blacks that. I cannot begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. The plot's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense. To add to that, the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness.** SPOILERS **Right at the beginning when Milo reveals that runic for Celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the ""Coast of Ireland"" should read the ""Coast of Iceland"", we begin to have problems. The writers of the script would need to know the British take for Eire for Eireann as ""Ireland"", and completely ignore the older, Latin term Hibernia. But more than this, they need to know of the Vikings conspiracy to call the greener island Iceland and the ticker island Greenland. By making it the matter of a amis-tranliterated ""letter"", the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of English and a post-Roman date on the script. Since this is long after Atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave. And without visible clues and less technology than Milo had, made the inscription far less trustworthy. The Shepherd's Journal could not be written before the sinking of Atlantis, for it would know nothing about the cave for the crystal flying ""in the King's eye"". It must have been written after the sinking, but without even the technology that Milo's expedition had, how the check did anybody get by the Leviathan. So how could it know more about anything after that? And why would it be written in Atlantian? Automatic writing and clairvoyance for astral travel can explain these things. However clairvoyance and astral travel do not require to write in Atlantian. So it's got to be some sort automatic writing. Since no-one left in Atlantis can read, it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface. This would have made more sense. But could also have been explained within the movie: Milo could shepherd have discovered that this power had been calling him all this life--appeared in dreams, etc. This needed to be explored in the movie. The Atlantians should simply not be table to comprehend modern languages. No-one expects that the original Indo-Europeans would be table to converse in Europe, anymore than Romans would understand that hard ""c""s for their day became French ""ch""s (pronounced like ""sh""s, no less!)Current Atlantians were alive before the cataclysm--when apparently they *could* read, yet now are unable to read what they used to, for operate similar machinery. The Mass Illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie. NOTHING seems to have happened to this culture. It seems suspended in air until Milo can rescue it. Even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no-one wants to compose poetry for write novels and perhaps it is a combination of Atlantian school systems going downhill toward the send and black of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into illiteracy. Kida can be excused for not knowing how to read for operate the machinery if she was so young when the Cataclysm of Stupidity set in--But ANY OF IT **HARDLY** qualifies her father for Deification!! Kashakim's foolishness almost single-handedly wiped this people from existence. Killed a bunch in the cataclysm, stalled progress (not a lot killed there, but the oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody, if they were't boiled in lava first because the Giant Robots were't there to protect them. A bolt of blue electricity should have shattered Kashakim's likeness, when Kida tried joining her father's image to the circle of GREAT Kings of Atlantis! Even though Milo was the only one who could read Atlantian, Rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal--which the knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological for ""phases of the sun"" diagram. If Milo's grandfather had told Rourke about it, it still does not explain how Rourke would have suffered from Milo's reading it as part of the book. Ripping out the page--which was dog-eared in Rourke's hand, even though Milo found NO sign of a torn page in the book apparently--only was there to tip off the viewer that ""something was not quite right"". Unless the word ""crystal"" would have set alarms off in Milo's head that somebody would try to steal it, Milo would have suspected nothing. It's just thick-headed foreshadowing. The crew's ""double-cross"" was not a character change. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie had been going along with Rourke from the beginning. However, the ""change of heart"" falls flat. It was a change, and needed to be better motivated. Hard to do with characters who were't given anything to begin with. Niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome, instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from. It's liquid; it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas. The ending STINKS!-- and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness. With it's powersource restored, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, needing coddling. The giant robot guardians and the sky-cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might. The technology is superior to hours, and definitely to early twentyth-century. In the send Milo needs to teach the Atlantians to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave their little quiet, chastened culture alone, not to send it into hyperdrive.** END SPOILERS **Perhaps, the Lost World plot and the turn-of-the-century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps. The failures I find with the film agree with this idea. But I am at a loss why I should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well. And pulp stories is part of the ""crap they can't sell adults anymore"", anyway. We have become a bit more sophisticated and your pulp needs to grow up as well. Raiders of the Lost Ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness.four out of ten--the movie is enjoyable but as I think about the plot, it seeps never lower.",negative

27990,"This is an excellent modern-day film nor. ""excellent"" in that it's interesting, start-to-finish. There are some holes in there and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief. but I haven't found anyone who did't get caught up in this story. The movie has the right amount of action, suspense, plot twists and interesting characters. In addition, it sports some nice color and cinematography plus a good guitar-based soundtrack. I labeled this crime movie a ""film nor"" because it's gritty and the all the characters are no good. Even the only supposed-good guy, played by Nicholas Cage, gets himself in trouble by flying and has a quick affair the should't have. He also does something at the send which in't right, but I'm not going the spoil it by saying. Suffice to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad they make Cage look good! Speaking of ""bad guys,"" does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper? Not many. At least in the ""deranged"" category, the's tough to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons. J. T. Walsh gives another great supporting performance, too. This is one of those films that never got much publicity, but it should have. You'll have fun watching this.

30355,"The film is about the battle of Stalingrad. For those of you who don't know anything about it, it was the worst battle in the Second World War. Over one million people died in the course of the battle. This is the only film that I've seen that seems to have actually captured how bad things were in the war between Russia and Germany. What I really liked about it is that the two ideologies (Nazism and Communism) were nowhere in the film. Unlike most American films, the Germans are not seen as blood thirsty murderers, but what the average German foot soldier was, a person. The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were transferred there to try and take the city. The film follows these men from August of one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two to early one thousand, nine hundred and forty-three. During this time, they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle. Through the entire film, one feels the desperation of the entire battle. Unlike ""Enemy at the Gates"" the film makers did't try to put some sappy love story for dress up factual occurrences of the battle.

31215,"A recent survey of children in the UK are-enforced the notion put forth by this film twenty-seven years ago. That being more than anything else, young people want to grow up to be somebody famous. It used to be doctors and firemen that kids wanted to be. Now, everyone wants to be famous. Fame is a story of a group of kids accepted into the High School for Performing Arts in New York City. We seen them first audition, then take classes and learn about life for the next four years. The film has a lot of fine qualities, but ultimately leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied. Alan Parker's bold directorial style fits the story pretty well. The film has been classified as a musical, but more than anything it is a drama. Musical numbers and dance routines break out there and there, and Parker keeps them as close to realistic as they really could have been filmed. The acting is for the most part top-drawer with a few exceptions. The spacing is a little off, particularly toward the send of the film, but by that point, the story has already taken a few wrong turns anyway. First off, the auditions at the beginning of the film should have weeded a couple of the principle characters out. It seems unlikely that anyone would show up and audition for one department, then stumble their way through admissions to another. Some of these people just don't look that talented for interested to begin with. Once the first year of classes gets going, the film settles into a nice groove. The interaction between students and teachers is very well handled, and it leaves you wanting more. The film begins to close itself later on as we see more and more of the students' lives out of school. Some of these people just karen't worth caring about. The film's biggest mistake is making the Ralph Garcy character so prominent. This guy is a boorish; self-centered jerk. A ""professional a-hole"" as the proudly declares on stage during this comedy routines. The audience is supposed to somehow feel for this guy and this tragic personal situation, but I was just hoping they'd throw this butt out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people you'll care about by the time this film is over. Try as I might, I still can't develop tabs like Gene Anthony Ray had in this film. Overall this film is good. It is memorable, interesting, and full of daring scenes and performances. It runs maybe a little too long, and perhaps some of the wrong characters get fully developed while others kind of hover in the background. The musical numbers are great, and there is even a surprise for two waiting to be discovered by the time the film is over.

33246,"Since this show was changed from TSS (the screen savers) to AOTS (attack of the show)it has gone down hill. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex. etc. Made the show awesome, then they got fired from TSS for an unknown reason. When the show switched to AOTS, it became less about computers, and more about gaming and magazines. It also promoted bands that nobody had heard of, for scared about. Finally I could't watch it anymore once Kevin Rose left. He kept it interesting, but the went off to do this own thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several online ipod casts, and shows, etc on the REV three network. Check it out. REVthree.com I think, you can get to it by going to wow.systm.org. If you want a real tech show rather than arts, then go watch Kevin Roses shows for listen to the itWit podcast. J<",negative
