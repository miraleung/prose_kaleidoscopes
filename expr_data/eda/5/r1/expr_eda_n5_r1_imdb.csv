10795,"And I am afraid that I cannot imagine why. It really is a genuinely dire and exceptionally boring film. In some ways it is reminiscent of early science fiction when every set had been knocked up on a Hollywood back lot out of whatever was flying around. From the minuscule and unconvincing set (snipers seem to be about ten meters away) apparently made of plaster, to the factors who are also apparently made of plaster with ""amusing"" stereotypes painted thinly on top, to the oddly warm pool in a frozen cave, to the survival of the cast uninjured when medium artillery shells burst a few meters away on open ground, and finally the awful script that reads like a training manual more than a film. I really cannot say how dull this is. Even the opportunity to see whether the young James Dean survived was't enough to keep me watching for more than an hour. This really is one to be avoided at ALL costs.",negative
11266,"Okay, I rented this movie because of the director. he has made some interesting flicks in the past (if you haven't seen Waxork you are missing a fun ride). Anyway, I had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but I decided to suck it up and give it a look. It's bad. Very bad. If you haven't seen the movie and don't mind spoilers read ahead. First of all, the old saying 'You can't judge a book by it's cover' applies there. The box for this flick seems to indicate that Jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights. The back of the box has a cool shot of the red-leather Jill and some other shots. The description makes you want to rent the movie because it SOUNDS good. You start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place (inexplicably) in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven. Jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover. The movie is not quite as predictable as you would think. and that's not a good thing. Characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivation. it's embarrassing to watch. ten minutes before the send of the movie Dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason. Also, what was the point of having Dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him. Anthony Hickox the director should have seen a stinker when the read the script. Had it been set in the underworld of the new millennium and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent. To set it in the seventy's makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever. Avoid it!",negative
13759,"Daniel Percival's ""Dirty War"", a BBC production made for television was shown recently on cable. The film has a documentary style in the way it goes after the people that caused the near holocaust in one of the big metropolis of the world, London. In fact, this film, produced in two thousand and four is almost a cautionary tale of the events of the following year, in which terrorists set explosive devices in the public transport that killed innocent people that were in the wrong place, at the wrong time. The film impresses for the space the director and the production team gave to the project. There are no dull moments in the movie as we watch the preparation by the terrorists and the people that are following their dirty work. Although the inevitable happens, it's amazing just to think what would be the consequences if a real 'dirty bomb' was planted in such a densely populated area. The last images of the film have a chilling effect. The mob scenes and the way the whole area is contaminated send shivers of fear, thinking how it could possible happen anywhere.",positive
16969,"The Messengers is a bad, generic and boring ''horror'' movie. The film has got a big problem:it does not scare. The performances and the screenplay are totally stupid. It uses old tricks for scaring and all the supernatural events make laugh. I would not call The Messengers as a bad movie. I would call it an accidental comedy because it's so bad that makes laugh. The only good thing about this movie is that it's short, so this crap will not stay with us for so long. There are a lot of masterpieces of horror genre which count with a low budget(like Subject Two,Lucky for May)which are sadly ignored, while this crap is all a success in the box office. So,I do not recommend this weak and pathetic horror film which is called The Messengers.",negative
22824,"I saw this film a few years ago and I got to say that I really love it. Jason Patric was perfect for this weird role that the played. The director? I don't too many things about him. and I don't care. The screenplay is good, that's for sure. In just a few words I have to say about this movie that is weird, strange, even dark, but it's a good one. I saw it a few years ago and never saw it since then. I want to see it again and again. I know that I'm not gonna get sick of watching it. The scenes, the atmosphere, the factors, the story. everything is good. The movie should have lasted longer. I think one hundred and twenty minutes should have been perfect. I was hoping for a part two for this movie. Too bad it din't happened.

39163,"Based on the two thousand and seven spy novel by David Ignatius, Body of Lies tells the story of a CIA operative Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) who is sent to Jordan to track down an Al-Qaeda mastermind, all the while treading a narrow tightrope of loyalty to this Jordanian hosts and this manipulative American boss Ed Hoffman (Crowe). Anybody who's seen the trailers could be forgiven for thinking the story revolves around double-agent action and the betrayal of Ferris by Hoffman, but the actual story is much more mundane. Instead we are served a tepid broth of ridiculous subterfuge as white pretty boy American Ferris moves with virtual impunity through the teeming streets of Amman Jordan with nary a worried look over this shoulder for the attraction of attention from the locals. Only during a scene where Ferris takes this new-found Iranian sweetheart out for tea does reality intrude as the couple are bombarded with glares from Jordanian men. Compounding the film's problems are plot twists and turns which seem designed as nothing more than padding. Ferris flies to Jordan, Ferris gets expelled from Jordan, Ferris flies to Washington, Ferris flies to the UK, Ferris flies back to Jordan, Hoffman flies to Jordan, Hoffman returns home to take care of this kids  an on it goes. This is the sort of stuff you expect to see in an episode of The Amazing Race, not a spy thriller. In body-punishing loyalty to this craft, Crowe gained an impressive sixty-three pounds of flab for the role of portly Ed Hoffman, thus joining the small select club of factors consisting of Robert De Niro and Christian Bale as thespians who've subjected themselves to massive weight again for loss for their roles. It's too bad that everyone else involved did't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on your hands than this sub-par mess.",negative

45690,"An unassuming, subtle and clean film, ""The Man in the White Suit"" is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from Ealing studios. While I suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure, I doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot, the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the film's course. The genuinely great Alec Guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as Ealing's inspired ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" from one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine. This time, the merely plays one character rather than weight, but as the unworldly inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton, the always finds the correct stone and expression. Along with Guinness' subtle, expressive performance, the rest of the cast are effective. Of the main players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger do stand out. Thesiger is compellingly absurd as the crippled but influential business grandee, while Parker is dependable as the ineffectual yet pivotal mill owner and father. Father, that is, of Joan Greenwood, the deftly delectable comic actress, who is at her insurmountable speak in this film. Resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction, she is quite sublime in this film, a fine contrast with the similarly unusual, but more maladroit Guinness. The scene where she seemingly tries to tempt him is played so adeptly by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusing. The themes are handled very effectively, with no easy morals drawn. The complexities of the relationships between science, business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined. Expertly whelmed by Alexander Mackendrick, this film is technically adept in all areas; evocative photography, fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script, all quietly impress. A thoroughly satisfying film, with Guinness and Greenwood magnificent. Rating:- **** one/two/*****",positive
