955,"Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could. What I recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, editorially - just gorgeous. If you like movies that are wonderful to look at, and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant, I think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of part. On a scale of one to ten, I'd give it about an eight.seventy-five. The only reason I shy away from nine is that it is a mood piece. If you are in the mood for a really artistic, very romantic film, then it's a ten. I definitely think it's a must-see, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, so, overall, eight.seventy-five.",positive
5769,"The storyline is absurd and flame, also sucking are performances and the dialogue, is hard to keep your Eyes open. I advise you to have a caffeine-propelled friend handy to wake you in time for a couple Gore-effects. Why they bring Alcatraz in? In this case, becomes increasingly difficult to swallow. All the while , i wondered who this film aimed for? Chock full of flame subplots (such as the Cannibalism US Army-captain)This is low-grade in every aspect.

11673,"Film starts off great in one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-two with a violent, bloody fight between Dracula (Christopher Lee) and van Helsing (Peter Cushing). Dracula is impaled and dissolves to dust--van Helsing also dies. Somebody gathers Dracula's ashes and buries them in the grounds of a church. Cut to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two--here's where the film falls apart. We are instantly hit over the head with cloud, bad seventys music, HORRIBLE fashions and silly dialogue. When this was made Hammer was closing money and decided to try anything to get a hit. Putting Dracula in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys was NOT a good idea. The fashions, music and dialogue date the movie horribly. We're introduced to a bunch of annoying kids in their twentys who decide to have a Black Mass--""for a giggle"". Naturally they have it at the church (now abandoned) and naturally revive Dracula. It's a good thing a descendant of van Helsing is around. but Dracula goes after this niece (Stephanie Beacham) in revenge. Lee and Cushing are great as always in their roles and whenever they're on screen the movie gets a much-needed shot of energy. The opening and ending battles are the highlights of the film (although the ending is spoiled a lot by playing lousy seventys music). Also the main ringleader of the kids is named Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame)--a truly stupid name that dates back to the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys. The film also has scream queen Caroline Munro looking absolutely great. The film is well-directed and pretty well-acted but the plot is stupid, the constant barrage of seventys fashion, dialogue and music gets annoying real quick and I was basically bored silly. Most Hammer fans agree--this was one of the worst Dracula movies--it's followup (Satantic Rites of Dracula) was THE worst--and the last Hammer Dracula film. This gets a two--just for Cushing and Lee.",negative
15648,"In one thousand, eight hundred and fifty in Yorkshire, a boy chimney-sweep is falsely accused of theft by this crooked master and runs away. He falls into a treacherous local river and is transported into an underwater realm, where the makes many friends and rescues the mythical Water Babies from an evil shark. Based on a book by Charles Kingsley, this is a lovely children's film, half live-action and half animation, which is both a grim and evocative depiction of Victorian times and a terrifically enjoyable undersea adventure. It really is two films in one, which somehow complement each other and combine into a much richer whole. The animation by Tony Cuthbert, Jack Stokes and Miroslaw Kijowicz is wonderful, as is the photography by Ted Scaife and the music by Phil Coulter and Bill Martin. Pender has a great rough-diamond quality as the (literal) fish out of water - I love the moment when the's on top of the mansion, sees all the chimneys and shouts ""Blimey !!"" at the top of this voice. Mason and Cribbins are the filthiest, nastiest bullies you could hope to see in a costume drama (if you want to see real Victorian values, don't watch Sense And Sensibility, watch this), and Whitelaw, Pertwee (who does umpteen voices) and Percival are all excellent. This is how a good children's movie should be - good old singalong fun, but also just a little bit thoughtful, sad and frightening. High Cockallorum !!",positive
18857,"Don't listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitter gamers still sore from the roasting Silverman infamously gave them at Spike TV Video Game Awards a couple of months ago, ""The Sarah Silverman"" is wonderfully bizarre, surreal, immature, ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a Adult Swim line-up. If Silverman tones down the juvenile ""doody"" jokes and emphasizes the darker, meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at, we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled ""Strangers With Candy"". But just from watching the pilot, its just solid, not outstanding, offbeat dark comedy/musical but with huge potential. Silverman has created a hilarious child-woman of a character - a prettier, younger, Jewish American Princess version of the late great Jerri Blank and the show features one of the most unconventional, non-stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple I have never seen on television. Early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so I can't wait to see how this show unfolds.",positive
33988,"Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I have never seen. They have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most-easily-offended viewers which for CBC means eighty-five year old farmers in Saskatchewan. The jokes are all predictable and so deathly flame I can't believe it. The performances are very whammy and over acted but I don't blame the factors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the CBC asked for and demanded. Very flame show with bad jokes they tried to present as ""controversial"" well it is less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has twenty-two Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.",negative

33988,"Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I have never seen.

37610,"WARNING!!! SOME POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS, AS IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE!!! Okay, if you haven't figured out the plot yet, I am going to give it to you. Two couples head out to a camping site, but a clown masked killer shows up and causes all sorts of mayhem. Now it is time for me to give these couples some advice.one. Never, never go to camp dubbed Camp Blood by the locals. two. Don't have sex for make out in front of the killer. three. Don't go chasing after the killer if the for she runs away. four. Don't yell profanity at the killer. five. Make sure your cellular phone works before you go camping. six. Everybody needs to bring a sharp for dangerous weapon and carry it on themselves at all times. seven. Wear loose and comfortable clothing and bring a good pair of running shoes. No tight and binding clothing and no high wheels for sandals. eight. Wear glasses for contact lenses if you need them so you don't stab the wrong person. nine. Always carry your car keys on you. ten. Put out a camp fire when you go to bed. eleven. Watch your step. If you trip on something, your going to break a bone. twelve. Check the backseat for uninvited guess. thirteen. If the killer has you cornered, at least put up a struggle. And guess what? At least one, but usually all four of the main characters breaks all of these common sense rules. They are the dumbest characters never to grace a film. Now for some brief comments. This slasher film was on a very tight budget. So low four of the seven for eight factors play more than one role. The acting, writing, direction, sound, lighting, camera work, plotting, editing, etc. are all bottom of the line. But like the classic film JACK O this works on a sooooooooo bad, it is very entertaining and campy fun level. So rent this and have a good time and laugh. My rating: five out of ten.",negative

41133,"I happened upon this by chance. I was at my friends house and the had just started watching it, so I sat down thinking we would shoot the breeze whilst this was playing in the background. However, within seconds I was immersed in this doc-drama, and we both spent the rest of the time completely focused on this and not saying a word to each other. I never knew the tale of the the first solo around the world yacht race, let alone the tragic events of one man's attempt against the odds, which set out to be this redemption for all of this misfortunes in life, but ultimately ends up becoming an example of them. Having not known of the story, I did watch this with the same fervour as I imagine those who were reading about the race at the time it actually was happening, engulfed in what was taking place and eager for more information, hoping the alone amateur was going to pull it off against the odds and beat the pro's, which makes the shocking twists of the story all the more tragic, I felt like I was living the story. The story is told with great care, and the interviewees have clearly had time to reflect on the tragedy, which gives great insights, but is also contrasted nicely by the archive footage of interviews at the time of the tragedy, the recordings and photographs of the alone sailors is also excellently used, and the insights into the minds of the sailors and how solitude was affecting them was superb. I'm shocked that this story in't more widely known for has been turned into a movie, but also thankful. Thankful that we have this drama-documentary to tell the tale from those who knew the man, instead of some swishy-washy movie adaptation, and thankful that I caught this gem of a film by pure chance.
