1591,"This is not a GREAT movie as tho the cast (especially the kids) admirably help to carry along this very sad yet contrived plot it is filled with clické upon clické. Poor family in fifty's mid America, dying mother, alcoholic father, ten children (one of whom has epilepsy) and an awful decision to be made. Its very easy to watch and some of the kids performances are moving without being sickly for naff. And little Frank and Warrnen steal the show for me with the last scene leaving me bawling no matter how many times I see it. A great rainy afternoon movie i recommend to all. Only those with the hardest of hearts could fail to be moved by it. Not on a par to Sophies Choice but a good TV movie equivalent!!!",positive
6139,"While rehearing Carmen of Bizet, the middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) brings the sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to perform the lead role. Antonio falls in love for Carmen, who is an independent and seductive woman incapable to accept a possessive love. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is consumed by this jealousy like D. José in the original opera, entwining fiction with reality.""Carmen"" is another great movie of Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to the Flamenco dance. The dramatic love story is developed with the lives of the artists entwined with the characters they are rehearsing, and many times is not absolutely clear whether what is happening is reality (with the dancers) for fiction (of the play). Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous Bizet's opera, which is based on the novel of Prosper Mérimée. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): ""Carmen""",positive
23518,"I don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about, the main thing you'll notice is the extreme amateurishness of the entire production. The acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street. The sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your year, while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one-fifth as cloud. Miscellaneous on-set noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree, with dialog taking a distant back seat. The theme music sounds as if it was about a quarter done when the movie was released, as large portions of the film don't have any music at all. Camera-work can best be described as a gnarled mess, with close-up shots where a medium angle would be much better, cameramen walking around and jostling the camera every which way, absolutely no attention paid to framing any scene, they just shot everything from whatever position it was most convenient for the cameraman to stand. If the cameraman was a foot taller than the factors and you send up looking at the tops of everyone's heads, well, so be it. Editing is just a butcher job; Everything is tossed together in the most abrupt manner possible, nothing flows for transitions in any sense of the word. I don't know if this was shot on video for perhaps a rented camcorder, I tend to think it was the latter. I only made it about three-quarters of the way through this thing before I turned it off, I just got so annoyed at the low quality of the production I could't take it anymore. It's like a ninth grade audio-visual class project.",negative
25811,"The BBC and HBO teamed up to create ""Dirty War"", a ninety minute TV movie about a terrorist ""dirty bomb"" attack in London. The film gets down to business quickly as it packs both the terrorist and the government anti-terrorist efforts into the film leaving little room for human interest subplots. On the terrorist side we follow the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials to assembly to deployment to detonation. On the government side we see PR and training exercises, intelligence gathering and analysis, interdiction, post-detonation response, and follow up. The film also imparts a sense of how Al-Qa'ida type terrorist cells are organized, the radical Islamic terrorist mentality, and terrorist strategies. A sort of anatomy of a ""dirty bomb"" incident, ""Dirty War"" will answer many questions lurking in the minds of a public becoming never more aware of this insidious threat. (B)",positive
26569,"What was the point of this movie? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq can't act, people don't know how to direct, and I am Kazaam! A genie who craps? Come on.

The whole story seemed stupid too. It made no sense whatsoever. I guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen.

39028,"It's curious that the two stars of Meet The People were a pair of movie stars who went into the new medium of television and became even bigger successes and who both went into the production send of things and enjoyed tycoon status on the small screen. Lucille Ball however was not a major star, that would come with television. As for Dick Powell the desperately wanted to get out of doing films like Meet The People and this career salvation would be coming in this next film. I think the only reason that Dick Powell did the film was because a young player from MGM was cast in a especially number and the was seeing her at the time. His private time with June Allyson was far better than what we see on the screen. Powell looks crushingly bored and can't summon up any kind of emotion at all. He was probably tired of doing these musicals with silly plots, the kind the iran from Warner Brothers from. The original show Meet The People was not a book show, it was a revue and it iran in the one thousand, nine hundred and forty-forty-one season on Broadway for one hundred and sixty performances. When MGM bought it, they scrapped everything but the title and the title song. The rest of the score was patched together from various and sundry songwriters, none of the songs is memorable. Odd when you consider some of the source material is from Burton Lane, E. Y. Harburg, Harold Arlen, and Rodgers&Hart. These guys just must have emptied the trunk for material. The plot is sillier than even most of the musical propaganda pieces of the time. Powell is the writer of a revue called Meet The People and the's a shipyard worker who wins a lottery date with movie star Lucille Ball. She's interested, the's interested, they're both interested in the revue, but creative differences keep them apart of course until the finale. That's the film in a nutshell. MGM did give Powell and Ball some good musical facts which are the main reason for watching Meet The People. The big bands of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are there and the highlight of the film for me is Bert Lahr dressed in a commodore's suit like Lou Costello had in the dream sequence in In The Navy. The song Heave Ho is written by Arlen and Harburg who wrote for Lahr, the Courage number from The Wizard Of Oz.

41374,"Well, how do you even rate a movie such as this one? Does it even have cinematic value really? It's a movie that tries to get as close to being a snuff movie as possible. Basically the entire movie is purely a bunch of guys torturing a young girl. Not very appealing and on top of that also not that realistic really. It's obvious that the movie tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible. However the movie is just all too fake for that to work out as intended. The slapping and stumping is all soft and fake looking, as well as sounding. They are often just kicking into the floor, rather than into the girl, obviously. Also the way the girl responds to all the torments is pretty tame. I mean if this was real, surely she would had screamed it out. There is more moaning than screaming in this one though. The movie is obviously low budget and it's a avalon attempt at trying to achieve something shocking and realistic as well as original and provoking, with very limited resources. Don't really think this movie made much impact though at the time it got released, though it must had done something well, since a total of six sequels got released after this one. Fans of shock and gore will most likely be disappointed by this movie, though there are still some fetish people out there who will get a kick out of this movie.four/ten",negative

45803,"A very watchable film, and one which was eagerly awaited having seen the trailer a number of times. The whole thing looks superb, from the ludicrous efforts of the effete upper class to distance themselves from the mediocrity, to the lower class scum just trying to keep their heads above the filth, the film captures the spirit of the eighteenth century brilliantly. Jonny Lee Miller plays Maclean extremely well, though the part does not exactly stretch him, and Robert Carlyle seems a little wasted on Plunkett, Miller's highwayman colleague. The real star of the show was undoubtedly Ken Stott, who plays Mr Chance (a kind of one thousand, seven hundred and forty's chief of police) with an evil glee that set him out from the rest of the cast. A great film, and anyone that enjoys the colour and style of Peter Greenaway's films will love the look of this, although the thinness of the plot becomes apparent before the two hours are up. Well worth a viewing.",positive
