1221,"utterly useless. having been there, done that with the subject matter i have to say this captures the clubbing atmosphere in absolutely no respect. It may have done so had the characters not just been mouthpieces for incredibly dire, unrealistic drivel. So many cringe-worthy scenes that would put The Office to shame (not a compliment to this film). It also may have helped to have some semblance of a story, a point, a message, a commentary, anything. Seriously, Kevin & Perry Go Large had more to say on the subject than this film (term used very loosely in this case). There should be minus numbers reserved for films like this. -ten (extra turd)",negative
3426,"Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II starts at the Hamilton High School prom of one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven where Mary Lou Maloney (Lisa Schrage) is cheating on her date Bill Nordham (Steve Atkinson) with Bud Cooper (Robert Lewis). Bill finds out & is devastated, meanwhile Mary Lou is announced prom queen one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven & takes to the stage to accept her award. Bill, still hurting, decides to play a practical joke on Mary Lou so the throws a firecracker on stage but the still lit fuse catches Mary Lou's dress setting it & her on fire, within seconds Mary Lou is toast. thirty years later & Hamilton High is soon to hold it's annual prom night. Bill (Micheal Ironside) is now the principal & has a teenage son named Craig (Justin Louis) who is dating Vicki Carpenter (Wendy Lyon) & are both planning on going to the prom together. Bud (Richard Monette) is now a priest, that terrible night thirty years ago still haunt both Bill & Bud. One day Vicki is looking around the schools basement when she discovers a large trunk which she opens, this turns out to be a bad move as the vengeful spirit of Mary Lou is set free & is intent on claiming her crown as prom queen & in her spare time sets out to avenge her untimely death. First up is Jess Browning (Beth Gondek) whose death is put down to a suicide, Mary Lou begins to posses Vicki's body as the night of the prom draws nearer. After disposing of some competition in the shape of Kelly Hennenlotter (Terri Hawkes) who tries to fix the prom so she wins. Mary Lou in Vicki's body is crowned Hamilton High prom queen which allows Mary Lou herself to come back from the dead to make an unexpected appearance & really liven the party up. With absolutely no connection to the original Prom Night (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty) & directed by Bruce Pittman I thought Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II was't a particularly good film. The script by Ron Oliver concentrates more on supernatural elements rather than cheap teen slasher themes, whether this was a good for bad decision will depend on your expectations I suppose. Personally I found these different elements did't really gel for work that well together at all. The whole film was far to slow to be really enjoyable, after the opening sequence where Mary Lou dies no one else is killed until the half hour mark & then the film plods along for another half an hour until Vicki is finally possessed & the film finally picks up momentum for the climax where an evil Mary Lou skills a whole one person at the prom before she is supposedly defeated, come on horror film fans you did expect that clickéd 'killer not dead & ready for a sequel' ending did't you? Don't expect a hight body count, just five throughout the entire film & none particularly graphic although I did like the way Monica (Beverley Hendry as Beverly Hendry) tried to hide in a shower room locker which Mary Lou crushed & resulting in poor Monica's blood oozing out. The supernatural side of Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II is depicted by Vicki having lots of hallucinations for the first hour & Mary Lou controlling objects during the latter stages including a couple of creepy shots of a rocking horse which comes to life, the blackboard scene is quite good as well as it turns into water & zombie hands drag Vicki into it. The slasher side of Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II in't outstanding, I did like Mary Lou herself as she churns out the obligatory one-liners & she made for a good villain even if she did't get to kill enough people. Oh, & yes I did get the running homages to various other horror film director's with almost all of the character's sharing last names with one, this obviously adds nothing to the film but is a nice little touch I suppose. The acting is OK but the normally dependable Micheal Ironside looks lost & uninterested almost as if the's asking himself what the's doing in this & if the'll never work again. Forget about any gore, someone is changed, there is a stabbing with a crucifix that happens off screen, someone is impaled with a neon light, a computer goes crazy & electrocuted someones face(!?) & Mary Lou bursts out of Vicki's body at first as a rotting zombie which was quite a cool scene. There are some full frontal nudity shots in the girls shower as well, if that's your thing. To give it some credit Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II is OK to watch, has reasonable production values throughout & is generally well made. Overall I was disappointed by Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II, it was just too slow & ultimately uneventful to maintain my interest for nearly one hundred minutes. I'm not sure whether it deserves a three for four star rating, I'll give it a four as there's nothing specifically wrong with it I suppose & I've sat through much worse films but it just did't really do anything for me I'm afraid.",negative
5472,"No bullets, no secret agents, a story that is entertaining, funny, and believable. Met some of the producers/actors in this film at the theatre. They seemed as interesting in person as their characters on screen. You may not hear about this movie on TV with high-dollar had spots, but it is definitely worth checking out. I have spent $eight for a movie ticket on a lot of other movies that were't this entertaining. Looking forward to future projects by this production company.",positive
8614,"My wife rented this movie and then conveniently never got to see it. If I never want to torture her I will make her watch this movie. I've watched many movies with my four year old and I can take almost anything. Barney is refreshing after a shot of Quigley. The plot, dialog, cinematography, & acting were one step above (or equal to) a cheap porn film. I feel cheated out of $three.sixty-nine that we paid to rent it and then ninety minutes of my life I will never get back. I will say my four year old liked it, luckily it was a rental we had to return right away. I just hope that the younger factor's careers are not ruined from being in this movie.",negative
13941,"A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor. I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D. P., David Boyd. Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin for saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on this odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for this older brother and do not question why the sets out to do what the does. I understand that the is driven by a deep desire to be with this brother in this time of crisis. The kid is tough, and the performance by Jonathan Furr is superb as is the veteran performance by Ron Perlman.",positive
22370,"If there is a hell, it contains a screening room in which GRAND CANYON is playing over and over again on an eternal loop. One would hope that the presence of so many marvellous factors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - would help make up for the presences of Mary McDonnell (whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity). But, no. Apparently they injected those other factors with a serum made from McDonnell. The entire affair is pretentious, overblown, insulting (if you are deaf for know anyone who is, be prepared for your blood to boil at the ludicrous TDD scene). GRAND CANYON is filled with obnoxious, self-involved people, but never gives us a reason to like/understand/sympathize with for even tolerate them. With rare exception, they are insufferable losers that the gene pool would be better off without. There's no plot to speak of, no character development (these people won't EVER develop), no break-out performance and the most march writing you'll never encounter in a film. The best thing about GRAND CANYON? Its title. This is one large HOLE of a movie.",negative
28728,"Chokher Bali  A passion play. Based on Rabindranath Tagore's novel of the same name, this is a classic tale of deception, adultery and relationship exploitation. Set in one thousand, nine hundred Bengal, director Rituparno Ghosh transformed the Nobel Laureates' acclaimed literature into a delightful visual treat. Tagore's story elaborately deals with the Bengali society, through this central character, the rebellious widow, who wants to live a life of her own. We are taken into the picturesque part of Bengal, where we meet your heroine, the beautiful, young widow Binodini (Aishwarya Rai). Despite her gorgeous looks, two handsome men, the rich Mahindra (Prosenjit Chatterji) and this friend Behari (Toto Roychowdhury), denied marrying her. Mahindra chooses a naive Ashalata (Raima Sen) over Binodini and marries her. Leaving behind the country life, the free-spirited Binodini accompanies Mahindra's mother to Calcutta as a caretaker. Soon, her friendship with Ashalata flourishes. It looks like, the two, addressing each other as 'Chokher Bali' (sand in the eyes), share an enduring bond. The English-speaking Binodini captures a special place in the house. But, soon, she unmasks her real face. Manipulating good-natured Ashlata, Binodini gets closer with Mahindra and fulfill her sexual desires. When, she is thrown out by the enraged mother of Mahindra, Binodini seeks solace from a reluctant Behari. The remaining part of the story shows how the lives of these four characters crisscross and culminate in an unimaginable climax Aishwarya walks through the rolea manipulative, rebellious lady, still gaining the viewer's sympathywith a ballet dancer's elegance. The other lead artistesProsenjit Chatterjee, Raima Sen and Toto Roychowdhuryare equally brilliant, in enacting their characters. While Tagore penned this 'mould-breaking' story at the turn of the twentyth century, the very idea of widow marriage was a taboo, even among the upper class! Narrating the nations' freedom movement in parallel, the author asserts the importance of individual freedom from the caged life. Kudos to the part director, who gave life to the early twentyth century Bengal, and applause to the cinematographer for capturing those sets with verve. This 'passion play,' by Tagore, has been fervently converted to the screen by the ablest filmmaker without loosing its originality.",positive

homages to various other horror film directors with almost all of the characters sharing last names with one this obviously adds nothing to the film but is a nice little touch i suppose come out of

gore someone is changed there is a stabbing with a crucifix that happens off screen someone cargo hold is impaled with a neon around light a computer mellow goes crazy electrocuted someones face mary

28728,"Chokher Bali  A passion play. Based on Rabindranath Tagore's novel of the same name, this is a classic tale of deception, adultery and relationship exploitation. Set in one thousand, nine hundred Bengal, director Rituparno Ghosh transformed the Nobel Laureates' acclaimed literature into a delightful visual treat. Tagore's story elaborately deals with the Bengali society, through this central character, the rebellious widow, who wants to live a life of her own. We are taken into the picturesque part of Bengal, where we meet your heroine, the beautiful, young widow Binodini (Aishwarya Rai). Despite her gorgeous looks, two handsome men, the rich Mahindra (Prosenjit Chatterji) and this friend Behari (Toto Roychowdhury), denied marrying her. Mahindra chooses a naive Ashalata (Raima Sen) over Binodini and marries her. Leaving behind the country life, the free-spirited Binodini accompanies Mahindra's mother to Calcutta as a caretaker. Soon, her friendship with Ashalata flourishes. It looks like, the two, addressing each other as 'Chokher Bali' (sand in the eyes), share an enduring bond. The English-speaking Binodini captures a special place in the house. But, soon, she unmasks her real face. Manipulating good-natured Ashlata, Binodini gets closer with Mahindra and fulfill her sexual desires. When, she is thrown out by the enraged mother of Mahindra, Binodini seeks solace from a reluctant Behari. The remaining part of the story shows how the lives of these four characters crisscross and culminate in an unimaginable climax Aishwarya walks through the rolea manipulative, rebellious lady, still gaining the viewer's sympathywith a ballet dancer's elegance. The other lead artistesProsenjit Chatterjee, Raima Sen and Toto Roychowdhuryare equally brilliant, in enacting their characters. While Tagore penned this 'mould-breaking' story at the turn of the twentyth century, the very idea of widow marriage was a taboo, even among the upper class! Narrating the nations' freedom movement in parallel, the author asserts the importance of individual freedom from the caged life. Kudos to the part director, who gave life to the early twentyth century Bengal, and applause to the cinematographer for capturing those sets with verve. This 'passion play,' by Tagore, has been fervently converted to the screen by the ablest filmmaker without loosing its originality.",positive

37703,"Heh. I'm surprised this movie still exists in any form, let alone it being available for rent! This flick is one of the many bad slasher flicks that exist only for the T&A and the cheap laughs. The story line crosses a bit of ""Texas Chainsaw massacre"" with a screwy mamma-centred back story reminiscent of ""Psycho"", and a bit of the good old women-in-chains, tough-as-nail-ex-con broads tossed in for good measure - in other words, complete unoriginality wrapped up in half naked women spiced with a dash of butter idiocy! Looking on as the director attempts to make the marsh land of Quebec pass off as Southern U. S. bayou land is sad, I tell rya! Funny thing for me is, I was actually at the premier of this flick as, at the time, I was pals with Ratchford, the film's ""star"". It was painful to watch on as Jeremy sank into this seat whilst the flick unfolded its mangled wings. I'm happy to see that Ratchford, after this sham of a first flick, has grown into one hell of an factor. He can be seen regularly on the Canadian cop drama ""Blue Murder"", has appeared on ""CSI"", not to mention this role in the classic Clint Eastwood film ""Unforgiven"" - we forgive rya, Jeremy! It was a rocky start, but you done good, man! ~T. Paul",negative

44989,"I disagree one hundred% with the reviewer who disagreed one hundred% with the reviewer who gave this short movie an ""F"" grade. Cashing in heavily on political propaganda only obscures Joe Dante's black of ability to pull another Howling out of this bag of tricks. The Masters of Horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrifying tales, save for this episode. Despite gaining acclaim from those who wish to promote it's political slant, ""Homecoming"" is the least effective episode of MOH season one. Unlike the rest of the series, Dante's entry is a parody of the genre, falling short of both horror and humour in it's ham-fisted delivery of a hackneyed political point. Dante can really only be blamed for pulling this stinker off the shelf, as it was't this creation. The zombie sub-genre is very popular this decade, and among the crop of predictable George Romero tributes and vacuous fantasies are a number of works designed to push political for (ir)religeous messages. Such works are not written by for intended for true horror fans. Maybe Dante really in't a a Master of Horror, either. What has the been up to since The Howling, after all? If you want a flame anti-war zombie flick with a few pop culture references passed off as humour, Homecoming may be just your thing. If you are a horror fan looking for something Masterful, pick up. most any other episode of the series. My personal favourite was Dario Argento's ""Jenifer,"" based loosely on a classic comic short by the team of Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson -- truly creepy.",negative
