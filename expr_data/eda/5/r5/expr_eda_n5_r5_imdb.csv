6108,"this was the most pointless film i have never seen as there was no plot and the factors did not seem to care. ninety% of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever, i laughed so much my ribs began to cache. the bit where the old men when to capture Robert Duvall was ludicrous. on a directorial level making a nor film does not involve lots of training sequences and pointless closeups on the main character. this is a failed attempt to create a nor thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. seeing as this was based on a 'manuscript' by john Grisham i do not count this as one of this book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as 'the firm' for 'the rainmaker'.",negative
20898,"The 'sixtys is an occasionally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. It is extremely uneven, and includes many annoying elements. Take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. If done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it. The acting was't extremely bad for a made for TV flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent, and ending up being confusing. How did this family somehow send up being at many of the big events during the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's? The ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the send. I would advise you to not waste your time on The 'sixtys and do something else with your time. I'm glad I watched this in class, and not on my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice, and stay away from this.",negative
22950,"I am looking at all the good reviews about this film and I start thinking to myself. Am I going crazy. ? Can't I see the beauty from a film like this. ? Am I just dumb enough to NOT understand the message this film is trying to point out? I don't know. maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and date all my brains as well. The film idea was going nowhere. I was sure it would have a foggy send, and of course. it did! Nothing exceptional. Not even the landscapes (I chopped that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice. but no). Just a flame story about a crazy teacher, and of course her crazy students. now all grown up, each of them. with this/her own fixed ideas. And boy some of those ideas were stupid. like the lizard story for example. At a moment I thought I was watching of files. with the lizard entering in the year and all. No. from my point of view this movie is a waste of time (not to say money if U pay for the ticket) The only part that I did like was the acting of the young blue eye ""german"" kid. He played very well and convincing for this page. The rest. nothing! I read the previous review and I think the script writer and the director were both on drugs when they came up with those ideas. Well considering that there are a lot of people that enjoyed this film. I think to myself again. Maybe I am the crazy one. Advice. Don't waste your time with this!",negative
23813,"Historically awful. Scarcely an accurate moment in four hours of ridiculosity. One cannot keep track of the inconsistencies while watching. As with all track and filed movies, nobody bothers to ask for any track consultants. Events and techniques that were't even created until the next century are shown. From the shots of runners jogging in a four hundred meters to the highly overweight factor portraying the high jump and long jump winner, one would have to know absolutely nothing about track to even be mildly entertained. Likely thrown together in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four as a tribute to the games just prior to the LA Olympics.",negative
25825,"Hollywood has made a lot of strange movies over the years, but none stranger than this. WHY this movie got made I will never know, nor how Paramount could have thought it would sell any tickets in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven. It is the strangest mix of genres I have seen in a long time, a movie that truly does not know whether it is trying to be a serious war drama for a Viennese operetta comedy. It tells the story of a British spy trying to get a poison gas formula out of Germany in the days just before WW II began. Ray Milland, a fine factor, is stuck playing the part like an escapee from Monty Python, all very exaggerated English prep-school dialogue. In Germany the meets a gypsy, Marlene Dietrich, who helps him to travel under cover as, of course, another gypsy. She plays her part like the typical Viennese operetta gypsy caricature, as do the other ""gypsies"" in the movie. But there are also Nazis, who are not funny at all. And then Milland finds the is starting to think like a gypsy, and that is not treated as a joke. Sometimes the music is for a light comedy, sometimes for a drama. Every time the Nazis show up, the film score plays Wagner, which is funny by itself. This movie could have been a comedy, for it could have taken the plight of the gypsies seriously and done a serious job of showing how the Nazis treated them. Both are hinted at in this movie, but neither pursued. What we are left with is a truly strange amish-mash of genres that must have embarrassed everyone (except the director) involved. Bizarre.",negative
32013,"This movie is so bad, they would't buy it back at my local used CD/DVD store. I only own it because it came in a box set which I bought for the masterpiece ""Deadfall"". The store bought back the other two movies I was selling from the four disc set, but they would't buy back Underworld, and those other two movies predefined rank, so what does that say about this movie? So I tried to sell it back to another store, that even bought back budget DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they would't buy back Underworld either. This movie is bad on every level, and is one of those that came out in the post-Tarantino-clone glut of the mid ninety's. The only slightly redeemable element is Dennis Leary telling Joe Montegna, that the's a ""stinky friend"" and calls him ""Mister Stinky Friend"". That line is so delightfully horrible, that I can't help but quote it at least once a week when describing a stinky friend. But now that I've enlightened you with that quote, you don't have to go thru the spain of watching this movie.",negative

32013,"This movie is so bad, they would't buy it back at my local used CD/DVD store. I only own it because it came in a box set which I bought for the masterpiece ""Deadfall"". The store bought back the other two movies I was selling from the four disc set, but they would't buy back Underworld, and those other two movies predefined rank, so what does that say about this movie? So I tried to sell it back to another store, that even bought back budget DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they would't buy back Underworld either. This movie is bad on every level, and is one of those that came out in the post-Tarantino-clone glut of the mid ninety's. The only slightly redeemable element is Dennis Leary telling Joe Montegna, that the's a ""stinky friend"" and calls him ""Mister Stinky Friend"".

41629,"Having read Diamond's book, I was slightly disappointed in the series, but all in all, it is quite informative. Reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work, seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' under every drug. Is Diamond a little preachy ? Sure. Like a lot of academics, the sees this theory as the most important thing never. He uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series. We get it, after about the first ten minutes. Is Diamond a little simplistic (in the series) ? Sure. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly amusing, condensing some very long, complicated history down to 'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about fifteen minutes. But the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute (but not totally define) the reasons for the Spaniard's success against the established cultures. Is the preaching *against* Western Civilization in any way ? Nope. Not a word. Not to my year. All the says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly, *not* that luck is the only reason. In the send, if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you.

44810,"My partner and I sat down to watch this film over a bottle of wine last Saturday and although we initially had your reservations once the story got going it was in actual fact rather gripping. The scene in which one of the characters in brutally murdered by knitting needles was particularly shocking and echoed the work of Korean new wave auteur Park Chan Wook. The weapon of choice was a particular masterstroke and allowed us to see into the psyche of 'Granny', heavily altering the connotations of a loving, warm Grandmother into a murderous shag. The dialogue was incredibly moving and lyrical in expressing the innermost paranoia the protagonist. Pavlosky's selections of mise men scene furthermore enhance the unnerving and magical atmosphere of the nights events, combining with the Oscar worthy performances to create a chilling and thought provoking masterpiece.

Leland slowly discloses this sad vision of world, showing that the is a sociopath.""The United States of Leland"" is a depressive and interesting study of a character. The low paced riveting screenplay discloses pieces of the story like a puzzle; there are excellent lines and dialog; the performances are great, although the twenty-three years old Ryan Gosling does not convince as a fifteen years old teenager; but it seems that a part is missing to complete the puzzle and make ""The United States of Leland"" an unforgettable movie. The disappointing clarification of the ""why"" for the violent action of Leland against Ryan Pollard is not convincing for touching, indeed shows that this character is a totally deranged sociopath with a weird and sick sight of world.
