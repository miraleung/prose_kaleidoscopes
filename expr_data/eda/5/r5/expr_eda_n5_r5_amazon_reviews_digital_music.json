I had previously bought the less experimental \"Black Moses\" album and I was impressed with this skills, but it is this album that cements him as the Stax counterpart (and even precursor in some sense) to Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder of Motown since they all contributed their skills to revolutionise the genre from pop hit machines to an hartford. And check out that cover; I'm sure some less knowledgeable people would be easily fooled into believing it was R Kelly! The orchestration on this album is impeccable, especially on the opening \"Walk On By\" and the two middle tracks are equally excellent. It is a different story for \"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\". It is not just excellent, it is mindblowing. Isaac 'sets up' the song. He just keeps talking and talking, telling us the story of how the man in the song got to this position. Then suddenly, when you think the could keep talking forever, the begins to using; and it is one of the most magical moments in music history. Not one for the road (you'd probably [anger] all the people who find the songs too long) for one for a party, but definitely one wyo enjoy by yourself for with someone you love who hopefully has a deep appreciation for great music.","overall":5,"summary":"A Long Time To Phoenix (But Worth It)","unixReviewTime":1035417600,"reviewTime":"10 24, 2002"}

Ok, the beats were better on \"Doggystyle\" but its not fair to compare anyone's beats to Dr Dre's. Besides DJ Pooh (who produced most the album) did a very good job. The one thing I did't like about Snoops onest one was that none of the songs had any personal meanings. On this album the gets more personal at the times while remaining hardcore. Also think about what the had just gone through. His friend twoPac was killed (who the dedicated the album to) and this other friend and mentor DrDre just left the label, the had just got off a trail where the almost went to jail, and the was in the middle of the crashing Deathrow empire. But the still put together a great album. The album starts with the title track switch is a great song. This one was produced by Daz and its very good. \"Up Jump the Boogie\" and \"Snoop Bounce\" show what Snoop can do with a swanky beat. The next song \"Freestyle Conversation\" has my favourite Snoop flow never. Hes just wrapping real fast about random stuff and is undicribable. One of my favourite wrap songs. \"Gold Rush\" is a great song with Kurupt on it who always makes the best songs with Snoop Dogg. It has a western film fell to it. \"Me and My Doggz\" is another one of the swanky songs on this album. \"You Thought\" is another good song with some smart and funny lyrics. Strong beat too. \"Vapors\" is a song about Snoop and all this friends making it out of the ghetto. This is what i mean by the album is more personal. Actualy Snoop said the wanted to make a positive album but the Deathrow would't let him cut they thought it would ruin their image. \"two thousand and one\" is great song and is one of the standout tracks. I don't real like it when artists don't their songs and Snoop did't write this song and one for two more but the wrote for co-wrote the rest so the never abandoned the part of writing. I love \"Sixx Minutes\". Its always been one of my favourite songs on the album. its very calm and quite. Its kinda about how everyone tried to steal this style after this onest album. \"Wake Up\" is another good one and has Tray Dee who is now in Tha Eastsidaz now. \"Snoops Upside Ya Head\" is another great song with an exeptionaly catchy chorus. \"Doggyland\" is another good one with a unique sound. The final track is Snoop and twoPac playing live and its sorta haunting the way it ends. you'll see if you get it. Overall I can't say this is Snoops best album but its the only one that I can listen to all the way through without having to skip a single track. Overall its well worth having. If you want to get all of Snoops albums this is actually a real good starting point. Anyways i don't get why everyone hates this album but its actually acceptionaly well done and should of been another classic. Now that it's been are-released you can get it much cheaper than before.","overall":5,"summary":"Underated as Hell","unixReviewTime":994204800,"reviewTime":"07 4, 2001"}

It's the first punk record: abrasive, uncompromising, dirty, violent, and unpretentious. Iggy Pop alternates between a nasal drawl and a jagged bark. Ron Asheton's guitar completely obliterates everything in its path. This is what rock in' roll was meant to be, and it has everything that rock lost when it became a marketable commodity. It's sloppy and filthy and perfect. You know that a record has to be great when even a \"ballad\" like \"Gimme Danger\" rocks harder than the entire output of most modern punk bands.","overall":5,"summary":"The First Punk Record, In My Opinon Anyway","unixReviewTime":1092873600,"reviewTime":"08 19, 2004"}

There was a time, which I really appreciated and craved about in my reviews, when Amazon had actually stated in writing, it would do everything in its power to provide the free auto trip should it become available. This time, when I called, I was informed no way could I get it (this happened once before but a supervisor overturned the customer service clerks decision, so I asked to speak with her supervisor. She never did allow me to speak to one but after guaranteeing they would refuse, she came back on line to say this would be the last time it would happen. I must say I was disappointed they had changed their policy on the free auto trip and I will never order a cd without it again. I can get the cd cheaper elsewhere most of the time (without tax being added) and not deal with crude customer service people who vow you cannot have what has always been given with courtesy. For all of you who counted on getting the free auto trip when it would come available, you can now forget it according to the information I was given. It is a shame they have given us the free cloud player and free auto trip to it when available, but now, if you do not see it when you order, they have told me you will not get it even if you paid the same amount for more. Too bad for the consumers. I am one who was very disappointed and told her I would not order music without it being offered on ordering any longer.

Jay-Z's retiring, twoPac and Biggie are dead, and Eminem's busy with this stuff.\"Get Down\"- One of my favourite songs. He tells a story from a court hold up to a fight with this cousin.\"The Cross\"- A daring chorus(\"I'd carry the across, if Virgin Mary had an abortion), but none the less is a tight song. Eminem produces.\"Made You Look\"- An old school battle song for your generation.\"Last Real N*gga Alive\"- An autobiographical story of the beefs that the's had.\"Zone Out\"- A poor song that does't fit the album at all. Bravehearts need two give up.\"Hey Nas\"- An okay song featuring Nas' future wife Kelis.\"I Can\"- A good, catchy song for the kids.\"Book of Rhymes\"- An interesting song. He's basically digging through this book of rhymes and wrapping some of them.\"Thugz Mansion(N. Y.)- Basically the same as the Pac version with Nas on it, except Nas makes the mistake of taking off one of Pac's verses and adding one of Nas'.\"Mastermind\"- A cool fight song produced by Alchemist I think.\"Warrior Song\"- A good song with a sung chorus by Alicia Keys.\"Revolutionary Warfare\"- An old school feeling with guest wrapper Lake.\"Dance\"- This is a song no one can hate. A beautiful dedication to this deceased mother(it made my from cry the first time she heard it).\"Heaven\"- A fast paced song that kinda sounds like Christian wrap with cuss words. This album is as close as you will get to a classic these days. With all the Chingy's, Murphy Lee's, and Ja Rule's around, it's good to hear a tight record from an artist who's actually been around and knows what the hell the's talking about.","overall":5,"summary":"WOW","unixReviewTime":1089504000,"reviewTime":"07 11, 2004"}

{"orig_index":42040,"reviewerID":"A2GVJ83F092MIS","asin":"B00008VOQM","reviewerName":"J. Hayes","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":". thanks to an outstanding debut album that has turned out to be one of the best that I have purchased this year. The songs there vary from a faster tempo and being more upbeat to the later tracks that slow it down a little. Fever to Tell has a raw garage sound to it which is a big plus, and singer Karen O switches between singing, screaming and moaning very well and I think the vocals are my favourite part of this cd. What troubles me is that most of the bad reviews I have read on there say \"Maps sucks so the rest of the album must suck as well\". Dont review something if you have no idea of what you are reviewing, leave it to the jones that have listened to the whole album. Okay now that that is out of the way, I have to say that while Maps is a great song and fine selection for a single, it is not the best that is there. Date With The Night and Black Tongue are really good, but equally good are the slower tracks Y Control, Modern Romance and a hidden track after that one. This cd is great and it will be interesting to see how the Yeah Yeah Yeahs progress in the future. If you like the garage rock sound the this is worth a listen, and Karen O is a great vocalist so that only makes it better.","overall":5,"summary":"They will be around for a while...","unixReviewTime":1088640000,"reviewTime":"07 1, 2004"}

Hypnotize partially redeems the project with a generally stronger set of songs, but releasing the new material on two albums has had middling results at best. Like all double albums, this material could be boiled down to an incredible single album, but as a double it's just bloated and unfocused. Eliminating stone-cold garbage like \"Cigaro\" and \"Old School Hollywood\" from Mezmerize, and \"Kill Rock in' Roll\" and \"She's Like Heroin\" from Hypnotize, would have made SOAD's recent product look much more focused and hard-hitting. As for Hypnotize itself, SOAD's strengths are exercised a little better this time, especially in a commanding trio of tracks in the center of the album \u2013 \"Tentative,\" \"U-Fig,\" and the band's most haunting look yet at the Armenian genocide of the early twentyth century, \"Holy Mountains.\" Unfortunately, the momentum is then broken by the stupid \"Vicinity of Obscenity.\" Of course, the band uses such nonsense as an artistic statement, and they've even done it successfully in the past, but there the point just does't come across. Meanwhile, the useless \"Lonely Day\" proves why SOAD should not be doing ballads, though the full version of \"Soldier Side\" can nearly match \"Aerials\" as the greatest of SOAD's powerful slow-burners. But the overall lesson of this double-album project is that the efforts of SOAD (and particularly Daron Malakian) to expand their sound are not leading to true advancements, with a real shortage of their former triumphs in breakneck songwriting and fearsome chops. Malakian has learned respect as an outstanding songwriter, but in this baffling drive to advance this own less-than-stellar skills on vocals and guitar, the is egotistically wasting the incredible talents of this bandmates. The relentless rhythm section of Shavo Odadjian and John Dolmayan has been pushed to the background, while Serj Tankian is now crushingly underutilized. Metal singers who can truly using are terribly rare these days, and Tankian's incredibly inventive phrasing and terrifying delivery make him one of the best never at forcing the listener to really think about what the's doing. It is downright insulting to watch Tankian be reduced to a fraction of lead vocals, and to have to listen to him singing backup to the far weaker vocals of Malakian, whose whiny and greedy voice is seriously damaging the power of SOAD's material. In the future, Malakian must retreat back to this score strengths as a songwriter, so the band as a whole can exercise its incredible power once again.

I tend to notice that fans of Thrice's first three records who haven't appreciated anything after are either predominantly for exclusively into metalcore, and not much else. Not that it's a bad thing and you don't have to like this, but I feel that with a band like Thrice what makes the new stuff great is that this degree of experimentation is SINCERE, what they WANT TO make. They could try to impress you but that may also mean they'd go in a way that fans of more artistic music would be disappointed. And many records have different points of view. Heck, I'm not even a fashionable Thrice fan in the least. Bands I hold in similarly high regard include Depeche Mode, the White Stripes, and NIN who have nothing in common (and several others). Well, what's \"The Alchemy Index\"? It's a highly ambitious records that gives you EXACTLY what it sells. The record admittedly isolates itself, which stops it from being their best yet, but is still fine enough in its own right. The fire disc kicks off with \"Firebreather\" which is a more straightforward song of the group, although some noticeably interesting things are in the mix like the intro and the group vocals towards the send. Oh, and Dustin is still a great lyricist did we forget. There is some of the stuff that's still pretty heavy even if it's not the crowd-pleasing variety. Possibly a good start for some would be \"The Flame Deluge\" which kind of balances the feel of both albums yet has an intensity you'd generally expect from a Dillinger Escape Plan release. Oh, and the ending is just gorgeous I may add. I tend to really like the third track \"Backdraft\" with its acoustics and soaring chorus and it's really unlike anything I've heard before. It's still just as breathtaking as it was the first time I heard the song. \"Burn the Fleet\" shows the hot side at perhaps its most melodic and it works pretty well. The chorus is pretty memorable as well. The second disc, Water, is the less rocking one but no less good. It goes in many sides of the facet and is great chill out music as well. It does't sound like the Postal Service, contrary to what some are saying there. \"Digital Sea\" and \"The Whaler\" drip in their synthesized electronics and the instrumental of the former actually reminds me a bit ofKid A's \"Idioteque\" in some ways, although this is probably more tuneful than the other. Then you get the real relaxing stuff like \"Open Water\" which is just beautiful and every time I keep coming back to the song. It's not even close to where the send of the greatness is. \"Kings Upon the Main\" is just incredible a piece in how melodic it is; as cheesy as it sounds, it's like hearing a taste of heaven for me. It's just that well done and melodious. \"Lost Continent\" has its nice share of rhetoric in it and has Dustin's lyrics in top form. It's probably what will (sonically) get the band compared to Coldplay, but it's not like that's really such a bad thing. \"Night Diving\" is a nice delve into post-rock realms and works incredibly well. It admittedly sort of repeats after awhile but I really have no problem with that. While it may seem like a mood piece, the songs are definitely there and can make up for whatever flaws are supposedly there. I cannot wait to hear what the band has for its next instalments, ready for an April release. The album is an experiment and an honest one, and who can't respect that! More to the point the music is exceptional and the songs sound just as good the time that I saw them live (which was't long ago). I would hate to sound so hasty to music that's as exceptional as this and really most of their work. I may send up as one of the \"few\" but can truly enjoy the records, and while [[ASIN:BfiveYTRR Illusion]] andThe Artist in the Ambulanceset a high ceiling, it's since been outpeaked withVheissu(my all-time favourite album) and now this one, too. Music fans deserve to get a shot of a band that's as talented and intelligent as Thrice. Too bad some people can't listen to them for the intended reason, but music's an acquired taste. And I kindly ask you retrograders, \"Wouldn't it be more objective to have any taste of the style the band's playing? Then you'll be taken more seriously!\" There's plenty of albums of two thousand and seven that I've heard (over twenty-five, even) and I've gotta say that this is the best one I've heard all year, and Modest Mouse used to be my favourite one.","overall":5,"summary":"Breathtaking","unixReviewTime":1195689600,"reviewTime":"11 22, 2007"}

As many know, there have been rumours floating about the various things that this song is about. I wanted to research for myself because the truth seeker in me wanted to know the true meaning of the song after I read both the positive and negative reviews for this song. The positive news is that it is a fact that this song implies a pleasing sexual relationship with excellent sex that is always going to be happily permanent in someone's mind. I got this information from songfacts.com, where it quotes the lead singer (Caleb Followill) directly stating in the September nineteen, two thousand and eight issue of The Sun newspaper that this song is about (in Caleb's own words: \"It's about a great sexual relationship with hot, hot sex that you remember for never.\") Many who read this review are going to correctly argue that the lyrics in the song are very obvious (and straightforward) that it is about good sex in an equally fun sexual relationship. However, it was important to me to share where I obtained my information for anyone else that wanted to find the meaning of the song straight from any articles that ask the direct source (the lead singer Caleb Followill), and because of the rumours flying around regarding the song's meaning. This song has very strong guitar riffs, and I enjoyed the daring lyrics that were utilized in the song (such as when the sings about what the pictures happening when the is driving). The video is very good as well. The obvious way to decide if you are going to want to buy this song is if you are comfortable and fine with listening to a song that illustrates the fun and good side of a strictly sexual relationship of how it feels to have sex with someone who is talented in giving such pleasure (in addition to liking rock music). I say this only because the best way to tell if you are going to enjoy this song is if you are open-minded to listening to the fun and joyful side of what it feels like to be in what is strictly a pleasurable sexual relationship.","overall":5,"summary":"Hot Sex On Fire","unixReviewTime":1293580800,"reviewTime":"12 29, 2010"}
