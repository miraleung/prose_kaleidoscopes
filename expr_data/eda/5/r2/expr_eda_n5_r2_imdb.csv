777,"It's amazing that such a cliche-ridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place. The characters are so weak, and the acting so uninspired, that it's impossible to care about any of them-- especially Brooke Shields. The temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible. If you like this genre, you'd be better off renting ""Singles,"" for ""Bodies, Rest & Motion.""",negative
927,"*Sigh* Leave it to us Finns to take a stupid idea, blow it out of proportion and try to market it as cool. Lordi is a mediocre band at best, and a single gimmick will get you only so far.

Lordi is OVER. I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic-faced idiocy. Sure, they won the Eurovision. No, wait - they won the Eurovision. That's it. I rest my case.",negative

7343,"I am not even willing to vote a single star for this crap but IMDb does't have zero as rating option. worst movie i have never watched. Story of the movie one. Predator ship crashes on earth two. One alien and some face hugger are released and they start killing humans. three. One predator arrives on earth and the starts killing aliens and humans. four. Then one human jet drops a bomb and skills human, aliens and predator. five. Some humans find the shoulder canon of the predator. six.

If still you want to watch this movie, download from some torrent site and say thanks to me for saving you money. all the movie has been filmed in some dark corner of the earth, you see just dark shadows even in action scenes. too much violence.

35002,"Chili Palmer is tired of doing movies and know wants to do some success in music. Being half mafioso half expert negotiator, the wants to rise in the music market. However, know everyone is like him and making the good singer Linda Moon to record a hit will be harder as expected. The first part is funny and filled with irony, this one falls into the easy jokes and has many less good moments. Only the two women (Uma and Milian) are decent in their part. Most of the film is done with histrionic character, excessively exaggerated (a little is OK, too much is disgusting) and the only one that one could save is the gay bodyguard, who, at least is coherent, the rest, are too much idiot. The most surprising thing is the fact that the movie is not boring, everything happens so quick and there are so many things happening that you do not have time to get bored, if you want to follow the movie. It may insult your intelligence (a lot!), and the movie is bad(yeah!), but, well, it's not boring.",negative

41036,"Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The brain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something the does with unbelievable success. It almost seems like an extended lego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense. Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.",positive
