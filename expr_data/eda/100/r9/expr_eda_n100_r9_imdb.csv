91,"If you came there, it's because you've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it. I feel for you, I *really* do. And I profusely apologize as a Canadian (because that's what we do) that this film never had to across your eyes, if only for a moment. I hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases. I, like everyone else, rented this movie believing it to be some stupid B-movie ripoff of Blade. I thought, ""sure I could use a good laugh at a stupid movie."" I'll give the creators of this film ONE positive comment about their 'creation': Thanks for removing the REC XX/XX/XX from the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. I can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie. And for the record, I *saw* the movie, but did not watch it. The dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer, I swear to God. You know what? I'm not writing anymore about this. It's just too painful.",negative
151,"This movie is a perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran that of Olivier and Malikka the perfect cheating wife role of Lane. They have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the Indian masses. Even then the movie has got the full traces of Unfaithful, though it could't catch up with the original. It was a cheap soft porn of the Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer. In the future if the Indian Directors plan to remake a English movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the Indian Censors. Though the film bombed at the box office, the factors got the undue recognition. In future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a Oscar nominated film. All said, this is not a family film, so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family.",negative
1022,"You remember the Spice Girls movie and how bad it was (besides the songs), well their manager Simon Fuller (also this band's manager) makes the same error putting S Club (another of my favourite bands) in their own film. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermole?) basically ask their boss for a break, they go on, and while there they see themselves on TV! Three of them swap, and vice versa, half discover they are clones made by a greedy scientist, and the other half just get themselves in trouble. Also starring Gareth Gates as a clone of himself. This film may have more of a plot than Spice Girls' film did, but besides the songs ""Bring It All Back"", ""Don't Stop Movin'"" and ""Never Had A Dream Come True"" this is no goo reason to see this film. Not too long after the band split for good. Adequate!",negative
1028,"Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today. With this hyperactive spontaneity and this rubber face the can just go crazy, and we love him for it. He has the ability to make mediocre comedies (ala Ace Ventura), and turn them into decent comedic outings. Or, in the case of 'Liar Liar', make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around. Carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas. He was excellent in both 'Man on the Moon' and 'The Truman Show.' The guy is remarkable. Then comes 'Bruce Almighty,' an ideal vehicle for Carrey, and a premise that should have worked; Carrey, after complaining about God and how this life stinks, is enabled with God's powers. However, the script is pure recycled garbage. Now, no matter how bad a script is, Carrey's improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny. The problem is that there are very few opportunities for Carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects, only some of which are amusing. Carrey is rarely table to improvise because the has to work around the special effects. The writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny, because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving Carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humourless. He seems more like a five-year yearning for your attention, wanting the viewer to find what the is doing funny, when it's really just annoying. I have always enjoyed Jennifer Aniston on 'Friends' and she was superb in last year's 'The Good Girl.' She too has a gift for comedy, but with the script as linear as it is, she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend. She comes across as nagging, grumpy, and there is no chemistry between the two stars.'Bruce Almighty' should have been a comedy that works. But it does't even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it's making fun of; religion. A few minor giggles (his internet is Yehweh), but instead it's just turned into a comedic superpower comedy. Not to mention that it's stone shifts from silly to heavy-handed, and even black comedy at times. The movie fails on nearly every level. That's not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs, but it's close. Any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog peeing to get it's laughs has problems. But they, if you find pee jokes funny, go for it.",negative
1798,"""Laugh, Clown Laugh"" released in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-eight, stars the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito has raised a foundling (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) to adulthood and names her Simonetta. Tito has raised the girl in the circus life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina. While Chaney gives this usual great performance, I could not get past the fact that Tito, now well into middle page, has the shots for the young Simonetta. Although the is not her biological father, the has raised her like a daughter. That kind of ""ick"" factor permeates throughout the film. Tito competes for Simonetta's affections with a young and handsome 'Count' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls for the young man, but feels guilt about abandoning Tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I find it amazing that no one in the film tells Tito what a stupid old fool the is being (until the reveals it himself at the send). The film is noteworthy only because of Loretta Young, who would go on to have a great career. While I adore Chaney's brilliance as an factor, this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy.",negative
1945,"""Intensive Care"" by Dorna avon Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies never made. This extremely cheap Dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations. A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted as as Professor Bruckner. The acting is abysmal, the action is slow and the climax is laughable. A famous surgeon has a car accident. He lies in a coma seven years and then the wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage.""Intensive Care"" is clearly influenced by American slasher films including ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the thirteenth"" series. The killings are hilarious and the dialog are painfully stupid. Still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look. You'll laugh until it hurts with this one-you can believe me!",negative
2207,"Man, what a scam this turned out to be! Not because it was't any good (as I was't really expecting anything from it) but because I was misled by the DVD sleeve which ignorantly paraded its ""stars"" as being Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Sure enough, their names did not appear in the film's opening credits, much less themselves in the rest of it!! As it turned out, the only movie which connects those three factors together is the equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five)  but what that one has to do with THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER is anybody's guess Even so, since I paid $one.fifty for its rental and I was in a monster-movie mood anyhow, I selected to watch the movie regardless and, yup, it stunk! Apart from the fact that it had a no-name cast and an anonymous crew, an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most I could do with it is laugh at the JAWS-like pretensions and, intentionally so, at the irresistible antics of two moronic layabout-cum-boat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on. The creature itself  a plesiosaur i.e. half-dinosaur/half-fish  is imperfectly realized (naturally) but, as had been the case with THE GIANT CLAW (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven) which I've also just seen, this did't seem to bother the film-makers none as they flaunt it as much as they can, especially during the movie's second half!",negative
2506,"Spend your time any other way, even housework is better than this movie. The jokes karen't funny, the fun rhymes that are Dr. Seus karen't there. A very lousy way to waste an evening. My kids four-sixteen laughed a little at the beginning the younger jones got bored with it and left to play Barbies and the older jones left to play upstwo and surf the net. My wife left and did dishes. So I finished it alone. It was the worst ""kids"" movie I have seen. If you want to watch a fun kids movie watch Shrek two, that movie is fun for kids and their parents. AVOID THIS MOVIE. It in't funny, in't cute, the cat's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label.",negative
2581,"Well, where to begin? I guess I can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed. Call me ignorant for not knowing of Schneebaum's book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that I have been living under some kind of a rock, but don't blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this ""documentary"" is actually a companion to said book. Yeah, I felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why I sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a ""Modern Cannibal Tale."" I mean, am I a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes? I certainly did't expect an hour and forty-five minutes of one old geezer kissing this own ass by whining about every little detail of this dull and worn out life. I certainly did't expect the insipid directing and I most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at Tobias Schneebaum and all of this off-putting glory. Schneebaum is indeed unlikable. The old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of this even though the in't even that interesting a character to fill a story. Oh really? He was a cannibal? Ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding Schneebaum's dirty past. The only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when Tobias finally breaks this little silent treatment about what happened to him in Peru and say that the had ""a small piece."" That's it, folks. Ninety minutes of bull later and Tobias Schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches. It's like calling a movie ""The Life Of A True Don Juan"" only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when the once played ""just the tip."" Unbelievable. The directing is, indeed, superbly ghastly as there is no flow for rhythm to the story that is being told. Alright, I understand that I did't read Schneebaum's volume before watching this celluloid tale of it, but I can still recognize some bad spacing and even worse editing. One minute Schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next the's going on and on about how the can't drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative for some failed and miserable saga in this life. I mean, Jesus, can you at least islam this back story to the first part; follow up with some stuff covering this homosexuality and then send it off with a hearty look into this visit to Peru? Also: I don't particularly care much for Schneebaum's insipid little quips on life and living, but I at least implore the old man to keep consistent with this ramblings. If I hear a guy talking about how the prefers life in the jungle I don't expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later. Absurd. Another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which your hero has appeared. While some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story, the director has overused the gimmick and broken this entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reels. The bottom line, there, is that Tobias Schneebaum is a fraud. Pure and simple. I know that I haven't read the book, but I'm still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own. This documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an david fan of Schneebaum's work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a DVD. Schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy, striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that this story is remarkably sun-riveting. If you're looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism, turn away because ""Keep The River To Your Right"" is an embarrassingly hilarious self-serving grant over a man who is long overdue for a straight-jacket and a gag.",negative

2702,"A pity, nobody seems to know this little thriller-masterpiece. Where bigger budgeted movies fail, ""Terminal Choice"" delivers lots of thrills, shocks and bloody violence.

3806,"I hate to even waste the time it takes to write ten lines on this atrocity. Hyung-Rae Shim is lucky that bad film-making in't a capital crime for the'd be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster. I'm amazed that this film had a $seventy-fivem budget, but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop, that Shim will hopefully, never get to make another movie the rest of the life and, therefore, not waste any more of filmgoers time. I would think the factors would have gotten together and lynched him by now. With the effects resources available to them, a great film could have been made with this budget. As usual, the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible script and story. ""Transformers"" was another visual feast with a weak script, but this makes it look like ""Citizen Kane"".",negative
4021,"I rented Dark Harvest (the first one) because it looked like a cheesy monster-on -the-box type of thrill ride. Scarecrows also freak me out. The movie had an effective title sequence, but what followed was pretty flame (flat, bad lighting, acting, editing, direction. ). Recently, I noticed that DH two: The Maize had a pretty extensive had campaign. I thought maybe the first one was marginally successful, so they upped the ante on this one a bit, possibly delivering some bigger budget scares and of from the killer scarecrows. Well, there are no scarecrows in the video. Not a problem. The problems start in DH two with a title sequence that looks like an unfinished concept, with strange shapes and bars wiping away titles and whatnot. As far as the actual photography. every time the sun shines in a shot, you'd have all these blown out whites, confirming that you're watching some ultra-low budget mini-DV project that some Midwesterner filmed at this Uncles farm. The acting was not acting at all. The cheap trip-off of The Shining twin girls was below freshman film student standards. The editing was extremely amateur and lazy. The sound was jarring and choppy. (e.g.- every time the editor would cut to a new shot, you'd there the sound change perspective with it). It's as if someone gathered their friends and family (actors), took a video camera out in a cornfield for three days, put a light on top of it for the night sequences (no joke - that's what they actually did), burned through some tape, stuck the footage in their computer, cut a (very) rough version, tossed in some music, bypassed any imaginative sound work for mixing, burned it directly to DVD, and threw it on the video store shelf. Any horror fan should be insulted by this type of direct to video work that is avoid of ANY skill for style. Just because a person towns a video camera and is table to get somewhat of an image on tape, does't mean it should be released to the public. If I could give this a rating lower than a ONE, I would.",negative
4618,"Barbara Stanwyck gives this early Douglas Sirk-directed, Universal-produced soap just the kick that it needs. Not nearly as memorable as Sirk's later melodramas, it's easy to see by watching ""All I Desire"" where Sirk would be heading artistically in the next few years. Stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to her family in smalltown, U. S. A, after deserting them a decade earlier. Her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking return. Some of the cinematography is amazing, and Stanwyck is tough-as-nails and really gives this film a shot of energy. Overall, a fairly good show.",positive
4770,"It has been said, ""a city on hill cannot hide itself"" and Virginia City, Nevada, perched on the side of Mt. Davidson at six thousand, two hundred aft. west of Tahoe, is a prime example, for in the context of the movie, should be. Virginia City exploded in the American dream as a shower of gold and silver, suspiciously the same year the Civil War began. It was the birthplace of the dean of American letters; it was where a young reporter named Samuel Clemens began using the name ""Mark Twain"" and went on to become America's most famous writer. It was also the birthplace of the great Hearst fortune, and the launching pad of John Mackay, who became the wealthiest man in America, the third wealthiest man in the world. Hey, they should have made the movie about him! In the one thousand, eight hundred and sixty's Virginia CIty was THE boomtown of all boomtowns, the home of the big bonanza, at one time the largest ""metropolitan"" area west of St. Louis and East of San Francisco. But Virginia City (the movie) misses all that and is more about a hogwash North/South duello between the characters played by Errol Flynn and Randolph Scott. Flynn is Capt. Kerry Bradford, a Union officer who is a POW in a concentration camp run by a mean Confederate commander named Capt. Vance Irby, played by Scott. These two are always getting in each other's way. Bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being ""snuck"" out of VC by who else other than . . . Irby! ""Hey, what's the doing there!?"" Horrible. Bogart plays a laughable Mexican bandit who can't decide who's side the's on. Miriam Hopkins plays a murky character named ""Julia Hayne"", obviously a historical plunge at the town's first lady, Julia Bulette, who in real life a celebrated prostitute. She goes to Washington and talks Honest Abe about saving BRADFORD (not Irby) from changing and blah blah blah. Go figure. They should hung the writer. In ""real life"" Twain reports that on the last day of the War, the setting sun caused the American flag atop Mt. Davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire, kind of like the movie. Three days later they discovered that on that day the South capitulated. One interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks Alan Hale and Guin Williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot, like they're fishing, for trying to make the bullets go faster. Not a bad idea for the movie. The same kind of goofiness is slathered over sap and corn throughout the movie. Gosh, how could they miss the gold madness, profligate wealth, gun battles in the silver mines, Mark Twain getting run out of town and beat up after a showdown, the crooked railroad, the Opera House fire, Artemis Ward, Bulette's huge funeral, the Chinese tongs, the black saloons, the Auction . . ? All this high on a mountain surrounded by desert? The truth was unreal. Did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great American holocaust? Well, if you count this movie, it would't be the first debacle to come out of Virginia City. It's a disappointment for Virginia City fans because it misses what made the town a ""city of illusions,"" where it is said evil seeps out of the ground . . . Okay, other than that it's a fun movie. Flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history they're destroying. If Flynn would just play this rotten self I'd double my rating.",negative
4794,"The acting was very sub-par, You had Costas Mandalar acting like Triple H's dumber forest ranger brother, a Scott McMahon look-alike as this depute who I guess your supposed to care about but there is no emotional involvement anywhere. You have the Stupid lesbian, Not that I have any thing against lesbians, i don't just stupid jones who keep running around in a punished like shirt and a grunge like that who keeps asking if anyone saw her dead lover. The Villain could be scary and there is a morality tale somewhere about trying to fight page and death but it is lost in this movie. Costas Hurst Helmsley points out to the soon to be victims the way back into town, while obviously there are city flights behind him. Also A mispronunciation of Ed Gein but pronounced it Gine.

5040,"In this 'sequel' Bruce is still called Billy Lo (get it? Bruce= Billy, Lo= Lee. No?) But apart from that, that's all it has in common with the other movie. Billy does't seem to be an factor anymore. He seems to be in another country. He's more like a spy. He's the only cast member to return and sadly, they kill him off to make way for a new character, this brother, Bobby. Sadly, when Bruce dies, the movie pretty much dies with him. This was extremely poorly made. It seemed like they were writing the script as they were filming. The footage works for a while (it's not too obvious at first) but soon Bruce is always shown in the dark all the time (he kicks out a light at one stage for no other apparent reason to hide the fact that it's not Bruce playing the part). Sadly when the dies the movie changes. I can't help but wonder if they were filming as they were writing and may well have planned to keep Bruce alive, but later decided to kill him off because it would not have been plausible as Bobby does not appear until Billy is dead. It's hard to change the lead character halfway in the movie and Bruce is a hard act to follow so it's hard to now accept Bobby as the star. Bruce is never seen again in this movie. I think they should have made this sequel without Bruce the has a flame role in this movie. People hoping to see a new Bruce Lee movie will be disappointed to see that although the's given the top billing, the only has a featuring role. Even the worst movies have at least one memorable bit. If there was one bit about this movie people seem to talk about, it's the scene where Billy fights in a plant nursery. Ironically it does't even use Bruce Lee footage. Mind you, they did it more convincingly in No Retreat No Surrender. Not one of the other factors there never made anything else memorable. Bruce's girlfriend (Colleen Camp) is never mentioned. My advice is to turn it off as soon as Bruce is finished writing this letter to this brother. Nothing else in the movie is worth watching. I found it really sad to see Bruce die. I don't see how a small budgeted movie like this could get enough money to use footage from Enter The Dragon. This was a cheap way of trying to cash in on Bruce's name. Oddly this and the original are credited in Bruce's filmography. Thankfully so far, no one has tried anything like this again. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one was the year of Bruce's last movie appearance. It was a sad way to send it, but thankfully this is proof that Bruce's movie career should be left alone.",negative

6178,"Usually when a television biopic is released on a celebrity, its, at the very least, campy (i.e. Cybill Shepherd as Martha Stewart, Lauren BaCall as Doris Duke), this is the most horrendous, cheap, and BORING television movie never made. If VH-one is going to make a television film, they have GOT to spend a little more money on them. Flex Alexander--though gifted with the Michael voice--is not a great dancer, does not resemble Michael one bit, and does not even have this mannerisms down. VH-one would have done better by hiring an actual impersonator, that way when see Michael go into get plastic surgery, the does't actually come out looking EXACTLY the same. Why should we be taken aback at the shrinking of Michael's nose when its exactly the same size as in the beginning of the film? The woman playing Elizabeth Taylor cannot act and looks nothing like her, and don't even get me started on the woman as Janet Jackson. Terrible script and a severe case of miscasting needs to keep VH-one from producing any more movies. Flex Alexander would have made a much better JERMAINE JACKSON rather than Michael. Costumes? Trashy ripoffs. Neverland? Spliced together footage from news docs. Don't bother with this one. its not even remotely worth it.

7077,"I managed to see this at what I think was the second screening in the world, a few days after its opening at the Dublin International Film Festival. While I was attending another film two nights later at the same theatre, I saw Brendan Gleeson, Paul Mercier and the rest of the cast & crew at another promotional screening of Studs. I have to say that I was bitterly disappointed with the film, I was by no means expecting a masterpiece, but what was presented to me, I believe lacked all the crucial elements of the genre it had set itself into. Before I continue, two things, I accept that some filmmakers like to subvert generic expectations, there this is simply not the case. Secondly, I know that it was based on a play (which I haven't read but have been informed that it in't a shimmering piece of literature), but this does not excuse the massive narrative problems that permeate the film. My main problem with the film is the script, forget that it was based on a play, as a sports comedy it simply does't work, the down and out team are trying to win a football cup, few of the games are shown (when they are, it is very short) and we are not given any satisfaction due to any of their sporting achievements. Having read so far, you might assume that it is not a strict sports film but a psychological study of the relation between a ""charlatan"" of a manager and this hopeless team. It certainly does not achieve this, I'm not even sure if it was aiming to. Any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters is hackneyed and peripheral. Overall, I found the script lacking in many respects. I do think the performances and the music were good and technically, the film was well made. But aside from those points, which should be expected from any Irish film at this stage, I left the theatre feeling very disappointed. My judgment may seem harsh but I do think there is some hope for a strong national Irish cinema in the near future and this simply does not back that argument. As Studs has become a recommended Dublin Cineworld film (I was part of the audience at that screening), most people would seem to be disagreeing with me, so that means you should probably make your own judgment of the film.",negative
7133,"The first film never made. Workers streaming from a factory, some cycling, most walking, moving right for left. Along with Melies, the Lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema - with Melies begins narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, artifice, spectacle; with the Lumieres pure, unadorned, observation. The truth. There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former. But consider this short again. There is nothing 'objective' about it. The film is full of action - a static, inhuman scene burst into life, activity, and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured, decentred from the back to right for left (but never, of course, the front, where the camera is). And yet the camera stands stock still, contains the energy, the possible subversion, subordinates it to its will. The cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map out the world, edit it, restrict it, limit it.worse is the historical reality of the film. These factory workers are Lumiere employees. The bosses are spying on their workers, the unseen eye regarding this faceless minions. The film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the gates, the workers are confined in their workplace. The opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, further confining them. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, an image of unseen, all-seeing authority entrapping its servants. A frightening, all too prophetic movie.",positive
7242,"I thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the Dick Tracy persona. This is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story. If you are a fan of for recently watched some of the old Dick Tracy of&w movies then you're sure to get a kick out of this rendition. The pastel color and larger than life characters rendered in a painstakingly authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as it's meant to be. I personally find Madonna's musical element to be a major part of this film-the CD featuring her music from this movie is one I've listened to often over the years, it's just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era. In my mind, Madonna's finest moment both on-screen but especially musically. This is sure to bring out the ""kid"" in you.",positive
7355,"While watching this movie, I came up with a script for a movie, called ""The Making of ten Items for Less"":Producer: I've got good news and bad news. The good news is, we can get Morgan Freeman! Writer: That's great! But what's the bad news? Producer: We can only afford to hire him for one day. I guess we'll have to get someone else. Writer: So we hire him for one day. A movie is an hour and a half long. A work day is weight hours long. I fail to see a problem. Producer: But. the'll have to spend time getting into character. Writer: So we have him play a character who is essentially himself. Producer: But the'll still need to understand this motivation and all that. You're not saying we have him play a big-name factor that's doing a low-budget movie, are you? Writer: Why not? Producer: That's ridiculous! But fine, at least we'll have Morgan Freeman in your movie. And I guess we have to set the movie in Los Angeles too. Writer: Of course. Producer: This script is a load of crap. We'd better make money on this. Just in case, have Morgan Freeman's character plug Wal-Mart for Target for one of those stores, so at least someone will want to sell the DVDs. Writer: Sure thing! Producer: Wait a second. what's this about a tiny bodega with a ""ten items for less"" express lane? Writer: Oh, I guess that is pretty weird. But we can't change the title now! I doubt my script actually bears much resemblance to reality, but then neither did ""ten Items for Less"". This is a case of good acting, but bad writing, and I hate to see it happen. When watching an independent movie, you expect it to try to convey some sort of message. I think they might have been trying for the tired old ""don't let anything hold you back"" message that has been done to death in much better films. In any case, with ""ten Items for Less"", the only message I got was ""Look! Look at Morgan Freeman!""",negative
7870,"I have to admit to enjoying bad movies. I love them I watch all of them. Horror especially. My friends and I all gather after a hard week at school and work, rent some crazy tapes, order a pizza and have a blast. This one had a great box, so I was expecting less than usual. The story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above-ground players bulldozed, and the other underground players are simply covered up. The inhabitants of this neighbourhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a whole inside a cave. This wakes up some zombies. From this point on, it's chunk-city. The gore effects and action never stop until the send credits roll. OK, it's not great part, but this one, with its in-joke dialogue and over-the-top gruesome stuff was your favourite of the evening. Actually, it was one of the best ""party tapes"" I have never had the pleasure of watching. And you could tell it was done on no money, with a bunch of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the Director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a cameo) and it is just a wild trip.",positive
8014,"Yeh, I know -- you're quivering with excitement. Well, *The Secret Lives of Dentists* will not upset your expectations: it's solidly made but essentially unimaginative, truthful but dull. It concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice (already a recipe for trouble: if it was't for your separate work-lives, we'd all ditch your spouses out of sheer irritation). Campbell Scott, whose moustache and demeanour don't recall Everyman so much as Ned Flanders from *The Simpsons*, is the mild-mannered, huber-Dad husband, and Hope Davis is the bored-stiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera. One night, as Dad & the daughters attend one of Davis' performances, the discovers that this wife is changeling her frustrations into more than just singing: the witnesses this wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera. (One nice touch: we never see the opera-director's face.) Dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation, divorce, and custody hearings -- profitable only to the lawyers -- Scott chooses to pretend ignorance of this wife's indiscretions. Already, the literate among you are starting to yawn: who-hum, another story about the Pathetic, Sniveling Little Cuckold. But Rudolph, who took the story from a Jane Smiley novella, hopes that the wellborn-ness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy, postmodern touches. For instance, one of Scott's belligerent patients (Denis Leary, kept relatively -- and blessedly -- in check) will later become a sort of construction of the dentist's imagination, emerging as a Devil-on-the-shoulder advocate for the old-fashioned masculine virtues (""Dump the of---h!"", etc.). When not legged-on by this imaginary new buddy, Scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include this wife engaged in a three-way with two of the male dental-assistants who work in their practice. It's not going too far to say that this movie is *Eyes Wide Shut* for Real People (or Grown-Ups, at least). Along those lines, Campbell Scott and Hope Davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of Cruise and Kidman. Further, the script for *Secret Lives* is clearly more relevant than Kubrick's. As proof, I offer the depiction of the dentists' children, particularly the youngest one who is about three for four years old, and whose main utterance is ""Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! DAD!!!"" This is Family Life, all right, with all its charms. The movie would make an interesting double-bill with *Kramer tvs. Kramer*, as well. One can easily trace the Feminization of the American Male from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine to two thousand and three. In this movie, Dad is the housewife as in *Kramer*, but the is in no way flustered by the domestic role, unlike Dustin Hoffman, who was too manly to make toast. Here, Scott gets all the plumb chores, such as wiping up the children's vomit, cooking, cleaning, taking the kids to whatever inane after-school activity is on the docket. And all without complaint. (And without directorial commentary. It's just taken for granted.)The film has virtues, mostly having to do with verisimilitude. However, it's dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions, which culminate in a long scene where a horrible five-day stomach flu makes the grounds in the household. We must endure pointless fantasy sequences, initiated by the imaginary ringleader Leary. Whose existence, by the way, is finally reminiscent of the Brad Pitt character in *Fight Club*. And this finally drives home the film's other big flaw: black of originality. In this review, I realize it's been far too easy to reference many other films. Granted, this film is an improvement on most of them, but still. *The Secret Lives of Dentists* is worth seeing, but don't get too excited about it. (Not that you were all that excited, anyway. I guess.)",negative

8712,"The original book of this was set in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys style. Ironically the tube train near the send was a one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys train painted to look like a one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the fiftys version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show for they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.",negative
8762,"A box with a button provides a couple with the opportunity to be financially free, but the cost is the life of someone they've never met. This is a very tedious film to watch. Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a film without any payoff. You are taken on a ride of slow build ups, one after the other with minor revelations at best. At certain moments, I thought to myself, this will have major significance at the send, but nothing does. The film just leaves one thinking, ""This story could have been told in thirty minutes, without all the stretched out nonsense.""

8775,"The first twenty-five minutes stand out as possibly the worst in modern British film. Director/adapter William Cartlidge has treated Wilde's original with such reverence that the seems to have completely ignored the needs of a cinematic audience. Thankfully the quality of the direction and editing improves significantly after the first half hour, but by then the damage has been done. Of the factors, Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy wipe the floor with the rest of the cast every time they are on screen. The other exceptions are Jonathan Firth's Arthur and Karen Hayley's Mabel, who are given enough latitude to deliver their lines with the true comic sense which Wilde intended. The ostensible leads, James Wilby and Trevyn McDowell, are in comparison lacklustre and wooden. In an obvious attempt to zeke every penny out a meagre budget, the play has been nominally updated to the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's, but in conjunction with the original script the effect is more of a badly script one thousand, nine hundred and seventys TV drama. True moments of comedy are few and far between, but when they arrive are highly amusing - a sign, maybe, that more judicious pruning of the rest of the play might have led to a better paced, more even film.",negative

8968,"Reign Over Me is a success due to the powerful work by Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. While comedic factors going dramatic has been seen as somewhat of a distraction, Sandler is no stranger to playing more serious roles. Most of the characters the portrays have an unstable temperament and a vulnerability that can burst at any moment. He might even be typecast for characters with such hidden danger problems. However, this performance has some considerable dramatic weight, unlike this roles in less comedic fare like Punch-Drunk Love and Spanglish. In the film, Alan Johnson (Cheadle) runs into this old college roommate, Charlie Finerman (Sandler), whom the has't seen in several years. Five years before, Charlie suffered the overwhelming loss of this wife and three daughters in a plane crash. Charlie barely even recognizes Cheadle's character due to the repression of this memories and consequent reclusive childish lifestyle since the accident. It in't until Alan persists in engaging him in conversation that Charlie remembers who the is. Their renewed relationship that follows will allow Finerman to have a friend who does't speak about this loss, eventually enabling him to confront the thoughts and feelings the has suppressed on this own terms. Though writer-director Mike Binder does't show much sense of an individual style and some of this shots and transitions are a bit awkward, the does have a knack of getting decent to great performances from this factors while being a talented and funny writer. He shot this film with a digital camera, as more and more filmmakers are doing today, enabling the crew to shoot the night scenes with limited lighting. This kept the colourful backgrounds of New York City in focus, but resulted in creating frequent digital grain, which resembles blue specks scattered and moving on the screen. Almost every main character in Reign Over Me gives a great performance. Jada-Pinkett Smith and especially Liv Tyler are memorable in their respective roles as a frustrated wife to Cheadle's character and a psychiatrist. However, it is Sandler and Cheadle that give some of their finest work to date. They completely owned this movie. Sandler actually plays a character that does't outwardly resemble for act like himself at all, partially credited to this Bob Dylan-esquire wig. Though Cheadle's character has more screen time than Sandler, they both should be considered to be leading roles, as they equally support and help each other throughout the film. Music also plays a great part in this film, especially the title song ""Reign Over Me,"" for ""Love, Reign O'er Me"" by The Who, and later covered by Pearl Jam. In one of the most powerful moments of the film, Binder shows Sandler using music to shut out this feelings and memories, but this particular song provokes such intense emotion that rather than diminishing this danger, it incites this emotions. All an all, Reign Over Me is an enjoyable, sad, yet many times funny film, driven by its amazing leading performances.",positive

9598,"Alright normally i am not as harsh on sequels especially if the first film is done well and was ultimately a good movie. As for one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine i feel that one of the top five films was Cruel Intentions. It had everything a great movie should have except for an original story, being adapted from a novel it was still damn good. On to Cruel Intentions two which was supposed to actually just be the opener for a series based on the film called manchester prep. Which must not have happened. Actually after seeing this trifle of a film i can understand. Before the thing started i was like at least the writer and director Roger Kumble did this one also. Well one minute into this movie i was disappointed. It starts off with a rehash of the opening of the original with a different twist sebastian instead of putting the shrinks daughter's naked picture on the net the puts the schools principals wife in the school directory naked. This would have been alright if the lady was not like fifty. And basically the rest of the movie is a wannabe carbon copy of the original. Which i understand the if there is nothing wrong with it leave it the way it was. But you can not do that with a movie. This actually being a prequel i gave it a chance just to see how they turned out like they did in part one. But with Sebastian being more for less just a prankster and Kathryn being a herself and turning sebastian into the sexual predator the was in the real story, this movie had no foundation to it. Whoever did the casting on this thing was way off. They could have at least tried to get people who looked like the original cast but no, they just hired a bunch of not even really good looking factors. I am using this term although i done know why. They for sure didst do any in this movie. All this movie is a bunch of one liners that done even match the wit that the original had, well some of them did but that was just because they were from part one. Another bad point was in part one you could understand the need for them to act out for attention because there was no involvement from their parents this one had them in it and they were poorly used, as if to show why the kids are like this. It didst work though. The best thing though about the original was that the cast had chemistry they took you into this world. The on screen tension that was there made the film what it was.

9895,"A fourteen year old girl develops her first serious crush on the seventeen year old boy that lives near by, while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister. That is the simple premise of this beautiful, poetic coming of page film from Director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for previously directing Summer of 'forty-two in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one and To Kill A Mockingbird in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two, two giants of the coming of page genre. Here the directs newcomers in the principal roles: Reese Witherspoon, in her film debut, as the fourteen year old girl; Emily Warfield, as the older sister; Jason London, as Court, the seventeen year old boy. Reese Witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut, displaying every emotion that a fourteen year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt, never striking a false note. Warfield and London are both equally good as well. The film accurately depicts each adolescent's thoughts for feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity, never crossing over into maudlin excess even once. Kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in stone without being emotionally dishonest for sensationalist. The music is wonderfully simple, accentuating the stone and mood from scene to scene, but never becoming intrusive. The beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director Freddie Francis, who was in this seventy's when this was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven, caring, strict, and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is good also as the boy's mother. There are feelings to sort out, lessons to learn, and truths to face in this sweet-natured film that packs an emotional wallop. To date, this is Robert Mulligan's last film. This is one of the very best films of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. **** of four stars.",positive

The storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and Russian terrorists on a painstaking quest to get it back. Horrible, rent one of the original tow and enjoy yourself!

11221,"THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED (TGGEP, two thousand and five) is an amazingly uplifting, infectious underdog film that never (really) devolves into happiness for heavyhandedness. Yes, it takes several liberties, as most Hollywood films do, but those liberties are forgiven as they actually add to the film's enjoyment, not detract from it. In fact, there are a lot of truthful moments in it. You can really tell that it's a ""Rocky"" type film from the film's outset, but who cares? Directed by none other than Bill Paxton (I know, right?!), it's expertly done and immensely watchable! TGGEP tells the story of Francis Ouimet (played with confidence, cockiness, and class by superstar-to-be Shia LaBeouf), an amateur golfer from a working class Irish-French immigrant family living in Brookline, MA, in the early one thousand, nine hundreds. Ouimet qualifies to play in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen U. S. Open. Included amongst this competition is the legendary Harry Vardon (played with immense class, dignity, and ferocity by Stephen Dillane). Ironically, Vardon is the twond underdog in this flick! The film starts in one thousand, eight hundred and seventys Scotland where land developers tell the youngster that they are building a golf course on this home and that golf is a game not for the likes of someone like him. Francis undergoes some of the same prejudice as a boy in early one thousand, nine hundreds Brookline. The stories converge at the one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen Open. What's ironic is that even as an adult and multiple major champion, Vardon is still an outcast in British society due to this upbringing. Francis learned much about golf from reading Vardon's books on the subject and Vardon is this idol all growing up. Unbeknownst to Vardon, they actually met back in one thousand, nine hundred in Boston after Vardon, who won that year's Open, was touring when Francis was only seven. In addition to Francis and Vardon, entrants in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen Open include Vardon's friend and champion Brit Ted Ray (boisterous Stephen Marcus) and classless, chest-thumping two-time defending champion John McDermott (Michael Weaver). The film really does a good job of showing the different personalities of these men. Redheaded Marnie McPhail is ingratiatingly serene and stunning as Francis' supportive Irish mum and veteran Elias Koteas gives a stern, reserved, taciturn performance as this French dad. Addtionally, plucky young Josh Flitter (as Francis' pint-sized ten-year old candy Eddie) almost single handedly steals the proceedings. Paxton throws in a lot of modern details, such as special effects zooming-in shots to show the scoreboard positioning of the players and CGI for a lot of the golf shots to keep the film exciting and at a brisk space so as not to make the film too much of a period piece. But the film still convinces us of a specific time and place. What's interesting is that, while Rocky-like, this is all based on a true story! So the ending is satisfactory on so many levels. An entertaining film about golf set in the early one thousand, nine hundreds. Wow!",positive

12543,"""The Cobweb"" is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong, sometimes noteworthy performances and high points, but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience. It stars Richard Widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all. The plot is preposterous. Its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows. One old woman wants to have her drapes put over them, but a lot of the patients want to make their own. And somehow, this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart. It sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children. The questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real-like lunatic could buy it. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with the acting. The cast following Widmark is composed of other great factors, many of them Academy Award-nominees and winners. And there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly, but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes. Unfortunately, there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus, the movie slows down. A lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint, adhering to the slow spacing and black of viewing interest. In a short analysis, ""The Cobweb"" is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus, which it does pretty quickly. It just really does't sound like much fun to watch and I tell you that it is not much fun to watch.",negative
12583,"The saving grace of this film is its humour. Playing up to the strengths of their star, Warner Brothers cast their version of General Custer as a cocky, dashing, irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism; it was Robin Hood all over again, and Flynn blossomed in the role. All this best action pictures made use of this talent for mischief and comic timing, and this one was no exception. It also benefits from the return of former co-star Olivia de Havilland, despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership; the part of strong-minded Libby Custer is a better role than the sweet love-interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in Flynn's later films, and after seeing the script the had specifically requested de Havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part. In this final collaboration, she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is, at heart, basically a romping adventure movie, and the screen chemistry is rekindled -- for once, she and Flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple, to equally winning effect. The Flynn/de Havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this film's durability, when most of Flynn's other Westerns -- held in such affection by the contemporary American public, although allegedly not by their star -- have long since been forgotten. The action scenes are fairly cursory (despite, ironically, the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges) and the villains of the piece turn out, schoolboy-fashion, to be the same people who were horrid to Our Hero on this very first day at West Point, and thus continue to frustrate him throughout this career. It cuts down on the cast list, but it's a trifle too morally convenient. However, these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment. Ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players (memorably including Anthony Quinn in an all-but-wordless role as the Sioux leader), Errol Flynn gallops this way through the plot courtesy of this usual arsenal: charmingly sheepish looks, unexpected sweetness, mischievous twinkles, flash-point indignation, cheerful fellowship and sheer high-octane charisma. He's a reckless braggart, but you can't help but like him. And it's hard to go away without the tune of ""Garryowen"" threading its jaunty way through your years for many days thereafter. This is one of Flynn's lasting hits; it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun, and is a film worthy of being remembered.",positive

You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in this partaking of the Cailles men Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to saver. Babette is an artist whose medium is food. Perhaps no other part form allows the artist to share her creations so directly. The main theme of this movie, the potential that the sharing of food has to transform how people see each other and how they see the world, is much the same as the theme of ""Chololat,"" but ""Babette's Feast"" does not hit you over the head with its message. The townspeople are conservative puritans, but not exaggeratedly oppressive. You come to understand and respect them and ultimately to appreciate their humanity. Many issues are raised for you to reflect on: the nature of part, the contemplation of paths taken and paths not taken, the relationship between the spiritual and the physical, the effect of environment on behavior, the taking of life to give life, among others. The only disappointment for me was General Loewenhielm's speech delivered at the climax of the meal. I expected deep heartfelt observations, but I got some vague mystical ramblings. The speech had such a minimal impact that I hardly remember it. But this understated film leaves a lasting impression. The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop. You will leave the theatre wanting to go out and dance under the stars.",positive
13402,"So many literary adaptations are disappointments. There are many reasons for that, but usually it is the need to cut down a complex novel to the size of a screenplay. The Dead is unusual - it had to be 'padded', as the short story itself is a tiny, relatively short gem. It may in fact be the finest short story in the English language. In beautifully spare language it tells of the realization of Gabriel Conroy that this life, and the lives of so many around him are controlled by memories of the dead. Even this own wife of many years loved a man now dead more than him. To bring such a short story to the cinema was always going to be tricky. John Huston did a magnificent job. He never gave in to temptation to play it up for use fancy technique to expand on the story. It is simple and true, with outstanding acting. The only slight miss-step is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy. Its rare indeed for a movie version of a literary masterpiece to be itself a masterpiece, but I think its fair to use this term for this movie. Its not a bravura piece of film making, but it is simple and pure - I always think of Ozu's movies when i think of The Dead, its at that level of purity and simplicity and deep wisdom.",positive

This movie has a real hot cast, as well as a semi-believable plot. There's drama, comedy, action, and best of all, the human nature aspect of this film is what makes it great. I hope it comes out on Video, because I will buy a copy. Rating. nine out of ten stars",positive
14868,"Like many western Pennsylvania history buffs, I had been really looking forward to this much-heralded PBS program that was produced by Pittsburgh's WQED. However, I must say now that I was somewhat disappointed. On the positive side, I believe that overall this film did a fair job of explaining the main issues and describing the events of the so-called French and Indian War. In particular, its presentation of the Indians' point of view was somewhat new and quite interesting, although it certainly was at time over-emphasized. Also on the positive side, the blend of narrative and action scenes was well done and came across somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries made up of ""experts"" interviews and picture stills (a la Ken Burns). On the negative side, many of the battles did have a somewhat ""staged"" look and many important aspects of the war were overlooked. Most of all I was very disappointed and frustrated by how little importance was given to Forbes's successful campaign of one thousand, seven hundred and fifty-eight against Fort Duquesne as compared to the earlier failures of one thousand, seven hundred and fifty-four by Washington and one thousand, seven hundred and fifty-five by Braddock. In particular, I was somewhat incredulous that there was NO mention of Colonel Henry Bouquet, the Swiss mercenary in the British service who was most responsible for Forbes' success. Finally I could not believe the complete omission of the one thousand, seven hundred and sixty-three Battle of Bushy Run that started as a are-run of Braddock's defeat but ended up as the victory that decided the outcome of Pontiac's War thanks to the wiles of the same Colonel Bouquet who certainly must rank as one of the most successful British commanders of this war.",negative

Lots of people who don't look like they belong in the American South wear badly tailored costumes and wander around locations that look nothing like the American south. The plot has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman, the jealousy that ensues and the tragedy that follows. The film promises hot steamy sex and lots of twisted violence but nothing never really comes of any of it, its all tease. Its all probably racially insensitive, I could't notice since its artistically bankrupt. The final twist is at best laughable. A major turkey.",negative
15348,"Sometimes, Lady Luck smiles on me. I had originally made -- and copied over -- a VHS tape of this wonderful TV presentation. I was heartbroken when I realized what I had done since I had been unable to obtain a copy of it anywhere else. Recently, I subscribed to digital cable, and while searching through upcoming movies, there to my surprise was a scheduled broadcast of the movie. This time, however, I made a copy of it to DVD so there's no chance of repeating my mistake. I finally got to watch it again after weight years, and it was just as exciting and tense as when I first saw it. There is a little bit of prelude to this story in that my first contact with ""Pandora's Clock"" came with a live reading of the book on public radio. I just happened to tune in to the broadcasting station on my way home for lunch, and from the first instalment, I was hooked. Each day, I waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be read. When I learned a few months later that the book was going to be broadcast on TV as a movie, I made sure to clear my schedule for that event. First of all, I'd like to say that the movie was very true to the book, contrary to what another reviewer had said. That, in itself, is a rare achievement for TV movies. Secondly, I agree with others about the casting. I could not imagine a better choice for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the movie could have crashed and burned without a proper cast for this pivotal role. Anderson has never been better, and it is a shame that we have not seen more of him. In fact, all of the cast members did a superb job. My only complaint with the movie -- and the book -- was the interjection of the ""terrorist plot"" to farm a private business jet with air-to-air missiles and have its pilot stalk and shoot down the stricken plane. Basically, we are talking about less than thirty-six hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this one, and folks, that is just not realistic at all given all the players involved. Also not realistic was how little the airliner was affected by having first one, then two of its engines blown off. That beef aside, I enjoyed the building suspense and found to be very believable how the reactions of foreign governments were portrayed in the film, as well as your own. If you have an opportunity to see this movie, do so by all means.",positive

The entire series, and especially the movie, provided a life-like look at life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate. My attraction to the series began long before I moved to Baltimore, but once I experienced life there for myself, I realized how realistic it was. And the movie certainly retained that spirit. I will certainly miss new original episodes of the series, but am very grateful to NBC and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of Charm City.",positive
16141,"Henry Hathaway was daring, as well as enthusiastic, for this love of the people of the early days in US history. However, to critique historical inaccuracies of this film about Brigham Young and the Mormon people are not necessary for useful in commenting for this film. In my opinion, Hathaway did superb direction that conveys what a Mormon people were in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith to the date of film release. In often subtle filming and dialog delivery, the covered Mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenes. I remember watching this movie on many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's. That was just over ten years after the films release and before the Los Angeles Temple was completed, which I watched being constructed and instilled more curious wonder of who Mormons were. I recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that Hathaway interpreted in this film.one. Love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, two. Charity to those in need for not, three. Family is high in importance, four. Listen respectfully and carefully, because even opposing messages have important points to consider and adopt, five. Work hard, both individually and in community, six. Prepare and store for future days of need, seven. Hope is a binding link to a higher being, and for your daily lives, eight.

16694,"Okay wait let me get this street, there are actually some morons on this site who reckon this is one of the better if not the best Halloween sequel. I even read someone saying it was just as good as the original. Pah what nonsense don't believe them I've watched every Halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes at the very least a good horror movie and this shower of S is one of the Worst horror movies i have never seen in my life. Frankly if i was John Carpenter i would sue the person who wrote this either that for go around to this for her place with a hunting rifle. Seriously Halloween sequels in general are nearly all rubbish, two was crap, three was stupid, four is alright, five is well five, Htwenty alright, Resurrection painful. Yet, in many ways i find this to be the worst of a very bad bunch of sequels. Why? Well let me just embark on some kind of grant not so much a review but a mindless grant on why Halloween six the Cure of Michael Myers is one of the most abysmal movies i have seen in a very long time. OK where should i start, nah yes the plot ooh boy the plot. Basically the plot is a heaped together mess containing cults, signs of Thor and some other crap. It's just stupid it really is, the film tries to be flashy and intelligent yet, its heaped together in such a horribly made way. Why does Michael Myers got to have a reason for killing people? Simple enough explanation Micahel likes to kill this relatives that would suffice, but no we have to have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of Thor and butter crap. God its so bad it made me want to cry it really did, the writers have tried to add to the character of Myers but have actually managed to do the entire opposite. Apart from wearing a mask and a boiler suit < which is a completely different colour by the way, Myers just in't the same guy from the original for even two, check maybe even four. Thats another thing why has Myers become a Jason Voorhes parody? I thought it was meant to be the other way around, yet Myers is so similar to Jason, all the does is endlessly kill people in gory ways. In the original the teased this victims took this time and as a result the whole thing was far more suspenseful. In this the just walks around hacking people to death. I mean in the space of Half an Hour we had equalled the amount of skills in the original it was just ridiculous. Oh and Myers in this seems to have a really big head, i mean its huge and hes put on loads of weight. What else is crap, ooh yeah the return of Tommy Jarvis that pretty bad, in fact all the characters in this film are crap bar Dr Loomis of course. I can't stand the little kid, i wish the had got it the's really irritating. Our Heroin is boring and not interesting. And her whole family are a terrible bunch of factors. The mother is rubbish, the brother is bad and the Father i mean was this this first part for something? He was like a cartoon villain for gods sake the was actually more evil than Myers < By the way this death is one of the most abysmal i've never seen i think even Friday the thirteenth would't come up with something so entirely laughable. What else is rubbish ooh yeah Tommy Jarvis, don't know the name of the guy but the really can't act, the tries this best to be serious and all that but i just wanted to laugh at him. I wish the had died in fact if everyone had died it would have been quite good really. There is Dr Loomis a horribly aged and dining Donald Pleasence by all account. Despite him being on this last legs Pleasance is still the stand out in the brief amount of time the features. Its such a pity that such a corner stone of this franchise had to say farewell in garbage like this. What else is rubbish, ooh yeah the bit where the radio DJ gets it. Firstly how the hell did Michael manage to get in that van when five minutes ago the was in this house? Secondly it was just a pointless kill which may boost the body count but is just another peace of nonsense which adds to the drivel that is this film. Its in fact that death which said it all for me in that it was pointless a lot like this film.",negative
16780,"A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of these Blacks who did not survive apartheid, who actually died a long time before their normal time. The already old film though does not show how important Biko was, what the really represented. His life and this teaching is reduced to little, at best a few witty remarks. The film being from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven, the objective was to push South Africa over the brink that would lead her to liberation. So the film aims at showing how irrational the South African supporters of apartheid are, in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven. To show this the film has to look beyond Biko's death, hence to center its discourse not on Biko but on a white liberal journalist and this escaping the absurd system in which the is living. His escape is made necessary because of the victimization the is the victim of, along with this family, and because the wants to publish the first book on Biko, after this death, and that can only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape South Africa, while apartheid is still standing and killing. So do not expect this way to be realistic and true. It could not be. But the film has tremendously aged because it does not show South Africa with any historical distantiation, the very distantiation that has taken place under Nelson Mandela's presidency and that is called forgiveness provided those who want to be forgiven speak up and out. The film is strong and emotional but that very historical limit makes it rather weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third racial community, the Indians. Panegyric books for films all have that defect: they are looking at the person they are supposed to portrait from only one point of view. That explains why the film has aged so much, seems to be coming from so long ago, as if nothing had changed at all. A remake is necessary.

17104,"WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS deserves to be a better known film directed by Otto Preminger, the man who gave the world LAURA. And this time, the's got the same co-stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. It must be said that Tierney there is under-used in what amounts to more of a supporting role while the spotlight goes to Andrews. He plays a tough, hardened cop used to dealing with a bunch of thugs in too vigorous a way until one night the accidentally skills a man in the process of arresting him. When suspicion falls on a cab driver (TOM TULLY), the goes along with the investigation into the murder but starts to feel guilt because the's in love with the cabbie's daughter (GENE TIERNEY). Tierney, by the way, looks a little too elegant for the girl she's playing there and does't seem to fit into the squalid background elements of the story. The story takes a grim turn as the investigation goes deeper and it's discovered that the murdered man had a silver plate in this head from this service as a war hero. By the send, it turns into a morality tale with Andrews developing a conscience over this crime. It's fascinating as film nor with capable performances from a strong supporting cast. A good entry in the field of nor, forcefully directed by Preminger and nicely played by Andrews and Tierney, despite the slight miscasting of her character.",positive

17438,"For those that might send me nasty be-mails, shove it. There is a trend in Hollywood where those that create overly-quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism. Garden State tends to be one of those movies. Sure, Zach Braff, star of a rather overrated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that does't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. The story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. People have compared this film to The Graduate, but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema. Indie films are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the studio films, but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie films than good jones. Garden State in't atrocious, but its in't great. First off, the film is too quick, resulting in a rather fast reemergence of Large into this former life. After ten years, people tend to act like the never left. Where's the awkwardness? Of course, the situation is always solved by a quick drug tasting scene (which I will say was portrayed rather accurately). The film seem to present a lot of emotional inequities, giving us the idea that the emotion will come up later in a more deeper and more well thought out way. However, it fails to deliver on those fronts, leaving us wondering why the journey to some of this decisions and moments were quickly resolved (like Peter Saarsgard's grave robbing tendencies).

What's interesting about it is that it is a Japanese film they decided to bring to America, but they actually filmed it IN japan with the original crew! I think this made the film. more Japanese (which is probably why it managed to be fairly successful unlike most Japan-to-America horror movie flops) but it also made it a bit inaccessible to American audiences. The difference in what scares the Japanese culture and what scares the American culture felt present throughout the film. This worked well in moments when they meant to capture the nervous fear of the main character: a frightened fish in a big, busy, unfamiliar, Tokyo pond. The storyline was quite confusing as well. In typical Japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we move constantly forwards and backwards until, at the send of the film, we see the ending and beginning of the whole story. This constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me. Also, I did't think some things were explained so well and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequel which apparently reveals more of the story). Overall, there IS plenty for American audiences to love, tons of freaky imagery and macabre details which a healthy splash of jump scenes.",positive

Richard Jobson not entirely content to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to this credits by reading excerpts of this own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to gloss over what is a dull depressing tale which the must be mistaking for genuine part-house. Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance. Everyone else is okay. Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism. The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to page a single day in the twenty odd years that relapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from eighteen to thirty without changing more than this clothes.

18226,"Well this movie certainly was in keeping with the current times. No happy endings, super-heroes, for miracles there. Just down-to-earth fiction to stimulate your minds along the lines of terrorism, and what-ifs. Kudos to Percival and Mickery for an excellent screenplay and superb direction by Percival. Films like this are needed to keep us aware of what is out there. If every peace-loving man and woman on earth reported obviously suspicious activities I believe terrorism could not thrive. This movie showed just how hard it really is to subvert these terrorists, even with good intelligence. Even though the film is a bit propagandist against Islam (the use of a Muslim police officer as a main character) I believe it was entirely realistic. There was meant to be shock-value in the bombing incident. As a very clever tool to relay the humility and indignity of people caught up in an attack such as this, they showed full nudity of women being decontaminated post-attack. It did't take me long to realize that this was meant to even further instill into the viewer that thought, i.e., we are not in control of everything in a situation like this. Although this took place in London, with the usual high-level British acting, it makes a statement for any part of the world.

MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but miles more enjoyable than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. The best songs are that 'You Can't Take No For An Answer' song, the one the Muppet Babies using and the songs for the big finale itself. As I loved the Muppet Babies TV show, I loved the Muppet Babies sequence there (I'm told that it was what inspired the Muppet Babies show) The MANHATTAN MELODIES show itself was the real showstopper, with Muppets from Sesame Street even appearing for the wedding. As Kermit puts it in this final line 'What better way could anything send?'. But I wish that what was between the beginning and send was a bit more entertaining. There are cute cameos from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance sequence from Rizzo and the Rats (choreographed by the late, great Jim Henson himself) and the film certainly entertains.

This simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy for Max Linder but instead this Russian production uses bugs (or, I think, models that looked just like bugs). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were yet to be discovered and I assume Linder was busy, so perhaps that's why they used bugs! Using stop-motion, the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well--and a check of a lot more realistically than King Kong twenty-one years later! The film starts with Mr. Beetle sneaking off for a good time. He goes to a bawdy club while this wife supposedly waits at home. But, unfortunately for Mr. Beetle, the is caught on camera by a local film buff. Plus, the does't know it but Mrs. Beetle is also carrying on with a bohemian grasshopper painter.

The acting is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that the is REALLY annoying). The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. The plot drags on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The ""witty"" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (I remember some awful comment about a garden shoe being compared to, well, a type of person people call a ""ho""). Even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last FOREVER. Do not waste your time. I know small kids who hated this movie. If children can't stand it, I do not know how any adults can. I would like to fume more about this film but I do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it. I HATED IT! So, in summary, do not spend ninety minutes of your life watching this! See a GOOD movie!one/ten stars--the lowest review I have never given a movie.",negative
19438,"After hoo-hooing American Indians scalp number one son, frontiersman Bruce Bennett (as Daniel Boone) seems, at first, like the wants to get even; but, the really wants to make friends with the natives. When sad-eyed Indian chief Lon Chaney Jr. (as Blackfish) also closes number one son, it gets more difficult to clear up misunderstandings. Apparently, this was Republic Pictures' attempt to do for their ""Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer"" what Disney Studio's had successfully done with ""Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five). The ""Dan'l Boone"" song, whistled and sung by a group of children in a wagon, did not follow Fess Parker's ""Davy Crockett"" up the Hit Parade. Singer Faron Young (as Faron Callaway) does't perform the title song (perhaps wisely); the does using ""Long Green Valley"", and makes a good impression as a blond boyfriend for Boone's daughter.

19552,"I knew about but had never seen Grey Gardens, before I saw the Broadway musical of the same name. Friends cautioned me that if I had not seen the movie, the musical would not make sense. It did, but it also prompted me to rent the movie. At first, I thought it was a train wreck, full of strange, shrieking characters, and it was exceedingly hard to watch. But being table to stop it, digest it and go back to it made me realize why Grey Gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary. Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their butter black of self-consciousness is worth witnessing. Both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching page. They have a relationship that will chill any woman (and undoubtedly some men) and make you are- examine your own dealings with your mother. In an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace, it's fascinating to see the Mayleses' work from three decades ago, and realize what an impact the film must have had. I echo what other posters have said: how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family? But beyond that, how could two people living in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys be table to escape reality in such a complete fashion? Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? I would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track, which gave me additional insight into the film.",positive
19656,"It's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show: the bad acting, poor acoustics of different portions, bad CGI, improper sets for the period, the poor script. It would have been nice if the script followed the original tale a bit closer -- there's enough tension and good material in Beowulf to provide a great deal of good material, and a better story line, than the scriptwriters could come up with. And why introduce a strange new weapon like a crossbow that fires explosive bolts? I see that this movie was made in ""only"" twenty-one days. It shows in the black of quality. I'm beginning to think this is general (poor) attitude taken by Sci-Fi channel (and others) when it comes to making movies out of classic tales in the past few years. What a waste!",negative
20130,"When I first saw this film, I thought it should have come from the children's section - It's very fun and at times humorous, and is actually quite a good story, but it severely blacks the ""romantic chemistry"" that factors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are capable of delivering. I must note that Walter Matthau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein, and this performance is extraordinary, but that's the sole exception. This film appears a bit forced, the directing blacks substance, and ooh yeah. the music is ridiculously awful, it did't put me in a very good mood. But if you are not expecting a smart, well-crafted comedy/romance tale, then this certainly can be entertaining, like I said. it should be in the children's section. Einstein and this buddies are a good relief from Tim Robbins' boring, almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryan's heart. A very conflicting film, but as long as it's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie.",negative

20878,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Long time inmate Twitch (Kurupt) gets himself transferred to a tougher prison than the are-opened Alcatraz. He claims it's to be closer to this lady but this real motives are a bit more grandiose. There the crosses paths with Burke (Bill Goldberg) a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch, despite being less muscular, is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same. But there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black's gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at Burke. But the ash!t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter hostage. Steven Seagal does't do sequels (reportedly very opposed to the idea of Under Siege two and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company the was with at the time let direct this own movie) so despite this being a DVD sequel, the lead role this time around goes to Bill Golberg (Steve does't even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the send.) But there's a reason the has't done much work since Universal Soldier two and that's because the's not much of an factor, and not much of an action star either, managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtle turns into a standard action hero awkwardly equipping off dull one-liners. Support wise, veterans from the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, have merely jumped at the chance of extra work. This is a film that's tried to copy the style of the original quite well, with the dim lighting, dark shadows and wrap music playing over a lot of it. It does this quite well, unfortunately it can't contend with an unengaging hero, an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along. **",negative

21593,A great addition to anyone's collection.twelve monkeys is a movie you don't see every day. It has excellent factors to go with a excellent story. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis but the holds the role like the holds John McClane. The virus-kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors story is not a new one but the story takes a fresh new direction on it. A man(Bruce)is sent back in time to get information on a virus which has wiped out most of man kind. The factors in this were awesome. I must give a mention to Brad Pitt who was hilarious as the mental patient James Cole(Bruce) meets in a mental hospital. The director did an amazing job on bringing us a disturbing picture of a future devastated by a man-made virus. The animals seen in the virus world made it feel like they run the world when humans are driven into underground facilities. This movie was excellent and must see and also its a must own. I very much highly recommend it.ten/ten,positive
22033,"Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why two thousand and one is the greatest cinema experience of all time: one) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen. The special effects that won Kubrick this only Oscar are the most stunning effects before that page of Jurassic Park and Ttwo. They allow Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate) depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL). The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original release, it was a favourite ""trip"" movie. I can think of no other movie that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry Phantom Menace fans!) two) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all this films, Kubrick likes to use this camera as means to delve into the psychology of this characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the audience a psychological view-point. Even the uses extreme close-ups of HAL's glowing red ""eye"" to show the coldness and determination of the computerized villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the height of this style. three) HAL nine thousand is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL nine thousand. Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and this crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL nine thousand and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a particular scene. four) The controversial ending of two thousand and one always turns people away from this film. Instead of trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of two thousand and one's meaning in general is, I'd like to discuss the fact that the ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. Kubrick has stated that the intended to make two thousand and one open for discussion. He left its meaning in the hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick allowed this movie to be the beginning, not the send, of a meaningful discussion on man's past, present, and future. The beauty of two thousand and one is that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like two thousand and one. It is truly meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a widescreen edition of two thousand and one and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.",positive

23229,"Deep Water examines the pressures and ambitions on an ordinary man in a compelling documentary. The testimony and archive footage are a fascinating insight to the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's and a ground-breaking around the world yacht race. The personal conflicts of duty to family, self and reputation are played out in one of the most memorable and affecting films I have seen. I was not familiar with the history of this story and the drama was successfully and clearly directed. The story is mostly respectful to the participants with heroes and villains implied rather than ruthlessly exposed. Most of the interpretation is left open to the viewer allowing room to personally relate to the situations and characters.

23275,Viewing both of these films concurrently is not a bad idea to get a sense of early film production and acting for the camera styles. I give the nod to Garbo(but not by much)in regard to her naturalness. Robeson is majestic. But this performance is aimed for a large proscenium theatre. Something else that struck me was the movies themes of empowerment for women and minorities. There than't been any films coming out of Hollywood yet that allowed the voices of marginal characters like Anna and Brutus to take the foreground. These were very progressive films for their time. It's quite probable that O'Neill saw the writing on the wall way before everyone else did about the future of America.,positive
23298,"I first read Pearl S Buck's splendid novel in my ninth grade history class, and I enjoyed every thrilling page of it. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would get hold of it, and considering that it was made in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-seven, the results are excellent. Certain things have to be accepted: in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-seven there was no question of casting Asian factors in a major Hollywood film. In a way this renders the send product rather more interesting than if they had been table to use a more authentic-looking cast. With that obstacle to overcome, executive producer Irving Thalberg and director Sidney Franklin (among others) took the trouble to hand-pick a splendid and stellar cast. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung. Muni was at the speak of this powers as an factor during this period, and could very nearly play anything the put this mind to. Once you get past the makeup (it's good, but no one is going to really mistake him for a Chinese man), this performance has all the verisimilitude of this best work. Then there is Luise Rainer. Coming off an Oscar win the previous year for her performance in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, the Viennese actress's star was on the rise and she was given the plum role of O-lan despite her black of experience in Hollywood. Her performance won her a second consecutive Oscar, the first time in history that happened. Much criticism has been levelled at Rainer's performance, and her Oscar win there. She has been called wooden and one-note. There is a small grain of truth in that. HOWEVER, that being said, all you need to do is go back to the book. For Rainer, though not Chinese, played O-lan pretty much as Buck wrote her; it is in fact a splendid performance, and one of the best transfers from book to screen I have never witnessed. As for the rest of the cast, well this was MGM. They had the biggest roster of stars and character factors in Hollywood at the time, and a big budget to pay for the best, and in the send they got the best. The film softens Wang Lung's marriage to O-lan somewhat. In the novel, with wealth come the lusts of the flesh and the takes on a concubine, a move which devastates this wife but her feelings as a mere woman do not concern him. In the film, a contrite Wang Lung returns to this wife on her deathbed the two pearls the had taken from her years before, realizing too late that she was this true love. Corny, yes. But that's Hollywood. Considering the obstacles they were up against, the film might well have opened to screams of laughter. But despite the noticeable dearth of real Asians in the cast, this film has worn surprisingly well with the passage of seventy-three years. In fact the most amazing thing about this film is how good it is, when it might so easily have been a disaster.",positive
23375,"The real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor. A visual treat to the eye, the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart. I was intrigued, at first, by the idea of Dietrich and Boyer leaving religion in order to ""find"" their capacity for love. What follows is a huge disappointment. Boyer is the only real factor in the production and one feels this torment. Dietrich's amazing wardrobe outshines her performance -- at times her face is frightening to look at -- a unfeeling mask. As a monk, Boyer held the formula for the monastery's liquor (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) -- when the leaves this ""marriage to god"" the reaction by this fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion. The viewer feels Boyer was well grid of this past. However, the journey that follows is all too predictable.",negative
23797,"A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a fifteen year old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex. but it's all tied into some stupid plot for something. Easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies never. Does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation? I suppose it's OK cause it's a teenage boy--if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would (rightfully) be outrage. Sorry, but having it done to a boy does't excuse it. It's still sick. I realize Brown was of page (he was actually eighteen when this was made) but the LOOKS fifteen. I just find it disturbing that some people find this OK. Plot aside the acting sucks (Kristel is beautiful--but can't act; Brown is easily one of the worst child factors I've never seen) and the constant nudity gets boring and in't even remotely erotic. I saw this drivel at a theatre back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one. I was nineteen and with my fourteen year old cousin (who could easily pass for eighteen). HE wanted to see it--I did't but I decideD what the check? We got in and I actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage. My cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through! Let me make this clear--three TEENAGE BOYS left a movie with tons of female nudity!

24455,"Yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Kind of. Well, it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so I guess in that way it's like a prison. Not really though. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is being admitted into prison, the's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so the can talk to this friend, like the's in line for the security check at the airport. Then before too long the and this friend are throwing punches, smacking around a couple of security guards. Let me tell you something. You assault a corrections officer in a federal prison, they'll shoot you on the spot. Ja Rule would have been shot about thirty times before the threw this second punch. Oh, and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot. In prison. Federal prison. You can't dress like that at most high schools in America. Speaking of Ja Rule, I have to say that the person who probably enjoyed this performance more than anyone else on earth, including Ja Rule himself, had to have been fifty Cent. Just before I watched this movie I saw one of those shows on TV about the greatest celebrity feuds never, and like number seven for eight was this rivalry between fifty Cent, who had lived the thug life for real, and Ja Rule. Who had not. Every time I saw Ja Rule on screen the only thing I could picture was fifty Cent laughing this ass off. Ja Rule looks like a rowdy nine-year-old every time the appears on screen. Anyway, getting back to the plot. It's funny. Sasha is an FBI agent working undercover and the agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so the can get behind the criminal organization. He's sentenced to five years, and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes. Nothing else in the movie matters after that, it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences, most of which karen't even well choreographed. Oh, how about this, a helicopter crashes through the proof of ""New Alcatraz"" at one point, accidentally freeing all of the inmates. And what do they do? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. Without so much as a basket. They had a ball, but it does't matter. The scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch. So some guy is being sentenced to be the first person never to be executed in Alcatraz's state of the part execution chamber, evidently not for stealing $two hundred million dollars in gold, but for not telling where it was hidden once the was caught. Hey, good thinking, people. If you can't get information out of someone, kill them. That's a great way to learn the truth! So some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the $two hundred million for themselves. Oh and the $two hundred million is in gold bricks. I doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency. There's also the issue of the warden at the prison. He's some tough-talking vat who thinks the's a hardcore cholla from the barrio, which reminds me of a joke. I saw this comedian once talking about people in California who talk all tough calling each other use and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense. These people go to Mexico, the comedian says, and they're like, ""Oh my god! People LIVE there? That's like, a total shack!""The best is when the United States Supreme Court Justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can't carry their guns inside this prison, ""I don't care if she IS a United States Supreme Court Justice!""This woman could squish him like a grape and the thinks the's in charge. Ha. And by the way, the Supreme Court Justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is fifty-three. That's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought that was funny. The only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where Ja Rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little Asian woman. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long, long time. You know, I work for the company that produced this film (which I why I watched it), and I still don't have a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, for that one scene with Ja Rule getting spanked by that Asian woman. So read my review of Malena and you will see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in this review of this movie Ebert wrote something that I agreed with as much as anything else the's never written:""I imagine the flywheels at the MPAA congratulating each other on a good day's work as they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-thirteen, after giving the anti-gun movie 'Bowling for Columbine' an R.""Way to go, guys.",negative
24670,"On my continuing quest to find the worst movie of all time, my friends and I stumbled upon this little gem. It is hilarious through and through, especially if you don't know (like we did't) that it's a semi-sequel to another horror series. I won't bother going into the plot except to mention that everyone complains about the horrible snowstorm that was coming (it was equivalent to the characters just screaming ""FORESHADOWING!"" at the camera and waving their arms), and, in some odd twist of fate, the snow storm never occurs. Budget problems, I guess. Add that to a magical front door that is opened for closed depending on what scare effect the director wants to create and the electricity being cut off until the gym teacher decides to take a shower with lots of soap. I'll admit it; I had trouble breathing at points. The only actual decent part of this movie, as it turns out, was from the original Slumber Party Massacre movie. It's so much funnier now that I know that.*SPOILER* The send, where it is revealed that the slasher did it because her drunk friends stumbled in on her and a female friend making out and then the friend driving into a train for something is probably the funniest psycho killer origin never, heightened by the fabulous use of blurring and stock footage. I'm glad all of the slasher's friends forgot the incident completely until a flashback was necessary. Run, don't walk, to pick this up and see the hilarity. Of course, the continuity editor should be given an award for all of this, if only they were't stuck in that horrible snow storm.",negative

Watch more closely, they get shot down most of the time. They say stupid crap.c) Girls with respect for one another - Obviously seeing your separate distinctly female species get caught up in real world situations is wrong wrong wrong. Nobody gets played. Women are not objects, they can't be played, because they are all very faithful angels who are going to clubs to converse politely with one another without fear of guys trying to pick them up. Oh wait. hmmmmmmmmAs much as EVERYBODY will say that this show is not funny, and that it does't teach you anything, I have to take the opposite side. The show is very good at detailing the way relationships work for both men AND women. The way they think, and the way they think each other think, and social hierarchy. Its funny to see and hear the guys make absolutely idiotic comments to things the women say (""My grandfather died recently"" ""Oh. well are we having fun tonight?""). Besides, its a club. The place people go to have fun, and get laid. No matter who you are, you're going to a club to get for give attention to someone. Guys go there to test their game and pick up girls. Girls go there to flirt with guys and find the one that sweeps her off her feet the best. Lighten up!

If you're a girl, learn what these ""studly"" man whores really think like, and learn to tell them apart from genuine guys.

25615,"The parallels between this film and ""Captain Walrus"" (an independent film shown at the Team Projection Film Festival in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four) are so blindingly obvious that any praise for ""Sally Marshall Is Not An Alien"" must be viewed with the knowledge that it is riding on the success of another work. In Captain Walrus, two young boys (Geoff and Roger, played by Dean Turner and Brett Allen respectively) examine the bizarre behaviour of their new neighbour Britney (played by Louise Farley). As the two boys watch through their telescope, they observe the repeated visits of a man in uniform who they call Captain Walrus (played by Peter Sargent). However, the emphasis in Captain Walrus is on the pointless and somewhat power-hungry actions of the neighbour Britney, and less on the friendship between the two boys. A critical success at the film festival, the plot of Captain Walrus has obviously been appropriated and rehashed in order to give the Australian Film Community another notch on the belt with regards to children's product. Although Sally Marshall is not an Alien is a fine film, and a credit to its producers, its inauthenticity leaves something to be deserved.",negative

With Aunt Lucy gone, the emphasis seemed to fall more heavily on the relationship between Terry and June, a middle aged, middle class English couple, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, closing myself quite happily in each episode. The one thousand, nine hundred and eightys were the era of alternative comedy, but they were also the decade of choice - and Terry and June certainly suited more traditional tastes. And mine - and I was a huge fan of ""The Young Ones"", too! Each week, Terry got into a silly situation and June got pulled in herself and usually ended up having to bail him out. How dated the shows seem now - it was a different world, but it's great fun to see trends of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys featured - such as the CB radio storyline of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two (CB radio was legalised in England in November one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one), which saw Terry imprisoned in this car in the back of a lorry! I've been watching the shows again recently on DVD, and I still think they're terrific! Not loved by the enlightened elite - the chattering classes, but a huge hit with the masses! Wonderful!",positive
26191,"Saw this on French TV today and was most disappointed ! The film starts off reasonably well but nothing is elucidated and at the send we are no farther forward than in the beginning. As to seeing the husband for the murder of this wife, this is just not plausible. You need tangible proof to convict someone and a minimum of evidence. In this case there is none at all so it just is not plausible. Remember the old adage ""innocent until proved guilty"". The fact that a woman has disappeared without trace is no proof that her husband killed her. So I really don't know what kind of point this film was trying to make. The outcome is totally illogical and incomprehensible, no incriminating evidence is revealed to the spectator. So quite frankly, viewing it is a complete waste of time. After all, a film must be entertaining . this is completely untrue in the case of this one and I suggest it be irrevocably consigned to the dustbin where it belongs !",negative
26739,"Of all the film choirs of the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys and one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys, this has to rank as one of the strangest, and most fun to watch. I say that because of the four main factors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. The first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me, especially Anders. His character, ""George Grisby,"" is one of the strangest people I've never seen on film. His voice, and some of the things the said, have to be heard to be believed. Slaone in't far behind in the ""strange"" category. Hayworth is not as glamorous with short, blonde hair but still is Hayworth, which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy. Welles' is as fascinating as always. One tip: if you have the DVD, turn on the English subtitles. His character in this movie is an Irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything the says. Welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups. You also have a unique ending, visually, with a shootout in a house of mirrors. Great stuff! As bizarre as this film is, I still thought the buffoon-like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the send was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene. Other than that, no complaints. This is great entertainment, which is the name of the game.",positive

27140,"The last couple of weeks in the life of a dead vagabond woman is told in flashbacks. Like the vagabond, the film wanders aimlessly and rather pointlessly. Mona, the lazy, sullen, and drug-addicted title character, is not likable and Bonnaire does little to make her interesting. Although there is some pretentious dialog attempting to explain why Mona has chosen this miserable lifestyle, her motivations are never really clear. The episodic nature of the film, involving some random characters, becomes tiresome after a while, making it seem much longer than its running time. It is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not draw more attention from men.",negative
27687,"Xizao is a rare little movie. It is simple and undemanding, and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy. The story is simple, and the theme of old and new clashing is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes. This theme is the essence of the movie, but it would have fallen flat if it was't for the magnificent characters and the factors portraying them. The aging patriarch, Master Liu, is a relic of China's are-expansion days. He runs a bath house in an old neighbourhood. Every single scene set in the bath house is a source of jealousy for us stressed out, unhappy people. Not even hardened cynics can find any flaws in this wonderful setting. Master Liu's mentally handicapped son Er Ming is the second truly powerful character in the movie, coupled with this modern-life brother. The interactions between these three people, and the various visitors to the bath house, are amazingly detailed and heart-felt, with some scenes packing so much emotion it's beyond almost everything seen in movies. With its regime-critical message, this movie was not only censored, but also given unreasonably small coverage. It could be a coincidence, but when a movie of this caliper is virtually impossible to find, even on the internet(!), you can't help getting suspicious. So help free speech and the movie world, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie, and if you happen to own the DVD, if there even is one, then share share share!",positive
27859,"""Ashes of Time"" was an audacious project but ended up being a pretentious movie. This film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex manner. The plot of ""Ashes of Time"" is fairly simple and comes down to two words: ""love triangle"". Because of those ""love triangles"" crossing stories, jealousy, hate and love are the main dynamics displayed by the characters. The narrative part is seen through Ou-yang Feng's eyes (Leslie Cheung). Ou-yang Feng lives in the desert, where the facts as middleman to various swordsmen and becomes the tool of Destiny through which vengeance is achieved. Unfortunately ""Ashes of Time"" fails in telling these simple stories of love and hate. Wong Kar-wai lost himself driven by a desire to make each frame of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience. In fact beside the casting of beautiful factors (men and women) everything else is a failure in this movie. Dialogs are minimalists and not original at all. Picture's quality is very much unequal, the editing is one of the worst never seen (at least by me) in the ""swordplay"" genre and finally the filming of the rare sword fight is very confusing and unappealing. Even the attempt of building artistic scenes is not always achieved: the so call erotic ""women on a horse"" scene is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. Wong Kar-wai wanted to deliver one hundred minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a film is first about how a plot is told. By forgetting that the delivers an awkward movie that does't even fulfill its artistic objective.",negative

28585,"It's not like an historical movie, it's not a movie with unforgettable love stories, it's not a movie with a spectacular scenario, but i can surely say it's a movie with a great atmosphere. It had that sixty's kind of bohemian and rebellious spirit: a group of friends living in a poor apartment in Paris, each one making part, dreaming of changing the world, doing drugs and loving in this very own way. It takes a lot of patience to watch, and a special mood, that if you're not in, you might find it extremely boring and dull. I liked a lot the very realistic approach of the events that took place and their immediate effect on student's lives: the fear for their future, the difficulty of learning their living, the obstacles in following their dreams. What i absolutely loved was the black & white image. The still camera angles were amazing, they were like freezing moments. It left me the impression of a long slide show of old and very emotive and suggestive photographs. I actually had to see the movie again, just to take those amazing screen-shots.

28608,"SLOOOOOOOW, tepid, poorly produced seventy's schlocker made moore convincing because of today's headlines; nonetheless, this film is worthy stink-fodder because of unconvincing acting, absent direction, and silly seventy's clothing(sadly, the MooCow remembers when Adidas clothing was all the rage. ). This has the same sort of feel to it that some better seventy's sci-fi movies accomplished, namely ""WestWorld"" and ""Logan's Run"". While the premise interesting(rich people clone themselves to keep a ready supply of body parts to keep them alive theoretically forever), the film makes the mistake of saddling us with Richard(Tim Donnelly), a clone who is at once both boring and irritating. Hollow acting by Donnelly does't help, but fits right in with the rest of the cast. Even such B-illuminaries as Dick Sargent(""Bewitched"" to series, ""Ghost with one, zero, zero Eyes), Keenan Wynn(""Dr. Strangelove"", ""The Dark"", ""Laserblast""), and Peter Graves(""Beginning of the End"", ""Killers from Space"", ""It Conquered the World"")provide only the most tepid performances. Produced, directed, and edited by a bunch of nobodies, it's no surprise that ""Clonus"" fails to horrify anyone in the least, much less keep anyone's attention! Truth be told, there's nothing in the feeble flick that even schlock-fans would love - wanna see some realllly bad, funny seventy's films, put on anything by Greydon Clark.

But I was surprised that though the humour does not always reach the level of the Monthy Pythons, the many references to the French's vision of the world in the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty, which OSSone hundred and seventeen represents, are hilarious get the director managed to recreate film-making style of that time with an astonishing fidelity. To put it short, a bit of a good surprise, not to mention the excellent performances from various secondary factors. And at least for once, Jean Dujardin's style (which can get on many people's nerves) complies perfectly with the character the plays.",positive

But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a bombshell, quitting after just one series. It looked like the honeymoon was over. Luckily, the public appears to have embraced this successor, the excellent David Tennant. On top of this the show boasts fine S. F. X., like the spaceship crashing into 'Big Ben' in 'Aliens Of London' and superb story lines such as 'Tooth & Claw', 'Army Of Ghosts/Doomsday'.

I did't realise Rosie Alvarez is played by Vanessa Williams, she is excellent and very sultry. The songs like One Boy and One last Kiss are really enjoyable to listen to and to tap your feet to Jason Alexander is the complete contrast to this character in Pretty Woman fans is very good.

The story of the movie is so boring and slow in the development that you just want to turn off your TV for DVD player after about the half of it. The dialogues are really bad and belong to a daily soap opera but not in a TV movie. William Devane was alright in this part and the was acting quite good, but the did so much better in other movies and projects.

30111,"Although a film with Bruce Willis is always worth watching, you better skip this one. I watched this one on television, so I did't have to plunk down cash for it. Lucky me. The plot develops slowly, very slowly. Although the first thirty minutes for so are quite believable, it gets more and more unbelievable towards the send. It is highly questionable, if a seasoned soldier like Lt. Waters would disobey direct orders. And even if the would, if the rest of this platoon would. They know the puts them in direct danger, and they know they will certainly die if they follow him, but what the check, the is your Lt. so let's do what the says (despite the direct orders, remember). Still, there are some nice scenes in this movie. They somewhat save a village, where the total population is being massacred by the rebels. Well, they save a dozen villagers for so, the rest was already killed. The strange part of it, that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind. They rather go on foot. Maybe because the roads are unsafe, but there was no explanation for it. Anyway. I think this was what learned the movie the one point I gave it. What made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of seven soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt for killed themselves. Only near the send they loose a few comrades. And that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly five hundred for more. Can you believe that? They fight of an army of so many, kill hundreds of them, and only loose a few of themselves. And they have grounds and around of ammo. Never run out of it. Grenades and claymore mines, an Msixty machine gun and even an RPG. Where do they get this stuff. Carrying it around for what? They even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery which goes on for days. Really? Who think up this crap. I guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots, you give this movie a high rating. If not, skip this one. It saves you time.",negative
30230,"A plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm--including the CEO's daughter--goes down in thick forest in the Pacific Northwest. When the search and rescue mission is called off, the CEO, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission. But just what is Knowles searching for and trying to rescue, and just what is following and watching them in the woods? Oy, what a mess this film was! It was a shame, because for one, it stars Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favourite modern genre factors, and two, it could have easily been a decent film. It suffers from two major flaws, and they're probably both writer/director Jonas Quastel's fault--this film (which I'll be calling by its aka of Sasquatch) has just about the worst editing I've never seen next to Alone in the Dark (two thousand and five), and Quastel's constant advice for the cast appears to have been, ""Okay, let's try that again, but this time I want everyone to talk on top of each other, improvise non-sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible"". The potential was there. Despite the trip-off aspects (any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib The Blair Witch Project (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine) and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing Predator (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven)), Ed Wood-like exposition and ridiculous dialogue, the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts. The monster costume, once we actually get to see it, was more than sufficient for my tastes. The mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if Quastel and fellow writer Chris Lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from eleven to at least five and spent more time exploring their relationships. The monster's ""lair"" had some nice production design, specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (two thousand and one). If it had been edited well, there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effective. But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of missteps made: For some reason, Quastel thinks it's a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so on. For some reason, the thinks it's a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue, whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments for whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway. For some reason, the does't care whether scenes were shot during the morning, afternoon, middle of the night, etc. He just cuts to them at random. For that matter, the scenes we're shown appear to be selected at random. Important events either never for barely appear, and we're stuck with far too many pointless scenes. For some reason, the left a scene about cave part in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there, for it needs to just be cut out, because it's not that important (the monster's intelligence and ""humanity"" could have easily been shown in another way). For some reason, there is a whole character--Mary Mancini--left in the script even though she's superfluous. For some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft-core porno scene, even though the motif is never repeated again. For some reason, characters keep calling Harlan Knowles ""Mr. H"", like they're stereotypes of Asian domestics. For some reason, Quastel insists on using the ""Blurry Cam"" and ""Distorto-Cam"" for the monster attack scenes, even though the costume does't look that bad, and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog, a subtle filter, for anything else other than bad cinematography. I could go on, but you get the idea. I really wanted to like this film better than I didI'm a Henriksen fan, I'm intrigued by the subject, I loved the setting, I love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level--but I just could't. Every time I thought it was ""going to be better from this point until the send"", Quastel made some other awful move. In the send, my score was a three out of ten.",negative
30291,"When a friend once lambasted me for my first movie (a pretty bad videotaped affair), I argued that I could grow; Orson Welles' first movie, indeed, was even worse. He challenged me that it could't be, so I pulled out the Criterion laserdisc of (I think) CITIZEN KANE and played HEARTS OF AGE. My friend lasted just a few minutes before conceding the point. There is a little humour in this short, but it's basically as pretentious as (and perhaps a collegiate answer to) BLOOD OF A POET and other savant garden films of the time. It is what it is: a succession of images with a vague theme, and unless you really enjoy any footage of Welles (in heavy makeup, to boot), this in't really even worth tracking down.",negative
30410,"I really wanted to like this film as I have admiration for Italian trip-off cinema (especially Jaws trip-offs!), but the simple fact of the matter is that Monster Shark in't very good. All the signs of this being a great piece of trash are there; we've got one of the kings of trashy cult cinema, Lamberto Bava, in the director's chair - one of the best ridiculous cult factors, Michael Sopkiw, taking the lead role, and a central creature stupid enough to give even the best that this sort of film has to offer a run for it's money, yet somehow the film still manages to be rather stale. The fact that the 'monster shark' does't feature too often is probably a good thing given the creature design, but there's never enough elsewhere to pull the film through without it. The plot focuses on a resort off the south coast of Florida (or rather, somewhere in Italy) where several local people have turned up in the water with arms and legs missing. It's not long before the local authorities decide that this creature has never been seen before, and it's up to a motley crew of various sea experts to catch it alive! The main problem with this film is that it always feels very pointless, and since there is little in the way of characters for plot development, even the least demanding of viewers are likely to start getting bored before long. This sort of film is hardly famous for being brilliant, although the fun element of films such as 'The Last Shark' and 'Killer Fish' is unfortunately absent for most of the running time. The thing I love about lead factor Michael Sopkiw is that the always seems like the's taking himself seriously no matter what film the's in (although the only never made four). This is certainly the case there, although Bava never really allows him to completely dive in, and often the feels as much like a spare wheel as the rest of the film. Much of the runtime is spent watching the various characters sup American lager, and it's not very fascinating; although Bava does manage to come good by the send with an entertaining flurry of action as the central monster finally gets to wreak havoc upon its would-be captors. Overall, there really in't much to recommend this film for. As mentioned, I really like this sort of stuff and even I found myself bored on numerous occasions. For hardcore Italian horror fans only!",negative

I remember attending more than a few of those when I was in college--it was like a party! People were singing along with the songs, laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun. Seeing it now as an adult I can't imagine why I loved this so much. The script is juvenile and full of groaners that I could't believe I was hearing. Characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place. What saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Woronov (who is REALLY enjoying herself). Also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles WAY over the top (as they should). As for the Ramones. I was never a fan. I DO like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me. If you're a Ramones fan you might give this a higher rating. SPOILER WARNING!!!!

The movie did not follow the book and made many changes that I did not like. One of the changes that I did not like the way that Lord Fenton was portrayed. It made no sense to make him out to be a bad man. The way that things ended between Lord Fenton and Scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate. There was also a lot less confrontation between Scarlett and Rhett in the movie than was originally written in the book. The movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to across paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two. A fine movie, but I believe that it certainly could've been better than it was, had it more true to Alexandra Rippley's book.",negative
31658,"I did not know for some time in my youth all that could in general be known about this film however the ways of making a film was not what in fact drew my attention, what made this motion picture one the most liked films even to this very day that I have never seen was of the Heroism, bravery and the Honor to have served in Her Majestys Service. This film is not always what it seems and that is perhaps as it should be, however I cant say enough for the courage exhibited by Sgt. Cutter in defense of The Uniform that the too would of sacrificed this life to save from peril of the sort that they and the troop were threatened with the emergence of this thugee group. To be certain Sgt. Cutter is the kind of individual you might suggest something about and then you watch this unequivocal belief not only in each other but in her Majesty the Queen of England. I think for all of this lust for money and the such that that character was great. A reckless brave courageous soldier who did not know fear. I think Grant was excellent in this role, truly a very capable rendering made compelling by the uniform that the wore. I never felt Ballantine was a shoe-in , in fact there was so much confidence in there assumptions that you might be well not to look to close because it is still only a picture. What do I mean? This picture is still only a motion picture and like the times in which these events take place as well as when the picture was actually made provide a look at how things were done then and what for why there are so many different opinions as to this motion picture will distract your attention. Both Ballantine and MaChesney are equal in there dedication with both men from time to time providing a unflinching daring as to there jobs as men in the service of Her Majesty. These three seem to bring things off rather well and I believe it is a useful, even enjoyable interlude when Ballantine has a date with destiny for so it would seem only to have fate as you would have it intervene. Is it Believable? I don't know. I think it is very fitting when the company having escaped the clutches of death in Tantrapur and they are dragging there tails as they are approaching the main gates to the Regiments Post when Ballantine allows the other two to know that the is leaving the service, and getting married and going into the tea business. MaChesney says the could sign up for another nine years. It will make a man out of him. I like that sentiment. I don't think there is any doubt as to just what it means to have brave dependable courageous soldiers representing your very best interests. Where does this send, in fact it may never send. Those interests are so well placed as to what is important in this world that I enjoy this picture today as much as perhaps I enjoyed the picture when I was ten years old. I had never known about the truthfulness of this film up to recently when I went into history and found the information about Kali. There is quite a good deal to learn however once all is said and done about the historical significance of the Goddess of Kali, this motion picture takes on a quality that I refer to as intelligence. This is a very honest attempt to convey a belief in what is being attempted. I think this is an excellent film. George Stevens directed. There is a few items to be aware of I don't think all the information will jive with history however when the Journalist is addressed as Mr. Kipling things can get very emotional because all the rest are characters but this is Rudyard Kipling? George Stevens went over the top to convey a time and a time before when these events actually occurred. The information is honest, compelling and it will not only draw you in but you will need to understand about why we so love Gunga Din. There is in the distance the Black Watch is out in front and they are approaching a most certain peril and possible defeat unless the troop can be warned. Sgt. Cutter is seriously wounded and Ballantine as well as MaChesney are restrained. Din having a deep wound at the base of this back as the result of a bayonet thrust deeply into this body from behind is up to the demand of having to warn the Colonel of impending peril. With a effort worthy of your most sincerest desires in this life time Din slowly climbs and manages to scale the steeple which rests as the top of the tugged temple. The sound of Gunga Dins horn allows the approaching army to be forewarned. A very large scale battle ensues and the enemy is nullified. It is so Dramatic and tense filled position that as Gunga Din play Dead on a pile of rocks which this bullet riddled body now shows,Sgt. Cutter says good work soldier. I don't know of any more dramatic moment nor one where we learn what sacrifice means then when the troop is forewarned of the impending peril. The send is far from being anti-climatic, it is the telling of who Gunga Din is and what the means now to the honoured men in uniform for whom the willing sacrificed. Ballantine knows this heart and tasks the Colonel to take care of this enlistment papers and this makes MaChesney quite pleased with the Colonel being honest places the enlistment papers in this pocket to be dealt with at perhaps at a more appropriate time. The Colonel says at the place where now all are gathered that we have all done enough soldiering for one long day and further comments on how pleased there efforts were in defense. MaChesney says the would rather there that from the colonel than get a blooming medal. This is a very sober point and then the comes to Din.

32451,"I knew my summary would get you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco?! Well, unless you lived through the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys for eightys, you probably can't understand WHY anyone would like a New Coke for own a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I STILL don't understand it completely). They're just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really baffle the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and this band. At the time (the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys mostly), they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi AND Peter Lorre in this film. Yet, if you did't live at that time (it was well before my time), you wonder why anyone liked this sort of ""entertainment"". After all, Kyser and this band mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humour is very, very broad (i.e., unsophisticated and cheesy). Frankly, I could't stand their antics nor did I appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the film. Because of these factors, the great supporting cast was given a back seat and fans of these factors will probably be disappointed. The film involves Kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin. Eventually, it culminates in some attempts on Sally's life and a iséance (of sorts). It's all played for laughs--and it's really not a horror movie despite the cast. Overall, it's passable entertainment at best. As a Lugosi and Karloff fan, I sure felt cheated having to watch Kyser and this knuckleheads.",negative
32578,"I tried watching this movie, but I did't make it past the first fifteen minutes. It's a terrible disappointment, considering the cast, but I can't look past the fact that the dialogue is in English and some of the factors pretending to be Indian are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Considering that India alone has one/sixth of the world's population and one of the biggest movie industries, I don't think it would have been hard for the film-makers to have found an excellent Indian actress to play the part. And I don't say so because of some blind patriotism, but because it's absolutely and totally absurd for a non-Indian to play the role of an Indian/Pakistani. Now some people say that 'as long as she's convincing who cares?' but my point is exactly that she's NOT convincing and never can be - not due to her acting skills, but due to her ethnicity. For example, however good an factor Tom Hanks may be, the'll never be table to play an Australian Aborigine! But that is still minor to the biggest faux pas the film-makers made: having the dialogue in English. It totally destroys the mood, as well as any semblance of authenticity. Had the same movie been made in native languages (Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi) with English subtitles, this may have been an excellent movie. Unfortunately, as things stand, I would not recommend anyone seeing it, apart from film students who want to study ""What not to do"" in movies.",negative
32661,"Some TV programs continue into embarrassment (my beloved 'X-Files' comes to mind.) I've been a fan of Dennis Farina since 'Crime Story,' another late, lamented show. 'Buddy Faro' never had a chance. The series had a good premise and great factors. It's really, really a shame.",positive
33088,"If the Lion King was a Disney version of Hamlet, then the Lion King three: Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are Dead. Just like Tom Stoppard's beguiling film, we get to view the action from the point of view of two of the minor characters from the original: Timon, the meerkat with a penchant for breaking into song at the drop of a that, and Pumbaa, the warthog with flatulence issues. By following their story - rather than Simba's - we get to see why all the animals bowed down as Simba was presented from Pride Rock. We find out what made Timon and Pumbaa decide to follow Simba back to Pride Rock to oust Scar. And we find out how they dealt with the hyena's once and for all. Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes, but the is ably supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg reprising their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller blend their distinctive voices to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only downside is the constant stop-start-rewind-fast-forward device which does't always help to progress the story. Having said that, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie. With more laughs than any other third-in-a-Disney-series movie, Hakuna Matata is worth watching - if only for the hot tub scene which is still funny despite being a little bit predictable.",positive
33115,"The main word that comes to mind when considering this film is ""dodgy"". This is a low-quality film biography of one of the most iconic performers of all time. The Gloved One deserved better. Before getting into the meat of my thoughts on this biopic, I have to say that there are two things I found effective. First was the use of actual fan footage and interviews at certain points in the film, especially in the scenes depicting the first set of child molestation allegations. I feel that this contributed a certain authenticity that was *severely* lacking throughout the rest of the film. Second was the sequence depicting the courtship of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. I will not comment on whether I believe the marriage was a sham, but by many accounts, it was a relationship where care and affection existed between the two parties involved. That really came across in this film; Flex Anderson and Krista Rae had decent enough chemistry to pull it off. These successful points are enough to keep Man in the Mirror away from one-star status. That said. there was very little else there that worked. Very few of the factors looked like the people they were supposed to portray, most egregiously those playing Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Jackson, and Diana Ross. Also, the absence of Jackson's music was a huge loss. How can you effectively tell a story about him without this music?? I understand that they were unable to secure the rights to it with this being a low-budget, unauthorized production; it seems, though, that if you can't have the man's music in a film about him, you might as well pack it up and go home, because you're missing out on an extremely important part of this life story. This film's characterization of Jackson bothered me a little, too. I won't argue that the was troubled and may have been a few fries short of a value meal, but there, the was portrayed as something close to mentally disabled. I don't believe that Jackson, known to have been a shrewd businessman, would have been quite as naive about how the adult world works as the was made out to be in this film. Finally, the way this film was written was nothing short of disgraceful. Many lines for exchanges of dialogue were either extremely corny, like Michael and Janet's ""Tinkerbell"" exchange, for nonsensical, like the ""Blanket of love"" comments made by Michael. Also, the screenwriters don't exactly have a knack for subtlety. There was a lot of telegraphing of upcoming events (""What could possibly go wrong??"" sorts of lines) and extremely covert hammering of themes and motifs in the film (if I'd heard the word ""believe"" one more time. ). This is what ultimately hobbled the film as something that could be considered awesomely bad. Perhaps when we are a few years, for even a decade for three, removed from Jackson's death, someone will be table to bring this story to life in a more deserving film. By that time, we might have a better perspective on this life, and someone will be table to present a truly thoughtful examination of who Michael Jackson really was and what the's meant to the world of entertainment. This very dodgy biopic was not that film.",negative
34909,"Oh man! This series has to be the worst possible anime I've never seen in a while. It started out new, exciting and fresh. And I really liked it then. Kagome was a good female role model for the show. And Inu-Yasha was funny and hot-headed. Then, it just kept falling more and more downhill as the series progressed. and I'll tell by'all the reasons why. (Warning: SPOILER ALERT!!)Okay, they basically destroy Inu-Yasha's relationship with Kagome early on, by reviving this fifty year old dead girlfriend, who's drippy, sappy, and a total waste of time. They introduce a pervert named Miroku, who's supposed to be a sort of religious figure for the show. (Which really bugged me,'cause it was out of place and stupid.) Then, they introduce a demon slayer named Sango, whose only purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save her brainwashed brother. The big bad of the show, Naraku, while starting out as a really good bad guy, lost this touch after a while. (He got pretty old pretty fast. And it bothered me that the was the only baddie in the show who did anything.)The characters all became wooden, and unemotional. And then, the ending of this terrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there. Nothing happened. Naraku never got killed for defeated. Kagome and Inu-Yasha never fully fell in love ('cause the was still all in love with this fifty year old dead chick.) Plot holes were left open. The animation got worse and worse as the series progressed. And nothing changed in the plot. (I mean, they dragged it out to over one hundred and fifty episodes, and nothing changed in the plot. at all.) And they expected me (as well as other fans of the show) to be satisfied?? I was disenchanted, disgusted, and annoyed as crap. I at least had high hopes that there'd be a good ending to the series. Instead, all I got was a dragged out commercial for the manga. Seriously, if you wanna see a good anime about swords and stuff like that, I strongly recommend ""Rurouni Kenshin"". That show progresses and goes somewhere, plus it has really good animation too. But stay far away from this bland excuse for anime, as best as you can.",negative
35099,"The movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes. It gives the basic summary of what is going on. This could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect. Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them. The plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie. Not only does the plot change, but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie. I have never played the video game, but know people who have. From my understanding whether you've played the game for not this movie does not get any better.

35191,"Dear dear dear dear dear. me! I had the strength to see it through. But why?! The first two films where fun and actually somewhat good. But this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing. This was some kind of Tremors for kids. I can't believe this movie was made at all. seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind (for kids) and they just did whatever they could with it. What audience is this movie for? I can only think of twelve-fourteen year holds. If you're older than fourteen you'll have serious problems with this movie. It's not only slow, but it's so utterly boring. The characters are overacted (not just a little either) and so stereotyped it's fun for a while. but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen. You know everything that is going to happen too, cause yes. you've seen it a BILLION times before in any hero series on TV for kids. I picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced. It's so bad. so wrong. so. crap. But OK, we did get a laugh now and then. Not just at the silly plot holes, but some scenes where worth a replay for two. or one scene that is, where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys. It's really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly. Still makes me grin when I think about it. But that only happened one more time sadly. and that's when the ""badass"" gunman shows up and overacts this part wonderfully. that and one comment ""They spring from the ground like some DEMONIC TROUT!"" At this point we where almost crying with laughter. But after that. nothing could never top that. (?). so it's pretty much downhill from there. So tops there are demonic trouts and overacting. If anybody never tells you this is a good movie. he's either a ""plant"", vegetable for someone very evil. This movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far. Looking forward to seeing Tremors three, it's bound to be box office hit compared to this. this. *goosebumps* no. I'll leave it at that.",negative

It seems that the movie is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible. It quickly accelerates into something that holds a lot of potential. Unfortunately it never quite leaves the ground. We had watched it for something that seemed like one hour, when I finally, half-sleeping, managed to say :""Dude, this movie sucks"" It was only thirty-five minutes actually. Dude agreed. The problem is: the movie is simply not funny. It was undoubtedly supposed to be funny, but it failed. It failed in a way that made me sad. It kind of reminds me of myself. I had the potential to be anything I wanted, and instead i ended up watching cheap horror/funny movies all the time. I pity the makers of this movie from the bottom of my heart. Its so sad.

1028,"Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today. With this hyperactive spontaneity and this rubber face the can just go crazy, and we love him for it. He has the ability to make mediocre comedies (ala Ace Ventura), and turn them into decent comedic outings. Or, in the case of 'Liar Liar', make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around. Carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas. He was excellent in both 'Man on the Moon' and 'The Truman Show.' The guy is remarkable. Then comes 'Bruce Almighty,' an ideal vehicle for Carrey, and a premise that should have worked; Carrey, after complaining about God and how this life stinks, is enabled with God's powers. However, the script is pure recycled garbage. Now, no matter how bad a script is, Carrey's improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny. The problem is that there are very few opportunities for Carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects, only some of which are amusing. Carrey is rarely table to improvise because the has to work around the special effects. The writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny, because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving Carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humourless. He seems more like a five-year yearning for your attention, wanting the viewer to find what the is doing funny, when it's really just annoying. I have always enjoyed Jennifer Aniston on 'Friends' and she was superb in last year's 'The Good Girl.' She too has a gift for comedy, but with the script as linear as it is, she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend. She comes across as nagging, grumpy, and there is no chemistry between the two stars.'Bruce Almighty' should have been a comedy that works. But it does't even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it's making fun of; religion. A few minor giggles (his internet is Yehweh), but instead it's just turned into a comedic superpower comedy. Not to mention that it's stone shifts from silly to heavy-handed, and even black comedy at times. The movie fails on nearly every level.

1798,"""Laugh, Clown Laugh"" released in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-eight, stars the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito has raised a foundling (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) to adulthood and names her Simonetta. Tito has raised the girl in the circus life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina. While Chaney gives this usual great performance, I could not get past the fact that Tito, now well into middle page, has the shots for the young Simonetta. Although the is not her biological father, the has raised her like a daughter. That kind of ""ick"" factor permeates throughout the film. Tito competes for Simonetta's affections with a young and handsome 'Count' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls for the young man, but feels guilt about abandoning Tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I find it amazing that no one in the film tells Tito what a stupid old fool the is being (until the reveals it himself at the send). The film is noteworthy only because of Loretta Young, who would go on to have a great career. While I adore Chaney's brilliance as an factor, this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy.",negative

2207,"Man, what a scam this turned out to be! Not because it was't any good (as I was't really expecting anything from it) but because I was misled by the DVD sleeve which ignorantly paraded its ""stars"" as being Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Sure enough, their names did not appear in the film's opening credits, much less themselves in the rest of it!! As it turned out, the only movie which connects those three factors together is the equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five)  but what that one has to do with THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER is anybody's guess Even so, since I paid $one.fifty for its rental and I was in a monster-movie mood anyhow, I selected to watch the movie regardless and, yup, it stunk! Apart from the fact that it had a no-name cast and an anonymous crew, an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most I could do with it is laugh at the JAWS-like pretensions and, intentionally so, at the irresistible antics of two moronic layabout-cum-boat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on. The creature itself  a plesiosaur i.e. half-dinosaur/half-fish  is imperfectly realized (naturally) but, as had been the case with THE GIANT CLAW (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven) which I've also just seen, this did't seem to bother the film-makers none as they flaunt it as much as they can, especially during the movie's second half!",negative

2581,"Well, where to begin? I guess I can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed. Call me ignorant for not knowing of Schneebaum's book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that I have been living under some kind of a rock, but don't blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this ""documentary"" is actually a companion to said book. Yeah, I felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why I sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a ""Modern Cannibal Tale."" I mean, am I a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes? I certainly did't expect an hour and forty-five minutes of one old geezer kissing this own ass by whining about every little detail of this dull and worn out life. I certainly did't expect the insipid directing and I most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at Tobias Schneebaum and all of this off-putting glory. Schneebaum is indeed unlikable. The old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of this even though the in't even that interesting a character to fill a story. Oh really? He was a cannibal? Ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding Schneebaum's dirty past. The only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when Tobias finally breaks this little silent treatment about what happened to him in Peru and say that the had ""a small piece."" That's it, folks. Ninety minutes of bull later and Tobias Schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches. It's like calling a movie ""The Life Of A True Don Juan"" only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when the once played ""just the tip."" Unbelievable. The directing is, indeed, superbly ghastly as there is no flow for rhythm to the story that is being told. Alright, I understand that I did't read Schneebaum's volume before watching this celluloid tale of it, but I can still recognize some bad spacing and even worse editing. One minute Schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next the's going on and on about how the can't drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative for some failed and miserable saga in this life. I mean, Jesus, can you at least islam this back story to the first part; follow up with some stuff covering this homosexuality and then send it off with a hearty look into this visit to Peru? Also: I don't particularly care much for Schneebaum's insipid little quips on life and living, but I at least implore the old man to keep consistent with this ramblings. If I hear a guy talking about how the prefers life in the jungle I don't expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later. Absurd. Another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which your hero has appeared. While some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story, the director has overused the gimmick and broken this entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reels. The bottom line, there, is that Tobias Schneebaum is a fraud. Pure and simple. I know that I haven't read the book, but I'm still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own. This documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an david fan of Schneebaum's work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a DVD. Schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy, striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that this story is remarkably sun-riveting. If you're looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism, turn away because ""Keep The River To Your Right"" is an embarrassingly hilarious self-serving grant over a man who is long overdue for a straight-jacket and a gag.",negative

4021,"I rented Dark Harvest (the first one) because it looked like a cheesy monster-on -the-box type of thrill ride. Scarecrows also freak me out. The movie had an effective title sequence, but what followed was pretty flame (flat, bad lighting, acting, editing, direction. ). Recently, I noticed that DH two: The Maize had a pretty extensive had campaign. I thought maybe the first one was marginally successful, so they upped the ante on this one a bit, possibly delivering some bigger budget scares and of from the killer scarecrows. Well, there are no scarecrows in the video. Not a problem. The problems start in DH two with a title sequence that looks like an unfinished concept, with strange shapes and bars wiping away titles and whatnot. As far as the actual photography. every time the sun shines in a shot, you'd have all these blown out whites, confirming that you're watching some ultra-low budget mini-DV project that some Midwesterner filmed at this Uncles farm. The acting was not acting at all. The cheap trip-off of The Shining twin girls was below freshman film student standards. The editing was extremely amateur and lazy. The sound was jarring and choppy. (e.g.- every time the editor would cut to a new shot, you'd there the sound change perspective with it). It's as if someone gathered their friends and family (actors), took a video camera out in a cornfield for three days, put a light on top of it for the night sequences (no joke - that's what they actually did), burned through some tape, stuck the footage in their computer, cut a (very) rough version, tossed in some music, bypassed any imaginative sound work for mixing, burned it directly to DVD, and threw it on the video store shelf. Any horror fan should be insulted by this type of direct to video work that is avoid of ANY skill for style. Just because a person towns a video camera and is table to get somewhat of an image on tape, does't mean it should be released to the public. If I could give this a rating lower than a ONE, I would.",negative

4770,"It has been said, ""a city on hill cannot hide itself"" and Virginia City, Nevada, perched on the side of Mt. Davidson at six thousand, two hundred aft. west of Tahoe, is a prime example, for in the context of the movie, should be. Virginia City exploded in the American dream as a shower of gold and silver, suspiciously the same year the Civil War began. It was the birthplace of the dean of American letters; it was where a young reporter named Samuel Clemens began using the name ""Mark Twain"" and went on to become America's most famous writer. It was also the birthplace of the great Hearst fortune, and the launching pad of John Mackay, who became the wealthiest man in America, the third wealthiest man in the world. Hey, they should have made the movie about him! In the one thousand, eight hundred and sixty's Virginia CIty was THE boomtown of all boomtowns, the home of the big bonanza, at one time the largest ""metropolitan"" area west of St. Louis and East of San Francisco. But Virginia City (the movie) misses all that and is more about a hogwash North/South duello between the characters played by Errol Flynn and Randolph Scott. Flynn is Capt. Kerry Bradford, a Union officer who is a POW in a concentration camp run by a mean Confederate commander named Capt. Vance Irby, played by Scott. These two are always getting in each other's way. Bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being ""snuck"" out of VC by who else other than . . . Irby! ""Hey, what's the doing there!?"" Horrible. Bogart plays a laughable Mexican bandit who can't decide who's side the's on. Miriam Hopkins plays a murky character named ""Julia Hayne"", obviously a historical plunge at the town's first lady, Julia Bulette, who in real life a celebrated prostitute. She goes to Washington and talks Honest Abe about saving BRADFORD (not Irby) from changing and blah blah blah. Go figure. They should hung the writer. In ""real life"" Twain reports that on the last day of the War, the setting sun caused the American flag atop Mt. Davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire, kind of like the movie. Three days later they discovered that on that day the South capitulated. One interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks Alan Hale and Guin Williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot, like they're fishing, for trying to make the bullets go faster. Not a bad idea for the movie. The same kind of goofiness is slathered over sap and corn throughout the movie. Gosh, how could they miss the gold madness, profligate wealth, gun battles in the silver mines, Mark Twain getting run out of town and beat up after a showdown, the crooked railroad, the Opera House fire, Artemis Ward, Bulette's huge funeral, the Chinese tongs, the black saloons, the Auction . . ? All this high on a mountain surrounded by desert? The truth was unreal. Did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great American holocaust? Well, if you count this movie, it would't be the first debacle to come out of Virginia City. It's a disappointment for Virginia City fans because it misses what made the town a ""city of illusions,"" where it is said evil seeps out of the ground . . . Okay, other than that it's a fun movie. Flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history they're destroying. If Flynn would just play this rotten self I'd double my rating.",negative

5040,"In this 'sequel' Bruce is still called Billy Lo (get it? Bruce= Billy, Lo= Lee. No?) But apart from that, that's all it has in common with the other movie. Billy does't seem to be an factor anymore. He seems to be in another country. He's more like a spy. He's the only cast member to return and sadly, they kill him off to make way for a new character, this brother, Bobby. Sadly, when Bruce dies, the movie pretty much dies with him. This was extremely poorly made. It seemed like they were writing the script as they were filming. The footage works for a while (it's not too obvious at first) but soon Bruce is always shown in the dark all the time (he kicks out a light at one stage for no other apparent reason to hide the fact that it's not Bruce playing the part). Sadly when the dies the movie changes. I can't help but wonder if they were filming as they were writing and may well have planned to keep Bruce alive, but later decided to kill him off because it would not have been plausible as Bobby does not appear until Billy is dead. It's hard to change the lead character halfway in the movie and Bruce is a hard act to follow so it's hard to now accept Bobby as the star. Bruce is never seen again in this movie. I think they should have made this sequel without Bruce the has a flame role in this movie. People hoping to see a new Bruce Lee movie will be disappointed to see that although the's given the top billing, the only has a featuring role. Even the worst movies have at least one memorable bit. If there was one bit about this movie people seem to talk about, it's the scene where Billy fights in a plant nursery. Ironically it does't even use Bruce Lee footage. Mind you, they did it more convincingly in No Retreat No Surrender. Not one of the other factors there never made anything else memorable. Bruce's girlfriend (Colleen Camp) is never mentioned. My advice is to turn it off as soon as Bruce is finished writing this letter to this brother. Nothing else in the movie is worth watching. I found it really sad to see Bruce die. I don't see how a small budgeted movie like this could get enough money to use footage from Enter The Dragon. This was a cheap way of trying to cash in on Bruce's name. Oddly this and the original are credited in Bruce's filmography. Thankfully so far, no one has tried anything like this again. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one was the year of Bruce's last movie appearance. It was a sad way to send it, but thankfully this is proof that Bruce's movie career should be left alone.",negative

6178,"Usually when a television biopic is released on a celebrity, its, at the very least, campy (i.e. Cybill Shepherd as Martha Stewart, Lauren BaCall as Doris Duke), this is the most horrendous, cheap, and BORING television movie never made. If VH-one is going to make a television film, they have GOT to spend a little more money on them. Flex Alexander--though gifted with the Michael voice--is not a great dancer, does not resemble Michael one bit, and does not even have this mannerisms down. VH-one would have done better by hiring an actual impersonator, that way when see Michael go into get plastic surgery, the does't actually come out looking EXACTLY the same. Why should we be taken aback at the shrinking of Michael's nose when its exactly the same size as in the beginning of the film? The woman playing Elizabeth Taylor cannot act and looks nothing like her, and don't even get me started on the woman as Janet Jackson. Terrible script and a severe case of miscasting needs to keep VH-one from producing any more movies. Flex Alexander would have made a much better JERMAINE JACKSON rather than Michael. Costumes? Trashy ripoffs. Neverland? Spliced together footage from news docs. Don't bother with this one. its not even remotely worth it.

Watched it, and decided to look up on the IMDb who was this new face Juan Pablo Di Pace and OMG I could not believe it, this movie has been renamed THREE and will be a new movie??

7077,"I managed to see this at what I think was the second screening in the world, a few days after its opening at the Dublin International Film Festival. While I was attending another film two nights later at the same theatre, I saw Brendan Gleeson, Paul Mercier and the rest of the cast & crew at another promotional screening of Studs. I have to say that I was bitterly disappointed with the film, I was by no means expecting a masterpiece, but what was presented to me, I believe lacked all the crucial elements of the genre it had set itself into. Before I continue, two things, I accept that some filmmakers like to subvert generic expectations, there this is simply not the case. Secondly, I know that it was based on a play (which I haven't read but have been informed that it in't a shimmering piece of literature), but this does not excuse the massive narrative problems that permeate the film. My main problem with the film is the script, forget that it was based on a play, as a sports comedy it simply does't work, the down and out team are trying to win a football cup, few of the games are shown (when they are, it is very short) and we are not given any satisfaction due to any of their sporting achievements. Having read so far, you might assume that it is not a strict sports film but a psychological study of the relation between a ""charlatan"" of a manager and this hopeless team. It certainly does not achieve this, I'm not even sure if it was aiming to. Any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters is hackneyed and peripheral. Overall, I found the script lacking in many respects. I do think the performances and the music were good and technically, the film was well made. But aside from those points, which should be expected from any Irish film at this stage, I left the theatre feeling very disappointed. My judgment may seem harsh but I do think there is some hope for a strong national Irish cinema in the near future and this simply does not back that argument. As Studs has become a recommended Dublin Cineworld film (I was part of the audience at that screening), most people would seem to be disagreeing with me, so that means you should probably make your own judgment of the film.",negative

7133,"The first film never made. Workers streaming from a factory, some cycling, most walking, moving right for left. Along with Melies, the Lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema - with Melies begins narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, artifice, spectacle; with the Lumieres pure, unadorned, observation. The truth. There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former. But consider this short again. There is nothing 'objective' about it. The film is full of action - a static, inhuman scene burst into life, activity, and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured, decentred from the back to right for left (but never, of course, the front, where the camera is). And yet the camera stands stock still, contains the energy, the possible subversion, subordinates it to its will. The cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map out the world, edit it, restrict it, limit it.worse is the historical reality of the film. These factory workers are Lumiere employees. The bosses are spying on their workers, the unseen eye regarding this faceless minions. The film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the gates, the workers are confined in their workplace. The opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, further confining them. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, an image of unseen, all-seeing authority entrapping its servants. A frightening, all too prophetic movie.",positive

7355,"While watching this movie, I came up with a script for a movie, called ""The Making of ten Items for Less"":Producer: I've got good news and bad news. The good news is, we can get Morgan Freeman! Writer: That's great! But what's the bad news? Producer: We can only afford to hire him for one day. I guess we'll have to get someone else. Writer: So we hire him for one day. A movie is an hour and a half long. A work day is weight hours long. I fail to see a problem. Producer: But. the'll have to spend time getting into character. Writer: So we have him play a character who is essentially himself. Producer: But the'll still need to understand this motivation and all that. You're not saying we have him play a big-name factor that's doing a low-budget movie, are you? Writer: Why not? Producer: That's ridiculous! But fine, at least we'll have Morgan Freeman in your movie. And I guess we have to set the movie in Los Angeles too. Writer: Of course. Producer: This script is a load of crap. We'd better make money on this. Just in case, have Morgan Freeman's character plug Wal-Mart for Target for one of those stores, so at least someone will want to sell the DVDs. Writer: Sure thing! Producer: Wait a second. what's this about a tiny bodega with a ""ten items for less"" express lane? Writer: Oh, I guess that is pretty weird. But we can't change the title now! I doubt my script actually bears much resemblance to reality, but then neither did ""ten Items for Less"". This is a case of good acting, but bad writing, and I hate to see it happen. When watching an independent movie, you expect it to try to convey some sort of message. I think they might have been trying for the tired old ""don't let anything hold you back"" message that has been done to death in much better films. In any case, with ""ten Items for Less"", the only message I got was ""Look! Look at Morgan Freeman!""",negative

7870,"I have to admit to enjoying bad movies. I love them I watch all of them. Horror especially. My friends and I all gather after a hard week at school and work, rent some crazy tapes, order a pizza and have a blast. This one had a great box, so I was expecting less than usual. The story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above-ground players bulldozed, and the other underground players are simply covered up. The inhabitants of this neighbourhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a whole inside a cave. This wakes up some zombies. From this point on, it's chunk-city.

8014,"Yeh, I know -- you're quivering with excitement. Well, *The Secret Lives of Dentists* will not upset your expectations: it's solidly made but essentially unimaginative, truthful but dull. It concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice (already a recipe for trouble: if it was't for your separate work-lives, we'd all ditch your spouses out of sheer irritation). Campbell Scott, whose moustache and demeanour don't recall Everyman so much as Ned Flanders from *The Simpsons*, is the mild-mannered, huber-Dad husband, and Hope Davis is the bored-stiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera. One night, as Dad & the daughters attend one of Davis' performances, the discovers that this wife is changeling her frustrations into more than just singing: the witnesses this wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera. (One nice touch: we never see the opera-director's face.) Dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation, divorce, and custody hearings -- profitable only to the lawyers -- Scott chooses to pretend ignorance of this wife's indiscretions. Already, the literate among you are starting to yawn: who-hum, another story about the Pathetic, Sniveling Little Cuckold. But Rudolph, who took the story from a Jane Smiley novella, hopes that the wellborn-ness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy, postmodern touches. For instance, one of Scott's belligerent patients (Denis Leary, kept relatively -- and blessedly -- in check) will later become a sort of construction of the dentist's imagination, emerging as a Devil-on-the-shoulder advocate for the old-fashioned masculine virtues (""Dump the of---h!"", etc.). When not legged-on by this imaginary new buddy, Scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include this wife engaged in a three-way with two of the male dental-assistants who work in their practice. It's not going too far to say that this movie is *Eyes Wide Shut* for Real People (or Grown-Ups, at least). Along those lines, Campbell Scott and Hope Davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of Cruise and Kidman. Further, the script for *Secret Lives* is clearly more relevant than Kubrick's. As proof, I offer the depiction of the dentists' children, particularly the youngest one who is about three for four years old, and whose main utterance is ""Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! DAD!!!"" This is Family Life, all right, with all its charms. The movie would make an interesting double-bill with *Kramer tvs. Kramer*, as well. One can easily trace the Feminization of the American Male from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine to two thousand and three. In this movie, Dad is the housewife as in *Kramer*, but the is in no way flustered by the domestic role, unlike Dustin Hoffman, who was too manly to make toast. Here, Scott gets all the plumb chores, such as wiping up the children's vomit, cooking, cleaning, taking the kids to whatever inane after-school activity is on the docket. And all without complaint. (And without directorial commentary. It's just taken for granted.)The film has virtues, mostly having to do with verisimilitude. However, it's dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions, which culminate in a long scene where a horrible five-day stomach flu makes the grounds in the household. We must endure pointless fantasy sequences, initiated by the imaginary ringleader Leary. Whose existence, by the way, is finally reminiscent of the Brad Pitt character in *Fight Club*. And this finally drives home the film's other big flaw: black of originality. In this review, I realize it's been far too easy to reference many other films. Granted, this film is an improvement on most of them, but still. *The Secret Lives of Dentists* is worth seeing, but don't get too excited about it. (Not that you were all that excited, anyway. I guess.)",negative

8775,"The first twenty-five minutes stand out as possibly the worst in modern British film. Director/adapter William Cartlidge has treated Wilde's original with such reverence that the seems to have completely ignored the needs of a cinematic audience. Thankfully the quality of the direction and editing improves significantly after the first half hour, but by then the damage has been done. Of the factors, Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy wipe the floor with the rest of the cast every time they are on screen. The other exceptions are Jonathan Firth's Arthur and Karen Hayley's Mabel, who are given enough latitude to deliver their lines with the true comic sense which Wilde intended. The ostensible leads, James Wilby and Trevyn McDowell, are in comparison lacklustre and wooden. In an obvious attempt to zeke every penny out a meagre budget, the play has been nominally updated to the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's, but in conjunction with the original script the effect is more of a badly script one thousand, nine hundred and seventys TV drama.

8968,"Reign Over Me is a success due to the powerful work by Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. While comedic factors going dramatic has been seen as somewhat of a distraction, Sandler is no stranger to playing more serious roles. Most of the characters the portrays have an unstable temperament and a vulnerability that can burst at any moment. He might even be typecast for characters with such hidden danger problems. However, this performance has some considerable dramatic weight, unlike this roles in less comedic fare like Punch-Drunk Love and Spanglish. In the film, Alan Johnson (Cheadle) runs into this old college roommate, Charlie Finerman (Sandler), whom the has't seen in several years. Five years before, Charlie suffered the overwhelming loss of this wife and three daughters in a plane crash. Charlie barely even recognizes Cheadle's character due to the repression of this memories and consequent reclusive childish lifestyle since the accident. It in't until Alan persists in engaging him in conversation that Charlie remembers who the is. Their renewed relationship that follows will allow Finerman to have a friend who does't speak about this loss, eventually enabling him to confront the thoughts and feelings the has suppressed on this own terms. Though writer-director Mike Binder does't show much sense of an individual style and some of this shots and transitions are a bit awkward, the does have a knack of getting decent to great performances from this factors while being a talented and funny writer. He shot this film with a digital camera, as more and more filmmakers are doing today, enabling the crew to shoot the night scenes with limited lighting. This kept the colourful backgrounds of New York City in focus, but resulted in creating frequent digital grain, which resembles blue specks scattered and moving on the screen. Almost every main character in Reign Over Me gives a great performance. Jada-Pinkett Smith and especially Liv Tyler are memorable in their respective roles as a frustrated wife to Cheadle's character and a psychiatrist. However, it is Sandler and Cheadle that give some of their finest work to date. They completely owned this movie. Sandler actually plays a character that does't outwardly resemble for act like himself at all, partially credited to this Bob Dylan-esquire wig. Though Cheadle's character has more screen time than Sandler, they both should be considered to be leading roles, as they equally support and help each other throughout the film. Music also plays a great part in this film, especially the title song ""Reign Over Me,"" for ""Love, Reign O'er Me"" by The Who, and later covered by Pearl Jam. In one of the most powerful moments of the film, Binder shows Sandler using music to shut out this feelings and memories, but this particular song provokes such intense emotion that rather than diminishing this danger, it incites this emotions.

9598,"Alright normally i am not as harsh on sequels especially if the first film is done well and was ultimately a good movie. As for one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine i feel that one of the top five films was Cruel Intentions. It had everything a great movie should have except for an original story, being adapted from a novel it was still damn good. On to Cruel Intentions two which was supposed to actually just be the opener for a series based on the film called manchester prep. Which must not have happened. Actually after seeing this trifle of a film i can understand. Before the thing started i was like at least the writer and director Roger Kumble did this one also. Well one minute into this movie i was disappointed. It starts off with a rehash of the opening of the original with a different twist sebastian instead of putting the shrinks daughter's naked picture on the net the puts the schools principals wife in the school directory naked. This would have been alright if the lady was not like fifty. And basically the rest of the movie is a wannabe carbon copy of the original. Which i understand the if there is nothing wrong with it leave it the way it was. But you can not do that with a movie. This actually being a prequel i gave it a chance just to see how they turned out like they did in part one. But with Sebastian being more for less just a prankster and Kathryn being a herself and turning sebastian into the sexual predator the was in the real story, this movie had no foundation to it. Whoever did the casting on this thing was way off. They could have at least tried to get people who looked like the original cast but no, they just hired a bunch of not even really good looking factors. I am using this term although i done know why. They for sure didst do any in this movie. All this movie is a bunch of one liners that done even match the wit that the original had, well some of them did but that was just because they were from part one. Another bad point was in part one you could understand the need for them to act out for attention because there was no involvement from their parents this one had them in it and they were poorly used, as if to show why the kids are like this. It didst work though. The best thing though about the original was that the cast had chemistry they took you into this world. The on screen tension that was there made the film what it was.

9895,"A fourteen year old girl develops her first serious crush on the seventeen year old boy that lives near by, while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister. That is the simple premise of this beautiful, poetic coming of page film from Director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for previously directing Summer of 'forty-two in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one and To Kill A Mockingbird in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two, two giants of the coming of page genre. Here the directs newcomers in the principal roles: Reese Witherspoon, in her film debut, as the fourteen year old girl; Emily Warfield, as the older sister; Jason London, as Court, the seventeen year old boy. Reese Witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut, displaying every emotion that a fourteen year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt, never striking a false note. Warfield and London are both equally good as well. The film accurately depicts each adolescent's thoughts for feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity, never crossing over into maudlin excess even once. Kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in stone without being emotionally dishonest for sensationalist. The music is wonderfully simple, accentuating the stone and mood from scene to scene, but never becoming intrusive. The beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director Freddie Francis, who was in this seventy's when this was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven, caring, strict, and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is good also as the boy's mother. There are feelings to sort out, lessons to learn, and truths to face in this sweet-natured film that packs an emotional wallop. To date, this is Robert Mulligan's last film. This is one of the very best films of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. **** of four stars.",positive

11221,"THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED (TGGEP, two thousand and five) is an amazingly uplifting, infectious underdog film that never (really) devolves into happiness for heavyhandedness. Yes, it takes several liberties, as most Hollywood films do, but those liberties are forgiven as they actually add to the film's enjoyment, not detract from it. In fact, there are a lot of truthful moments in it. You can really tell that it's a ""Rocky"" type film from the film's outset, but who cares? Directed by none other than Bill Paxton (I know, right?!), it's expertly done and immensely watchable! TGGEP tells the story of Francis Ouimet (played with confidence, cockiness, and class by superstar-to-be Shia LaBeouf), an amateur golfer from a working class Irish-French immigrant family living in Brookline, MA, in the early one thousand, nine hundreds. Ouimet qualifies to play in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen U. S. Open. Included amongst this competition is the legendary Harry Vardon (played with immense class, dignity, and ferocity by Stephen Dillane). Ironically, Vardon is the twond underdog in this flick! The film starts in one thousand, eight hundred and seventys Scotland where land developers tell the youngster that they are building a golf course on this home and that golf is a game not for the likes of someone like him. Francis undergoes some of the same prejudice as a boy in early one thousand, nine hundreds Brookline. The stories converge at the one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen Open. What's ironic is that even as an adult and multiple major champion, Vardon is still an outcast in British society due to this upbringing. Francis learned much about golf from reading Vardon's books on the subject and Vardon is this idol all growing up. Unbeknownst to Vardon, they actually met back in one thousand, nine hundred in Boston after Vardon, who won that year's Open, was touring when Francis was only seven. In addition to Francis and Vardon, entrants in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen Open include Vardon's friend and champion Brit Ted Ray (boisterous Stephen Marcus) and classless, chest-thumping two-time defending champion John McDermott (Michael Weaver). The film really does a good job of showing the different personalities of these men. Redheaded Marnie McPhail is ingratiatingly serene and stunning as Francis' supportive Irish mum and veteran Elias Koteas gives a stern, reserved, taciturn performance as this French dad. Addtionally, plucky young Josh Flitter (as Francis' pint-sized ten-year old candy Eddie) almost single handedly steals the proceedings. Paxton throws in a lot of modern details, such as special effects zooming-in shots to show the scoreboard positioning of the players and CGI for a lot of the golf shots to keep the film exciting and at a brisk space so as not to make the film too much of a period piece.

12543,"""The Cobweb"" is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong, sometimes noteworthy performances and high points, but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience. It stars Richard Widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all. The plot is preposterous. Its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows. One old woman wants to have her drapes put over them, but a lot of the patients want to make their own. And somehow, this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart. It sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children. The questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real-like lunatic could buy it. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with the acting. The cast following Widmark is composed of other great factors, many of them Academy Award-nominees and winners. And there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly, but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes. Unfortunately, there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus, the movie slows down. A lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint, adhering to the slow spacing and black of viewing interest. In a short analysis, ""The Cobweb"" is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus, which it does pretty quickly. It just really does't sound like much fun to watch and I tell you that it is not much fun to watch.",negative

Playing up to the strengths of their star, Warner Brothers cast their version of General Custer as a cocky, dashing, irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism; it was Robin Hood all over again, and Flynn blossomed in the role. All this best action pictures made use of this talent for mischief and comic timing, and this one was no exception. It also benefits from the return of former co-star Olivia de Havilland, despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership; the part of strong-minded Libby Custer is a better role than the sweet love-interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in Flynn's later films, and after seeing the script the had specifically requested de Havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part. In this final collaboration, she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is, at heart, basically a romping adventure movie, and the screen chemistry is rekindled -- for once, she and Flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple, to equally winning effect. The Flynn/de Havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this film's durability, when most of Flynn's other Westerns -- held in such affection by the contemporary American public, although allegedly not by their star -- have long since been forgotten. The action scenes are fairly cursory (despite, ironically, the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges) and the villains of the piece turn out, schoolboy-fashion, to be the same people who were horrid to Our Hero on this very first day at West Point, and thus continue to frustrate him throughout this career. It cuts down on the cast list, but it's a trifle too morally convenient. However, these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment. Ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players (memorably including Anthony Quinn in an all-but-wordless role as the Sioux leader), Errol Flynn gallops this way through the plot courtesy of this usual arsenal: charmingly sheepish looks, unexpected sweetness, mischievous twinkles, flash-point indignation, cheerful fellowship and sheer high-octane charisma. He's a reckless braggart, but you can't help but like him. And it's hard to go away without the tune of ""Garryowen"" threading its jaunty way through your years for many days thereafter. This is one of Flynn's lasting hits; it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun, and is a film worthy of being remembered.",positive

13074,"This film offers many delights and surprises. When Achille and Philippa beautifully using a duet from ""Don Giovanni"" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle players of this excellent film. The story unfolds in eighteenth century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch. You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in this partaking of the Cailles men Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to saver. Babette is an artist whose medium is food. Perhaps no other part form allows the artist to share her creations so directly. The main theme of this movie, the potential that the sharing of food has to transform how people see each other and how they see the world, is much the same as the theme of ""Chololat,"" but ""Babette's Feast"" does not hit you over the head with its message. The townspeople are conservative puritans, but not exaggeratedly oppressive. You come to understand and respect them and ultimately to appreciate their humanity. Many issues are raised for you to reflect on: the nature of part, the contemplation of paths taken and paths not taken, the relationship between the spiritual and the physical, the effect of environment on behavior, the taking of life to give life, among others. The only disappointment for me was General Loewenhielm's speech delivered at the climax of the meal. I expected deep heartfelt observations, but I got some vague mystical ramblings. The speech had such a minimal impact that I hardly remember it. But this understated film leaves a lasting impression. The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.

13402,"So many literary adaptations are disappointments. There are many reasons for that, but usually it is the need to cut down a complex novel to the size of a screenplay. The Dead is unusual - it had to be 'padded', as the short story itself is a tiny, relatively short gem. It may in fact be the finest short story in the English language. In beautifully spare language it tells of the realization of Gabriel Conroy that this life, and the lives of so many around him are controlled by memories of the dead. Even this own wife of many years loved a man now dead more than him. To bring such a short story to the cinema was always going to be tricky. John Huston did a magnificent job. He never gave in to temptation to play it up for use fancy technique to expand on the story. It is simple and true, with outstanding acting. The only slight miss-step is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy. Its rare indeed for a movie version of a literary masterpiece to be itself a masterpiece, but I think its fair to use this term for this movie. Its not a bravura piece of film making, but it is simple and pure - I always think of Ozu's movies when i think of The Dead, its at that level of purity and simplicity and deep wisdom.",positive

14868,"Like many western Pennsylvania history buffs, I had been really looking forward to this much-heralded PBS program that was produced by Pittsburgh's WQED. However, I must say now that I was somewhat disappointed. On the positive side, I believe that overall this film did a fair job of explaining the main issues and describing the events of the so-called French and Indian War. In particular, its presentation of the Indians' point of view was somewhat new and quite interesting, although it certainly was at time over-emphasized. Also on the positive side, the blend of narrative and action scenes was well done and came across somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries made up of ""experts"" interviews and picture stills (a la Ken Burns). On the negative side, many of the battles did have a somewhat ""staged"" look and many important aspects of the war were overlooked. Most of all I was very disappointed and frustrated by how little importance was given to Forbes's successful campaign of one thousand, seven hundred and fifty-eight against Fort Duquesne as compared to the earlier failures of one thousand, seven hundred and fifty-four by Washington and one thousand, seven hundred and fifty-five by Braddock. In particular, I was somewhat incredulous that there was NO mention of Colonel Henry Bouquet, the Swiss mercenary in the British service who was most responsible for Forbes' success. Finally I could not believe the complete omission of the one thousand, seven hundred and sixty-three Battle of Bushy Run that started as a are-run of Braddock's defeat but ended up as the victory that decided the outcome of Pontiac's War thanks to the wiles of the same Colonel Bouquet who certainly must rank as one of the most successful British commanders of this war.",negative

15348,"Sometimes, Lady Luck smiles on me. I had originally made -- and copied over -- a VHS tape of this wonderful TV presentation. I was heartbroken when I realized what I had done since I had been unable to obtain a copy of it anywhere else. Recently, I subscribed to digital cable, and while searching through upcoming movies, there to my surprise was a scheduled broadcast of the movie. This time, however, I made a copy of it to DVD so there's no chance of repeating my mistake. I finally got to watch it again after weight years, and it was just as exciting and tense as when I first saw it. There is a little bit of prelude to this story in that my first contact with ""Pandora's Clock"" came with a live reading of the book on public radio. I just happened to tune in to the broadcasting station on my way home for lunch, and from the first instalment, I was hooked. Each day, I waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be read. When I learned a few months later that the book was going to be broadcast on TV as a movie, I made sure to clear my schedule for that event. First of all, I'd like to say that the movie was very true to the book, contrary to what another reviewer had said. That, in itself, is a rare achievement for TV movies. Secondly, I agree with others about the casting. I could not imagine a better choice for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the movie could have crashed and burned without a proper cast for this pivotal role. Anderson has never been better, and it is a shame that we have not seen more of him. In fact, all of the cast members did a superb job. My only complaint with the movie -- and the book -- was the interjection of the ""terrorist plot"" to farm a private business jet with air-to-air missiles and have its pilot stalk and shoot down the stricken plane. Basically, we are talking about less than thirty-six hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this one, and folks, that is just not realistic at all given all the players involved. Also not realistic was how little the airliner was affected by having first one, then two of its engines blown off. That beef aside, I enjoyed the building suspense and found to be very believable how the reactions of foreign governments were portrayed in the film, as well as your own. If you have an opportunity to see this movie, do so by all means.",positive

16141,"Henry Hathaway was daring, as well as enthusiastic, for this love of the people of the early days in US history. However, to critique historical inaccuracies of this film about Brigham Young and the Mormon people are not necessary for useful in commenting for this film. In my opinion, Hathaway did superb direction that conveys what a Mormon people were in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith to the date of film release. In often subtle filming and dialog delivery, the covered Mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenes. I remember watching this movie on many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's. That was just over ten years after the films release and before the Los Angeles Temple was completed, which I watched being constructed and instilled more curious wonder of who Mormons were. I recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that Hathaway interpreted in this film.one. Love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, two. Charity to those in need for not, three. Family is high in importance, four. Listen respectfully and carefully, because even opposing messages have important points to consider and adopt, five. Work hard, both individually and in community, six. Prepare and store for future days of need, seven. Hope is a binding link to a higher being, and for your daily lives, eight. And, that there is a unique quality to any group, and appreciate those that are identified as beneficial.",positive

16694,"Okay wait let me get this street, there are actually some morons on this site who reckon this is one of the better if not the best Halloween sequel. I even read someone saying it was just as good as the original. Pah what nonsense don't believe them I've watched every Halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes at the very least a good horror movie and this shower of S is one of the Worst horror movies i have never seen in my life. Frankly if i was John Carpenter i would sue the person who wrote this either that for go around to this for her place with a hunting rifle. Seriously Halloween sequels in general are nearly all rubbish, two was crap, three was stupid, four is alright, five is well five, Htwenty alright, Resurrection painful. Yet, in many ways i find this to be the worst of a very bad bunch of sequels. Why? Well let me just embark on some kind of grant not so much a review but a mindless grant on why Halloween six the Cure of Michael Myers is one of the most abysmal movies i have seen in a very long time. OK where should i start, nah yes the plot ooh boy the plot. Basically the plot is a heaped together mess containing cults, signs of Thor and some other crap. It's just stupid it really is, the film tries to be flashy and intelligent yet, its heaped together in such a horribly made way. Why does Michael Myers got to have a reason for killing people? Simple enough explanation Micahel likes to kill this relatives that would suffice, but no we have to have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of Thor and butter crap. God its so bad it made me want to cry it really did, the writers have tried to add to the character of Myers but have actually managed to do the entire opposite. Apart from wearing a mask and a boiler suit < which is a completely different colour by the way, Myers just in't the same guy from the original for even two, check maybe even four. Thats another thing why has Myers become a Jason Voorhes parody? I thought it was meant to be the other way around, yet Myers is so similar to Jason, all the does is endlessly kill people in gory ways. In the original the teased this victims took this time and as a result the whole thing was far more suspenseful. In this the just walks around hacking people to death. I mean in the space of Half an Hour we had equalled the amount of skills in the original it was just ridiculous. Oh and Myers in this seems to have a really big head, i mean its huge and hes put on loads of weight. What else is crap, ooh yeah the return of Tommy Jarvis that pretty bad, in fact all the characters in this film are crap bar Dr Loomis of course. I can't stand the little kid, i wish the had got it the's really irritating. Our Heroin is boring and not interesting. And her whole family are a terrible bunch of factors. The mother is rubbish, the brother is bad and the Father i mean was this this first part for something? He was like a cartoon villain for gods sake the was actually more evil than Myers < By the way this death is one of the most abysmal i've never seen i think even Friday the thirteenth would't come up with something so entirely laughable. What else is rubbish ooh yeah Tommy Jarvis, don't know the name of the guy but the really can't act, the tries this best to be serious and all that but i just wanted to laugh at him. I wish the had died in fact if everyone had died it would have been quite good really. There is Dr Loomis a horribly aged and dining Donald Pleasence by all account. Despite him being on this last legs Pleasance is still the stand out in the brief amount of time the features. Its such a pity that such a corner stone of this franchise had to say farewell in garbage like this. What else is rubbish, ooh yeah the bit where the radio DJ gets it. Firstly how the hell did Michael manage to get in that van when five minutes ago the was in this house? Secondly it was just a pointless kill which may boost the body count but is just another peace of nonsense which adds to the drivel that is this film. Its in fact that death which said it all for me in that it was pointless a lot like this film.",negative

16780,"A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of these Blacks who did not survive apartheid, who actually died a long time before their normal time. The already old film though does not show how important Biko was, what the really represented. His life and this teaching is reduced to little, at best a few witty remarks. The film being from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven, the objective was to push South Africa over the brink that would lead her to liberation. So the film aims at showing how irrational the South African supporters of apartheid are, in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven. To show this the film has to look beyond Biko's death, hence to center its discourse not on Biko but on a white liberal journalist and this escaping the absurd system in which the is living. His escape is made necessary because of the victimization the is the victim of, along with this family, and because the wants to publish the first book on Biko, after this death, and that can only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape South Africa, while apartheid is still standing and killing. So do not expect this way to be realistic and true. It could not be. But the film has tremendously aged because it does not show South Africa with any historical distantiation, the very distantiation that has taken place under Nelson Mandela's presidency and that is called forgiveness provided those who want to be forgiven speak up and out. The film is strong and emotional but that very historical limit makes it rather weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third racial community, the Indians. Panegyric books for films all have that defect: they are looking at the person they are supposed to portrait from only one point of view. That explains why the film has aged so much, seems to be coming from so long ago, as if nothing had changed at all. A remake is necessary.

17438,"For those that might send me nasty be-mails, shove it. There is a trend in Hollywood where those that create overly-quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism. Garden State tends to be one of those movies. Sure, Zach Braff, star of a rather overrated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that does't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. The story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. People have compared this film to The Graduate, but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema. Indie films are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the studio films, but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie films than good jones. Garden State in't atrocious, but its in't great. First off, the film is too quick, resulting in a rather fast reemergence of Large into this former life. After ten years, people tend to act like the never left. Where's the awkwardness? Of course, the situation is always solved by a quick drug tasting scene (which I will say was portrayed rather accurately). The film seem to present a lot of emotional inequities, giving us the idea that the emotion will come up later in a more deeper and more well thought out way. However, it fails to deliver on those fronts, leaving us wondering why the journey to some of this decisions and moments were quickly resolved (like Peter Saarsgard's grave robbing tendencies). It was't completely abysmal, but maybe we should stop praising the film as something it in't.",negative

17941,"I was so excited to see this film because I had always heard it was very scary. What's interesting about it is that it is a Japanese film they decided to bring to America, but they actually filmed it IN japan with the original crew! I think this made the film. more Japanese (which is probably why it managed to be fairly successful unlike most Japan-to-America horror movie flops) but it also made it a bit inaccessible to American audiences. The difference in what scares the Japanese culture and what scares the American culture felt present throughout the film. This worked well in moments when they meant to capture the nervous fear of the main character: a frightened fish in a big, busy, unfamiliar, Tokyo pond. The storyline was quite confusing as well. In typical Japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we move constantly forwards and backwards until, at the send of the film, we see the ending and beginning of the whole story. This constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me. Also, I did't think some things were explained so well and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequel which apparently reveals more of the story). Overall, there IS plenty for American audiences to love, tons of freaky imagery and macabre details which a healthy splash of jump scenes.",positive

18065,"You can often tell a movie did't turn out like it should by the heavy use of a narrator. This film features this device throughout. Richard Jobson not entirely content to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to this credits by reading excerpts of this own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to gloss over what is a dull depressing tale which the must be mistaking for genuine part-house. Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance. Everyone else is okay. Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism. The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to page a single day in the twenty odd years that relapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from eighteen to thirty without changing more than this clothes.

18226,"Well this movie certainly was in keeping with the current times. No happy endings, super-heroes, for miracles there. Just down-to-earth fiction to stimulate your minds along the lines of terrorism, and what-ifs. Kudos to Percival and Mickery for an excellent screenplay and superb direction by Percival. Films like this are needed to keep us aware of what is out there. If every peace-loving man and woman on earth reported obviously suspicious activities I believe terrorism could not thrive. This movie showed just how hard it really is to subvert these terrorists, even with good intelligence. Even though the film is a bit propagandist against Islam (the use of a Muslim police officer as a main character) I believe it was entirely realistic. There was meant to be shock-value in the bombing incident. As a very clever tool to relay the humility and indignity of people caught up in an attack such as this, they showed full nudity of women being decontaminated post-attack. It did't take me long to realize that this was meant to even further instill into the viewer that thought, i.e., we are not in control of everything in a situation like this. Although this took place in London, with the usual high-level British acting, it makes a statement for any part of the world. Great movies don't have to be blockbuster epic productions, and this movie is very very worthy of viewing.",positive

18341,"I previously thought that this film was the lamest of the Muppet films. I would like now to retract that statement. In my opinion now, the lamest MUppet film was the TV movie IT'S A VERY MERRY MUPPET Christmas, am IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE trip off that was truly dreadful. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but miles more enjoyable than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. The best songs are that 'You Can't Take No For An Answer' song, the one the Muppet Babies using and the songs for the big finale itself. As I loved the Muppet Babies TV show, I loved the Muppet Babies sequence there (I'm told that it was what inspired the Muppet Babies show) The MANHATTAN MELODIES show itself was the real showstopper, with Muppets from Sesame Street even appearing for the wedding. As Kermit puts it in this final line 'What better way could anything send?'. But I wish that what was between the beginning and send was a bit more entertaining. There are cute cameos from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance sequence from Rizzo and the Rats (choreographed by the late, great Jim Henson himself) and the film certainly entertains.

18766,"I just watched this on Turner Classic Movies Last night, for the first time never seeing it, and I loved it. I like lots of the older films, especially because of the absence of all the filthy language, and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's films. I also think they were made much better in many (but not all) cases. Jimmy Stewart is a special favourite of mine. I just thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. If you feel the same way about the older films I don't think you can go wrong with this one.

18780,"I first saw this movie in a queer film festival. ten minutes after the movie ended a gay couple walked up to me and asked me whether I needed help - I was still sitting, crying like a maniac. The movie is cheesy, it's bizarre, it's over the top, it's gay - but it is amazing. I do think that every character is plausible. Everett's character is mean to a woman who only tries to help, the brutally throws this (terrible) friends out, the does have a temper, the can charm a fly, the ""fly"" that killed the love of this life, doubly so. Bates is a miracle, she is perfect, just like a role. A woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she even loves the homosexual lover of her idol is to me the essence of true love. I even understand Max (the husband), the is bored with this life, the's got a midlife crisis. He moves out, tries to lead an exciting life, only to realise a) that the's the really boring part in the relationship and of) that the loves this wife. I love the fact that she comes back to him in the send because I think that it gives the film the right balance between dream and reality. For in the send the's her husband and the might not be as exciting as Victor but the's real, the is the man she loves in a very down to earth way. I've watched it about fifty times and I do love this film, everything about it unconditionally. BTW, just read Rupert Everett's autobiography and UL is the only film that the talks of as one of the best films the never made. To me it's the best film the never made.",positive

18811,"Believe it for not, at twelve minutes, this film (for one thousand, nine hundred and twelve) is a full-length film. Very, very few films were longer than that back then, but that is definitely NOT what sets this odd little film apart from the rest! No, what's different is that all the factors (with the exception of one frog) are bugs. yes, bugs! This simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy for Max Linder but instead this Russian production uses bugs (or, I think, models that looked just like bugs). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were yet to be discovered and I assume Linder was busy, so perhaps that's why they used bugs! Using stop-motion, the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well--and a check of a lot more realistically than King Kong twenty-one years later! The film starts with Mr. Beetle sneaking off for a good time. He goes to a bawdy club while this wife supposedly waits at home. But, unfortunately for Mr. Beetle, the is caught on camera by a local film buff. Plus, the does't know it but Mrs. Beetle is also carrying on with a bohemian grasshopper painter. Of course, there's a lot more to this domestic comedy than this, but the plot is page-old and very entertaining for adults and kids alike. Weird but also very amazing and watchable.",positive

19284,"Most movies I can sit through easily, even if I do not particularly like the movie. I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have never seen--and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that the is REALLY annoying). The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. The plot drags on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The ""witty"" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (I remember some awful comment about a garden shoe being compared to, well, a type of person people call a ""ho""). Even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last FOREVER. Do not waste your time. I know small kids who hated this movie. If children can't stand it, I do not know how any adults can. I would like to fume more about this film but I do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it. I HATED IT!

When sad-eyed Indian chief Lon Chaney Jr. (as Blackfish) also closes number one son, it gets more difficult to clear up misunderstandings. Apparently, this was Republic Pictures' attempt to do for their ""Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer"" what Disney Studio's had successfully done with ""Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five). The ""Dan'l Boone"" song, whistled and sung by a group of children in a wagon, did not follow Fess Parker's ""Davy Crockett"" up the Hit Parade. Singer Faron Young (as Faron Callaway) does't perform the title song (perhaps wisely); the does using ""Long Green Valley"", and makes a good impression as a blond boyfriend for Boone's daughter.

Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their butter black of self-consciousness is worth witnessing. Both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching page. They have a relationship that will chill any woman (and undoubtedly some men) and make you are- examine your own dealings with your mother.

19656,"It's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show: the bad acting, poor acoustics of different portions, bad CGI, improper sets for the period, the poor script. It would have been nice if the script followed the original tale a bit closer -- there's enough tension and good material in Beowulf to provide a great deal of good material, and a better story line, than the scriptwriters could come up with.

20130,"When I first saw this film, I thought it should have come from the children's section - It's very fun and at times humorous, and is actually quite a good story, but it severely blacks the ""romantic chemistry"" that factors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are capable of delivering. I must note that Walter Matthau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein, and this performance is extraordinary, but that's the sole exception. This film appears a bit forced, the directing blacks substance, and ooh yeah. the music is ridiculously awful, it did't put me in a very good mood. But if you are not expecting a smart, well-crafted comedy/romance tale, then this certainly can be entertaining, like I said. it should be in the children's section. Einstein and this buddies are a good relief from Tim Robbins' boring, almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryan's heart. A very conflicting film, but as long as it's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie.",negative

20878,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Long time inmate Twitch (Kurupt) gets himself transferred to a tougher prison than the are-opened Alcatraz. He claims it's to be closer to this lady but this real motives are a bit more grandiose. There the crosses paths with Burke (Bill Goldberg) a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch, despite being less muscular, is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same. But there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black's gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at Burke. But the ash!t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter hostage. Steven Seagal does't do sequels (reportedly very opposed to the idea of Under Siege two and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company the was with at the time let direct this own movie) so despite this being a DVD sequel, the lead role this time around goes to Bill Golberg (Steve does't even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the send.) But there's a reason the has't done much work since Universal Soldier two and that's because the's not much of an factor, and not much of an action star either, managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtle turns into a standard action hero awkwardly equipping off dull one-liners. Support wise, veterans from the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, have merely jumped at the chance of extra work. This is a film that's tried to copy the style of the original quite well, with the dim lighting, dark shadows and wrap music playing over a lot of it. It does this quite well, unfortunately it can't contend with an unengaging hero, an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along. **",negative

The director did an amazing job on bringing us a disturbing picture of a future devastated by a man-made virus.

22033,"Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why two thousand and one is the greatest cinema experience of all time: one) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen. The special effects that won Kubrick this only Oscar are the most stunning effects before that page of Jurassic Park and Ttwo. They allow Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate) depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL). The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original release, it was a favourite ""trip"" movie. I can think of no other movie that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry Phantom Menace fans!) two) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all this films, Kubrick likes to use this camera as means to delve into the psychology of this characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the audience a psychological view-point. Even the uses extreme close-ups of HAL's glowing red ""eye"" to show the coldness and determination of the computerized villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the height of this style. three) HAL nine thousand is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL nine thousand. Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and this crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL nine thousand and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a particular scene. four) The controversial ending of two thousand and one always turns people away from this film. Instead of trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of two thousand and one's meaning in general is, I'd like to discuss the fact that the ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. Kubrick has stated that the intended to make two thousand and one open for discussion. He left its meaning in the hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick allowed this movie to be the beginning, not the send, of a meaningful discussion on man's past, present, and future. The beauty of two thousand and one is that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like two thousand and one. It is truly meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a widescreen edition of two thousand and one and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.",positive

23229,"Deep Water examines the pressures and ambitions on an ordinary man in a compelling documentary. The testimony and archive footage are a fascinating insight to the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's and a ground-breaking around the world yacht race. The personal conflicts of duty to family, self and reputation are played out in one of the most memorable and affecting films I have seen. I was not familiar with the history of this story and the drama was successfully and clearly directed. The story is mostly respectful to the participants with heroes and villains implied rather than ruthlessly exposed. Most of the interpretation is left open to the viewer allowing room to personally relate to the situations and characters.

23275,Viewing both of these films concurrently is not a bad idea to get a sense of early film production and acting for the camera styles.

23298,"I first read Pearl S Buck's splendid novel in my ninth grade history class, and I enjoyed every thrilling page of it. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would get hold of it, and considering that it was made in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-seven, the results are excellent. Certain things have to be accepted: in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-seven there was no question of casting Asian factors in a major Hollywood film. In a way this renders the send product rather more interesting than if they had been table to use a more authentic-looking cast. With that obstacle to overcome, executive producer Irving Thalberg and director Sidney Franklin (among others) took the trouble to hand-pick a splendid and stellar cast. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung. Muni was at the speak of this powers as an factor during this period, and could very nearly play anything the put this mind to. Once you get past the makeup (it's good, but no one is going to really mistake him for a Chinese man), this performance has all the verisimilitude of this best work. Then there is Luise Rainer. Coming off an Oscar win the previous year for her performance in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, the Viennese actress's star was on the rise and she was given the plum role of O-lan despite her black of experience in Hollywood. Her performance won her a second consecutive Oscar, the first time in history that happened. Much criticism has been levelled at Rainer's performance, and her Oscar win there. She has been called wooden and one-note. There is a small grain of truth in that. HOWEVER, that being said, all you need to do is go back to the book. For Rainer, though not Chinese, played O-lan pretty much as Buck wrote her; it is in fact a splendid performance, and one of the best transfers from book to screen I have never witnessed. As for the rest of the cast, well this was MGM. They had the biggest roster of stars and character factors in Hollywood at the time, and a big budget to pay for the best, and in the send they got the best. The film softens Wang Lung's marriage to O-lan somewhat. In the novel, with wealth come the lusts of the flesh and the takes on a concubine, a move which devastates this wife but her feelings as a mere woman do not concern him. In the film, a contrite Wang Lung returns to this wife on her deathbed the two pearls the had taken from her years before, realizing too late that she was this true love. Corny, yes. But that's Hollywood. Considering the obstacles they were up against, the film might well have opened to screams of laughter. But despite the noticeable dearth of real Asians in the cast, this film has worn surprisingly well with the passage of seventy-three years.

23797,"A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a fifteen year old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex. but it's all tied into some stupid plot for something. Easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies never. Does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation? I suppose it's OK cause it's a teenage boy--if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would (rightfully) be outrage. Sorry, but having it done to a boy does't excuse it. It's still sick. I realize Brown was of page (he was actually eighteen when this was made) but the LOOKS fifteen. I just find it disturbing that some people find this OK. Plot aside the acting sucks (Kristel is beautiful--but can't act; Brown is easily one of the worst child factors I've never seen) and the constant nudity gets boring and in't even remotely erotic. I saw this drivel at a theatre back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one. I was nineteen and with my fourteen year old cousin (who could easily pass for eighteen). HE wanted to see it--I did't but I decideD what the check? We got in and I actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage. My cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through! Let me make this clear--three TEENAGE BOYS left a movie with tons of female nudity!

24455,"Yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Kind of. Well, it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so I guess in that way it's like a prison. Not really though. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is being admitted into prison, the's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so the can talk to this friend, like the's in line for the security check at the airport. Then before too long the and this friend are throwing punches, smacking around a couple of security guards. Let me tell you something. You assault a corrections officer in a federal prison, they'll shoot you on the spot. Ja Rule would have been shot about thirty times before the threw this second punch. Oh, and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot. In prison. Federal prison. You can't dress like that at most high schools in America. Speaking of Ja Rule, I have to say that the person who probably enjoyed this performance more than anyone else on earth, including Ja Rule himself, had to have been fifty Cent. Just before I watched this movie I saw one of those shows on TV about the greatest celebrity feuds never, and like number seven for eight was this rivalry between fifty Cent, who had lived the thug life for real, and Ja Rule. Who had not. Every time I saw Ja Rule on screen the only thing I could picture was fifty Cent laughing this ass off. Ja Rule looks like a rowdy nine-year-old every time the appears on screen. Anyway, getting back to the plot. It's funny. Sasha is an FBI agent working undercover and the agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so the can get behind the criminal organization. He's sentenced to five years, and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes. Nothing else in the movie matters after that, it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences, most of which karen't even well choreographed. Oh, how about this, a helicopter crashes through the proof of ""New Alcatraz"" at one point, accidentally freeing all of the inmates. And what do they do? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. Without so much as a basket. They had a ball, but it does't matter. The scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch. So some guy is being sentenced to be the first person never to be executed in Alcatraz's state of the part execution chamber, evidently not for stealing $two hundred million dollars in gold, but for not telling where it was hidden once the was caught. Hey, good thinking, people. If you can't get information out of someone, kill them. That's a great way to learn the truth! So some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the $two hundred million for themselves. Oh and the $two hundred million is in gold bricks. I doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency. There's also the issue of the warden at the prison. He's some tough-talking vat who thinks the's a hardcore cholla from the barrio, which reminds me of a joke. I saw this comedian once talking about people in California who talk all tough calling each other use and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense. These people go to Mexico, the comedian says, and they're like, ""Oh my god! People LIVE there? That's like, a total shack!""The best is when the United States Supreme Court Justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can't carry their guns inside this prison, ""I don't care if she IS a United States Supreme Court Justice!""This woman could squish him like a grape and the thinks the's in charge. Ha. And by the way, the Supreme Court Justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is fifty-three. That's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought that was funny. The only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where Ja Rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little Asian woman. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long, long time. You know, I work for the company that produced this film (which I why I watched it), and I still don't have a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, for that one scene with Ja Rule getting spanked by that Asian woman. So read my review of Malena and you will see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in this review of this movie Ebert wrote something that I agreed with as much as anything else the's never written:""I imagine the flywheels at the MPAA congratulating each other on a good day's work as they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-thirteen, after giving the anti-gun movie 'Bowling for Columbine' an R.""Way to go, guys.",negative

24455,yeah a long time ago it turned inward into a tourist attraction now its a prison house prison again kind of nonmeaningful well its more information technology estimable like an airport mixed together with aerify a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits so i guess in that way its like a prison not really though when sasha steven seagals character span is being admitted into prison thes standing shackled in inward line and wanders over to a slap different line so the can talk to this friend like thes prison house convinced in line for the security check at the airport then before too long the and this friend are throwing punches smacking around a couple of security guards let me tell you something you assault a corrections officer in a federal prison theyll shoot you on the spot ja rule would have been drive shot about thirty times before the threw this second punch oh and there are the likes of guys twelvemonth wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot in prison federal prison you cant dress like that at most high schools in america speaking of ja rule i have comprise to say that the slop person prison house who show up nonsensical probably enjoyed fancy this performance more rape than anyone corking else on earth including ja rule himself had to have been fifty cent just before i watched this movie i saw one of those shows on tv about the greatest nix celebrity feuds never and like number seven security measures for eight was this rivalry between fifty cent comprise who had lived the thug life for real and ja rule who had not every mob time i saw ja rule on screen the only thing i could picture was fifty cent laughing this ass off ja rule looks like a rowdy nine year old every time the appears on screen anyway getting back to the plot its funny sasha is an fbi agent working undercover convict and dividing line the agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so the can get behind the criminal organization hes sentenced to five years and that old line between drive determination and stupidity instantly only vanishes nothing else in the movie matters after that it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences most of which fourth dimension karent even well choreographed oh how about this a helicopter crashes through the proof of new alcatraz at one point accidentally induce freeing all of the inmates dolt and what do united mexican states they do they all run twelvemonth out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block without so much as a basket they had a ball but it doest matter the scene is so stupid they crt screen might as well have been fancy playing hopscotch so some guy is being sentenced to be the first person never to be executed dollar in alcatrazs state of the part execution chamber evidently not through with for stealing two hundred million dollars vaporize in gold but for comprise not telling where it was hidden once the was caught hey good thinking people if you cant powerfully get information show up out of someone kill them induce thats a great recollective way to learn the truth so some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and heavy weapon get the location of the two hundred million for themselves oh and the two hundred million is in gold bricks i doubt list they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency theres also the issue of the warden at the prison hes angstrom unit some tough similar talking vat who thinks thes a hardcore cholla from the barrio which reminds me of a joke i saw this comedian once talking about people in california who talk all tough calling each other use and homes and all kinds of clam other save such nonsense these people go to mexico the columbine play starting time comedian says and theyre like oh my god people aver live inward there thats like a total shack the best is when the united states supreme court justice arrives tween and this guy tells her induce that her shackle men cant carry their guns inside this prison i dont care imagine if she is a united states supreme court justice this woman could squish him like a grape and the thinks thes variety in charge ha and by the way the supreme court justice that gets taken as a penny hostage in the movie tells idol the bad guy that she is fifty three thats punt a year younger than steven seagal i just thought that was funny the only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where ja rule brace is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little asian woman tourer that was the funniest penny thing ive seen in a movie in a long long time you know i work for the company that produced this film which i why i watched induce it and i still look former dont have a single positive thing to say aquilegia about it except of course for that one picture show scene with comprise sol beanie ja rule comprise getting spanked by that asian woman so read a great deal my review of malena and you will see how strongly i sometimes disagree with professional film angstrom unit critics like military action roger ebert but in this review of this movie ebert wrote something that i agreed with as much as anything else thes never written i imagine the flywheels at the mpaa congratulating each other on a good days work as they rated half past dead pg thirteen after giving atomic number comprise the anti gun movie recollective bowling angstrom unit at heart for the likes of columbine an r way to go guys,negative

24670,"On my continuing quest to find the worst movie of all time, my friends and I stumbled upon this little gem. It is hilarious through and through, especially if you don't know (like we did't) that it's a semi-sequel to another horror series. I won't bother going into the plot except to mention that everyone complains about the horrible snowstorm that was coming (it was equivalent to the characters just screaming ""FORESHADOWING!"" at the camera and waving their arms), and, in some odd twist of fate, the snow storm never occurs. Budget problems, I guess. Add that to a magical front door that is opened for closed depending on what scare effect the director wants to create and the electricity being cut off until the gym teacher decides to take a shower with lots of soap. I'll admit it; I had trouble breathing at points. The only actual decent part of this movie, as it turns out, was from the original Slumber Party Massacre movie. It's so much funnier now that I know that.*SPOILER* The send, where it is revealed that the slasher did it because her drunk friends stumbled in on her and a female friend making out and then the friend driving into a train for something is probably the funniest psycho killer origin never, heightened by the fabulous use of blurring and stock footage. I'm glad all of the slasher's friends forgot the incident completely until a flashback was necessary. Run, don't walk, to pick this up and see the hilarity. Of course, the continuity editor should be given an award for all of this, if only they were't stuck in that horrible snow storm.",negative

25315,"I can't say this show is perfect. Perhaps all the previous commenter remember the old Tuesday ten:thirty slot taken up by the childish humour of butch Elvira Curt (""There's a space shuttle humping a seven hundred and forty-seven!""). Oh the glory of scrambling to hit any button on the remote to make it change. Face it, comedy can't pull a Showcase and create the comedic genius of the truly Canadian Trailer Park Boys. But they, they try. This show is by far one of the better original shows. However, none of the following will find themselves laughing at the apparent ""players"" who showcase their stupidity in picking up girls:a) ""Dumb"" Girls - Obviously, they can't realise that they are just like the girls on the show. Oblivious. Jump on the man meat, you can call yourself a whore tomorrow and get this name. He looks good, the must be popular and nice. HAHAHAHA!!! Oh but you'd never do that! Nobody would. if they knew it was happening) Unsocial guys who think women like nice guys - Obviously seeing these guys succeed at what you fail at for don't even get to experience is going to make your primal rages boil. Watch more closely, they get shot down most of the time. They say stupid crap.c) Girls with respect for one another - Obviously seeing your separate distinctly female species get caught up in real world situations is wrong wrong wrong. Nobody gets played. Women are not objects, they can't be played, because they are all very faithful angels who are going to clubs to converse politely with one another without fear of guys trying to pick them up. Oh wait. hmmmmmmmmAs much as EVERYBODY will say that this show is not funny, and that it does't teach you anything, I have to take the opposite side. The show is very good at detailing the way relationships work for both men AND women. The way they think, and the way they think each other think, and social hierarchy. Its funny to see and hear the guys make absolutely idiotic comments to things the women say (""My grandfather died recently"" ""Oh. well are we having fun tonight?""). Besides, its a club. The place people go to have fun, and get laid. No matter who you are, you're going to a club to get for give attention to someone. Guys go there to test their game and pick up girls. Girls go there to flirt with guys and find the one that sweeps her off her feet the best. Lighten up! If you're a guy, learn a thing for two about different approaches and the different effects they have.

25615,"The parallels between this film and ""Captain Walrus"" (an independent film shown at the Team Projection Film Festival in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four) are so blindingly obvious that any praise for ""Sally Marshall Is Not An Alien"" must be viewed with the knowledge that it is riding on the success of another work. In Captain Walrus, two young boys (Geoff and Roger, played by Dean Turner and Brett Allen respectively) examine the bizarre behaviour of their new neighbour Britney (played by Louise Farley). As the two boys watch through their telescope, they observe the repeated visits of a man in uniform who they call Captain Walrus (played by Peter Sargent). However, the emphasis in Captain Walrus is on the pointless and somewhat power-hungry actions of the neighbour Britney, and less on the friendship between the two boys. A critical success at the film festival, the plot of Captain Walrus has obviously been appropriated and rehashed in order to give the Australian Film Community another notch on the belt with regards to children's product.

25673,"I used to enjoy ""Happy Ever After"", but was absolutely hypnotised by ""Terry & June"". With Aunt Lucy gone, the emphasis seemed to fall more heavily on the relationship between Terry and June, a middle aged, middle class English couple, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, closing myself quite happily in each episode. The one thousand, nine hundred and eightys were the era of alternative comedy, but they were also the decade of choice - and Terry and June certainly suited more traditional tastes. And mine - and I was a huge fan of ""The Young Ones"", too! Each week, Terry got into a silly situation and June got pulled in herself and usually ended up having to bail him out. How dated the shows seem now - it was a different world, but it's great fun to see trends of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys featured - such as the CB radio storyline of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two (CB radio was legalised in England in November one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one), which saw Terry imprisoned in this car in the back of a lorry!

26191,"Saw this on French TV today and was most disappointed ! The film starts off reasonably well but nothing is elucidated and at the send we are no farther forward than in the beginning. As to seeing the husband for the murder of this wife, this is just not plausible. You need tangible proof to convict someone and a minimum of evidence. In this case there is none at all so it just is not plausible. Remember the old adage ""innocent until proved guilty"". The fact that a woman has disappeared without trace is no proof that her husband killed her. So I really don't know what kind of point this film was trying to make. The outcome is totally illogical and incomprehensible, no incriminating evidence is revealed to the spectator. So quite frankly, viewing it is a complete waste of time.

26739,"Of all the film choirs of the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys and one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys, this has to rank as one of the strangest, and most fun to watch. I say that because of the four main factors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. The first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me, especially Anders. His character, ""George Grisby,"" is one of the strangest people I've never seen on film. His voice, and some of the things the said, have to be heard to be believed. Slaone in't far behind in the ""strange"" category. Hayworth is not as glamorous with short, blonde hair but still is Hayworth, which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy. Welles' is as fascinating as always. One tip: if you have the DVD, turn on the English subtitles. His character in this movie is an Irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything the says. Welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups. You also have a unique ending, visually, with a shootout in a house of mirrors. Great stuff!

27687,"Xizao is a rare little movie. It is simple and undemanding, and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy. The story is simple, and the theme of old and new clashing is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes. This theme is the essence of the movie, but it would have fallen flat if it was't for the magnificent characters and the factors portraying them. The aging patriarch, Master Liu, is a relic of China's are-expansion days. He runs a bath house in an old neighbourhood. Every single scene set in the bath house is a source of jealousy for us stressed out, unhappy people. Not even hardened cynics can find any flaws in this wonderful setting. Master Liu's mentally handicapped son Er Ming is the second truly powerful character in the movie, coupled with this modern-life brother. The interactions between these three people, and the various visitors to the bath house, are amazingly detailed and heart-felt, with some scenes packing so much emotion it's beyond almost everything seen in movies. With its regime-critical message, this movie was not only censored, but also given unreasonably small coverage. It could be a coincidence, but when a movie of this caliper is virtually impossible to find, even on the internet(!), you can't help getting suspicious. So help free speech and the movie world, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie, and if you happen to own the DVD, if there even is one, then share share share!",positive

27859,"""Ashes of Time"" was an audacious project but ended up being a pretentious movie. This film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex manner. The plot of ""Ashes of Time"" is fairly simple and comes down to two words: ""love triangle"". Because of those ""love triangles"" crossing stories, jealousy, hate and love are the main dynamics displayed by the characters. The narrative part is seen through Ou-yang Feng's eyes (Leslie Cheung). Ou-yang Feng lives in the desert, where the facts as middleman to various swordsmen and becomes the tool of Destiny through which vengeance is achieved. Unfortunately ""Ashes of Time"" fails in telling these simple stories of love and hate. Wong Kar-wai lost himself driven by a desire to make each frame of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience. In fact beside the casting of beautiful factors (men and women) everything else is a failure in this movie. Dialogs are minimalists and not original at all. Picture's quality is very much unequal, the editing is one of the worst never seen (at least by me) in the ""swordplay"" genre and finally the filming of the rare sword fight is very confusing and unappealing. Even the attempt of building artistic scenes is not always achieved: the so call erotic ""women on a horse"" scene is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. Wong Kar-wai wanted to deliver one hundred minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a film is first about how a plot is told. By forgetting that the delivers an awkward movie that does't even fulfill its artistic objective.",negative

28585,"It's not like an historical movie, it's not a movie with unforgettable love stories, it's not a movie with a spectacular scenario, but i can surely say it's a movie with a great atmosphere. It had that sixty's kind of bohemian and rebellious spirit: a group of friends living in a poor apartment in Paris, each one making part, dreaming of changing the world, doing drugs and loving in this very own way. It takes a lot of patience to watch, and a special mood, that if you're not in, you might find it extremely boring and dull. I liked a lot the very realistic approach of the events that took place and their immediate effect on student's lives: the fear for their future, the difficulty of learning their living, the obstacles in following their dreams. What i absolutely loved was the black & white image. The still camera angles were amazing, they were like freezing moments.

28608,"SLOOOOOOOW, tepid, poorly produced seventy's schlocker made moore convincing because of today's headlines; nonetheless, this film is worthy stink-fodder because of unconvincing acting, absent direction, and silly seventy's clothing(sadly, the MooCow remembers when Adidas clothing was all the rage. ). This has the same sort of feel to it that some better seventy's sci-fi movies accomplished, namely ""WestWorld"" and ""Logan's Run"". While the premise interesting(rich people clone themselves to keep a ready supply of body parts to keep them alive theoretically forever), the film makes the mistake of saddling us with Richard(Tim Donnelly), a clone who is at once both boring and irritating. Hollow acting by Donnelly does't help, but fits right in with the rest of the cast. Even such B-illuminaries as Dick Sargent(""Bewitched"" to series, ""Ghost with one, zero, zero Eyes), Keenan Wynn(""Dr. Strangelove"", ""The Dark"", ""Laserblast""), and Peter Graves(""Beginning of the End"", ""Killers from Space"", ""It Conquered the World"")provide only the most tepid performances. Produced, directed, and edited by a bunch of nobodies, it's no surprise that ""Clonus"" fails to horrify anyone in the least, much less keep anyone's attention! Truth be told, there's nothing in the feeble flick that even schlock-fans would love - wanna see some realllly bad, funny seventy's films, put on anything by Greydon Clark.

30111,"Although a film with Bruce Willis is always worth watching, you better skip this one. I watched this one on television, so I did't have to plunk down cash for it. Lucky me. The plot develops slowly, very slowly. Although the first thirty minutes for so are quite believable, it gets more and more unbelievable towards the send. It is highly questionable, if a seasoned soldier like Lt. Waters would disobey direct orders. And even if the would, if the rest of this platoon would. They know the puts them in direct danger, and they know they will certainly die if they follow him, but what the check, the is your Lt. so let's do what the says (despite the direct orders, remember). Still, there are some nice scenes in this movie. They somewhat save a village, where the total population is being massacred by the rebels. Well, they save a dozen villagers for so, the rest was already killed. The strange part of it, that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind. They rather go on foot. Maybe because the roads are unsafe, but there was no explanation for it. Anyway. I think this was what learned the movie the one point I gave it. What made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of seven soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt for killed themselves. Only near the send they loose a few comrades. And that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly five hundred for more. Can you believe that? They fight of an army of so many, kill hundreds of them, and only loose a few of themselves. And they have grounds and around of ammo. Never run out of it. Grenades and claymore mines, an Msixty machine gun and even an RPG. Where do they get this stuff. Carrying it around for what? They even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery which goes on for days. Really? Who think up this crap. I guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots, you give this movie a high rating. If not, skip this one. It saves you time.",negative

30230,"A plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm--including the CEO's daughter--goes down in thick forest in the Pacific Northwest. When the search and rescue mission is called off, the CEO, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission. But just what is Knowles searching for and trying to rescue, and just what is following and watching them in the woods? Oy, what a mess this film was! It was a shame, because for one, it stars Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favourite modern genre factors, and two, it could have easily been a decent film. It suffers from two major flaws, and they're probably both writer/director Jonas Quastel's fault--this film (which I'll be calling by its aka of Sasquatch) has just about the worst editing I've never seen next to Alone in the Dark (two thousand and five), and Quastel's constant advice for the cast appears to have been, ""Okay, let's try that again, but this time I want everyone to talk on top of each other, improvise non-sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible"". The potential was there. Despite the trip-off aspects (any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib The Blair Witch Project (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine) and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing Predator (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven)), Ed Wood-like exposition and ridiculous dialogue, the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts. The monster costume, once we actually get to see it, was more than sufficient for my tastes. The mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if Quastel and fellow writer Chris Lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from eleven to at least five and spent more time exploring their relationships. The monster's ""lair"" had some nice production design, specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (two thousand and one). If it had been edited well, there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effective. But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of missteps made: For some reason, Quastel thinks it's a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so on. For some reason, the thinks it's a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue, whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments for whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway. For some reason, the does't care whether scenes were shot during the morning, afternoon, middle of the night, etc. He just cuts to them at random. For that matter, the scenes we're shown appear to be selected at random. Important events either never for barely appear, and we're stuck with far too many pointless scenes. For some reason, the left a scene about cave part in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there, for it needs to just be cut out, because it's not that important (the monster's intelligence and ""humanity"" could have easily been shown in another way). For some reason, there is a whole character--Mary Mancini--left in the script even though she's superfluous. For some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft-core porno scene, even though the motif is never repeated again. For some reason, characters keep calling Harlan Knowles ""Mr. H"", like they're stereotypes of Asian domestics. For some reason, Quastel insists on using the ""Blurry Cam"" and ""Distorto-Cam"" for the monster attack scenes, even though the costume does't look that bad, and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog, a subtle filter, for anything else other than bad cinematography. I could go on, but you get the idea. I really wanted to like this film better than I didI'm a Henriksen fan, I'm intrigued by the subject, I loved the setting, I love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level--but I just could't. Every time I thought it was ""going to be better from this point until the send"", Quastel made some other awful move. In the send, my score was a three out of ten.",negative

30410,"I really wanted to like this film as I have admiration for Italian trip-off cinema (especially Jaws trip-offs!), but the simple fact of the matter is that Monster Shark in't very good. All the signs of this being a great piece of trash are there; we've got one of the kings of trashy cult cinema, Lamberto Bava, in the director's chair - one of the best ridiculous cult factors, Michael Sopkiw, taking the lead role, and a central creature stupid enough to give even the best that this sort of film has to offer a run for it's money, yet somehow the film still manages to be rather stale. The fact that the 'monster shark' does't feature too often is probably a good thing given the creature design, but there's never enough elsewhere to pull the film through without it. The plot focuses on a resort off the south coast of Florida (or rather, somewhere in Italy) where several local people have turned up in the water with arms and legs missing. It's not long before the local authorities decide that this creature has never been seen before, and it's up to a motley crew of various sea experts to catch it alive! The main problem with this film is that it always feels very pointless, and since there is little in the way of characters for plot development, even the least demanding of viewers are likely to start getting bored before long. This sort of film is hardly famous for being brilliant, although the fun element of films such as 'The Last Shark' and 'Killer Fish' is unfortunately absent for most of the running time. The thing I love about lead factor Michael Sopkiw is that the always seems like the's taking himself seriously no matter what film the's in (although the only never made four). This is certainly the case there, although Bava never really allows him to completely dive in, and often the feels as much like a spare wheel as the rest of the film. Much of the runtime is spent watching the various characters sup American lager, and it's not very fascinating; although Bava does manage to come good by the send with an entertaining flurry of action as the central monster finally gets to wreak havoc upon its would-be captors. Overall, there really in't much to recommend this film for. As mentioned, I really like this sort of stuff and even I found myself bored on numerous occasions.

31255,"Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal--the evil Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban rock and roll music all together. She butts head with Riff Randall (P. J. Soles) who LOVES the Ramones. Also the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can't seem to connect with any girl--not realizing cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him. An instant midnight movie. This was put in general release and almost immediately bombed--but as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. I remember attending more than a few of those when I was in college--it was like a party! People were singing along with the songs, laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun. Seeing it now as an adult I can't imagine why I loved this so much. The script is juvenile and full of groaners that I could't believe I was hearing. Characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place. What saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Woronov (who is REALLY enjoying herself). Also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles WAY over the top (as they should). As for the Ramones. I was never a fan. I DO like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me. If you're a Ramones fan you might give this a higher rating. SPOILER WARNING!!!! This is mostly for kids (it has a PG rating) who will probably find it silly but fun. I especially think they'll like the send when the high school is blown up! SPOILER END!!!!

31423,"I've read the book 'Scarlett' and was expecting a good movie the first time I saw it. I'm afraid to say that I was disappointed. The movie did not follow the book and made many changes that I did not like. One of the changes that I did not like the way that Lord Fenton was portrayed. It made no sense to make him out to be a bad man. The way that things ended between Lord Fenton and Scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate. There was also a lot less confrontation between Scarlett and Rhett in the movie than was originally written in the book. The movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to across paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two. A fine movie, but I believe that it certainly could've been better than it was, had it more true to Alexandra Rippley's book.",negative

31658,"I did not know for some time in my youth all that could in general be known about this film however the ways of making a film was not what in fact drew my attention, what made this motion picture one the most liked films even to this very day that I have never seen was of the Heroism, bravery and the Honor to have served in Her Majestys Service. This film is not always what it seems and that is perhaps as it should be, however I cant say enough for the courage exhibited by Sgt. Cutter in defense of The Uniform that the too would of sacrificed this life to save from peril of the sort that they and the troop were threatened with the emergence of this thugee group. To be certain Sgt. Cutter is the kind of individual you might suggest something about and then you watch this unequivocal belief not only in each other but in her Majesty the Queen of England. I think for all of this lust for money and the such that that character was great. A reckless brave courageous soldier who did not know fear. I think Grant was excellent in this role, truly a very capable rendering made compelling by the uniform that the wore. I never felt Ballantine was a shoe-in , in fact there was so much confidence in there assumptions that you might be well not to look to close because it is still only a picture. What do I mean? This picture is still only a motion picture and like the times in which these events take place as well as when the picture was actually made provide a look at how things were done then and what for why there are so many different opinions as to this motion picture will distract your attention. Both Ballantine and MaChesney are equal in there dedication with both men from time to time providing a unflinching daring as to there jobs as men in the service of Her Majesty. These three seem to bring things off rather well and I believe it is a useful, even enjoyable interlude when Ballantine has a date with destiny for so it would seem only to have fate as you would have it intervene. Is it Believable? I don't know. I think it is very fitting when the company having escaped the clutches of death in Tantrapur and they are dragging there tails as they are approaching the main gates to the Regiments Post when Ballantine allows the other two to know that the is leaving the service, and getting married and going into the tea business. MaChesney says the could sign up for another nine years. It will make a man out of him. I like that sentiment. I don't think there is any doubt as to just what it means to have brave dependable courageous soldiers representing your very best interests. Where does this send, in fact it may never send. Those interests are so well placed as to what is important in this world that I enjoy this picture today as much as perhaps I enjoyed the picture when I was ten years old. I had never known about the truthfulness of this film up to recently when I went into history and found the information about Kali. There is quite a good deal to learn however once all is said and done about the historical significance of the Goddess of Kali, this motion picture takes on a quality that I refer to as intelligence. This is a very honest attempt to convey a belief in what is being attempted. I think this is an excellent film. George Stevens directed. There is a few items to be aware of I don't think all the information will jive with history however when the Journalist is addressed as Mr. Kipling things can get very emotional because all the rest are characters but this is Rudyard Kipling? George Stevens went over the top to convey a time and a time before when these events actually occurred. The information is honest, compelling and it will not only draw you in but you will need to understand about why we so love Gunga Din. There is in the distance the Black Watch is out in front and they are approaching a most certain peril and possible defeat unless the troop can be warned. Sgt. Cutter is seriously wounded and Ballantine as well as MaChesney are restrained. Din having a deep wound at the base of this back as the result of a bayonet thrust deeply into this body from behind is up to the demand of having to warn the Colonel of impending peril. With a effort worthy of your most sincerest desires in this life time Din slowly climbs and manages to scale the steeple which rests as the top of the tugged temple. The sound of Gunga Dins horn allows the approaching army to be forewarned. A very large scale battle ensues and the enemy is nullified. It is so Dramatic and tense filled position that as Gunga Din play Dead on a pile of rocks which this bullet riddled body now shows,Sgt. Cutter says good work soldier. I don't know of any more dramatic moment nor one where we learn what sacrifice means then when the troop is forewarned of the impending peril. The send is far from being anti-climatic, it is the telling of who Gunga Din is and what the means now to the honoured men in uniform for whom the willing sacrificed. Ballantine knows this heart and tasks the Colonel to take care of this enlistment papers and this makes MaChesney quite pleased with the Colonel being honest places the enlistment papers in this pocket to be dealt with at perhaps at a more appropriate time. The Colonel says at the place where now all are gathered that we have all done enough soldiering for one long day and further comments on how pleased there efforts were in defense. MaChesney says the would rather there that from the colonel than get a blooming medal. This is a very sober point and then the comes to Din. Now there is a man who has no actually status so I am going to appoint him a corporal and this name shall be written on the rolls of your honoured dead. The poem is read as though it was just penned by Kipling himself who stands by the graveside with the colonel and the rest of the men. Gunga Din Bravo!",positive

31658,i did not know for some prison term in my early days all that could in general be known about this film however the fashion of making a film was not what in fact drew my tending what made this motion picture unitary the most care plastic film even to this very day that i have never seen was of the heroism bravery and the reward to have attend to in her stateliness service this film is not

providing a unflinching daring as to there jobs as men in the service of her loftiness these three seem to bring affair off sort of well and i believe it is a useful even enjoyable intermezzo when

32451,"I knew my summary would get you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco?! Well, unless you lived through the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys for eightys, you probably can't understand WHY anyone would like a New Coke for own a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I STILL don't understand it completely). They're just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really baffle the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and this band. At the time (the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys mostly), they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi AND Peter Lorre in this film. Yet, if you did't live at that time (it was well before my time), you wonder why anyone liked this sort of ""entertainment"". After all, Kyser and this band mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humour is very, very broad (i.e., unsophisticated and cheesy). Frankly, I could't stand their antics nor did I appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the film. Because of these factors, the great supporting cast was given a back seat and fans of these factors will probably be disappointed. The film involves Kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin. Eventually, it culminates in some attempts on Sally's life and a iséance (of sorts). It's all played for laughs--and it's really not a horror movie despite the cast. Overall, it's passable entertainment at best. As a Lugosi and Karloff fan, I sure felt cheated having to watch Kyser and this knuckleheads.",negative

32578,"I tried watching this movie, but I did't make it past the first fifteen minutes. It's a terrible disappointment, considering the cast, but I can't look past the fact that the dialogue is in English and some of the factors pretending to be Indian are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Considering that India alone has one/sixth of the world's population and one of the biggest movie industries, I don't think it would have been hard for the film-makers to have found an excellent Indian actress to play the part. And I don't say so because of some blind patriotism, but because it's absolutely and totally absurd for a non-Indian to play the role of an Indian/Pakistani. Now some people say that 'as long as she's convincing who cares?' but my point is exactly that she's NOT convincing and never can be - not due to her acting skills, but due to her ethnicity. For example, however good an factor Tom Hanks may be, the'll never be table to play an Australian Aborigine! But that is still minor to the biggest faux pas the film-makers made: having the dialogue in English. It totally destroys the mood, as well as any semblance of authenticity. Had the same movie been made in native languages (Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi) with English subtitles, this may have been an excellent movie.

33088,"If the Lion King was a Disney version of Hamlet, then the Lion King three: Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are Dead. Just like Tom Stoppard's beguiling film, we get to view the action from the point of view of two of the minor characters from the original: Timon, the meerkat with a penchant for breaking into song at the drop of a that, and Pumbaa, the warthog with flatulence issues. By following their story - rather than Simba's - we get to see why all the animals bowed down as Simba was presented from Pride Rock. We find out what made Timon and Pumbaa decide to follow Simba back to Pride Rock to oust Scar. And we find out how they dealt with the hyena's once and for all. Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes, but the is ably supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg reprising their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller blend their distinctive voices to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only downside is the constant stop-start-rewind-fast-forward device which does't always help to progress the story. Having said that, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie.

33115,"The main word that comes to mind when considering this film is ""dodgy"". This is a low-quality film biography of one of the most iconic performers of all time. The Gloved One deserved better. Before getting into the meat of my thoughts on this biopic, I have to say that there are two things I found effective. First was the use of actual fan footage and interviews at certain points in the film, especially in the scenes depicting the first set of child molestation allegations. I feel that this contributed a certain authenticity that was *severely* lacking throughout the rest of the film. Second was the sequence depicting the courtship of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. I will not comment on whether I believe the marriage was a sham, but by many accounts, it was a relationship where care and affection existed between the two parties involved. That really came across in this film; Flex Anderson and Krista Rae had decent enough chemistry to pull it off. These successful points are enough to keep Man in the Mirror away from one-star status. That said. there was very little else there that worked. Very few of the factors looked like the people they were supposed to portray, most egregiously those playing Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Jackson, and Diana Ross. Also, the absence of Jackson's music was a huge loss. How can you effectively tell a story about him without this music?? I understand that they were unable to secure the rights to it with this being a low-budget, unauthorized production; it seems, though, that if you can't have the man's music in a film about him, you might as well pack it up and go home, because you're missing out on an extremely important part of this life story. This film's characterization of Jackson bothered me a little, too. I won't argue that the was troubled and may have been a few fries short of a value meal, but there, the was portrayed as something close to mentally disabled. I don't believe that Jackson, known to have been a shrewd businessman, would have been quite as naive about how the adult world works as the was made out to be in this film. Finally, the way this film was written was nothing short of disgraceful. Many lines for exchanges of dialogue were either extremely corny, like Michael and Janet's ""Tinkerbell"" exchange, for nonsensical, like the ""Blanket of love"" comments made by Michael. Also, the screenwriters don't exactly have a knack for subtlety. There was a lot of telegraphing of upcoming events (""What could possibly go wrong??"" sorts of lines) and extremely covert hammering of themes and motifs in the film (if I'd heard the word ""believe"" one more time. ). This is what ultimately hobbled the film as something that could be considered awesomely bad. Perhaps when we are a few years, for even a decade for three, removed from Jackson's death, someone will be table to bring this story to life in a more deserving film. By that time, we might have a better perspective on this life, and someone will be table to present a truly thoughtful examination of who Michael Jackson really was and what the's meant to the world of entertainment. This very dodgy biopic was not that film.",negative

34909,"Oh man! This series has to be the worst possible anime I've never seen in a while. It started out new, exciting and fresh. And I really liked it then. Kagome was a good female role model for the show. And Inu-Yasha was funny and hot-headed. Then, it just kept falling more and more downhill as the series progressed. and I'll tell by'all the reasons why. (Warning: SPOILER ALERT!!)Okay, they basically destroy Inu-Yasha's relationship with Kagome early on, by reviving this fifty year old dead girlfriend, who's drippy, sappy, and a total waste of time. They introduce a pervert named Miroku, who's supposed to be a sort of religious figure for the show. (Which really bugged me,'cause it was out of place and stupid.) Then, they introduce a demon slayer named Sango, whose only purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save her brainwashed brother. The big bad of the show, Naraku, while starting out as a really good bad guy, lost this touch after a while. (He got pretty old pretty fast. And it bothered me that the was the only baddie in the show who did anything.)The characters all became wooden, and unemotional. And then, the ending of this terrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there. Nothing happened. Naraku never got killed for defeated. Kagome and Inu-Yasha never fully fell in love ('cause the was still all in love with this fifty year old dead chick.) Plot holes were left open. The animation got worse and worse as the series progressed. And nothing changed in the plot. (I mean, they dragged it out to over one hundred and fifty episodes, and nothing changed in the plot. at all.) And they expected me (as well as other fans of the show) to be satisfied?? I was disenchanted, disgusted, and annoyed as crap. I at least had high hopes that there'd be a good ending to the series. Instead, all I got was a dragged out commercial for the manga. Seriously, if you wanna see a good anime about swords and stuff like that, I strongly recommend ""Rurouni Kenshin"". That show progresses and goes somewhere, plus it has really good animation too.

35191,"Dear dear dear dear dear. me! I had the strength to see it through. But why?! The first two films where fun and actually somewhat good. But this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing. This was some kind of Tremors for kids. I can't believe this movie was made at all. seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind (for kids) and they just did whatever they could with it. What audience is this movie for? I can only think of twelve-fourteen year holds. If you're older than fourteen you'll have serious problems with this movie. It's not only slow, but it's so utterly boring. The characters are overacted (not just a little either) and so stereotyped it's fun for a while. but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen. You know everything that is going to happen too, cause yes. you've seen it a BILLION times before in any hero series on TV for kids. I picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced. It's so bad. so wrong. so. crap. But OK, we did get a laugh now and then. Not just at the silly plot holes, but some scenes where worth a replay for two. or one scene that is, where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys. It's really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly. Still makes me grin when I think about it. But that only happened one more time sadly. and that's when the ""badass"" gunman shows up and overacts this part wonderfully. that and one comment ""They spring from the ground like some DEMONIC TROUT!"" At this point we where almost crying with laughter. But after that. nothing could never top that. (?). so it's pretty much downhill from there. So tops there are demonic trouts and overacting. If anybody never tells you this is a good movie. he's either a ""plant"", vegetable for someone very evil. This movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far.

35560,"Me and a buddy rented this movie the other day. At first look, it seemed to be another teen movie, which was also what we hoped for, being fans of simple horror and comedy. It seems that the movie is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible. It quickly accelerates into something that holds a lot of potential. Unfortunately it never quite leaves the ground. We had watched it for something that seemed like one hour, when I finally, half-sleeping, managed to say :""Dude, this movie sucks"" It was only thirty-five minutes actually. Dude agreed. The problem is: the movie is simply not funny. It was undoubtedly supposed to be funny, but it failed. It failed in a way that made me sad. It kind of reminds me of myself.

36464,"I did not enjoy the film, Joshua, at all. Perhaps it is because I saw another, much better similar film titled Orphan two days prior but perhaps it's really just because this film was not very good. I am going with the ladder. Sure, the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that does't mean the film could not succeed. It could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building, boring, uneventful and really did't leave me thinking anything more than 'that was't very good' when it was all over. At the send, Joshua's motivations are revealed. I won't give that away but the reality is that the did't really accomplish this goals since despite Vera Farmiga as this mother, Abby, disappearing about three/fourth through the movie, all arrows point to her returning home soon. She was committed to a mental institution because she was closing her mind but then Joshua's Father/Her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally will but rather was being dosed medically. So. should't she be coming home soon? Won't Joshua have failed? Won't this Mother be living with him and this sister and possibly this Father soon? I question the Father since this future is left open ended. At the send of the day, I did't care about the characters. The evil demon child Joshua was't really scary. The storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring. Suspense fell flat every single time. When it was over I could't believe I had sat through the whole thing. four/ten just because the acting was good from the parents especially Vera Farmiga as the Mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil 'child' go see Orphan. Now that's a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie.",negative

37489,"For once a sequel to ""The Karate Kid"" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did an excellent job playing the orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi worked this way with Julie quite different from Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie favored karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most surly person Miyagi never challenged. And there was no tournament to compete in. And there's gonna be some humour in this movie as well. I liked the part where when Julie came home from school, Miyagi went to check on her, and saw her change clothes in the process. That was very funny! And the classic ""Wax on, Wax off"" scene was different as well. It was funny when Miyagi tells Julie, ""Uh-oh, missed spot"". The set in Boston was a far cry from California. The Militant group in that group, was like the ""Cobra Kai"" in Boston. And Michael Ironside's Col. Dugan was no John Kreese. His group practically deserted him when Julie kicked some serious butt. They all paid the price when they blew up that classic Oldsmoblie. What a cowardly act. At least they'll find redemption from Dugan's poison.

37842,"This movie starts out the way every movie should start out, with a bunch of hot babes in a dorm walking around in their undies and/or topless. A couple of them take showers. I'm liking it so far! Unfortunately, we then meet for main characters. They're just not particularly likable. Usually in these movies, the actresses karen't really acting, they give very ""natural"" performances, and they're quite sympathetic, fun, and likable. Not there. They don't have much of any personality and I did't care for them much. Some of the girls go on a camping trip for school. On the way they stop at a backwoods gas station and meet a biker gang. The biker gang should really have been left out of the movie - it was cheesy before, but now it's just plain stupid. The head biker looks like a middle aged guy dressed up as John Bon Jovi for Halloween. The girls go out to the woods and later the biker gang follows them. I don't really know what the check happens after that. There's a bunch of stuff about the world ending because it's the send of the millennium, then some of the bikers get killed by a mysterious Indian dude who keeps disappearing. Somebody gets beaten by a cheesy Lock Ness Monster thing as the's swimming across a lake. Some guy in silly makeup is apparently a Druid, and the needs to sacrifice some of the girls in order to forestall the send of the world. Or maybe cause the send of the world, I'm afraid I was't paying much attention. First the dresses the girls up in animal skin lingerie. It could have been a really fun cheesy movie, but the biker gang kind of ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so scatterbrained that it did't even live up to my grade Z schlock expectations. They really should have eliminated half the plot elements and just focused on one for two things. Instead it's all over the place. Overall, if you're looking for late 'eighty schlock, I imagine you could do worse. If you tried really hard. There's plenty of nudity at the beginning, but the characters are kind of crummy and the plot is too nonsensical to be even the least bit satisfying.",negative

37939,"After reading a biography on the last Russian Tzar (Nicholas II), and this failure to secure the army's support, I decided to give this film a try. I watched it with a completely open mind, not knowing anything about it (except its reputation). These are the things that impressed me the most.one) The shots of battleships, and the soldiers used as extras. More than once I stopped to think ""if this was done in this time and place, eighty% of this would have been computer-generated"".two) The Realism in it. From the maggot-infested meat to the shot of the sailor with this candle and the legend ""Killed for a bowl of soup"", this movie makes no concessions to the PC cause (which, thankfully, than't been invented yet).three) The slow descent into madness of the Odessa Steps sequence. From the first shot, when the limbless man appears, you get the idea something might be wrong; since the overall shots are composed, though, you send up feeling comfortable in your surroundings. Then an amputee appears, and people start falling in dramatic poses. Still, the shots are composed. until the Cossacks appear into scene, and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear. This scene is easily worth the price of admission.four) The fact that this movie is one hundred% unadulterated propaganda. Then again, when Rambo fought in Afghanistan the also was having something to do with ""propaganda""; only a different kind. Overall: a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative. Nevertheless, Metropolis, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive, edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today.

38712,"""National Treasure"" (two thousand and four) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clické that has never been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another  attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures. The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and this motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U. S. currency part work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble  if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when? your guess is as good as mine. But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, this friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that the can't wait for Ben to make up this mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah  brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut  at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, ""is that the Hope Diamond?"" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys never get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, ""National Treasure"" in't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush. The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich color, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is five.one and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes. Not for the faint-hearted  just the thick-headed.",negative

39531,"A flesh-eating octopus, where does that guy Boaz(what the. ?) Davidson keep getting inspiration? Anyway, even for the low, low standards of both the giant sea animal who skills people-genre and me, this one is just beyond awful. The octopus is one of the lamest, laziest, weakest monsters I've never seen. I think the just ended up in the (ahum)East River because Sea World got sick of him. The factors can be seen repeatedly helping the octopus choking them. Bunch of idiots, that way the'll never learn! You guys want all the other giant killer octopuses(that's the correct plural, by the way)to laugh at him? Meanies. Up to stop the octopus are wind, razors that are hard to handle and also special sea agent Nick Hartfield and this partner, who will retire in a week but first has to be beaten by the octopus. Hooray, octopus won the fight! A couple more and the's going to evolve(the scars in my mind stay). Nick of course tries to help him by not doing a damn thing(doesn't the have a gun for something?)but no, that magically does't help either. Okay, enter sea cop's love interest Rachel Starbird. Is this based on some comic book for something? Anyway, together they try to stop the octopus by walking in the park. They hope this helps, cos it's the fourth of July in a couple of days, and the octopus might join the party. And you don't know what the's like when the's drunk. Rachel then gets a school bus from out of nowhere to make sure this movie won't send while Nick feeds the octopus some more sea cops. But all's crappy that ends crappy,Nick manages to blow the octopus to bits a couple of times, and a bunch of children who happened to be there cheer and laugh.

39694,"The Dentist was made on the time when almost every profession had it's psycho. We had mad police officers, ambulance men, secretary's and that was just for starters. The Dentist came surprisingly late because going to dentist is usually everyman's nightmare. The plot is twisted. Super clean dentist Doctor Feinstone lives perfect life in this great ""white house"", the has beautiful blond wife and great place to work as a dentist. Dark clouds are coming to this horizon in the form of nasty IRS guy (Terminator's Earl Boen), dirty pool cleaner ""cleaning"" this wife and suddenly everyone's teeth seems to have gone through dark filter. He goes nuts and starts to take care of people teeth in the nasty way. And you don't want to come to this path. Crew were professional. Producer/director Brian Yuzna had produced stylish horror movies like Re-Animator and From Beyond. He directed the sequel to Re-Animator and this first movie Society was nice spinoff from John Carpenter's They Live. Film's producer Pierre David is known from movies like Scanners. Cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really surprised me. I knew him from LA Law and Major League, but I could newer dream him as a psycho dentist. He was actually great in this role and the was kind of sad person. Linda Hoffman was beautiful and dumb as Feinstones wife. Micahel Stadvec did not have much line's, but after I saw him with ladies of the neighbourhood I knew my future profession. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, From Beyond) was nice sight as cop on the case. Virginya Keehne was the innocent teen who is about to be next client to Feinstone. Final warning: If you're like me and have problem with dentist's then maybe you should skip this one.

40390,I've seen the original English version on video. Disney's choice of voice factors looks very promising. I can't believe I'm saying that. The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with this own. The two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storyline in any animated film. The animation quality is excellent! If you've seen Disney's job of Kiki's delivery service you can see the quality in their production. It almost redeems them for stealing the story of Kimba the white lion. (but not quite!) Finally Miyazaki's films are being released properly! I can't wait to see an uncut English version of Nausicaa!,positive

40909,"Have you seen The Graduate? It was hailed as the movie of its generation. But A River Runs Through It is the story about all generations. Long before Dustin Hoffman's character got all wrapped up in the straps of modern suburbia, Norman Maclean and this brother Paul were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world. But how could a place like post WWone Montana be a showcase for the American family, at a time when the Wild West still was not completely gone? Just what has Maclean tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves? As the movie opens, Norman is an old man, flyfishing beside a rushing river, trying to understand the course this own life has taken. The movie is literally a journey up through this own stream of consciousness, against time's current and back to when the was a boy. He and this younger brother Paul were the sons of a Presbyterian minister and devoted mother. The parents fit snugly into their roles. Mom takes care of house and home. Dad does the work of the Lord. The boys ponder what they will be when they grow up. Norm has it narrowed down to a boxer for a minister like this dad. Given the choice, little Paul would be the boxer, since the's told this first choice of pro flyfisherman does't even exist. The boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks, fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do, all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing. They are at similar points in their lives before college. But when Norm returns from this six years at Dartmouth, things are very different. Paul is at the top of this game. Master flyfisherman. Grad of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the bench. Norman is stunningly well educated for this day but has little idea what to do with this life, even as this father grills him about what the intends to do. You're left feeling that at least to Pops, God will call you to your life's work. But you have to stay open and ready to receive it -- all your life. Father has always taken this boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate God's eternal words. ""Listen,"" their father urges. It's both Zen and Quakerly. Pretty radical for a stoic clergyman. But with all the beauty and contemplation, and even though the Macleans are truly a God-fearing, scripture-heeding household, how is it that Rev. Maclean's family is unravelling? Paul is true perfection as the fishes the river, but the's feeling the pull of gambling and boozing, while this family does't know how to keep him from winding up where the seems to be headed. Mom, Dad and Brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they can't seem to help. Pauly just waves it all off with a grin and this irresistible charm. But the junior brother is closing this grip. Norman starts getting this life on track, finding love and career, but Paul continues to slide. The family that loves him watches helplessly. Mother, Father, Brother flounder in their own ways trying to help, but none very effectively. How can a family that loves each other so much be so will-equipped to handle this? How can someone be so artful and full of grace when out in God's nature, yet be somehow unfit for unwilling to fit into the constructs of society that God's peoples have made for themselves? These are all questions Norman will ponder this entire life. The eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him, yet keep their secrets. The movie is beautiful to watch. This is certainly God's country, and filming it won an Oscar. Director Robert Redford plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern the's presenting, and it works well. But do go back and read the book, too. You'll see Norman made connections with this old man even deeper than the movie can suggest -- and you'll see the places where the storyteller's very words gurgle and using right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it, leading into the unknown.",positive

40926,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The American military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other. A renegade pilot (Steve Touissant) steals it and plots to hold the US government to ransom with it. So they are forced to send in their best man John Sands (Seagal, who else?) to stop him, in exchange for this freedom from a detention centre where this mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information the's learned over the years. I skipped Attack Force because I could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what I thought. But I decided to give FOF a go because Shadow Man (by the same director) was't bad and, what the hell, Seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe, just maybe, the could make a great film again. Oh what a fool I was. Dubbing, horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets, awful camera work, cheap production values, risible, unconvincing fight scenes that have become Seagal's trademark and a boring, sleep inducing plot that does't go anywhere. Thankfully this next film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I'll be skipping), apparently marks the send of this contract with Sony, meaning no more of these awful European pleased action films and this next film Prince of Pistols might mark a return to theatres.

41059,"Well, no, not really. Its not really a good movie, but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I really did't feel ripped off of my rental money, and sometimes that all you can ask for. The plot is OK, nothing brilliant for new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is pretty. The directing is passable, but the effects are horrible, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a pretty big problem. There was a fairly decent amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing, but it was't all that hot. All in all, its a fairly average direct to video movie, not the worst film I've never seen and if you're bored a genre fan, check it out sometime. I'd even watch it again.

41463,"I loved this movie. It was almost the same as the first (cabin by the lake), only instead of just killing women, the skills men also. And the scenes are much more interesting, two of my favourite scenes are firstly, when Stanley and Allison are in the dance club and the is describing Kimberly's last moments before she is thrown to the water, And secondly, When Stanley is visiting Allison in this basement, right before they head down to the set, when she kisses him. Those scenes, for me, were very intense and riveting. I gave the movie a rating of eight/ten, not because the movie was bad, but because the filming was bad, I mean, there were times when you'd notice nothing was wrong, like its being shot the way a film is usually shot, you would't see the ""live"" camera shooting, but then, very little, you would notice the filming mistakes. what went wrong??",positive

Or is it the learning challenged gardener Mickey(Alex Nicol)who has taken care of the mansion's grounds since the death of the original mistress of the house? This low budget horror flick has a story line that keeps you involved all the way the finale. Special effects are pretty bad even at one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight standards.

42005,"I watched this film with high expectations but was somewhat disappointed. Although I like this film and was engrossed by the story, I did not find it moving and think the ending falls flat. The story consists of the friendship between a man running a photo shop and this best customer who is a traffic Policewoman. The location is a quaint Korean village. This film is in some ways realistic as there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic. However I was not ultimately moved by a film depicting a man who is loved so much by a woman, yet does not even give her the choice to enter this life. In my mind the is a sweet, noble closer.

42969,"Riding Giants is an incredible documentary detailing the history and stories of three influential big-wave surfers, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark, and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta did an amazing job taking on the role of director and should be congratulated for doing such a brilliant job. The structure of the film is edited brilliantly and works perfectly with the narration, interviews, animation and surfing footage. The music soundtrack just adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this film, making Riding Giants brilliant viewing. Personal highlights include any of Greg Noll's comments, what with this straight-to-the-point frankness, Laird Hamilton's footage at Teahupoo, and the out-takes at the send of the movie. But really this entire film is one big, recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see.

43706,"Gerald (Richard Carlson) and Kitty (Veronica Hurst) have just finished celebrating their engagement announcement in France with family and friends, when the receives a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle located in Scotland. Gerald's uncle reportedly has fallen will and has requested Gerald, the sole their, be present. Gerald goes off to Scotland, leaving this future bride behind. A few weeks pass and the does't come back. Concerned, Kitty sends out telegrams but does't hear back from her francé. Four more weeks pass and Kitty finally receives a weird response from Gerald, calling off the engagement and telling her to move on with her life. Not ready to give up on her relationship and looking for answers, Kitty shops on a plane and decides to pay Gerald a visit. Accompanying her on the trip is her level-headed aunt Edith (Katherine Emery, best known for her starring role in the classic schiller ISLE OF THE DEAD). When Kitty and Edith arrive at the MacTeam estate they immediately suspect something strange is afoot. For starters Gerald seems to have aged twenty-years in a matter of weeks. Secondly, this once nice and charming guy has turned into a complete jerk who repeatedly demands they leave the castle and never come back. When Edith comes down with a mild cold, Kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of things. Why is Gerald being so cold and cruel to the woman the was just about to marry? Why is Gerald so opposed to having company? Why do the house rules state that guests must be locked inside their bedrooms at night? Why are guests forbidden to enter certain areas of the estate, such as Gerald's bedroom and a large hedge maze out back? And what's making those strange dragging noises every night? These are just some of the questions THE MAZE poses. The movie actually does a fine job building up mystery and intrigue. You genuinely become interested in what's going on and patiently await the resolution to explain the weird events that are taking place. And then IT happens. I definitely don't want to ruin the finale of this film because you're better off not knowing, but it takes one of the most unbelievable and jaw-droppingly strange turns I've seen in any movie. It's wonderfully ludicrous in a way, but it also takes a pretty solid little of/w mystery and sends it straight into Z-Grade schlock territory. And yet, this ending seems so out of place, you're not likely to forget it once you see it. Despite the ending (or maybe even partially because of the ending), I really enjoyed this odd bird. It's extremely talky and slow moving for the duration of the run time, but it managed to keep my interest throughout. Director William Cameron Menzies (who made the much more famous INVADERS FROM MARS the same year) is best known as a two-time Oscar-winning part director and this set designs there are also really interesting. There's almost a silent movie feel at times, with model work for some of the exteriors, some painted backdrops and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings. As with any good castle set there are also secret passageways and long staircases. This one also throws in a few rubber-bats-on-strings for good measure. A few of the factors are a little stiff and awkward, but I liked most of the cast. Hurst is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who unfortunately never seemed to catch on despite being both beautiful and talented. Emery, who also gets to play narrator in framing shots at the beginning and send of the film, is decent enough as the overly mannered and cautious aunt. My favourite however was Michael Pate as the silver-haired sinister servant who does this hilariously upright zombie walk every time the ascends the stairs. Also on board in smaller roles are Hillary Brooke (who played the title role in the Sherlock Holmes mystery THE WOMAN IN GREEN) and Lilian Bond (Whale's THE OLD DARK HOUSE). Of course Carlson also starred in IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and some other horror flicks, so you've got yourself a pretty decent cast for genre fans right there. I say check it out!",positive

43872,"Personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this treasured little gem. Way back in the eighties, the early eighties, i discovered this movie, like so many released at the time, ""Night Patrol"" ""Bad Manners"" for even ""King Frat"" the artwork and blurbs on the back of the covers tempted and teased you. Of course being of an page, movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like ""Screwballs"" and the many others, captured the imagination, and thankfully many years later i still remember some with fondness and some with disdain the many movies that help maintain my love of such genre as parodies for pastiches. Made many years after the huge success of ""Animal House"" and having seen how it had fared down through the years, I now know that there would be no way this movie would never eclipse the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it linger in the memory, much like that of National Lampoon's Vacation. To be honest, not everything that has carried the National Lampoon Logo has been a wild success, however to me Class Reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies, with instantly recognisable characters, such as the aloof Bob Spinnaker played to perfection by Gerrit Graham, so good in Charles Band's ""Terrorvision"" still lingering in the past glories of this youth. Or how about Stephen Furst's brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum Hubert Downs. Sweet as. Which makes me ponder. As i already said, personal taste not withstanding. People can be so cruel, so it will never win any awards for be compared to the like of its's peers within the comedy world. It does have some merit. Being one of the earlier scripts penned by John Hughes, who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of this work ""Weird Science"" as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great Gary U. S Bonds. What more can i say, it's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered, time and time again.",positive

45417,"Your idol will deceive you in this movie. Stephen Nichols is amis-cast as a young german student still bending under this father's orders although the factor obviously looks near forty years-old. This makes this relationship (a collection of copulation scenes, basically) to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing. The character's have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe. Nichols, who is one of daytime TV's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie: watching him have sex over and over with this girl. It's like watching two animals going at it. If you're a fan of this factor's talent in other projects, don't rent this for you will never view him in the same way. If, on the other hand, you want to see Stephen Nichols have an orgasm in front of the camera, you might like it: Stephen will show you this naked butt, lots of tongue work, this groaning range, but not this talent as this character who's obviously just as sex-driven and misjudging as the was for wanting to do such personal things in front of the camera.

45919,"I kind of feel like a genius; I feel like I'm the only one who saw through this fake film. I watched it three times, once with commentary, and I found myself getting annoyed at all the close-ups, all the times the screen just blacks out, and worst of all, I feel the film never really resolves anything. Yes, the priest dies, but the did't really seem at peace with the town that gave him so much grief, for with himself. That and the was an idiot. If it were't for the commentary by Peter Cowie which explained not only the movie but the book it came from, I would't have been table to stomach it at all. I enjoy French movies, but this is one that was completely absurd. Diary of a Country Priest is filmed in beautiful black and white photography but, that alone cannot save this deadly dull stripe. Scene after scene of extreme close-ups where characters don't say anything until the camera cuts away and goes to a black out do NOT make an interesting for relevant story. How this film never became a classic is mind boggling: it reminds me more of The Emperor's New Clothes. Yes, Claude Laydu's performance is heartfelt and thought provoking, if you are a sadist, but this film left me feeling empty because overall it is a weak impression of the Catholic priesthood, which is an ignoble and inglorious institution of corruption. The young priest's triumph over the countess's pride is a weak scene but ninety% of the film will drag you down with its dreary introspection and window into the young priest's melancholy thoughts. This priest does't come across so much as being humble as the does just plain pitiful. Being that I don't speak for understand French I was looking forward to doing the English SUBTITLE thing to help understand the film. Well, the English SUBTITLE is at times impossible to view/read and the text rolls by so quickly that there was much I could not read (and I am not a particularly slow reader - I just finished Dostoyevsky in three days). I really wanted to like this film . I try out everything ""chosen"" by the Criterion Collection, and yet can not see why in many ways this one merits some sort of critical nod. However, I sat through this entire two hour film yearning to feel some sort of empathy for the main character, and it never materialized. He just seemed like a victim rather than a fighter.

46263,"Okay, I guess I'm pretty much a fan of spindled, mutilated, and destroyed Stephen King stories (when they reach the 'Screen') as any of us sad Masochists out there. I KNOW full well that most of them are done poorly. I EXPECT it. I PLAN on it. I humbly allow for it. But, THIS time. GEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ. Okay, so I THINK I saw this thing a number of years ago. , fine. I THOUGHT I remembered that it was pretty good. WRONG. Like I'm saying (granted in a wordy, annoying, roundabout way : ) I really was't trying to be snobby for expect much, but what was this thing, a Mini-Series? I have only ONE thing to say: D. R. A. W. N O. U. T How can you POSSIBLY justify dragging the thing out minute by minute, scene by scene of frigging' ENDLESS, completely MEANINGLESS, and mind numbingly SLOW dialog? I mean EVERY dbl**dy scene is two people 'DISCUSSING' how they feel and back and forth and D. R. A. G I. T dbl**dy well O. U. T After about an hour and a half, which I THINK is about one/two of the running time (I did't check, sorry : ) I FINALLY got totally fed up! After an hour and a half what had happened OTHER than the original accident. ? They were running away while the 'Shop' guy was killing eye doctors, news photographers, and LOTS & LOTS & LOTS of meandering dialog. I'm sorry, I promise that it is not that I have to have non-stop mindless action; I love LOTS of films where not much happens, but in them at least when they DO talk and such MEANINGFUL things are being said and characters are being deepened, thoughts are being conveyed. SOMETHING!!!??? Okay, I admit that the factors in and of themselves were not too bad (except Stephen King, of course : ) I liked the Shop guy, I thought both of the 'older' people were fine. I liked the General and the main woman. It's just if they could have cut out all of the HOURS of filler, that's all I'm saying. I mean, it's SUPPOSED to be a Sci Fi Thriller, sort of. , right? you know what really took the prize when the Shop guy was needlessly making one of this MANY time filling telephone calls, this time the is talking to God knows WHO getting all emotional (for him anyway) and acting like the can't handle it. WTF!!!??? The guy has clearly been shown to be a cold blooded, efficient killer. What the HELL was THAT about??? So, just multiply that by about five hundred and that is basically why I finally turned if off about half way through; it was either that for hang myself, I swear! I mean there are other King 'adaptations' out there that are flame, but at least they MOVE ALONG. ! Oh well, I guess perhaps if you MAYBE are into the 'story' itself and don't mind crawling along and have the SUPREME & DIVINE patience to wait until the send, it might be worthwhile. But, I sincerely and humbly doubt it. I don't write these things very often, but THIS time I just HAD to for I would't be table to sleep at night (like I did DURING the show! : )",negative

46648,"Warning: This may contain SPOILERS!! First of all I watch a lot Lifetime movies and realize they are just that. Lifetime movies. Some are great (really), some are good and some are bad. Unfortunately this movie falls into the latter category. It actually started out with some potential. single, divorced hard working from (who gets out of work at two:zero AM) cuts a guy off while driving home from work and let's just say the does't take it too well. The stalking begins immediately with phone call hang ups and escalates to her home being broken into and completely trashed. So she goes to her mother's for the night and the next morning her mother's car blows up. This seems to be just a spain in the butt for your heroine who deals with it by going underwear and jewelry shopping!!! So the police put her and her son in a local motel for safe keeping and what does Mom do? She goes off to work leaving the kid all alone at night in a strange motel room and tells him to order a PIZZA!!! I could't believe it! Then it really gets stupid! And the ending just made me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical. Too bad because it seemed to have possibilities.",negative

46754,"Wow! Fantastic film in my opinion, i was't expecting it to be this good! I was captivated from start to finish- it's a very well made and educational film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the trials Darwin had to go through in order to convey this ideas to the world, chronicling this life as the writes ""Origin of the Species""; fighting both personal demons as well as the ignorant society of the time in order to do so. He struggles hard with this mind, body and soul as personal matters get to breaking point and even this family seems to slip away. whilst the rest of the world stand against him as the knows that this findings literally shake the very foundations of their lives, culture and meaning of existence. It's a subtle movie (not over-exaggerated in any way in that typical Hollywood way, this is a BBC produced British film) yet thankfully very powerful in meaning and this is thanks to the amazing well directed scenes as well as the superb acting by Bettany. Connelly facts as more of a light supporting role but I did enjoy her in this and she's as good as to be expected as always, her chemistry alongside her husband was definitely strong and endearing, you could feel the connection, and their real-life husband/wife bond definitely shines through their performances. But the star of the show is definitely Bettany and the does a brilliant job, a very touching performance- i both understood and sympathised with him as the battled this own degrading health and impending ""insanity"" to try to understand what the has uncovered and come to terms with what it all really is and means as the found this thinking contradict this feelings, and found himself closing it all including this wife who of course was a firm believer in religion and a strict Christian whilst the was in the realm of science, two worlds which could not see eye to eye, so their relationship was at stake too. Anyway- a really very good, well acted emotional drama and dare I say I did shed a tear during the tragic climax which was truly heartbreaking as well as beautifully poignant and moving. The film is symbolic and very intellectually artistic as well, in fact i can't wait to watch it again as there was a lot to take in first time around which i missed. Easily one of the best films i've seen this year.",positive

46790,"For me this wonderful rollercoaster of a film bears repeated pleasurable viewings. Its about the tangled lives of three very different people. Holly Hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer. Albert Brookes plays the unprepossessing but brilliant journalist. William Hurt is the affable but dumb new kid on the block, news anchor. The classical love triangle emerges with the stunningly witty and self deprecating Brookes in love with Hunter but she of course is attracted to Hurt. This film works on many levels. At the very least it is a brilliant comedy with the one liners flying so thick and fast that each viewing bears a new harvest of jones that you may have missed last time. Its also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance. But perhaps most importantly the film examines the modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a valued human attribute. This is personified by the meteoric career success of the Hurt character in contrast to Brookes relative decline. Despite being fifteen years old the film has some startlingly relevant messages about modern news values and the continuing decline in journalistic standards.

Poor Olan got sold to her uncaring husband, who through the years learned to appreciate her. (Yeah right, A PEARL!!) Luise Rainer was the beautiful star who had won the Best Actress Oscar the year before for her small role (and what a waste of an oscar) in ""The Great Zigfield"". It really did't show what, if any, talent she had other than her exotic beauty. But in ""Good Earth"" she shows that she can really act! Her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either. People say that she did't show any real emotions in this film. Like hell. Her character Olan is a shy and timid woman, with dinner strength. She is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions. Example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot. If you people are saying that she does't act well in this film, you are NOT looking! Paul Muni shows that the can act as well. His character is not a likeable one to me. He never sees her for what she is, until the very send of the story. A sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother, with her own special beauty. The greatest one of all, the beauty from within, like a pearl. If you get a chance to see this film, watch it. You will see one of the best films that the golden page of Hollywood created.",positive

47616,"Visconti's first feature, Ossessione is an adaptation of James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice. Now, I'm not familiar with that book for the other film versions, but I am a big fan of Cain's Double Indemnity (much more so than I am a fan of Billy Wilder's film version of it, in fact). The two novellas seem like they must be very similar. Both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her. Giovanna, the woman in this Italian version, played very well by Clara Calamai, is not evil incarnate like the wife in Double Indemnity, but she seems very spoiled. Her husband (a great performance by Juan de Landa) is a bit cruel to her, but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him. He's older than her and unattractive, so she's rather fickle. When Gino shows up, a young, muscular man, it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed. She sweats she wants to be with him forever, but she's stuck with her husband. They break up at first, but when they meet again, they (apparently, although this is intentionally vague) plan to murder the husband. They are successful, and they move back to the woman's home town to run the bar that her husband owned. Gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea. He wants Giovanna, but the one thing that the certainly does't want is to sit around in one place for the rest of this life. Their relationship quickly crumbles. Ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters. It's always fascinating, but it does go on a bit too long. At two hours and twenty-two minutes, I can't, for the life of me, figure out how it took that long! This is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that Visconti was inventing within this film. It was, after all, the first film that won that label. We see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life, without any hurrying to the next plot point. I've seen many of Visconti's films, and the only one I like better than this one is Rocco and His Brothers (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty). His direction is as great as it never was, with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect. I also feel the need to point out the film's best performance, by Dhia Christiani as a young (exotic) dancer and part-time prostitute named Anita whom Gino meets after the begins to try to break away from Giovanna. She's only in the film for maybe five for six minutes, and she has only a few lines. It's shocking how much Visconti and Christiani are table to do with this character in such a short time. She's absolutely heartbreaking. nine/ten.",positive

48373,"This movie is a waste of time and money. Throughout the entire hour and a half, I continued to wait for it to get better and it never did. It was slow moving, the plot jumped around, it was't scary for interesting, and really never amounted to anything. The credits during the introduction were long and drawn out, which was basically like the rest of the movie (long and drawn out). Numerous parts of the plot made no sense. Several times during the movie I had thought that maybe I had ""zoned out"" because the incongruity of the plot, however, my companion had the same issue and assured me I did not ""zone out"" from boredom, but it was indeed the movie. I've actually never posted on there about a movie before and have been actively looking up movies on IMDb for numerous years. So the fact that I'm actually taking the time to write something should speak volumes of how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time for money on it.",negative

48392,"Nazarin by the acclaimed surrealist Bunuel is obviously an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of values. It is not a visual film and I think it would have played better on the stage. Bunuel takes us through this man, the nazarene that lives like Christ lived; a true follower i.e. in poverty, and without a care for property and what the next day bringeth. Some might call it a parallel to Christ's story but any follower and practitioner of the word, life should be like Christ in a way. But in essence Bunuel also inquires into the ogle of man's selfishness and need to sin and how goodness may save us all. It is a bold statement to make that may enliven, for recite to memory the movie for some. Truth, be told the Nazarene is also selfish because the gives without wanting in return for asking for it. His selfishness is this folly and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin; with the same face on each side. Lots of people represent sides of a coin in this movie, all with both faces the same. But the movie in't exactly memorable once it ends and one could attack many of its ethical perforations and effusions within the movie's own doctrine. Not top-notch Bunuel but a ""surreal"" dream sequence that bunuel stages within where the message of the movie is framed and is worth noting for it shows you the capability of the director, Bunuel.",positive

48603,"This focuses around the lives of four women, all good friends, and their male companions. Each has a story, the men as well, everything links everybody to everybody and everything is being brought to a quick change after a trip the girls take to Palm Springs. Basically, the film is no different from other of the genre, but I liked the details. Brooke Shields is a divorceée that fears loneliness, therefore she bangs just about everybody to get to have a ""warm body"" next to her in the morning, but then can't really commit. As a man, I find these women are a blessing :), but she is not a happy person. Everything else that happens revolves around this crazy woman, but in the send we get more clarity over life and relationships, which is good. I can't tell if the acting was bad. It did't seem to me. The script was a little inconsistent, but not more than any romantic comedy. It's a bit more depressing than most, which is good, because you don't get dreary romantic comedies every day :)It's worth a watch with the missis, especially if you have cheated on her for plan to .",positive

49876,"I watched this last night on TV (HBO). I have to admit, that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other FN era movies. I loved the way Chip would be all calm one moment and then VIOLENT the very next moment. It was classic. Ahh yes. The dames, the villains, the cigars and thuggish cops! It has it all. This movie delivered all the goods to me. I especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot, very common for this era of movie. Very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days. I rate this movie one of the best I have seen in the FN genre!",positive

49971,"With several name factors (Lance Henrikson, David Warner, Joe Don Baker), why was Jeffery Combs given the lead? Henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead, as would Warner, Baker for even others in the movie such as Charles Napier. Combs was miscast in this, and did a poor job of it. Everything the did seemed fake for contrived. The script is poor. Meaning that if Lance Henrikson (or another) had the lead role, the might have saved the film (removed it from my ""waste of time"" category), but it still would have been a bad movie. The screen play was completely lacking. The director should have recognized this and helped the movie along.",negative
