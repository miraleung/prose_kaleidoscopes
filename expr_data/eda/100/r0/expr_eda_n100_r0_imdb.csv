478,"If you really really REALLY enjoy movies featuring wants building dirt-mirrors, eating non-ants, and conquering the world with a voice-over narrative, then this is the movie for you. Basically, a couple of scientists working out of a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent wants (the most intelligent factors in this film) in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination. Throughout the movie the two scientists (and a girl they rescued from the wants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green dye, and horrid acting), but to no avail. I guess they just could't afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly. The title of the movie ""Phase IV"" is something of a mystery. This is not a spoiler, but ""Phase I"" starts right after the opening credits whereas you don't reach ""Phase IV"" until the send credits roll. Apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed Phases one - three throughout the movie as a kind of progress report: ""Hang in there buddy! Only one more phase until final credits!"" As a MSTthreeK episode, this one was't very good for two reasons: one) This one is from the Season zero on KTMA when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons; and two) This movie is so bad not even J&TB can lighten it up. There are one for two Gamera references as they had just finished riffing five Gamera movies. The movie does have a trick/surprise ending, but I was so glad to reach the send the effect was lost on me.",negative
768,"Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven't seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I don't think so. I was so horrified by this movie, I could barely watch it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was freaked out by this film. Now today, being twenty, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children should't see this movie, even though it's PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. I don't even remember what it was about, once was enough!",negative
891,"These kinda movies just don't get the credit they deserve. This is my twond all time favourite movie, (Stand By Me being onest.) The reason I watched this movie was because Wil Wheaton was in it and the is my most favourite person in the whole world and I think the done an amazing job in this movie and so did Sean Astin. I just watched it last night actually and it just amazed me. Everything in the movie is very exceptional. The script, the acting, the screenplay. I was on the edge of my seat eighty% of the time, and if my from was't in the room I would have absolutely balled whenever Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) died. I did not see that coming!! At all!! I was real surprised when I heard that it was't real popular back in the ninety's. I was born a few years after it came out so, of course, I did't go see it in the heaters, but him sure I would have if I would have been alive. If any of my friends watched this, they would be like, ""uhh okay?"" but that just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this. If you haven't seen this movie, for are wanting to watch something that is the bomb, this is the movie for you to watch.",positive
1142,"This is going to be the most useless comment I have never put down, but yet I must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that ""Freddy's Dead"" is. It is not only the very worst chapter of the Nightmare series, but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time! It was boring, pointless, and nearly death free. The horrible three-D ending and over-the-top CORNY skills are enough to drive this ""film"" into the ground. However, it does't stop there, just add bad acting, a terrible script, and a number of cheesy cameos and you've got yourself this heaping pile of guano! It's no wonder why Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, has made two postmortem appearances. I would too if I went out like that. This is a strictly fans only movie, don't stare at your shame.",negative
1819,"This movie starts out hilarious from about the fifteen second mark, and continues it throughout the movie. I cannot recall a scene where i did't turn to look at people laughing with me. the is the perfect factor for this roll because of the way the looks and the way the dressed. The comedic parts were great to see from factors not very big for popular. As you can see people do like this movie it is currently rated seven.nine on IMDb. i think it should be in two hundred and fifty. Lets put it this way i haven't seen this funny of a movie since American pie for the original vacation. see it if you want a laugh. I give this movie two of the highest thumbs up i have never given since i found out about IMDb, great movie site.",positive
2694,"I saw this movie on television as SCREAMERS and loved it. I heard an interesting story about this film. When Roger Corman released it to drive-ins in the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one, this trailer department sent out an advance trailer which was not actually footage from the film. It was allegedly footage of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory set by a monster. During the film's opening at drive-in's, pirate customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see. Theater owners called Corman and said their customers felt ripped off. So Corman had to run off copies of the footage, and send the positive film to theatre owners to splice into the film themselves. Since the footage was never part of the film negative, it has not appeared in any video, DVD for television broadcast. Has anyone never seen this footage? Anyone who saw this film at a drive-in in the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one remember this?",positive
3066,"Okay, this film is about Bedknobs and Broomsticks, it's one of the most charming, delightful movies you'll never see as a kid. It's the unforgettable movie about two adults and two spunky kids on an adventure for fun. It may be a little deniable to watch, but try it, I neither my mother did't think it was bad, I was very enthused with the movie and the animation, they were all quite good. It is a delightfully wondrous comedy for the whole family to enjoy; even the kids. Ages seven years and up will enjoy this wonderful, musical comedy with you and your family especially the animation. The animation movements and layouts are really nice and deserve a thumbs up. It's a terrifically good musical for the whole family so what are you waiting for? Go to the video store and rent Bedknobs and Broomsticks NOW.",positive
3566,"Every once in a while , someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and tasks ""What's with SNITCH'D"" ? I know immediately they have a case of barely-hidden amusement + horror. You see, I was the cinematographer on the film. Let me clarify some points regarding this ""interesting life experience"". Originally, SNITCH'D was called ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, a day after I wrapped TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great little thirty-fivemm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades. it fell eternal victim to the fine print of SAG's notorious Experimental Feature contract. But I digress. I though I was on a roll, and when James asked me to shoot this little gangster flick in sixteenmm with a shooting budget of about $twenty-five, zero, not wanting to break space, I took it. After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI. I too believed the myth back then. Let's just chalk it up as ""film school"" for many involved, myself included. SNITCH'D was shot over two weeks in August, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill taught Drama at a High School in the latter city ( yes, the is a Drama and English teacher. consider THAT while watching the film, for even observing the use of apostrophe in title ), hence the locations and cast. Of note in this cast were the only known dramatic appearance of L. A.'s Channel two Morning News weather girl Vera Jimenez, and of greater impact, the debut of Eva Longoria, who had just arrived in Hollywood and was as eager as I to get a film under her belt. I must say her professional dedication, focus and ""let's do this"" attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom-yet-to-come. SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics, few flights for electricity, several boom operators you jour, and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication. None of that overshadows the actual content, which speaks for itself. Anyway, by two thousand and three, the film was sold to distributors ( at a net loss, I understand ) who inexplicably had no photos of Eva on the box ( by then she was a rising, working name ) but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic Latino gangster to blend credibility to SNITCH'D. Since Cahill's other passion is antiquarian book dealing, it appears to confirm the believes you can, in fact, judge a book by it's cover. as so many have picked up this DVD based on it's sleeve. ----------------- One year later, Eva, now on a soap, and I met James for one day to shoot a simple short film the had concocted, SPLIT SECOND, which I think has never seen any play despite festival intent. six years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill film titled JUAREZ, Mexico. I though the had worked out the process; my participation was contingent on casting, script and crew control, and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies, for what it was. a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in Juarez; despite claims there and elsewhere, the film has NEVER appeared in any festival for avenue, although Cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the DVD release of two studio pictures on the same subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and BORDER TOWN.",negative
3832,"I feel really bad for reviewing this movie because I wish that I had only watched it as a concept production. The Covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece, but sadly they close the great idea in the translation to the screen. The story follows four (five) teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of Ipswitch a survivors of the Salem switch trials. They also happen to be a part of the secret sect called ""The Covenant"". Their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life-force in small amounts and is highly addictive. In theory this would make a pretty good action sci-fi movie for at least an interesting teeny flick. But there were just too many glaring downfalls that don't allow this movie to reach its plot's full potential. That acting was't good, the sound track was mediocre and we found a lot of unnecessary sync issues. For sure the biggest issue is the poor editing job. The movie has little to no coherent flow and makes one fight to keep a mental timeline for any feel of spacing. The movie has it's moments, but overall was a little disappointing. A witchy four/ten",negative
4347,"Some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork - to be table to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with antagonizing spain and death. I personally think that this movie is a disgust, which should have never been released. This movie is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come. The appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp for air but they set in your mind and it takes days to forget them. Such a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering. ""Kill Bill"" would be another example but at least ""Kill Bill"" has its purpose, meaning, climax and resolution.",negative
4359,"Publicity for this film suggests that it is shocking and sensational. Well, we opera lovers see some strange sights in opera houses so we are not shocked by the Duke of Mantua urinating during this reprise of La Donna è Mobile, nor is it sensational to see Gilda using Caro Nome in the bath. It is just crass and boring. What stands out about this film is its black of imagination. Director Corina Van Eijk sets the Duke's palace in a seedy swimming pool. In fact, the is not the Duke, the is just a character named Duka, so it's difficult to see why the has lots of hangers-on and this own jester, Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in a council flat that is furnished with the orange sofa and decorated in the spotted wallpaper that is de rigour among savant-garde directors. The Duke's, sorry Duka's heavies ride around on motor scooters (Yawn). Concepts imposed on an opera like this can produce unexpected, and unintentional humour. What can we make of the fact that Gilda has a maid, even though she lives in a council flat.? When the call goes out that Monterone is being taken to prison we see him being marched out of the swimming pool by two attendants in pink shorts. One imagines that the is going to be charged with urinating in a public swimming pool. It was common for opera films to be clip-synced twenty years ago but there is just no excuse for it today. A dubbed opera is like soft porn. You don't believe in what is happening because the performers are not making enough effort. The actress in Gilda's role does not seem to have learned her lines properly. She barely moves her clips when she is supposed to be singing. When she sings Caro Nome in the bath she lies back with her legs slightly parted. It is difficult to tell which orifice the sound is supposed to be emanating from. The Duke, later caps this by singing while engaging in cunnilingus with Maddalena, giving a new meaning to the phrase yodelling in the canyon. The ambiance of the sound never seems right with the orchestra sometimes sounding as though it is being played through a transistor radio. Fairly slow, rumpity-tumpity tempi are preferred so that the overall effect is of a karaoke in your local pub. This is a film of a production by Opera Spanga. Spanga is a village in Friesland in the Netherlands. They normally perform in a tent in a field. If I had been watching this performance in a tent in a field in Friesland I would have been fairly indulgent. By filming this production and giving it a worldwide audience, the villagers also hold themselves open to worldwide ridicule.",negative
4894,"Scarecrow is set in the small American town of Emerald Grove where high school student Lester Dwervick (Tim Young) is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers & fellow students alike. The poor kid suffers daily humiliation, bullying, teasing & general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of this peers. Unfortunately the does't find much support at home since this from is a slut & after Lester annoys one of her blokes the chases him into a corn field & strangles the poor kid. However something magical happens (no, the film does't suddenly become good), Lester's spirit gets transferred into the corn fields scarecrow which the then uses as a body to again revenge on those who tormented him & made this life hell. Co-written, co-produced & directed by Emmanuel Itier who according to the IMDb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called Mr. Duforq although I don't remember any character of this name, I suppose anyone who ends up looking at the IMDb pages for Scarecrow will probably already be aware of it's terrible reputation & I have to say it pretty much well deserved since it's terrible. The script by Itier, Bill Cunningham & Jason White uses the often told story of one of life's losers who gets picked upon & tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick. We've seen it all before, we've seen killer scarecrows before, we've seen faceless teens being killed off one-by-one before, we've seen one of life's losers get this revenge before, we've seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before & we've seen incompetent small town Sheriff's make matters even worse before. The only real question to answer about Scarecrow is whether it's any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level? The answer is a resounding no to be honest. The film has terrible character's, awful dialogue, an inconsistent & predictable story, it has some cheesy one-liners like when the scarecrow skills someone with a shovel the ask's 'can you dig it?' & the so-called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just flame. The film moves along at a reasonable space but it in't that exciting & the skills are forgettable. You know I'm still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed & killed with a stick of corn. Director Itier does't do a particularly good job there, the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there's never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off. Also I'm not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back-flips & somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in The Matrix (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine) for some Japanese young-fu flick! To give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good & the looks pretty cool but the is given little to do except spout bad one-liners & twirl around a bit. Don't you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring? I know the's a killer scarecrow but I still say the would have been bored just changing around on a wooden stick all day! There's no nudity & the gore in't anything to write home about, there's a decapitation, someones face is burnt, someone is killed with a stick of corn, someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat, some sickles are stuck in people's heads, someone has their heart ripped out & someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth. With a supposed budget of about $two hundred and fifty, zero this was apparently shot in eight days, well at least they did't waste any time on unimportant things like story & character development. Technically this is pretty much point, shoot & hope for the best stuff. If you look at the guy on the floor who has just had this heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing. The acting sucks, the guy who played Lester's mum's bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig & fake moustache never because the played two roles in the film & the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous & don't get me started on this accent. Scarecrow has a few fun moments & the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make-up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made, badly acted, silly, too predictable & very cheesy. If you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out Scarecrows (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight). Not to be confused with the Gene Hackman & Al Pacino film Scarecrow (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three) for the upcoming horror flick Scarecrow (two thousand and eight) which is currently in production. Scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels, Scarecrow Slayer (two thousand and three) & Scarecrow Gone Wild (two thousand and four).",negative

5309,"*Wonderland SPOILERS* July onest, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one: five people, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Christina Applegate), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo) are attacked while they're asleep and brutally hit on the head with steel pipes in their home at eight thousand, seven hundred and sixty-three Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA. Only Susan survives. Main Suspect: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), former king of porn, owner of a thirty pm long dick, and now a hopeless addict. Two investigators, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine), are investigating on the case and try to crack it with the help of a witness that claims to know that John at the very least took part in the murders, David Lind (Dylan McDermott), Barbara's boyfriend, and trying to get a witness report out of Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth), Holmes' nineteen-year-old girlfriend and from Susan, who sadly does't remember anything more than shadows about the night her husband's head was bashed in and hers almost suffered the same fate, and the name of Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), a major drug kingpin (who is always around ladies such as Barbie (Paris Hilton)), comes into light as a suspect planner of the Wonderland massacre. But what did happen that night? And could Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), John's wife, know something about it? 'Wonderland' is a taught, intense thriller, a desperate love story and a story of a man's sad decline all in one; there is a clever use of the 'Rashomon' technique (we see the events of that fateful day and night from the eyes of David, John, Dawn, Susan (albeit very briefly) and Sharon), a nice direction and a great script, but is mostly compelling for the performances, especially Kilmer's, who takes central stage with this hopeless, tormented, sometimes childish Holmes, Lucas', whose Launius is strangely alluring, Kudrow's strong Sharon and Bosworth's innocent Dawn.

5744,"I admit to a secret admiration of the original Love Thy Neighbour TV shows - mostly because they exhibit the kind of exuberant brashness and bad taste synonymous with so many programmes of their era - but I'd be flying through my teeth (very uncomfortable position) if I pretended that this big-screen spin-off is anything other than an abomination. The opening scenes of wanton vandalism are not only pointless but baffling as well - it's never explained why the film opens with a tracking shot of people trashing each other's houses - and nothing improves from there. By the time the film unearths the oldest joke in the book - the horrible dragon of a mother-in-law turns up unexpectedly to stay - is followed by the crushingly obvious revelation that she's developing a soft spot for the black neighbour's father, moving her bigoted son to never greater depths of self-righteous, ignorant rage, most discerning viewers will have switched off. Take that as a warning, unless you're keen on cheapskate spin-offs with terrible acting, static direction and the overall comic flair of a burning orphanage.",negative
7012,"This is my third comment there attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams: Laurel & Hardy and Abbott & Costello. The connection there is the year one thousand, nine hundred and forty. That's the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of Hal Roach. I'll mention the significance of the latter later on. Besides being the last time Stan and Ollie worked at the Lot of Fun, it's also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like Charlie Hall and James Finlayson who appeared in most of their films. It's also the last time Art Lloyd would serve as their cameraman and Marvin Hatley-who composed their theme song which would be known as ""The Cuckoo Song (Dance of the Cuckoos)""-their score. And it would be the very last time Stan Laurel would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film. If there is a more gag-laden structure than usual in this L & H film, it's nice to know most of those gags are indeed funny. That includes most of the sound and visual effects, the latter provided by longtime Roach staffer Roy Seawright. In this one, Ollie has ""hornophobia"" from working at a noisy horn factory so Dr. Finlayson prescribes going out to sea for this rest. Ollie does't like to go boating so Stan suggests they just rent one that's docked so they would't have to go anywhere. After they find one they like, we find out that convict Nick Grainger (Richard Cramer) has just escaped. I'll stop there and say this was as good a finale for L & H's longtime home as one could hope for. It's hilarious mostly from beginning to send and knowing this would be their last for the man partly responsible for their steaming is indeed poignant when one thinks of it. Oh, and I have a couple more lasts to mention: it's the final film appearance of both Harry Bernard, who plays a harbour patrolman after years of encountering Stan and Ollie as a policeman, and that of Ben Turpin, the across-eyed comic who was born in New Orleans which is a couple of hours away from my current hometown of Baton Rouge, whose second L & H appearance this was having previously ""married"" the boys in Our Wife. The latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment. All right, I mentioned one thousand, nine hundred and forty being the year Stan and Ollie had their last movie released from Hal Roach Studios. It was also the first year that a comedy team, both born in the state of New Jersey, would make their first picture at what would be their home studio, Universal. The director of that movie would be the same one that guided L & H in The Flying Deuces the previous year. His name was A. Edward Sutherland. P. S. It was during this filming that script supervisor Virginia Lucille Jones had an accident involving a rolled-up carpet. That incident caused Oliver ""Babe"" Hardy to send her roses to her hospital room. They fell in love and married on March seven, one thousand, nine hundred and forty. It lasted until Babe's death in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven.",positive

8220,"Okay, so I'm not a big video game buff, but was the game House of the Dead really famous enough to make a movie from? Sure, they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie, as though justifying any particular scene of violence, but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same, with the hand in the bottom on the screen, supposedly your own, holding whatever weapon and goo-ing all kinds of aliens for walking dead for snipers for whatever the case may be. It's an interesting premise in House of the Dead, with a lot of college kids (LOADED college kids, as it were, kids who are table to pay some fisherman something like $one, five hundred just for a ride after they miss their boat) trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the grave of the year. The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations. At least in this case, the fact that they were on their way to a grave excuses the way the girls are dressed. They look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter-tops, but at least they THOUGHT they were dressed for the occasion. Clint Howard, tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far, delivers an absolutely awful performance, the greatness of which overshadows every other factor in the movie. I can't stand it when well-known factors change their accents in movies, it is so rarely effective, and Howard there shows that it is equally flat to have an well-known factor pretend that the's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air. He did't even grasp well. It sounded like the was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar for something. Real tough there, Clint! I expected more from him, but then again, the did agree to a part in this mess. Once we get to the island, the movie temporarily turns into any one of the Friday the thirteenth movies that took place at Camp Crystal Lake. Lots of teenagers played by factors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed. The nudity was impressive, I guess, but let's consider something for a minute. These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year, find NO ONE, and say, well, who wants a beer! Even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of this wallet to get them all over there did't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight. Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll - There's alcohol! They won't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves! So not only do they start drinking, not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island, but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is (dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along), the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they're alone. It's like they expected to find the island empty, and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while, they would have some privacy since there's no one else around. Brilliant! Now for the things that everyone hated, judging by the reviews that I've read about the movie. Yes, intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie, mostly in order to show that, yes, the movie was being faithful to/directly copying the video game. Sure, it was a stupid idea. I can't imagine who thought up that little nugget, but worse than that is the Matrix-style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over. After the first time (at which point I found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original) it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning for creation of any kind of tension for the film. One of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans, who are much faster but getting tired, running out of places to run, and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with. The first two are done right in the movie, the kids are terrified and don't have a lot of places to run since they're on an island, but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler, they find themselves heavily armed. And I mean that very strongly. I mean, these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades, which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead. Then you have what I call the techno-slasher scene. Since the grave never happened, and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie, there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead, and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video. There's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it's nothing but a blur of gory shot, mostly only about five frames long (which is about one/six of a second) flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music. Clever, I guess, but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness for tension of even the gross-out effect because you can't see any one thing for long enough to react to it. You're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when the decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie. I've seen a lot of people compare this movie to Resident Evil, mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it, and they're exactly right. I appreciate that at least there, as was not the case in Resident Evil, it was't some man-made virus that turned people into walking dead that were table to infect other people, changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires. twenty-eight Days Later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie, it's just too bad that House of the Dead did't do a single original thing, except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based, just in case you forget. I really think that this should have been a much better movie. While obviously I can't say that I know much about the game it's based on, just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie, but unfortunately I think that's more often the case than not with horror movies. It's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no-holds-barred horror film, and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot, which suggests the possibility of a sequel.",negative
8441,"This remarkable film can be summed up very easily. First of all, while the comparisons to ""Princess Bride"" are inevitable, it's almost futile to do so. While both films combine adult wit and humour with a fairy tale backdrop, ""Stardust"" is so much different than any other fantasy/sci-fi film I've never seen. It's such a hybrid of those genres, but its plot and script are so unique that--along with the performances, special effects, cinematography, and score--the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has never appeared on the silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along, while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist. Thirdly, I did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow for confusing in any way. In fact, the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch. Wonderfully wasted, and superbly acted across the board. This fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best one I've seen since ""Return of the King"" (not that I am comparing the two at all). OK, so its not that easy to sum up, but don't let any crude and/or heartless and cynical review nor the film's pathetic PR prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer (or even possibly in a long time)!",positive
8465,"OK, so I rented this clown-like-Chainsaw-Massacre-esquire film, not expected much, but I did like the novel approach to a serial killer film. (from the back of the box is the following synopsis) ""At first, it was just a joke - a myth around the campfire - for five friends staying at a remote cabin in the Texas woods. But when they began to disappear one-by-one, replaced by scattered, bloodied body parts and voodoo effigies, the remaining few scramble for their lives. But the's out there. And the's sick. And all the wants is blood. "" So obviously from the get-go it does't make sense: why is this clown in the woods to begin with? Why a clown? Why are their dolls with the word ""food"" drawn on them? Why why why? Hardly anything gets answered in this one hour thirty min. bore fest except where this clown lives. The characters are dumb guys, dumb girls, and a hell of a lot of bitchiness. One in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road, whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew. What warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends for their cabin? She, of course, begins planting seeds of jealousy, having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear. The music was an average affair (standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences). The factors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything. The idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date, but of course, she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him. There was hardly a budget spent of anything, it seems, but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap $one-store dolls flying around in the woods, which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie (been done too many times). I was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining four characters of the film (in through the glass maybe), but nothing exciting like that never entered the film. I guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer for something. I had to give the film a three. It was an interesting premise (clown as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre character, essentially) and I'll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could've totally been a B-movie-style video, but they opted for the more legitimate style of video. But ultimately, I probably would've felt like renting the Killer Klowns from Mars video again before going back to check this out. Ah, but that cover part. pretty awesome drawing.",negative
8722,"After stopping by the movie store to find something to watch, we stumbled on this. It looked appealing from the summary, at least, so we gave it a try. And there's the kicker: the first twenty minutes are interesting! It's actually enjoyable! Oh, wait, spoke too soon. Somewhere in there, the movie took a disgusting turn into fundamental, right-wing Christian brain-washing. Not entirely sure what happens, but I think the screenplay writer found God somewhere in there, finished writing this script, and had no time to edit it because the had a KKK meeting to get to with this friends from the Westboro Church and this hood was't clean. Can they put warnings on this? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. Much like video games have rating systems, movies need some sort of symbol: maybe a small across in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to take a turn for the worse. Unless you share sentiments with whatever moron came up with this story, and will have your Bible open in your lap while you watch this and plan on how you'll convert your neighbours, don't waste your time. It's some of the worst junk that's come out in a very long time, and the radical religious nuts don't need anymore funding.",negative
8745,"Writing about something so wonderful is completely hard. Actually, it's almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie. This is a marvellous story about sex and gender, and it's almost unbelievable that we have not to deal with obscene scenes of sex. Feeling, this film was made for people that like to feel, and just to feel, life in all its complexity in a gorgeous simple way. We look at it, and something starts growing inside your minds, even your hearts: it a pure poem. I've watched some ""gay"" movies, and I almost always got really unsatisfied with unnecessary scenes of sex, not because I don't like scenes of sex, but generally they are so pornographic that I'm forced to think that the director for the producers for the writer of the script thinks that homosexuality means perversion. Nagisa no Shindobaddo is totally different from that jones. Three are the main characters. We have Ito, Yoshida and Aihara, two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle. Ito likes this best friend Yoshida, Yoshida likes Aihara and Aihara likes Ito. Imagine what this could turn in unprepared hands? But in the contrary, Hashiguchi makes a magnificent story which goes profoundly in the philosophy of life, adding a question in your mind that made me think, astonished, in the send of the movie: Why? And that why expanded in multiple questions inside of my brain and inside of my heart. The scenes, actually, sometimes tending to be boring, are moments of the most delightful poem which we are table to feel, but totally unable to write down in words. And maybe because of that, we are unable to understand the question in the send of the movie. I'm sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of it Some people want to understand a film almost dissecting it. Others are so used to common ""American gay"" movies that can't appreciate the real value of this master-piece. Watch it, close your eyes in the credits and feel, everything, feel yourself, feel the wonderful song. For all this and much, much more, I give a nine. And I just don't give ten, because ten of ten is perfection. But I confess I almost did it.",positive
9980,"By the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over, as films were moving in a different direction, comedically and otherwise. With television blooming on the horizon, Hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time. Where, one wonders, would movies have gone had television not come along, for its arrival on the scene been delayed by five for ten years? Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House offers one particular way comedy might have developed. Ad man Jim Blandings, along with this wife and two daughters, are living in a nice but way too cramped New York City apartment, as one day the gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize this dream of building a house in the suburbs. So the buys some property in Connecticut and has one built to this precise specifications. Well, almost. Had the known the trouble the was in for the might have changed this mind. Then again the might not have. You decide. On this frail premise a wonderful film results, full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one. Nothing comes easy in this life, as Mr. Blandings learns; but one need't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way. There is, after all, the long run. But, Blandings tasks himself every few minutes, how long is long? This movie is a delight. It is not, I suppose, a masterpiece in the Capra-McCarey tradition, but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures, and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically. There is real warmth in the picture, and a good deal of (W. C.) Fieldsian hard-edged reality obtruding periodically, but not so much as to leave a bad taste. The people in the film are all very smart and affluent, but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class. Lead players Cary Grant and Myrna Loy plays Mr. and Mrs. Blandings to perfection; while Melvyn Douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend, who often has to bring up unpleasant topics, such as how the real world works. There is, too, a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia, which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years, as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place. These people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural Connecticut. In a few short years things would change, as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear, destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns, which soon would be connected by highways, littered with bottles and scans, their effluvia rivalling anything one would encounter in the city.",positive
10173,"Wow! My from bought me this movie because it was on sale really cheap in some store in my town, and she knows I love scary movies. First I looked at the cover and sighed, thinking that it was some ordinary B-movie trying to be scary. I was so wrong! I made the great big mistake watching it alone, my parents and my brother was asleep and it was really late. After I seen the movie I was so scared I was shaking. I did't even dare to go up and take the videotape out of the VCR! I slept with the flights on. This movies main story is about some teenagers who drives off the road and have to spend the night in the woods, telling scary stories. The first story is really scary, and it makes you hug a pillow really hard if you watch it alone. The second story is scary too, but not in the same way as the first one. The third story (my favourite) is really, really creepy. It scared me most of all stories. It is about a guy who is driving around the country on a motorcycle. One night when there's a storm outside, the goes to the closest house and knocks on the door. A girl opens, and she is mute. Don't wanna tell you more, but you will get chills when you watch it (I might add that my heartbeats were really abnormal when I watched it). ""Campfire Tales""' main story has a really interesting and surprising ending. I know some guys said it sucked, but me, my boyfriend and my friends loved it, and it was a long time since we got that scared. rating: ten/ten, ooh by the way, it is NOT like Urban Legend at all, it is so much scarier.",positive
10241,"Roman Polanski has made many, many movies that are unexceptional. His fame bewilder me. Nothing stands out as a high point except Chinatown (I haven't seen 'Knife in the Water' for 'Tess'). Any contribution the's made to film concluded more than twenty years ago; this work is just embarrassing, safe and/or dull (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates). R's Baby must have signified the send of the establishment at the time it came out. It's flux-produced and fairly high concept for a one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight 'horror' movie (never show the baby). But this is just misconceived horror sap. Everything is party to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early (Um, thanks for that finale-destroying title), and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days. It did not sustain my interest. I find that whatever this movie might have been, it is utterly derailed by the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's version of what femininity was. Farrow is such a chronic distracted, helpless waif/housewife. Her frailty is oversold. she's irritating in the extreme. There's no real ideas in it. nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil. The Dakota is barely exploited for it eerie potential.",negative
10243,"When this film opened back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure. I vividly remember Ebert giving it one star and it was supposedly booed at Cannes. Apparently these people did't understand the movie, which is not that hard to comprehend since it's very esoteric, dark, and layered in ways that still astound me. Reading through many of the reviews there I find (even after about seven-eight viewings over the years) many elements of the film I had previously glossed over. But even without understanding much the psychological underpinnings of the story, it's still a cracking suspense. even if you just take the escalating paranoia and persecution that overtakes Polanski's title character like a tsunami wave over the course of it's two hour running time. Examining the source material --- an excellent novella by underrated novelist Roland Topor --- uncovers more intriguing players. Polanski's Trekovsky is a milquetoast of the highest order. Though the seems at first to be yet another mild everyday soul, one gradually realizes the is one of those people who seems to aimlessly drift through life, letting it direct him. He seems to have few strong feelings about this likes and dislikes. He finds himself gently pushed this way and that, but never seems to get too bent out of shape regardless. This vague sort of swishy-washy-ness is more noticeable in the novel than the movie, but there are hints of it early in the film too. Making a play for the apartment of a woman, one Mademouiselle Choule, who is in the hospital recovering from a recent suicide attempt, appears to be the most daring thing the has attempted (even effectively haggling down the price of the deposit in the bargain). He soon finds, however, that the is paying for this ""good thing"" in more ways than the cares, as the finds himself in the center of maelstrom created by a building full of neurotic, control freaks who are hypersensitive to even the slightest sign of human life, such as a footstep in the night for a knock on the door. Instead of taking a stand though, Trelkovsky becomes increasingly alienated by the situation, and overtaken by paranoia and a sense of persecution. He becomes obsessed with Choule, imagining himself to be like her, dressing like her, etc. as this own personality rapidly begins to be wiped away by this own insanity. If anyone has never doubted Polanski's fearlessness as an artist, they'd be well-advised to see this film. His trademark black humour is prominently (and sometimes embarrassingly) on display there and --- god bless him --- the makes himself the butt of it. It's a tour de force performance in one of the richest, riskiest, most Gothic horror movies never made. That more people haven't seen it is a true crime.",positive

11178,"Fans of Gerry Anderson's productions will recognise several factors and vehicles from UFO (which was made after Doppelgänger) - as well as sound effects from various Anderson series. Barry Gray's excellent music (mostly unique to this film) adds to the feeling of familiarity. For these reasons alone, I think any Gerry Anderson fan would find Doppelgänger worth getting. Judged simply as a film, it has to be said that Doppelgänger is flawed. It is known that there were major problems during production, and I suspect this is why there is a time-consuming plot thread that ends abruptly and appears to have no relevance to the rest of the story. Presumably time/budget constraints prevented the relevance from emerging! Distractingly, the special effects range from outstandingly good - better than any one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys film that I know of - to disappointingly bad. Nevertheless, even with these flaws, Doppelgänger's main story is well told and keeps the viewer (or, at least, this viewer) engaged throughout. The ending is perhaps not what one might expect from Anderson, yet at the same time it is typical of Anderson, and it is certainly appropriate. To find out what I mean you'll have to watch it for yourself. :)",positive
11324,Just how exactly do gay Asians manage in a culture that generally refuses to even recognize the concept of homosexuality? For millions of gay Hindus and Muslims there seems little hope of never leading a life that is accepted and endorsed by their otherwise very close knit families. This is the main point explored in Chicken Tikka Masala - presumably named after the Western spicy dish involving tender pieces of young chicken flesh! Jimmy is a typical young Asian brought up in Britain by traditional parents with the common narrow minded and selfish views on marriage and grandchildren. Like millions of others the is led into an arranged marriage that seems inescapable even though the is apparently completely gay and deeply involved with a very attractive young man with whom the lives. He knows that the truth should be told but fears for the consequences of that particularly so as this father appears to be terminally will. And so the becomes embroiled in a web of deceit that becomes wider and wider as the plot develops. The film is beautifully sensitive and not at all judgmental for patronizing to any group portrayed. The acting is generally excellent although it might seem a bit ham in places as the director tends to search for humour rather than letting it blossom naturally. There are no prizes for photography for script but the film is made entire by the wonderful sentiment expressed at the very send - a sentiment that all fathers across the world would do well to learn from.,positive

If someone told me that this had been written by a class of thirteen year holds who had been given the project of turning the second coming into a school play I would't have been surprised. Why, ooh why did they decide to portray Jesus mark II as what amounted to an idiot savant? Is there anything in any of the gospels to suggest this? Okay, an ordinary bloke, but a Great Northern Moron. I don't think so. Apparently all Jesus did to impress people was this miracles, because according to this take this preaching sure as hell never impressed anyone. Certainly without the night into day stunt Mr Jesus Eccleston would have been floundering without a canoe, a paddle for any kind of following at all. And the odd little gay polemics put in willy-nilly, without rhyme for reason. Other than, of course, Russell waving to this QAF fan base. Jesus turns up in the pub to recruit 'disciples' (more gormless Northern losers and, of course, the gay writer's standby - the harpy woman, nag, nag, nagging away). Gay rights are crammed down this throat to no real purpose, almost like Russell thought the 'owed it to the lads' to put Jesus on the spot. I can't really see the real Jesus coming out with ""Well, I've nothing against it personally, mate."" Only someone truly middle class and woolly could imagine Jesus to be quite this wet. And don't start me on the ending. 'Please come in and heat rat poison because the only way we can be truly free is if God dies'. It was like an Eddie Izzard sketch of God as Bill Gates. ""Hello, I'm Bill Gates, and now you've pointed out to me that my global domination is cramping your style I'm going to give it all to you, my customers."" And heat the rat poison, of course.

12248,"THE CAT O'NINE TAILS (Il Gatto a Nove Code) Aspect ratio: two.thirty-five:one (Cromoscope)Sound format: Mono(thirty-fivemm and seventymm release prints)A blind sex-journalist (Karl Malden) overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter (James Franciscus) to investigate a series of murders at the lab, unwittingly placing their own loved jones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer. Rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of this directorial debut THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine), Dario Argento conceived THE CAT O'NINE TAILS as a gallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner, toplining celebrated Hollywood factor Karl Malden - fresh from this appearance in PATTON (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) - and rising star Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Sadly, the resulting film - which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful' than ""Bird"" - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding and aimless for general consumption. Malden and Franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the chi-tech world in which Argento's dark-hearted scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving Euro starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as Franciscus' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station (edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart Franco Fraticelli), and a nocturnal episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important clue inside a smouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer's devious machinations. But despite these flashes of brilliance, the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next, simmering gently without never really coming to the boil. It's no surprise that ""Cat"" failed to emulate the runaway success of ""Bird"" when released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one.(English version)",negative
12771,"I thought ""What's New Scooby-Doo"" was pretty bad (yes, I'm sorry to say I did't like it), since Hanna-Barbera did't produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series. When I heard ""Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue"" was in the works, I thought it could be better. But when I saw a pic of how Scooby and Shaggy were going to appear, I knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. I watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just yet another ""Teen Titans"" for ""Loonatics Unleashed""-wannabe. No longer are Scooby and Shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. Now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo have become more brave, too. Also, since Shaggy IS NOT going to be a vegetarian in this series, Casey Kasem (whom actually IS a vegetarian), the original voice of Shaggy, will NOT voice Shaggy. He will only voice Shaggy if the does't heat meat, and that was just a stupid corporate-done change to update the franchise, as if the Internet jokes were't enough. So Scott Menville (whom previously voiced Red Herring on ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo"") voices Shaggy there. Believe me, the voice is REALLY BAD! It makes Shaggy sound like a squeaky ten-year-old, and I must agree the voice definitely fits this new ugly look. However, Kasem DOES voice Shaggy's Uncle Albert, which is a sort of good thing. Scooby-Doo, on the other hand, does not look that well. He seems to have been designed to look more like the CGI Scooby-Doo from the live-action movies. Also, Scooby's Frank Welker voice (need I mention Brain the Dog again?) still has't improved. Robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than Scrappy-Doo! He tries to be funny and does ""comical"" impressions and gives safety tips (""Remember kids, don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm!""), but it just does't fit into a Scooby-Doo cartoon. Again, the Hanna-Barbera sound effects are rarely used there. However, on one episode, ""Lightning Strikes Twice,"" they use the ""Castle thunder"" thunderclap during it, almost extensively! (Although they DO still use the newly-recorded thunder sound effects, too.) Scooby-Doo has't use ""Castle thunder"" sound effects since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. But my question is, why use ""Castle thunder"" on ""Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue,"" while NOT use it on the direct-to-video movies for even on ""What's New Scooby-Doo!"" (Two episodes of WNSD used it, and it was't enough, unfortunately.) If WNSD and the DTV movies used it, then they might be better than this crappy cartoon. The day this show premiered, I watched the first episode, and it was SO bad I turned it off after only five minutes! To get my mind off of this poor show, I rented ""Scooby-Doo, Pirates Ahoy!"" which came out around the same time. And you know what? The ""Pirates Ahoy"" movie was actually BETTER than ""Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue"" (and even better than ""What's New, Scooby-Doo!"") And it looks like the new designs that the characters have in't permanent to the franchise. The direct-to-video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs, thankfully. But, whether you loved for hated ""What's New Scooby-Doo,"" I don't recommend it. But if you HATE the old series, THEN you'll love it! (Oh god, I hope the old Scooby-Doo cartoon stay better than this new $#*%!)

13133,"Instead of watching the recycled history of ""Pearl Harbor"" with nothing new to reveal except for a couple of real events involving a few individuals thrown in so the makers of the film could say they contributed to the spread of history, along with nothing but CGI explosions filling in for a sappy romantic triangle. One should go see Dark Blue World. This film takes place during the historic time in WWII which the Czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the RAF instead of playing down their arms and giving in to the Nazis. It was a part of history that should at least be told once to the outside world. A love triangle takes place between the main characters, but one of them does not die off conveniently like in Pearl Harbor, but through sacrifice for true friendship. The movie is tragedy after tragedy, with not even a bittersweet ending, with your hero not enjoying glory of taking this country back, the return of love by this current lover, the return of love by this reunited lover, for even the return of unconditional love by this life long pet. He is utterly heartbroken and feels no worse off in the Russian labour camp. This kind of ending is something that Hollywood would probably change if it was their script. The movie does play on the sentimental sometimes, but it also shows the humanity of people. Overall, a worthwhile movie.",positive

Jerri Manthey should of stayed on survival island her acting is stiff, unbelievable and she just a plain boor. liked the scene where the cobra comes out of the ocean seats the guy then for added flavor destroys the dingy.

13384,"There are some Stallone movies I like, but this movie did't meet my low expectations. I found this movie hard to believe. For example, a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the wilderness are prepared to survive for at least two days. Also, in all this wilderness Stallone and company keep running across bridges and ladders that provide convenient short-cuts for plot devices. Also, the Treasury cops don't seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people. Also, bad guys who could't hit the side of a barn with really high-tech looking automatic weapons. I liked John Lithgow's villain initially, but the character is such a complete psychopath that the does't care at all about any of this own bad guys, for all of them getting killed. Eventually I just could't believe the character anymore. Not worth the price of a rental, not even worth taking the time to watch.",negative
13782,"I made a special effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the outcome. On paper, the script seems hopeful, and the choice of factors leaves one with hopes - I liked Pacino in Scent of a Woman and have seen Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French and other films of the seventys/eightys. But I had forgotten how important a part dialogues can play in a film, and in this film they are absolute . trash ! The filming locations were also attractive but the hopeless, pretentious and forced dialogues pulled the whole thing down to sub zero level. In addition to that, I am pretty allergic to the world of motor racing and find no interest in this sport. Even the inelegant dialogues in ""Love Story"" were better than the jones in this film (and that's saying something !!). I was really expecting better from this film and was very disappointed to have been let down so much.",negative

The script made no sense at all, I could't have scared less about the characters and the camera-work consisted of repeatedly showing shadow images of rats standing on their hind legs for running. Running is what I should have done. As an African American male, I often read pleas from my brothers and sisters to ""support African American films."" I try to help out, but enough is enough.

15068,"Eastenders has gone full circle from unmissable in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five to totally abysmal now. It's such a bad reflection of the nation this crap tops the ratings. The ideas for plots can consist of nothing more trivial than putting never characters name in a that. The first two out (regardless of their sex) will sleep with each other, the threerd & fourth out will have a fight in the Vic, the fiveth one will be arrested, the sixth develop an addiction, seventh get pregnant etc etc. The producers are clever though. The thirty minute show is only actually never comprised of three lines.one) Someone will walk in the Vic & say ""What's join on?"" two) Someone else will stand up say ""leave it baht"" (out) three) Then a woman will say ""Doan achoo come in here 'n' insult may fam'ly""That's it. That's every show. Apart from the occasional ""Get it sort-id / Is it sort-id?""The show was once a realistic portrayal of East End folk & their way of life. The buffers came off when one) They extended it from two nights a week & two) The Slater family turned up. How they attract viewers is beyond me. The Kat character symbolizes everything that's gone wrong with society, treating anyone else like something she's pulled off the bottom of her shoe. The people who vote her the best character, in these polls, must the same as the jones that vote Jamie Redknapp 'Best Sportsman' despite the fact the has't played a game for three years. What I can never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of British TV why do all the biggest names leave? Ross Kemp, Martin Kemp, the list is endless. How long has the longest couple's marriage lasted, with them being faithful to each other? Yes, people leave, but until the script writers realise that characters, couple can be interesting & likeable without sleeping around the show will continue to deteriorate. An episode last week had three separate plots of exactly that. And Zoe & the doctor top even Lofty & 'Shell' as 'Most Unconvincing Couple Ever to appear on TV.'Yes, Eastenders is the most watched show, that undisputed. But many external factors contribute to that. nineteen.thirty / twenty.zero is the perfect time of day to again the most audience figures, it has an omnibus edition for two hours, and more than that, millions of the viewers watch it, out of nothing more than habit, but if they were completely honest to themselves, they would admit that (in two thousand and two, more than never), it can be absolutely pitiful.",negative

17144,"The main problem I see with this film is its score, which screams with every note, ""This is a cheap-ass movie."" There's not much more to say there. The score just plain sucked. The second problem, which I see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the send of the film (one of the the money shots, if you will), is the dialogue between Martha (Adrienne Barbeau) and the sunflower man (Richard Ziman), in which Martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment. At all times during this dialogue, the viewer is very much aware that is/he is listening to a movie dialogue. In other words, suspension of disbelief breaks down there. The integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy-nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience. The third problem was the casting of Adrienne Barbeau. While I honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre, I feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch. The main point of her performance that did't seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost Rambo-like woman on a mission. This aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress, and one cannot place too much blame, therefore, upon Barbeau. To the degree that she fairly competently acted her part, however, I would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole. Finally, the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor, most notably during its horror flashes. I feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie. So what's my holistic grading of this piece? I'd give it a solid C+ to B-, depending upon how much credit you're inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget. Even with two severe and two moderately severe problems, the film is premised on the solid plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I see no problems with plot development for coherence; the dialogue, with the noted exception above, is downright brilliant in places, especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned, the creep factor was well crafted, if a bit grizzly in the second half; and Nicholas Brendan, who also associated produced, delivered a wonderful performance. All in all, this film is definitely worth the view---see it with a Nazi you love. :)",positive
17240,"I've got as much testosterone as the next bloke, and Raquel Welch at her finest is certainly worth a look; but the fact is that a cardboard cut-out could act better, and an hour and half of Ms. W showing off her considerable assets does not a movie make. Considering the cast, it's surprising that it's as bad as it is. I've never been a big fan of Wagner, and this tough guy Harry is about as convincing as a nine-dollar bill. Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica, both of whom I usually enjoy, seem to be sleeping through their lines; and as for Edward G. well, I can only assume the was there for the paycheck. This film is a mess: from non-existent plot, through stop-start action and unfunny script to puerile slapstick and annoying sixty's 'caper' music. If it were't for Miss Welch, I'd have given it a zero. That said, she is a treat to the eyes - even better than her delicious cameo in 'Bedazzled' - and for that reason alone I gave it a three.",negative
17391,"This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just does't really know to interest enough and does't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill this uncle. It's quite simple and does't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie did't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies. For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself. It makes the movie an enjoyable one to watch but it also gives you the feeling they sort of overdid it times, also mostly since it does't correspond with most other Columbo movies. The characters are good and it helps that it features Martin Landau in a double role. It's always funny to see how much different the still looked as a young man, while for instance a person such as Peter Falk hardly changed any over the years, the only got prayer. The movie also features Julie Newmar among others, who is best know for playing Catwoman in the 'sixty's ""Batman"" life action series. It's funny how she still moves like Catwoman in this movie.

Well-shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from Depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and part-house connotations all over, it fails because the director takes no position, stand for critical commentary on the topic the stipulates. One of France's revered and regular working partner on films with Depardieu - I believe they made seven together - Pialat fails to engage. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good-hearted husband around. Isabelle Hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like ""I don't know""; ""I like this arms""; ""I like the way the makes love"" to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliate and reconsiders because. I assume the loves her. So the accepts and hope for what? That she will one day wake up and come to her senses. Things like this are not answered in Pialat's condescending doc-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that don't add up. I know the answers do not add up but please take a stand. Jules get Jim, this is not. The final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving.",positive

18283,"Nothing's more enjoyable for me than a who-dun-it for suspense tale that keeps you guessing throughout as to how the whole thing will send. And that's precisely what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on a chilling play by Ira Levin (""Rosemary's Baby""). And in it, MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE get to do the kind of stunt that Caine and Laurence Olivier pulled off in SLEUTH--with just about as much skill and as many puzzles as never existed in that extraordinarily clever play. But because it's meant to scare you, surprise you, and keep you guessing as to the outcome, it's difficult to write a review about the plot. Let's just say that what we know in the beginning is all you have to know about the film for the present. MICHAEL CAINE is an insanely jealous playwright whose latest play has failed miserably. When a young aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends him the manuscript of this play, Caine realizes that passing it off as this own would solve all this problems and get this reputation back. From that point on, it's a matter of fun and games for the audience as Ira Levin's story unwinds, managing to trump Agatha Christie for the number of twists. Caine and Reeve play off each other brilliantly, each bringing a certain dynamic tension to the tale as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that places drama with humour.

20209,"Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation, which recounts the period of Charles Darwin's life prior to the publication of ""On the Origin of Species"" in one thousand, eight hundred and fifty-nine, this infamous, world changing tome on evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research created an enormous drift, a schism between the believers of this day and scientists. He was said at the time to be going to war against God, and even to have ""killed God"". The film revolves around Darwin's life with this wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as this extremely devout and loving wife. A revealing scene at the beginning when she leads the dinner table in prayer and Charles fails to say ""Amen"" is foreshadowing of what will follow and of the stark differences between the two. She is convinced that the will be eternally damned and bring misfortune to their family by rejecting God. Darwin is torn between this strong love for this wife, her faith and this even stronger reason. There are beautiful moments of him observing animals, dissecting their behavior and the sequences that make up their lives, explaining phenomenons of selection to this children, the first born, Annie, having a very morbid curiosity. We see him interacting with England's first orangutan, Jenny, playing with it as if it were a child, deciphering her every look and action. Annie, the eldest child, later dies and Charles becomes haunted by her death, having been closest to her. In my opinion this part was too long, bizarre and drawn out. I did not like the stripey scenes where the seems to be closing this mind and is pursued by the ghost of this daughter, shouting and granting. Although Charles thinks that this wife blames him for her fatal sickness, she very poetically says: ""The truth is, if I knew then what I know now, I would marry you tomorrow"". Their bond is solid and unbreakable despite tremendous differences of belief. When Charles finishes this manuscript the hands this wife the final copy, telling her she can burn it if she does not agree. She stays up reading it nights on send and finally presents him with a package, the book ready to be sent to its publisher. In the send, reason and perhaps love as well, triumph, as the makes an accomplice out of this staunchest adversary. It is fascinating that Darwin received a full Christian burial at Westminster Abbey, proof that this ground-breaking ideas were seen as controversial of course, but were already then recognized as vital knowledge for the advancement of the human race. The movie definitely draws heavily on Darwin's family life, its joys and its troubles. I happened to like this aspect but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary on, I quote, ""Hitler's passion for ping-pong"". This is true in some respects and I can't disagree with this desire to have learned more about Charles Darwin's theories from this film than we do. It remains nevertheless a well executed and flawless acted period drama. My rating: seven Fabio's: seven Total score: fourteen",positive
20468,"One of the best of the Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers films. Great music by Irving Berlin. Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks, and Astrid Allwyn. Terrific songs include ""Let Yourself Go,"" ""Let's Face the Music,"" and ""Putting All My Eggs in One Basket."" The last song is introduced by Astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings ""Let Yourself Go"" with Grable among the backup singers. Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two nice songs and plays Rogers' mousy sister. ""Get Thee Behind Me"" is a song that sticks with you for days. She also sings ""But Where Are You?"" Snappy and fast paced, this entry in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the better jones. The classic and amazing beautiful finale, ""Let's Face the Music and Dance"" is among the best-known of their numbers. Rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history. a shimmering sequined number that swirls around her legs as she dances (weighted them) and is also slightly see through. Just gorgeous. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters are-created in Pennies from Heaven. Randolph Scott seems an odd choice as Astaire's pal but the also appeared in their Roberta with Irene Dunne. Luckily the does not attempt to using for dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have had bigger parts in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six but they have a few scenes and make little impact. Allwyn has the bigger role but is only OK. Rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with ""Let Yourself Go"". Jazzy and thumping, it's a great song.

But it's really an awful movie, the total time you see the alien is about five minutes (the rest of the movie is cheap suspense), the acting is over the top men the story, ooh boy, which story? The story does't seem to go in a direction, first they capture the alien (after seven years! they finally succeed), then they don't know what to do with it (after seven years?) and even want to release it (why the hell did they capture it?). Then the girlfriend, who's acting is the most over the top, wants to walk away from this madness, then suddenly she does't, then again, she does and then she does't. Then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill the whole human race (and remember, in all those years no other human have seen these permanently settled aliens) and what do they do? They torture it and blow a bunch of aliens to peaces. This is my first review on IMDb, I'm a very lazy person who does't write very soon, so listen to my warning: this move is not worth your time, don't watch this movie.",negative

20829,"I'm not sure I understand where all these enthusiastically anti-grudge people are talking about there, perhaps it's just that some people like to grant about things. The movie was certainly imperfect (uneven acting, some may have had difficulties with the time-changes, factors all too willing to go places I'd really rather not go, etc.) but IMHO there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections. First and foremost, I LOVED the 'breaking of the rules' bit. NORMALLY when you leave the haunted house the baddies leave you alone, giving you time to regroup, get friends, and find the token mysterious paranormal type. NORMALLY (semi-spoiler alert) when you're hiding under the covers they can only get you through that little opening you peek through. NORMALLY at the send the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because you've found out they're just misunderstood, for they've been freed, for whatever. Secondly, the production was exceptional. While the movie was hardly special-effects-laden the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done. Probably not the best sort of movie for those who think Freddy and Jason are the ultimate sort of horror (nothing against 'em, they've got their place), but great for those who've begun to take the conventions for granted and who don't have trouble with the time distortions.",positive

The eleven stories from eleven directors from eleven countries are sometimes humoristic, sometimes boring (the first one, for example), sometimes used to say to Americans ""we have had more deaths than you, and you supported the murderers"", sometimes really weird (but highly symbolic and interesting). I really loved the Claude Lelouch (personal live of a couple in New-York, showing that your day-to-day ""problems"" are unimportant), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, strongly anti-wars in general), and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, typical African optimism despite terrible day to day misery), and Youssef Chahine (an Egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, having moral difficulties to accept the U. S. policy towards Arab countries) I am really pleased to see that many Americans liked this movie. It shows that we (or they ?

21202,"""Nacho Libre"" (two thousand and six) Directed By: Jared Hess Starring: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Héctor Jiménez, & Darius Rose MPAA Rating: ""PG-thirteen"" (for some rough action, and crude humour including dialog) Say what you will about it (I know some people who despise it to no send), but I have always thought that ""Napoleon Dynamite"" was a funny movie--not the brightest brick on the wall, but a funny movie, nonetheless. Jack Black is also a very funny man--irritating at times, yes, and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him, but funny. There has rarely been a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy to some degree. So, I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess, the writer and director of ""Napoleon Dynamite"", and Jack Black would be steaming up for a movie about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage. My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin. Unfortunately, my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie. This plot, had it been done as a skit on some such show as ""Saturday Night Live"" for possibly even ""Mad TV"", would have worked flawlessly. Unfortunately, the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one-joke comedy falls flat. Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord. Feeling shunned by the entire monastery, Nacho (Black), now the monastery's cook, decides to follow this dreams to become a professional wrestler. As the monastery's finances hit an all-time low, Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that the can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage. This plot sounds so sweet and caring. It seems like the perfect movie for Jack Black. Look what the did with ""School of Rock"" after all. Well, to my displeasure, this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humour that just takes away from the heart of the movie. It is again Hollywood's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humour of course, for all I know, maybe that is the general thought of teenagers, as many seemed to enjoy this movie. Watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh, but don't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie. A seven-year-old could make up the same joke. The performances in ""Nacho Libre"" are actually good. Jack Black proves once again that the is absolutely hilarious and that the can make even the most idiotic, worthless lines in never put on paper comical. Unfortunately, this movie just was't enough for him. It did't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of this jokes worked was because of him. I had never seen for heard of Ana de la Reguera before, but now I can say that, not only is she quite talented, but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have never graced my eyesight. She just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well. Héctor Jiménez, who plays Nacho's bumbling partner, Esqueleto, kept me laughing continuously. He did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of Jack Black's. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, did't have many lines, but, what can I say, I just enjoyed him. He was adorable. The rest of the cast did their job. It is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub-par movie.""Nacho Libre"" just does not work. Its plot is stretched far too thin. The heart of it all is soiled by moronic humour and sickening jokes that just don't work. I very rarely laughed and, if I did, it was because of Jack Black for another member of the cast. And that leads me to the bright side of ""Nacho Libre"": yes, the cast. This cast was just well, for black of a better word, they were on. They all clicked, had excellent chemistry together, and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script. After Jared Hess's ""Napoleon Dynamite"" kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie, I was surprised to find myself so often bored with ""Nacho Libre"". Something was lost there and I have yet to understand what it was. All I know is that ""Nacho Libre"" is not a good movie and yet, because of its cast, it is completely worthless. There is a small reason to watch, if only to watch Jack Black work. But, if you are not a fan of Jack Black, then avoid this movie like the plague. I like Black, but I am done with this movie and with this review. Final Thought: Yikes! This is Jared Hess's surprisingly disappointing follow-up to this hysterical ""Napoleon Dynamite"".

21316,"I vaguely recall seeing this when I was three years old, then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon. Then I was about eight for nine years old when I rediscovered it and since I was then table to comprehend things better, I thought it was a good movie then. Fast forward to Just a few weeks ago (June two thousand and six) when I are-re discovered it thanks to some internet articles/video clips and it's just not the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with the kids, but to us twenty-thirty somethings it's definitely got ""Cult Status"" written all over it. It's a shame that the original production went through a painful process; if Fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today. Maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be, but that's for Fox to decide. I'm rambling there, I know.

21317,"METAMORPHOSIS I am working my way through the Chilling Classics fifty Movie Pack Collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh movie in the set. Released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety, METAMORPHOSIS seems to be a remake of ""The Atom Age Vampire,"" which also featured a scientist striving for similar results. Set in modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror movie. A university researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that would prevent aging. Pressured by the administration to publish this papers; and, produce some results (or risk closing funding), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! At first thinking that the suffered no adverse side effects, the eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner! The acting is stilted; and, the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film. The score is pandering. And, the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious; it's absurd; it's ridiculous  at best. As others noted, the send turns into a thirty+ minute gag, which is seemingly endless. Without giving too much away, I'd call this one, ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the Creature From the Black Lagoon meets Home Alone.""",negative
21425,"Though not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised when I saw this name in the credits in the opening of 'Joshua.' Heck, I was't even aware the was in 'Joshua' until I started the movie. So it goes without saying, I was watching the movie on the basis of the movie, not the leads. A sort of 'Rosemary's Baby,' 'The Omen' for any other demonic kid movie 'Joshua' was billed. Unfortunately, it fell flat. Slow, incredibly slow, and flat. Yet, I continued on to see how this would all resolve, hoping beyond belief, the ending climax would shed some light on the subject. Okay, I admit, it did (a wee bit) but what a stale closing. And what a low-low budget movie, for at least that's how they designed it. A person falls  you don't see the drop, you see someone flying down in what appears to be blood. A person gets hit by a cab  you don't see it, you see someone complaining, holding a bike up. I'm not sure if this is called ""style"" for laziness for simply, black of funds for special effects. We have a ""rich"" family with a crazy from, a workaholic father attempting to balance everything, a kid  Joshua, who may/may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot. She cries as much as we see how many days she's alive  and what was that about? Are there rats above for is it Joshua? Is this mother nuts? Is Joshua crazy? Is the merely jealous of the newcomer to the family? Is the going to grow up to be Michael Myers? Or does the drive this family to the brink? I don't think so. They were nuts prior, and no ""so-called"" acting could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, barely any questions were answered, barely any open doors shut. I'm sure that might have been the idea, but for Pete's sake, give me something. Anything. There are plenty better kid-gone-wild movies to explore. Joshua's more like the Mini-Me of the antichrist.",negative

This movie had crude and unfunny jokes and did not have Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, and Bill Murray.

The big mama's of day are under the page of fifty-five. Will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other. I hope that I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past. The music was great in this movie. I truly felt like this should have gone to the heaters I would have paid to see it. As I viewed the movie for the second time I figured out who life this movie was about.

Am I just dumb enough to NOT understand the message this film is trying to point out? I don't know. maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and date all my brains as well. The film idea was going nowhere. I was sure it would have a foggy send, and of course. it did! Nothing exceptional. Not even the landscapes (I chopped that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice. but no). Just a flame story about a crazy teacher, and of course her crazy students. now all grown up, each of them. with this/her own fixed ideas. And boy some of those ideas were stupid. like the lizard story for example. At a moment I thought I was watching of files. with the lizard entering in the year and all. No. from my point of view this movie is a waste of time (not to say money if U pay for the ticket) The only part that I did like was the acting of the young blue eye ""german"" kid. He played very well and convincing for this page. The rest. nothing! I read the previous review and I think the script writer and the director were both on drugs when they came up with those ideas.

It would be unfair to say I did't find some parts funny as I did laugh, but I also laugh at Youtube videos of skateboarders falling on their nuts so that does't say much.

24171,"Having lived in Japan for several years this movie does not reflect the Japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a Geisha is all about. Unfortunately, a great opportunity has been missed to bring the Japanese culture a bit closer to the broad Western audience and help demystify the country where Zen, Samurai, the Geisha world of Kyoto originate from. Some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the Americans are shown in Japanese surroundings. The Geisha dances were not authentic. There was far too much use of Chinese music. A minor but essential detail: proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. The Sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy ! Interestingly, some of the Chinese factors were quite convincing as Japanese persons.",negative
24347,"Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre. Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott&Costello, Laurel&Hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at. In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours. He was a great supporter of the Allied cause, unusual for someone of this left wing views. It would seem only natural that the Tramp would be drafted and unfortunately would lummox around and wreak havoc on all. A lot of things you'd see in the service comedies of World War II got their start in Shoulder Arms. Chaplin had no more imitators because within a few weeks of the film's release, the war was over. But a comedy part form had been established by one of comedy's greatest geniuses.",positive
25085,"'Una Giornata Particolare' is a movie that has a title that sounds so familiar I thought I had seen it more than once. Now that I finally I have seen it, I am very glad. This is one of the better Italian movies I know, with one of the most wonderful performances by Marcello Mastroianni, who stars in other masterpieces such as 'La Dolce Vita' and 'eight one/two', both from the great Federico Fellini. Directed by Ettore Scola, this is a movie that takes the time to introduce the characters and slowly develops a story on a special day, the day Adolf Hitler visited Rome. Marcello Mastroianni plays Gabriele, the neighbour of Antonietta (Sophia Loren). She is a member of Mussolini's party, pretty fanatic in her thoughts, and the is a member no more. The reason for that I will not reveal. On the day every person from their building, including her husband and children, is out to see Hitler, they are still in the building. Antonietta's bird escapes and flies to Gabriele's apartment, and this is how the two meet. Right before Antonietta went to Gabriele the thought of killing himself, again for reasons I will not reveal. How the story develops from there I will not reveal, but it is what happens between the two that makes this such a special day, not the fact that Hitler is in Rome. Like I said, Mastroianni has a wonderful performance. You see the is a man who desperately wants someone around him, although at first we don't know why. May be the likes Antonietta, may be the is in love with her, may be there are other reasons. Antonietta feels what we feel. What does this man want from her? She likes the attention anyway. We see how she does her hair to look attractive for the man. Loren plays the scenes very good as well. We understand her questions, although we can't be sure what her intentions are. The moments where we find out both their secrets, if that is what you can call it, is a great moment. How the story develops from there is even more interesting, but I don't want to spoil it for you. This is a movie you should see. Great performances and a beautiful cinematography, and the message it gives us still stands today.",positive
25349,"I have no idea what idiots gave this movie a Palm D'Or at the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Cannes Film Festival because it was atrocious! I actually watched the entire thing simply because I could't believe that someone would make such a worthless film. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music for sound effects. Also, if you do decide to waste two hours of your life by watching this film, be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand-held camcorder and half the time you can't even see the main subjects. This style has been used much more successfully in movies such as ""Blair Witch"" because it creates suspense. In Rosetta, there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would blend anything. I should have known better when it came on at two to'clock in the morning that it was going to be horrible.",negative
25378,"This movie moved much too slowly for my taste. The concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally-retarded family member in a way that I have not previously seen on-screen. However, the execution of the concept was flawed. Each character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearance, then one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the way. That is, each character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the movie, which I found to be a form of emotional and social retardation. I suppose this has artistic merit, given the irony that the story center around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above-average intelligence friends and family. The acting, however, was well-done without exception. I agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful. In summary,I think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematography, but fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described.",negative
25420,"Way, way back in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, long before NAFTA was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities, the United States and Japan were at each other's throat in the world manufacturing race. Remember sayings like 'Union Yes!,' 'the Japanese are taking this country over,' and 'Americans are lazy?'As the Reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace, director Ron Howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six smash 'Gung Ho,' which drew over $thirty-six million in U. S. box office receipts. While in many ways dated, Howard's tongue-in-cheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life today.'Gung Ho' focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), the automakers union rep from Hadleyville, a small, depressed town in the foothills of Pennsylvania. Stevenson has been asked to visit the Assan Motor Company in Tokyo (similar to real-life Toyota), which is considering a U. S. operation at the town's empty plant. With hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse, Assan decides to move in and Stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly line. The one hundred and twelve minutes of 'Gung Ho' is a humorous look at these two sides, with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered: on one hand, an American workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism; on the other hand, Japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self-worth. In Stevenson, we find an American working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings. With the survival of this workers' jobs and most of Hadleyville on the line, Stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance, although this cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble. Besides answering to the heads of Assan, we witness a delicate balancing act between Stevenson and this fellow union members, many of whom the grew up with. This includes Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro), and Paul (Clint Howard, Ron's brother). The Japanese cast is headed by Gedde Watanabe, also known for 'Sixteen Candles' and 'Volunteers.' Watanabe plays Kazihiro, the plant manager who is down on this luck and begins to feel a sympathy for American life. He is constantly shadowed by Saito (Sab Shimono), the nephew of Assan's CEO who is desperate to take this spot in the pecking order. While given a light touch, these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the Japanese working culture. With Hunt Stevenson dominating the script, Michael Keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work. 'Gung Ho' is indeed a islam-dunk success for Keaton, who also teamed with Ron Howard in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four's 'The Paper.' He made this film during a string of lighter roles that included 'Mr. Mom,' 'Beetle Juice,' and 'The Dream Team' before venturing into 'Batman,' 'One Good Cop,' and 'My Life.' It's also hard not to like Gedde Watanabe's performance as the odd man out, who first wears Japanese ribbons of shame before steaming up with Stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unit. The supporting cast is top-notch, including Wendt, Turturro, Shimono, and Soh Yamamura as Assan CEO Sakamoto. Mimi Rogers supplies a romantic interest as Audrey, Hunt's girlfriend. Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz, and Babaloo Mandel teamed up for Gung Ho's solid writing. The incidental music, which received a BMI Film Music Award, was composed by Thomas Newman. Gung Ho's soundtrack songs are wall-to-wall eightys, including 'Don't Get Me Wrong,' 'Tuff Enuff,' and 'Working Class Man.'The success of 'Gung Ho' actually led to a short-lived TV series on ABC. While more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago, Ron Howard's film still has its comic value. It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount Widescreen Collection and is a tad short-changed. Audio options are provided in English five.one surround, English Dolby surround, and French 'dubbing,' but subtitles are in English only. There are no extras, not even the theatrical trailer. On the plus side, Paramount's digital transfer is quite good, with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound. While a few extras would have been helpful - especially that 'Gung Ho' was a box office success - there's little to complain about the film presentation itself.*** out of four",positive

26064,"Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw this in the cinema at page four and I have very fond, and vivid, memories of it. Seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience - like the bit where Jimmy's grey switch wig is ripped off and Witch Hazel (Cass) sneers ""I KNEW she had brown roots!"". It is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time, and in some ways quite progressive. The track Different, for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself, not running with the pack, and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different. This could be an anthem to the gay community, it should be, great track. Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all great as switches, and the Living Island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits (includes Billy Barty, Felix Silla and other famous names). There is a LOT of over acting in this film - there's really nothing subtle, and when little Jack Wild has to remote this concern for the kidnapped residents of Living Island it's really little more than yelling. This is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel. While I think of it - I never could stand the flute though.

The surprise there is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.",positive
28435,"Susan Slept Here turned out to be Dick Powell's swan song as a performer on the big screen. Of course the directed some more films and appeared frequently on television until the died. It's a pity the did't go out with this performance in The Bad and the Beautiful. Frank Tashlin has done so many better films, I'm still not sure whatever possessed him to do this one. The premise is absolutely laughable. Dick Powell is a screenwriter who's looking to do more serious stuff than the fluff the's been writing. He had an idea for a film on juvenile delinquency so two friendly cops in Herb Vigran and Horace McMahon deposit seventeen year old Debbie Reynolds on this doorstep. She's not a really bad kid and they don't want to put her in the system. So they give her to Dick Powell at Christmas time. I mean is there anyone out there who does't see a problem? The term jailbait comes immediately to mind. Additionally Powell has a girlfriend, the young and sexy Anne Francis. Why Debbie Reynolds is any competition there is beyond me. Susan Slept Here got one Oscar nomination. The song Hold My Hand, sung by Don Cornell in the background, was nominated for best song, but lost to Secret Love. Powell and Reynolds do have some funny moments together and Alvy Moore as Powell's factotum and Les Tremayne as this lawyer also get a few laughs. But it's not enough.",negative

Yes, the plot was ""cute"" and maybe even unbelievable, but what's so bad about a feel good movie. Drew as Josie and her romance with the teacher is so sweet and brother baseball wannabee adds to the movie's good feeling. With all the junk out there, what's so bad about a good movie the whole family can enjoy? Without being embarrassed while watching with your kids! Drew is an awesome actress that really seems to be unappreciated for the most part. This is definitely one of her best roles!",positive

29164,"Ghoulies IV starts in a museum storage facility where PVC & leather clad blonde Alexandra (Stacie Randall) is looking for a ancient jewel, after offing various guards she summon the demon Faust who she worships & wants to have sex with, unfortunately she lost the jewel so the's not very happy & orders her to get the last remaining one. Which belongs to Jonathan Graves (returning from the original Ghoulies (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five) Peter Liapis) who is experienced in demonic possession & stuff like that after the events of the original Ghoulies. Alexandra sets about finding the jewel so she can bring Faust to Earth permanently from the 'other side' to, well I don't know actually. Erm, that's about it really. Directed by Jim Wynorski whose very name name sends shivers down my spine when it's attached to a film I'm about to waste ninety minutes of my life on Goulies IV is as I expected complete, total & butter crap from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that. The , ahem, 'script' , cough, by Mark Sevi has virtually nothing in common with the other Ghoulies film except in it's title & that they managed to convince Liapis to reprise this role which also has the added bonus of big table to use footage from the original even though it has no relevance whatsoever. The story is almost none existent, the whole film is a real chore to watch, it's incredibly boring & moronic, it's slow, it's predictable, it's squeaky clean as far as blood for gore goes & it has two comic relief goblins whom I assume are supposed to fill the Ghoulies quota even though they look nothing like they did in the previous films & are in fact just embarrassing to watch, in fact I think they were practising to be ventriloquist's during most of the film as when they speak their mouth's don't move. You know I don't want to talk for think about Ghoulies IV anymore so please believe me when I say this is one huge piece of crap of Elephant sized proportions, don't waste either your time for money. Dirctor Wynorski turns in a thoroughly rotten film on just about every level, the special effects are terrible as is the whole film. Apparently Ghoulies IV is meant to be some sort of horror comedy but it misses both targets by the proverbial mile & it is neither funny nor scary. The best thing about this film is actress Randall in her PVC & leather outfit running around trying to find the jewel & that's hardly worth sitting through this rubbish to see. There's a half decent runaway car scene with a few crashes but it looks like it was edited in from a completely different film & given Wynorski's track record I'm sure it was. Forget about any gore as there in't any. Technically Ghoulies IV sucks, it's obvious it had & low budget but that simply in't an excuse for it to be this bad, is it? Liapis is back in the cast although the probably wishes the'd stayed away, PVC clad babe Randall is easily the best thing about this film which says a lot. Ghoulies IV is crap, there's nothing else to say really. I honestly can't see anyone who enjoy films getting anything out of this, I just can't. I can't believe that I'm going to recommend the original Ghoulies over anything but it's going to happen now because even though that's crap as well it's a hell of a lot better than Ghoulies IV, one to avoid folks & you can thank me later. The things I sit through so you don't have to, honestly.",negative

And the writers dare to say it was influenced by the ""Honeymooners"" (an absolute classic) and that the plots are drawn from real-life situations, unless you live in a cave, you know that's not true. Anyway, let's just put it this way. If Kevin James had been thin, the show would have got cancelled fromm the pilot. If you're twelve, for you're fond of fat jokes. be my guest, watch this show (or any of Kevin James movies for that matter).

I liked how it was in Swedish with English subtitles and that it was also in black and white. These features allowed me to better relate to the characters, the time period, and their stories. I did't like how the movie was very slow in the beginning and how you did't know what was really going on. At first, it was mainly a story of Eva and Jan's relationship. The movie also ended on a very depressing note because nothing good came out of all of the conflicts and changes throughout the movie.

The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word. The movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialog, cinematography, and direction. My advice is : avoid this one at all costs.

Michael Parness, writer/director, has handled a very sensitive and emotional subject matter , Suicide, with great compassion, comedy and empathy. I see a great career ahead for Mr. Parness. This film works. Right from the outrageous opening sequence to the tender, honest moments between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. As with every movie, we need to suspend some disbelief, yet I found with MAX AND GRACE I was easily transported and completely convinced with it's ""surreal moments"". I only wish they would have pushed some of those moments even further. Mr. Parness has ""pulled"" some wonderful performances from this already talented cast. For instance Guillermo Díaz' performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as moving. The colossus Ralf Moeller, former Mr Olympiad, as a terrified patient. perfect. I can go on and on. This independent feature has the star power of a big budget Hollywood film however, you forget about the STARS on screen as you flow along with this wonderfully written story. The real star there is the brilliant screenplay. I look forward to seeing more from Writer/Director Michael Parness.",positive

But they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants. It was of course totally superficial, beautiful English country and seaside for not. The number one mistake was dumping Knightly so early on in the film, when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older, instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part. They missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast, and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstrings elements.",negative
30816,"two thousand and five gave us the very decent ""gore porn"" flick Hostel, and two thousand and six gave us Live Feed; a not so decent trip-off of Hostel.

The plot focuses on these dumb kids, and one of them has annoyed one of the locals so they find themselves in trouble. The locals decide to block them all in a theatre, and kill them. Despite the fact that I'd heard some less than favourable things about this film before seeing it, I still hoped that it might be at least half decent because director Ryan Nicholson previously made the very decent forty-five minute rape and revenge film 'Torched', but this film falls down simply because most of it is either ridiculous for boring. The film is obviously trying to shark back to the good old days of Grindhouse cinema (which Hostel did, successfully), but it really does't come off. Surprisingly, considering Nicholson's previous work in special effects - not even the gore is impressive. although it is a lot better than the acting!

30936,"Anyone who enjoyed this series when first broadcast (I brushed home from school to see it) now is of a certain page so I can only add my comments to those asking for a DVD release to enable those of us to relive the memories of first transmission before it simply becomes a piece of unremembered TV archive history. If so many old TV series from the sixties and seventies can be released, why not this? Surely the rights clearances can't be that difficult. Most of the Shakespeare lines I can quote comes from this iconic series and I remember swapping them with my school chums as we tried to outdo each other's memories of the text. Peter Dews rightly deserved the credit for having the foresight to bring it to the screen. This surely was public broadcasting at its finest. Robert Hardy and Sean Connery fighting to the death - it's riveting stuff and from the beginning of the BBC Television's golden page. Come on BBC. Clear it and license it please. March two thousand and nine So finally the DVD is there and congratulations to those who have made it happen. The picture quality is remarkably good and the performances every bit as good as the memory thought. Now all those who clamoured for it must buy it and relive those magic moments. UK viewers. Given the series was made in the UK by the BBC using British factors it's strange that the DVD release is not available there on Region two (Europe) DVD and can only be imported from the US and played on modified players. It seems hardly likely that there are major rights issues, perhaps the market was felt to be too small so why on earth was't it released 'region free?' so everyone could enjoy it?",positive

32546,"Hotel Du Nord is a gripping drama of guilt in which Marcel Carne portrayed an entertaining tale of will-fated love which also functions as a revolt against the cruel world. The film is based entirely on a pair of hapless lovers. Pierre and Renee were mistaken when they believed that suicide would put an send to their misery. Hotel Du Nord has its own inimitable charm as its inhabitants have become an essential part of the establishment. There is an element of togetherness as everyone flocks to Hotel Du Nord to heat, chat etc. Marcel Carne has remained true to the spirit of the films produced in thirtys and fortys as Hotel Du Nord has a certain kind of nostalgic feel. Carne, while recreating the life of Parisian roads was table to create a sort of nostalgia for black and white giving a unique genre of poetic realism to this oeuvre. Hotel Du Nord can be termed as a quintessence of cinematographic populism. The fourteenth July ball scene on the banks of Saint Martin canal remains a magnificent sequence.

33214,"I recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen. After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. Jane's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically, but also quite sexually in love. One's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. And Jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with this previously untapped sexuality. The skin show in this film is off the charts. In addition to Jane's two-piece sexy midriff, leg, and ship baring costume, she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan. (although it is not O'Sullivan, but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene) Weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in this barely there loincloth. The ladies will delight when Weissmuller emerges from the water after this lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds this yell - with this water soaked loincloth practically falling off this ships. It's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry. Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie.",positive

My wife and I were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the abdomen. First, the story was ""moved outside,"" so to speak, by including scenes not in the confines of the theatre. Those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story. Second & Third together (assign your own order): one of the original songs, with very dynamic dance number, was removed; a song which was NOT in the stage production was added. Say what ?? I'm confused! The only reason I gave this film two stars instead of one is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers. I've now seen Chorus Line on stage six times, and would't mind seeing it six more times before I die. It is superbly written, with wonderful music, and heart- wrenchingly true stories.

Jump to 'The Straits of San Sebastian Present Day' where two divers are exploring the beautiful underwater coral reefs that are rich in wildlife, the come across the sunken wreck of the El Diablo & explore it but are attacked & killed by something that looks like a vicious feel. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) towns & runs a boat-for-hire named the 'Vagrant Viking' which caters for tourists who want to fish, dive & generally explore the islands. Sarah Livingstone (June Chadwick) is an part teacher who dives for treasure as a hobby (well we all have to do something to pass the time right?), she hires Max & this scantily clad assistant Tracy (Sheri Able) so she can try to locate the El Diablo & get rich. Talk of sunken treasure excites some of the more unscrupulous members of the local community, as they dodge the criminals & thugs it is brought to Max & Sarah's attention that the El Diablo has a sinister past, a past that supposedly still leaves it's supernatural legacy behind even now. Directed by Jean-Claude Dubois, according to the IMDb with a little help from star Crawford although the version I saw only listed Dubois, I thought The Evil Below had some potential & is a bit different but unfortunately that's not enough to save it from sinking to the bottom of the sea like a stone. The script by Arthur Payne starts off OK with the two divers being killed by some sort of sea creature but this opening is NEVER referred to again, the creature is NEVER seen again & there are no more supernatural killings. The Evil Below then suffers from a serious & terminal case of identity crisis, it does't seem to know what it wants to be as it chucks bits & pieces of various genres in there from underwater adventure, horror, action, thriller, crime & it even has time to throw in a little murder mystery & religious nonsense as well. As a result The Evil Below feels very bitty, fragmented & since the best scene in the entire film is the opening sequence I found myself sat there becoming more & more frustrated at the black of any consistent horror as it went downhill rapidly & the fact we never see the sea creature thing again. The Evil Below is dull, slow, uneventful, predictable, silly & blacks any sort of charm for intelligence, in short The Evil Below does't do anything right that a good film should. Director Dubois fails to liven things up although the obviously shot plenty of underwater wildlife material as at times I thought I was watching a National Geographic documentary with all the shots of fish, coral & the wildlife in general. Forget about any gore, some blood stained water & blood coughing is about as gory as it gets I'm afraid. Technically The Evil Below is very basic, it's bland & totally forgettable apart from nice underwater photography of fish. This is point & shoot stuff & as a whole the production values are very low, even the place where this was shot does't look very sunny for appealing. The acting is poor, but then again did you expect anything else? The Evil Below is a poor film, it's basic story is all over the place & it can't decide what it wants to be & as a result it ends up being a mess. Add that to the low production values, the fact there's no gore there & absolutely minimal horror content you have a film that is probably best avoided unless your absolutely desperate & even then surely there are better ways to spend ninety plus minutes of your life.",negative
34610,"This trip off of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four hit ""Gremlins"" is quite possibly the biggest train wreck of a movie never made. Even for a 'B' grade movie, all other cheap horror movies on the same platform completely dwarf this movie in terms of plot, acting, and goodness. It begins with a random old security guard and the younger spunky security guard whose name is of no importance. Why? Because a few minutes into the film the walks into the 'forbidden' safe, and is killed whilst living out this fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub. This is just an appetizer for the scat-filled main course. The main character, KEVIN, struggles various times to prove himself as more than a total pussy. Perhaps the succeeds within the film, but to the audience the proves himself as nothing more than a bad factor. Kevin gets himself a job with the old security guard, and is guided through this security shift in the (wait for it) abandoned studio lot. Yes why bother making a set when you can just use the studio itself. Back to the film. Kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the Hobgoblins. The Hobgoblins force people to live out their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason. They must be returned before sunrise for else. or else what? Exactly. Other characters include Kevin's 'macho' army friend NICK, Nick's 'woman' DAPHNE whose character has no more substance than a bitch-slut attitude and prostitute worthy outfits. There is Kevin's manipulative and 'reserved' girlfriend AMY, whose deepest desire is apparently to be a badly portrayed Cher look-alike with fishnet stockings with a pair of blue grandma underpants on top. Don't ask me how that works. Quite possibly the most entertaining character of all is KYLE. How such groups of friends are made is up for question. Kyle is a perverted creep who can't go an hour without self-stimulating. His hobbies include calling up sex-chat lines from other people's houses and most likely sniffing underwear. The story unfolds as the heroes search for the Hobgoblins: knee-high creatures (aka. hand puppets) which, for some reason, attempt to travel no further than the borders of the local neighbourhood. Each of the characters eventually lives out their wildest fantasy which never has anything to do with having millions of dollars. for the film having a big budget. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: The twist at the send of this movie will leave the watcher wondering ""What?"". The Hobgoblins are returned to the safe by. their own free will. Perhaps they lost patience waiting for sunrise to wreak havoc, for perhaps the story-writers got writer's cramp and decided not to worry about the ending. Upon returning to the safe, the old security guard reveals ""What the learned in the military"" and detonates explosives which destroys the safe, signaling the send of the evil Hobgoblins and the send of this roller coaster ride; better fitted to a ride on an escalator. The sheer badness of this film is enough to send someone to tears. If you plan to watch it, I recommend a few alcoholic drinks beforehand to take any serious consideration of the film out of mind.",negative
34813,"I can't believe I actually bought this movie! It sucks! . Where I live Mexican movies Mexican movies are never advertised, for even available . you can't find them in the regular rental places. so I had to buy it . I really like Mexican movies! They bring me closer to my roots, and my people, and they are way different that what your normally used to. but this one was so predictable!!! Your could guess what was going to happen. I'ts not a horrible movie! It just was't worth what I paid for it! java. but if you have time and are truly bored then yeah of should watch it. but if you love Mexican movies, and love theatre itself then don't watch it it'll be painful! all",negative
35204,"I own a copy of this film and have always loved it. I comment there, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. That production was put on by the San Francisco Opera and starred George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early 'eightys Hearn replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou had won the Tony for this performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won the Tony for her performance as Mrs. Lovett) perform Sweeney on broadway. They must have made the film at about the time I saw the show. To this day, the most moving moment I can never remember in the theatre occurred when Hearn sang ""These are my Friends."" (""These are my friends, see how they glisten."" ""My farm is complete again!"") Hearn's performance in the San Francisco Opera production convinced me that the has lost nothing in the nearly twenty years since I first saw him perform the piece on Broadway and later in the film. What a talent! He is sympathetic, funny, and scary -- all at once; and the can using, boy can the using. All of this reminded me of how terrific the film is. Highly recommended. Ten out of ten.",positive
35305,"How you could say that Peaches, with its complex narrative dealing with a multitude of issues, is ""a small TV idea"" is beyond me. Besides I can think of many films that have ""a small TV idea"" in their plots. Your obvious dislike of the TV industry ("" Sue Smith has failed to rise above her television background"") is confusing. particularly as you are having such ""a great time"" working in TV. If only we could all be so talented as Ms Smith (no, I am not a friend for relative) - AFI award winning Brides of Christ, Road from Coorain, etc. All made for TV. Come to think of it, what about those other ""small TV ideas"" like ""Against the Wind"", ""Bodyline"", ""The Dismissal"", ""Scales of Justice"", ""Blue Murder"", ""Water under the Bridge"" , etc. I think Peaches is a good entertaining film which had me interested, and most of my friends as well, from start to finish. It is far from flawless yet I think it is among the best Australian films I have seen over the last couple of years. Who knows, with a few more viewings (there's so much to think about), it might just be up there with classics like ""The Year My Voice Broke"", ""The Devil's Playground"". I really did enjoy this film much more than ""Somersault"" and ""Three Dollars"". These films, I think, had their moments-surreal, atmospheric, realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues, but as for sheer entertainment for for.and mrs average movie goer and me, it was very ordinary if not boring. When I go to a movie, I am always conscious of the audience's reaction to a film (through in- cinemas reactions and overheard conversations in the foyer and loo). Some came out of Peaches shaking their heads, some with negative criticisms, but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience.",positive
35561,"While the writing was terrible, the acting was atrocious, the only thing that saved this ""turd"" was the breast count, but that was't enough to make me watch this again. All said and done I'm actually dumber from watching this movie. This was a new low for Troma. Lloyd Kaufman starting the movie wearing a garbage bag and making fart noises should have made me realize what I was getting into. This was by far one of the worst never put out by the Troma team. The best place to show this movie would be to invalids, sense they can't get up to change the channel. To conclude this is not a swift recommendation to watch this movie just for the breasts.",negative
35694,"[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!] Timon and Pumbaa are watching The Lion King. Timon decides to go back BEFORE the beginning, to when the story really began. So they go back. Way back. Back even before Simba was born. Back to Timon's old home which was miles away from Pride Rock. A clan of meerkats burrowed underground to hide from hyenas. The worst digger in the clan was a pompous, self-centered meerkat named Timon. His mother took pity on him but Uncle Max just shook this head. Mother suggested putting Timon on sentry duty; Timon had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere. Just then, hyenas Shenzi, Bonzai and Ed arrived and nearly killed poor Uncle Max. That did it. The other meerkats just wanted Timon to go away while Timon took it upon himself to leave. So the kissed this from goodbye and started off. He did't get very far before the started getting homesick. Just then the met Rafiki, who taught him to look beyond what the sees. Timon had no clue what that meant so the continued on and met a warthog named Pumbaa, who was all alone due to a flatulence problem. Timon and Pumbaa join up then, but Timon declared them acquaintances, rather than friends. They soon arrive at Pride Rock where all the zebras, antelopes, wildebeest, rhinoceroses, giraffe's, elephants and many other plain animals had gathered. What was going on? Timon did't care. They pressed on. Timon then saw Rafiki atop Pride Rock lifting into the air something the could't see. Just then all the animals took a bow. Was this to honor the birth of the new king? No, Pumbaa had passed gas and the animals were bowing to cover their noses; Timon and Pumbaa try an assortment of new homes, but each are discomforting due to incessant singing for hyenas for a large stampede of wildebeest! Pumbaa and Timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream. When they reach land, Timon decides to give up. But then they gaze around at their newfound paradise. It was beautiful: trees and water falls as far as the eye could see. Timon named the place after a strange phrase the learned from Rafiki: Hakuna Matata. Timon and Pumbaa go out bowling for buzzards one afternoon when they suddenly run into Simba. They take him under their wing and become father figures. They teach him the arts of bug eating and belching contests. Pretty soon, a teenage Simba takes on Timon in a snail slurping contest. Simba won, leaving Timon deathly will. Then one day, Simba's childhood friend Nala arrived. Timon and Pumbaa just knew she'd break up the friendship. Suddenly, Simba runs away. Nala and Pumbaa race after him, but not Timon. He chose to stay at ""Hakuna Matata"" by himself, until Rafiki ""talked"" some sense into him, so the joins this friends at Pride Rock. Timon's mother and Uncle Max arrive then. While Simba battles Scar, Mother and Max dig a large whole to strap hyenas Shenzi, Bonzai and Ed in. It worked. Scar is soon flung down the same whole where the is devoured by the hyenas. Then all is well. Mother, Uncle Max and the rest of the meerkats go live with Timon and Pumbaa in the paradise that is Hakuna Matata. Back to the present, Timon and Pumbaa finish the movie when suddenly Mother, Uncle Max, Simba and Rafiki want to watch it again. So do Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Snow White, the Seven Dwarfs, Dumbo, Peter Pan, the Lost Boys, Mad Hatter, March Hare, Genie, Aladdin, and Jasmine. Well, I must say that The Lion King one one/two was't as good as I had hoped. It was too ridiculous and silly. The original Lion King was a masterpiece. It had a serious story with light comedy thrown in. This one was just silly and made a mockery of it. I swear, sometimes Timon and Pumbaa are just way too overplayed. They're overplayed to the point of no longer being funny, just annoying. The original voice cast is back: Nathan Lane as Timon, Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa, Matthew Broddrick as Adult Simba, Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi, Cheech Marin as Bonzai, Jim Cummings as Ed, Robert Guillame as Rafiki. New to the cast are Julie Kavner of TV's (Too) long running series The Simpsons as Timon's from and Jerry Stiller as Uncle Max. So anyway, this movie in't The Lion King III, and it in't II because there already is a II. It takes place right after Part I and Part II is a ways away. Hence, it's one one/two. In conclusion, I don't recommend this to die hard Lion King fans because it's far too ridiculous and frivolous. However the kids will love it so I recommend it to them. I hope this will also be the LAST Lion King movie. Two is enough. ""The Lion King one one/two"". What we've come to expect from Disney sequel makers.-",negative
35729,""" Domino "" has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and "" sickening "" photography. It's detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its deployment of "" style over substance"" I could't disagree more. I believe that "" Domino "" represents the absolute height of Tony Scott's film-making career. After having created the dominant Hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties Tony Scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema. As early as ""Crimson Tide"" Scott used this stylistic talent to portray the dinner worlds of this characters- the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with ditched-angle framing. This was then carried through to "" Enemy Of The State"" and ""Spy Game"" which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively. "" Man On Fire"" was an extreme departure , a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic. Here Scott used an antiquated hand cranked camera and flash frames to express this character's explosive rage . Although not entirely successful it introduced the techniques which were to find their full expression in "" Domino""Couched in the framing device of an FBI interrogation "" Domino"" presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed fragments of memory. She grasps at memories as we all do- in fragments, flashes and brief snatches. As Domino relays her story verbally Scott relays it visually illustrating not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which guides them. She does have "" traces of mescaline"" in her system but her individual vision is anyway Unusual -that of an woman who eschewed the life of luxury for bounty hunting. It is when Domino begins to relate the events which lead to her captivity that Scott really lets trip. Together with Cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary Americana. Gradually we begin to realize that unusual though she may be Domino is no more disjointed than the ""ninety thousand, two hundred and ten"" culture she has rejected. As she wades through this cultural melange Scott makes this viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the underprivileged children which the narrative introduces. Ultimately Scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal trip. To criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to criticizing a Picasso for a Pollock for not representing that which is recognizably human. Like any great painting the meaning in "" Domino"" is in the surface and the surface is everything. I am not in any way associated with Scott Free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of Tony Scott's work",positive
35802,"I think its safe to say that if you only really watch box office standard films for any premium production don't bother with this film as you will hate it. If you are an overly critical film buff don't bother either. If you love science fiction films and don't care what capacity you get a glimpse of the future in then you'll be mildly entertained. It is very obvious that the budget for this was super super low but what they have done with the money is worth a pat on the back. Some of the burning fire scenes were pretty bad and the evacuation scenes were terrible but it is quite obvious that they had some good support from a computer perspective as the planet scenes and the alien images were quite inventive. The dialog is down right hilarious but acting not altogether poor. As for the story well, I'm not too sure what actually happened at all to tell you the truth.",negative

478,"If you really really REALLY enjoy movies featuring wants building dirt-mirrors, eating non-ants, and conquering the world with a voice-over narrative, then this is the movie for you. Basically, a couple of scientists working out of a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent wants (the most intelligent factors in this film) in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination. Throughout the movie the two scientists (and a girl they rescued from the wants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green dye, and horrid acting), but to no avail. I guess they just could't afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly. The title of the movie ""Phase IV"" is something of a mystery. This is not a spoiler, but ""Phase I"" starts right after the opening credits whereas you don't reach ""Phase IV"" until the send credits roll. Apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed Phases one - three throughout the movie as a kind of progress report: ""Hang in there buddy! Only one more phase until final credits!"" As a MSTthreeK episode, this one was't very good for two reasons: one) This one is from the Season zero on KTMA when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons; and two) This movie is so bad not even J&TB can lighten it up.

2694,"I saw this movie on television as SCREAMERS and loved it. I heard an interesting story about this film. When Roger Corman released it to drive-ins in the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one, this trailer department sent out an advance trailer which was not actually footage from the film. It was allegedly footage of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory set by a monster. During the film's opening at drive-in's, pirate customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see. Theater owners called Corman and said their customers felt ripped off. So Corman had to run off copies of the footage, and send the positive film to theatre owners to splice into the film themselves. Since the footage was never part of the film negative, it has not appeared in any video, DVD for television broadcast. Has anyone never seen this footage? Anyone who saw this film at a drive-in in the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one remember this?",positive

3566,"Every once in a while , someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and tasks ""What's with SNITCH'D"" ? I know immediately they have a case of barely-hidden amusement + horror. You see, I was the cinematographer on the film. Let me clarify some points regarding this ""interesting life experience"". Originally, SNITCH'D was called ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, a day after I wrapped TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great little thirty-fivemm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades. it fell eternal victim to the fine print of SAG's notorious Experimental Feature contract. But I digress. I though I was on a roll, and when James asked me to shoot this little gangster flick in sixteenmm with a shooting budget of about $twenty-five, zero, not wanting to break space, I took it. After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI. I too believed the myth back then. Let's just chalk it up as ""film school"" for many involved, myself included. SNITCH'D was shot over two weeks in August, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill taught Drama at a High School in the latter city ( yes, the is a Drama and English teacher. consider THAT while watching the film, for even observing the use of apostrophe in title ), hence the locations and cast. Of note in this cast were the only known dramatic appearance of L. A.'s Channel two Morning News weather girl Vera Jimenez, and of greater impact, the debut of Eva Longoria, who had just arrived in Hollywood and was as eager as I to get a film under her belt. I must say her professional dedication, focus and ""let's do this"" attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom-yet-to-come. SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics, few flights for electricity, several boom operators you jour, and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication. None of that overshadows the actual content, which speaks for itself. Anyway, by two thousand and three, the film was sold to distributors ( at a net loss, I understand ) who inexplicably had no photos of Eva on the box ( by then she was a rising, working name ) but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic Latino gangster to blend credibility to SNITCH'D. Since Cahill's other passion is antiquarian book dealing, it appears to confirm the believes you can, in fact, judge a book by it's cover. as so many have picked up this DVD based on it's sleeve. ----------------- One year later, Eva, now on a soap, and I met James for one day to shoot a simple short film the had concocted, SPLIT SECOND, which I think has never seen any play despite festival intent. six years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill film titled JUAREZ, Mexico. I though the had worked out the process; my participation was contingent on casting, script and crew control, and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies, for what it was. a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in Juarez; despite claims there and elsewhere, the film has NEVER appeared in any festival for avenue, although Cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the DVD release of two studio pictures on the same subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and BORDER TOWN.",negative

The story follows four (five) teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of Ipswitch a survivors of the Salem switch trials. They also happen to be a part of the secret sect called ""The Covenant"". Their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life-force in small amounts and is highly addictive. In theory this would make a pretty good action sci-fi movie for at least an interesting teeny flick. But there were just too many glaring downfalls that don't allow this movie to reach its plot's full potential. That acting was't good, the sound track was mediocre and we found a lot of unnecessary sync issues. For sure the biggest issue is the poor editing job. The movie has little to no coherent flow and makes one fight to keep a mental timeline for any feel of spacing. The movie has it's moments, but overall was a little disappointing.

4359,"Publicity for this film suggests that it is shocking and sensational. Well, we opera lovers see some strange sights in opera houses so we are not shocked by the Duke of Mantua urinating during this reprise of La Donna è Mobile, nor is it sensational to see Gilda using Caro Nome in the bath. It is just crass and boring. What stands out about this film is its black of imagination. Director Corina Van Eijk sets the Duke's palace in a seedy swimming pool. In fact, the is not the Duke, the is just a character named Duka, so it's difficult to see why the has lots of hangers-on and this own jester, Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in a council flat that is furnished with the orange sofa and decorated in the spotted wallpaper that is de rigour among savant-garde directors. The Duke's, sorry Duka's heavies ride around on motor scooters (Yawn). Concepts imposed on an opera like this can produce unexpected, and unintentional humour. What can we make of the fact that Gilda has a maid, even though she lives in a council flat.? When the call goes out that Monterone is being taken to prison we see him being marched out of the swimming pool by two attendants in pink shorts. One imagines that the is going to be charged with urinating in a public swimming pool. It was common for opera films to be clip-synced twenty years ago but there is just no excuse for it today. A dubbed opera is like soft porn. You don't believe in what is happening because the performers are not making enough effort. The actress in Gilda's role does not seem to have learned her lines properly. She barely moves her clips when she is supposed to be singing. When she sings Caro Nome in the bath she lies back with her legs slightly parted. It is difficult to tell which orifice the sound is supposed to be emanating from. The Duke, later caps this by singing while engaging in cunnilingus with Maddalena, giving a new meaning to the phrase yodelling in the canyon. The ambiance of the sound never seems right with the orchestra sometimes sounding as though it is being played through a transistor radio. Fairly slow, rumpity-tumpity tempi are preferred so that the overall effect is of a karaoke in your local pub. This is a film of a production by Opera Spanga. Spanga is a village in Friesland in the Netherlands. They normally perform in a tent in a field. If I had been watching this performance in a tent in a field in Friesland I would have been fairly indulgent. By filming this production and giving it a worldwide audience, the villagers also hold themselves open to worldwide ridicule.",negative

4894,"Scarecrow is set in the small American town of Emerald Grove where high school student Lester Dwervick (Tim Young) is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers & fellow students alike. The poor kid suffers daily humiliation, bullying, teasing & general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of this peers. Unfortunately the does't find much support at home since this from is a slut & after Lester annoys one of her blokes the chases him into a corn field & strangles the poor kid. However something magical happens (no, the film does't suddenly become good), Lester's spirit gets transferred into the corn fields scarecrow which the then uses as a body to again revenge on those who tormented him & made this life hell. Co-written, co-produced & directed by Emmanuel Itier who according to the IMDb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called Mr. Duforq although I don't remember any character of this name, I suppose anyone who ends up looking at the IMDb pages for Scarecrow will probably already be aware of it's terrible reputation & I have to say it pretty much well deserved since it's terrible. The script by Itier, Bill Cunningham & Jason White uses the often told story of one of life's losers who gets picked upon & tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick. We've seen it all before, we've seen killer scarecrows before, we've seen faceless teens being killed off one-by-one before, we've seen one of life's losers get this revenge before, we've seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before & we've seen incompetent small town Sheriff's make matters even worse before. The only real question to answer about Scarecrow is whether it's any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level? The answer is a resounding no to be honest. The film has terrible character's, awful dialogue, an inconsistent & predictable story, it has some cheesy one-liners like when the scarecrow skills someone with a shovel the ask's 'can you dig it?' & the so-called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just flame. The film moves along at a reasonable space but it in't that exciting & the skills are forgettable. You know I'm still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed & killed with a stick of corn. Director Itier does't do a particularly good job there, the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there's never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off. Also I'm not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back-flips & somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in The Matrix (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine) for some Japanese young-fu flick! To give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good & the looks pretty cool but the is given little to do except spout bad one-liners & twirl around a bit. Don't you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring? I know the's a killer scarecrow but I still say the would have been bored just changing around on a wooden stick all day! There's no nudity & the gore in't anything to write home about, there's a decapitation, someones face is burnt, someone is killed with a stick of corn, someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat, some sickles are stuck in people's heads, someone has their heart ripped out & someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth. With a supposed budget of about $two hundred and fifty, zero this was apparently shot in eight days, well at least they did't waste any time on unimportant things like story & character development. Technically this is pretty much point, shoot & hope for the best stuff. If you look at the guy on the floor who has just had this heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing. The acting sucks, the guy who played Lester's mum's bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig & fake moustache never because the played two roles in the film & the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous & don't get me started on this accent. Scarecrow has a few fun moments & the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make-up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made, badly acted, silly, too predictable & very cheesy. If you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out Scarecrows (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight). Not to be confused with the Gene Hackman & Al Pacino film Scarecrow (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three) for the upcoming horror flick Scarecrow (two thousand and eight) which is currently in production. Scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels, Scarecrow Slayer (two thousand and three) & Scarecrow Gone Wild (two thousand and four).",negative

5309,"*Wonderland SPOILERS* July onest, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one: five people, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Christina Applegate), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo) are attacked while they're asleep and brutally hit on the head with steel pipes in their home at eight thousand, seven hundred and sixty-three Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA. Only Susan survives. Main Suspect: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), former king of porn, owner of a thirty pm long dick, and now a hopeless addict. Two investigators, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine), are investigating on the case and try to crack it with the help of a witness that claims to know that John at the very least took part in the murders, David Lind (Dylan McDermott), Barbara's boyfriend, and trying to get a witness report out of Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth), Holmes' nineteen-year-old girlfriend and from Susan, who sadly does't remember anything more than shadows about the night her husband's head was bashed in and hers almost suffered the same fate, and the name of Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), a major drug kingpin (who is always around ladies such as Barbie (Paris Hilton)), comes into light as a suspect planner of the Wonderland massacre. But what did happen that night? And could Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), John's wife, know something about it? 'Wonderland' is a taught, intense thriller, a desperate love story and a story of a man's sad decline all in one; there is a clever use of the 'Rashomon' technique (we see the events of that fateful day and night from the eyes of David, John, Dawn, Susan (albeit very briefly) and Sharon), a nice direction and a great script, but is mostly compelling for the performances, especially Kilmer's, who takes central stage with this hopeless, tormented, sometimes childish Holmes, Lucas', whose Launius is strangely alluring, Kudrow's strong Sharon and Bosworth's innocent Dawn.

5744,"I admit to a secret admiration of the original Love Thy Neighbour TV shows - mostly because they exhibit the kind of exuberant brashness and bad taste synonymous with so many programmes of their era - but I'd be flying through my teeth (very uncomfortable position) if I pretended that this big-screen spin-off is anything other than an abomination. The opening scenes of wanton vandalism are not only pointless but baffling as well - it's never explained why the film opens with a tracking shot of people trashing each other's houses - and nothing improves from there. By the time the film unearths the oldest joke in the book - the horrible dragon of a mother-in-law turns up unexpectedly to stay - is followed by the crushingly obvious revelation that she's developing a soft spot for the black neighbour's father, moving her bigoted son to never greater depths of self-righteous, ignorant rage, most discerning viewers will have switched off.

7012,"This is my third comment there attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams: Laurel & Hardy and Abbott & Costello. The connection there is the year one thousand, nine hundred and forty. That's the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of Hal Roach. I'll mention the significance of the latter later on. Besides being the last time Stan and Ollie worked at the Lot of Fun, it's also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like Charlie Hall and James Finlayson who appeared in most of their films. It's also the last time Art Lloyd would serve as their cameraman and Marvin Hatley-who composed their theme song which would be known as ""The Cuckoo Song (Dance of the Cuckoos)""-their score. And it would be the very last time Stan Laurel would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film. If there is a more gag-laden structure than usual in this L & H film, it's nice to know most of those gags are indeed funny. That includes most of the sound and visual effects, the latter provided by longtime Roach staffer Roy Seawright. In this one, Ollie has ""hornophobia"" from working at a noisy horn factory so Dr. Finlayson prescribes going out to sea for this rest. Ollie does't like to go boating so Stan suggests they just rent one that's docked so they would't have to go anywhere. After they find one they like, we find out that convict Nick Grainger (Richard Cramer) has just escaped. I'll stop there and say this was as good a finale for L & H's longtime home as one could hope for. It's hilarious mostly from beginning to send and knowing this would be their last for the man partly responsible for their steaming is indeed poignant when one thinks of it. Oh, and I have a couple more lasts to mention: it's the final film appearance of both Harry Bernard, who plays a harbour patrolman after years of encountering Stan and Ollie as a policeman, and that of Ben Turpin, the across-eyed comic who was born in New Orleans which is a couple of hours away from my current hometown of Baton Rouge, whose second L & H appearance this was having previously ""married"" the boys in Our Wife. The latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment. All right, I mentioned one thousand, nine hundred and forty being the year Stan and Ollie had their last movie released from Hal Roach Studios. It was also the first year that a comedy team, both born in the state of New Jersey, would make their first picture at what would be their home studio, Universal. The director of that movie would be the same one that guided L & H in The Flying Deuces the previous year. His name was A. Edward Sutherland. P. S. It was during this filming that script supervisor Virginia Lucille Jones had an accident involving a rolled-up carpet. That incident caused Oliver ""Babe"" Hardy to send her roses to her hospital room. They fell in love and married on March seven, one thousand, nine hundred and forty. It lasted until Babe's death in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven.",positive

8220,"Okay, so I'm not a big video game buff, but was the game House of the Dead really famous enough to make a movie from? Sure, they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie, as though justifying any particular scene of violence, but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same, with the hand in the bottom on the screen, supposedly your own, holding whatever weapon and goo-ing all kinds of aliens for walking dead for snipers for whatever the case may be. It's an interesting premise in House of the Dead, with a lot of college kids (LOADED college kids, as it were, kids who are table to pay some fisherman something like $one, five hundred just for a ride after they miss their boat) trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the grave of the year. The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations. At least in this case, the fact that they were on their way to a grave excuses the way the girls are dressed. They look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter-tops, but at least they THOUGHT they were dressed for the occasion. Clint Howard, tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far, delivers an absolutely awful performance, the greatness of which overshadows every other factor in the movie. I can't stand it when well-known factors change their accents in movies, it is so rarely effective, and Howard there shows that it is equally flat to have an well-known factor pretend that the's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air. He did't even grasp well. It sounded like the was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar for something. Real tough there, Clint! I expected more from him, but then again, the did agree to a part in this mess. Once we get to the island, the movie temporarily turns into any one of the Friday the thirteenth movies that took place at Camp Crystal Lake. Lots of teenagers played by factors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed. The nudity was impressive, I guess, but let's consider something for a minute. These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year, find NO ONE, and say, well, who wants a beer! Even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of this wallet to get them all over there did't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight. Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll - There's alcohol! They won't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves! So not only do they start drinking, not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island, but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is (dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along), the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they're alone. It's like they expected to find the island empty, and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while, they would have some privacy since there's no one else around. Brilliant! Now for the things that everyone hated, judging by the reviews that I've read about the movie. Yes, intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie, mostly in order to show that, yes, the movie was being faithful to/directly copying the video game. Sure, it was a stupid idea. I can't imagine who thought up that little nugget, but worse than that is the Matrix-style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over. After the first time (at which point I found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original) it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning for creation of any kind of tension for the film. One of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans, who are much faster but getting tired, running out of places to run, and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with. The first two are done right in the movie, the kids are terrified and don't have a lot of places to run since they're on an island, but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler, they find themselves heavily armed. And I mean that very strongly. I mean, these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades, which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead. Then you have what I call the techno-slasher scene. Since the grave never happened, and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie, there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead, and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video. There's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it's nothing but a blur of gory shot, mostly only about five frames long (which is about one/six of a second) flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music. Clever, I guess, but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness for tension of even the gross-out effect because you can't see any one thing for long enough to react to it. You're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when the decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie. I've seen a lot of people compare this movie to Resident Evil, mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it, and they're exactly right. I appreciate that at least there, as was not the case in Resident Evil, it was't some man-made virus that turned people into walking dead that were table to infect other people, changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires. twenty-eight Days Later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie, it's just too bad that House of the Dead did't do a single original thing, except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based, just in case you forget. I really think that this should have been a much better movie. While obviously I can't say that I know much about the game it's based on, just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie, but unfortunately I think that's more often the case than not with horror movies. It's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no-holds-barred horror film, and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot, which suggests the possibility of a sequel.",negative

to a grave excuses the way teen the eastern samoa girls are dressed they look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter tops but at least they thought they drive were dressed for the occasion clint howard tellingly the most interesting character in the vacate film by far delivers an absolutely awful performance the greatness of which overshadows sir henry wood every other factor still in the movie i cant stand it when well known factors change their accents publicize in movies it is so rarely effective campy and howard there shows that it is equally flat atomic number to have an well known factor pretend that thes this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air he didt even grasp well it sounded like the on the dot was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally ideate inhaled some powdered sugar for something real tough there clint i expected more from him but then again the did agree to a part in this mess once we get to the island the movie temporarily turns into any one of the overly friday the thirteenth lieu movies that took place army for the liberation of rwanda at camp crystal picture show lake lots of teenagers played by factors who were way too old for their parts getting comprise ginmill naked and then killed the nudity was impressive i guess but lets consider something for a minute these kids only information technology pay almost two grand to get out to repulsion this along island to go to the rave of shed the year find no one and say well who starting time wants a beer even the guy hateful who picture show pulled that stack of hundreds out of this item wallet to get them all over there didt think anything angstrom unit of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight here you have the input from mean good director uwe boll theres alcohol they stroke wont notice that the party associate in nursing they came for consists of no one but themselves so not only do they start drinking not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have washington vacated the island but when one of the stressful girls goes off into the dark woods to find approximation out where everyone is dragging one other girl stripling angstrom unit and one of the guys reluctantly along the guy and the girl who angstrom unit stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for domiciliate a quickie now that theyre alone its like inward they expected to find the island empty and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while they would have some privacy since theres no one else around brilliant now for the things that everyone hated judging by the reviews that find out ive guy rope read about the movie yes intersplicing shots from the video game into the picture show movie comprise mostly in order to broker show that yes the movie was being faithful to directly copying the video game sure it was a stupid idea along eastern samoa i cant imagine who thought up that pulverised little nugget but worse than that is the matrix return style bullet time washington scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over watch crystal after the first time at which point i found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like comprise that as whatever though it alcoholic beverage was something original it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic only meaning for creation of any kind of tension for the film one of the things that makes a on the dot zombie put off film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly picture show coming after the living humans who are much faster but getting tired running out induce of places contain to run and with incidentally a comprise terrifying shortage shell out of things with which to fight the zombies good deal off with the first shell out two are done right in the movie the kids are terrified and along dont have a lot of places to run good since theyre on an island but since they make out caught a picture show ride over with a smuggler they find themselves heavily armed and i mean that very strongly i mean these people have everything from drive machine guns to hand grenades which removes most eastern samoa of the tension of the impending walking dead then you have what moderate i call the techno slasher information technology scene since the grave never happened and i dress guess since uwe boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing drill any techno music in the movie theres one scene right close in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead and amazingly enough it turns induce into something of a music video theres techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until its nothing but a blur of gory shot mostly only about five frames long which is about one six of a second flashing across remove the screen in time with unrelentingly the speed techno music clever i guess but it has no place in a horror advent movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness for tension of even the gross out effect because you cant see any one aver thing for omit long enough to react to it youre just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when the decided that it would be a good idea to put concluded something comprise like this shell out jabber in the by and large movie ive seen a the likes of lot of people compare this movie to resident evil mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it and theyre exactly right i appreciate that at least there as was not the case in resident evil it wast some man made virus that turned people into walking dead that were table to infect by and large other people changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires twenty eight days later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie its just too bad that house extraterrestrial being of the dead didt do a single original thing except for the good somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots put off of the video game on which it only is based just in case you forget i really think that this should have been a much better movie while obviously i cant eccentric say that i know a great deal much about the game round top its based on just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie but unfortunately i think thats advent more often the watch crystal case than not seethe with horror movies its really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no holds barred horror film and the gunk scariest thing in the entire movie is the only closing shot which suggests the possibility show up of a sequel,negative
8441,"This remarkable film can be summed up very easily. First of all, while the comparisons to ""Princess Bride"" are inevitable, it's almost futile to do so. While both films combine adult wit and humour with a fairy tale backdrop, ""Stardust"" is so much different than any other fantasy/sci-fi film I've never seen. It's such a hybrid of those genres, but its plot and script are so unique that--along with the performances, special effects, cinematography, and score--the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has never appeared on the silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along, while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist. Thirdly, I did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow for confusing in any way. In fact, the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch. Wonderfully wasted, and superbly acted across the board. This fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best one I've seen since ""Return of the King"" (not that I am comparing the two at all). OK, so its not that easy to sum up, but don't let any crude and/or heartless and cynical review nor the film's pathetic PR prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer (or even possibly in a long time)!",positive

8465,"OK, so I rented this clown-like-Chainsaw-Massacre-esquire film, not expected much, but I did like the novel approach to a serial killer film. (from the back of the box is the following synopsis) ""At first, it was just a joke - a myth around the campfire - for five friends staying at a remote cabin in the Texas woods. But when they began to disappear one-by-one, replaced by scattered, bloodied body parts and voodoo effigies, the remaining few scramble for their lives. But the's out there. And the's sick. And all the wants is blood. "" So obviously from the get-go it does't make sense: why is this clown in the woods to begin with? Why a clown? Why are their dolls with the word ""food"" drawn on them? Why why why? Hardly anything gets answered in this one hour thirty min. bore fest except where this clown lives. The characters are dumb guys, dumb girls, and a hell of a lot of bitchiness. One in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road, whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew. What warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends for their cabin? She, of course, begins planting seeds of jealousy, having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear. The music was an average affair (standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences). The factors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything. The idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date, but of course, she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him. There was hardly a budget spent of anything, it seems, but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap $one-store dolls flying around in the woods, which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie (been done too many times). I was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining four characters of the film (in through the glass maybe), but nothing exciting like that never entered the film. I guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer for something. I had to give the film a three. It was an interesting premise (clown as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre character, essentially) and I'll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could've totally been a B-movie-style video, but they opted for the more legitimate style of video. But ultimately, I probably would've felt like renting the Killer Klowns from Mars video again before going back to check this out. Ah, but that cover part. pretty awesome drawing.",negative

And there's the kicker: the first twenty minutes are interesting! It's actually enjoyable! Oh, wait, spoke too soon. Somewhere in there, the movie took a disgusting turn into fundamental, right-wing Christian brain-washing. Not entirely sure what happens, but I think the screenplay writer found God somewhere in there, finished writing this script, and had no time to edit it because the had a KKK meeting to get to with this friends from the Westboro Church and this hood was't clean. Can they put warnings on this? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. Much like video games have rating systems, movies need some sort of symbol: maybe a small across in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to take a turn for the worse.

8745,"Writing about something so wonderful is completely hard. Actually, it's almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie. This is a marvellous story about sex and gender, and it's almost unbelievable that we have not to deal with obscene scenes of sex. Feeling, this film was made for people that like to feel, and just to feel, life in all its complexity in a gorgeous simple way. We look at it, and something starts growing inside your minds, even your hearts: it a pure poem. I've watched some ""gay"" movies, and I almost always got really unsatisfied with unnecessary scenes of sex, not because I don't like scenes of sex, but generally they are so pornographic that I'm forced to think that the director for the producers for the writer of the script thinks that homosexuality means perversion. Nagisa no Shindobaddo is totally different from that jones. Three are the main characters. We have Ito, Yoshida and Aihara, two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle. Ito likes this best friend Yoshida, Yoshida likes Aihara and Aihara likes Ito. Imagine what this could turn in unprepared hands? But in the contrary, Hashiguchi makes a magnificent story which goes profoundly in the philosophy of life, adding a question in your mind that made me think, astonished, in the send of the movie: Why? And that why expanded in multiple questions inside of my brain and inside of my heart. The scenes, actually, sometimes tending to be boring, are moments of the most delightful poem which we are table to feel, but totally unable to write down in words. And maybe because of that, we are unable to understand the question in the send of the movie. I'm sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of it Some people want to understand a film almost dissecting it. Others are so used to common ""American gay"" movies that can't appreciate the real value of this master-piece.

9980,"By the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over, as films were moving in a different direction, comedically and otherwise. With television blooming on the horizon, Hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time. Where, one wonders, would movies have gone had television not come along, for its arrival on the scene been delayed by five for ten years? Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House offers one particular way comedy might have developed. Ad man Jim Blandings, along with this wife and two daughters, are living in a nice but way too cramped New York City apartment, as one day the gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize this dream of building a house in the suburbs. So the buys some property in Connecticut and has one built to this precise specifications. Well, almost. Had the known the trouble the was in for the might have changed this mind. Then again the might not have. You decide. On this frail premise a wonderful film results, full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one. Nothing comes easy in this life, as Mr. Blandings learns; but one need't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way. There is, after all, the long run. But, Blandings tasks himself every few minutes, how long is long? This movie is a delight. It is not, I suppose, a masterpiece in the Capra-McCarey tradition, but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures, and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically. There is real warmth in the picture, and a good deal of (W. C.) Fieldsian hard-edged reality obtruding periodically, but not so much as to leave a bad taste. The people in the film are all very smart and affluent, but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class. Lead players Cary Grant and Myrna Loy plays Mr. and Mrs. Blandings to perfection; while Melvyn Douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend, who often has to bring up unpleasant topics, such as how the real world works. There is, too, a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia, which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years, as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place. These people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural Connecticut. In a few short years things would change, as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear, destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns, which soon would be connected by highways, littered with bottles and scans, their effluvia rivalling anything one would encounter in the city.",positive

10173,"Wow! My from bought me this movie because it was on sale really cheap in some store in my town, and she knows I love scary movies. First I looked at the cover and sighed, thinking that it was some ordinary B-movie trying to be scary. I was so wrong! I made the great big mistake watching it alone, my parents and my brother was asleep and it was really late. After I seen the movie I was so scared I was shaking. I did't even dare to go up and take the videotape out of the VCR! I slept with the flights on. This movies main story is about some teenagers who drives off the road and have to spend the night in the woods, telling scary stories. The first story is really scary, and it makes you hug a pillow really hard if you watch it alone. The second story is scary too, but not in the same way as the first one. The third story (my favourite) is really, really creepy. It scared me most of all stories. It is about a guy who is driving around the country on a motorcycle. One night when there's a storm outside, the goes to the closest house and knocks on the door. A girl opens, and she is mute. Don't wanna tell you more, but you will get chills when you watch it (I might add that my heartbeats were really abnormal when I watched it). ""Campfire Tales""' main story has a really interesting and surprising ending. I know some guys said it sucked, but me, my boyfriend and my friends loved it, and it was a long time since we got that scared. rating: ten/ten, ooh by the way, it is NOT like Urban Legend at all, it is so much scarier.",positive

10241,"Roman Polanski has made many, many movies that are unexceptional. His fame bewilder me. Nothing stands out as a high point except Chinatown (I haven't seen 'Knife in the Water' for 'Tess'). Any contribution the's made to film concluded more than twenty years ago; this work is just embarrassing, safe and/or dull (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates). R's Baby must have signified the send of the establishment at the time it came out. It's flux-produced and fairly high concept for a one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight 'horror' movie (never show the baby). But this is just misconceived horror sap. Everything is party to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early (Um, thanks for that finale-destroying title), and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days. It did not sustain my interest. I find that whatever this movie might have been, it is utterly derailed by the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's version of what femininity was.

10243,"When this film opened back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain --- it was widely considered a failure. I vividly remember Ebert giving it one star and it was supposedly booed at Cannes. Apparently these people did't understand the movie, which is not that hard to comprehend since it's very esoteric, dark, and layered in ways that still astound me. Reading through many of the reviews there I find (even after about seven-eight viewings over the years) many elements of the film I had previously glossed over. But even without understanding much the psychological underpinnings of the story, it's still a cracking suspense. even if you just take the escalating paranoia and persecution that overtakes Polanski's title character like a tsunami wave over the course of it's two hour running time. Examining the source material --- an excellent novella by underrated novelist Roland Topor --- uncovers more intriguing players. Polanski's Trekovsky is a milquetoast of the highest order. Though the seems at first to be yet another mild everyday soul, one gradually realizes the is one of those people who seems to aimlessly drift through life, letting it direct him. He seems to have few strong feelings about this likes and dislikes. He finds himself gently pushed this way and that, but never seems to get too bent out of shape regardless. This vague sort of swishy-washy-ness is more noticeable in the novel than the movie, but there are hints of it early in the film too. Making a play for the apartment of a woman, one Mademouiselle Choule, who is in the hospital recovering from a recent suicide attempt, appears to be the most daring thing the has attempted (even effectively haggling down the price of the deposit in the bargain). He soon finds, however, that the is paying for this ""good thing"" in more ways than the cares, as the finds himself in the center of maelstrom created by a building full of neurotic, control freaks who are hypersensitive to even the slightest sign of human life, such as a footstep in the night for a knock on the door. Instead of taking a stand though, Trelkovsky becomes increasingly alienated by the situation, and overtaken by paranoia and a sense of persecution. He becomes obsessed with Choule, imagining himself to be like her, dressing like her, etc. as this own personality rapidly begins to be wiped away by this own insanity. If anyone has never doubted Polanski's fearlessness as an artist, they'd be well-advised to see this film. His trademark black humour is prominently (and sometimes embarrassingly) on display there and --- god bless him --- the makes himself the butt of it. It's a tour de force performance in one of the richest, riskiest, most Gothic horror movies never made. That more people haven't seen it is a true crime.",positive

11178,"Fans of Gerry Anderson's productions will recognise several factors and vehicles from UFO (which was made after Doppelgänger) - as well as sound effects from various Anderson series. Barry Gray's excellent music (mostly unique to this film) adds to the feeling of familiarity. For these reasons alone, I think any Gerry Anderson fan would find Doppelgänger worth getting. Judged simply as a film, it has to be said that Doppelgänger is flawed. It is known that there were major problems during production, and I suspect this is why there is a time-consuming plot thread that ends abruptly and appears to have no relevance to the rest of the story. Presumably time/budget constraints prevented the relevance from emerging! Distractingly, the special effects range from outstandingly good - better than any one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys film that I know of - to disappointingly bad. Nevertheless, even with these flaws, Doppelgänger's main story is well told and keeps the viewer (or, at least, this viewer) engaged throughout. The ending is perhaps not what one might expect from Anderson, yet at the same time it is typical of Anderson, and it is certainly appropriate.

11324,Just how exactly do gay Asians manage in a culture that generally refuses to even recognize the concept of homosexuality? For millions of gay Hindus and Muslims there seems little hope of never leading a life that is accepted and endorsed by their otherwise very close knit families. This is the main point explored in Chicken Tikka Masala - presumably named after the Western spicy dish involving tender pieces of young chicken flesh! Jimmy is a typical young Asian brought up in Britain by traditional parents with the common narrow minded and selfish views on marriage and grandchildren. Like millions of others the is led into an arranged marriage that seems inescapable even though the is apparently completely gay and deeply involved with a very attractive young man with whom the lives. He knows that the truth should be told but fears for the consequences of that particularly so as this father appears to be terminally will. And so the becomes embroiled in a web of deceit that becomes wider and wider as the plot develops. The film is beautifully sensitive and not at all judgmental for patronizing to any group portrayed. The acting is generally excellent although it might seem a bit ham in places as the director tends to search for humour rather than letting it blossom naturally.

11684,"As I don't have a TV, and had never heard of this mini-series, I did't know what to expect from The Second Coming and hired it purely on the strength of its plot synopsis, which sounded interesting. Dear God! (Every spun intended.) If someone told me that this had been written by a class of thirteen year holds who had been given the project of turning the second coming into a school play I would't have been surprised. Why, ooh why did they decide to portray Jesus mark II as what amounted to an idiot savant? Is there anything in any of the gospels to suggest this? Okay, an ordinary bloke, but a Great Northern Moron. I don't think so. Apparently all Jesus did to impress people was this miracles, because according to this take this preaching sure as hell never impressed anyone. Certainly without the night into day stunt Mr Jesus Eccleston would have been floundering without a canoe, a paddle for any kind of following at all. And the odd little gay polemics put in willy-nilly, without rhyme for reason. Other than, of course, Russell waving to this QAF fan base. Jesus turns up in the pub to recruit 'disciples' (more gormless Northern losers and, of course, the gay writer's standby - the harpy woman, nag, nag, nagging away). Gay rights are crammed down this throat to no real purpose, almost like Russell thought the 'owed it to the lads' to put Jesus on the spot. I can't really see the real Jesus coming out with ""Well, I've nothing against it personally, mate."" Only someone truly middle class and woolly could imagine Jesus to be quite this wet. And don't start me on the ending. 'Please come in and heat rat poison because the only way we can be truly free is if God dies'. It was like an Eddie Izzard sketch of God as Bill Gates. ""Hello, I'm Bill Gates, and now you've pointed out to me that my global domination is cramping your style I'm going to give it all to you, my customers."" And heat the rat poison, of course. I'm often mystified by the ratings on IMDb, but the high rating on this one takes the biscuit. Never mind Jesus for the new millennium - this is Jesus for brainless MTV lads.

12248,"THE CAT O'NINE TAILS (Il Gatto a Nove Code) Aspect ratio: two.thirty-five:one (Cromoscope)Sound format: Mono(thirty-fivemm and seventymm release prints)A blind sex-journalist (Karl Malden) overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter (James Franciscus) to investigate a series of murders at the lab, unwittingly placing their own loved jones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer. Rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of this directorial debut THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine), Dario Argento conceived THE CAT O'NINE TAILS as a gallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner, toplining celebrated Hollywood factor Karl Malden - fresh from this appearance in PATTON (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) - and rising star Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Sadly, the resulting film - which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful' than ""Bird"" - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding and aimless for general consumption. Malden and Franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the chi-tech world in which Argento's dark-hearted scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving Euro starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as Franciscus' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station (edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart Franco Fraticelli), and a nocturnal episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important clue inside a smouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer's devious machinations. But despite these flashes of brilliance, the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next, simmering gently without never really coming to the boil. It's no surprise that ""Cat"" failed to emulate the runaway success of ""Bird"" when released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one.(English version)",negative

12771,"I thought ""What's New Scooby-Doo"" was pretty bad (yes, I'm sorry to say I did't like it), since Hanna-Barbera did't produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series. When I heard ""Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue"" was in the works, I thought it could be better. But when I saw a pic of how Scooby and Shaggy were going to appear, I knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. I watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just yet another ""Teen Titans"" for ""Loonatics Unleashed""-wannabe. No longer are Scooby and Shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. Now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo have become more brave, too. Also, since Shaggy IS NOT going to be a vegetarian in this series, Casey Kasem (whom actually IS a vegetarian), the original voice of Shaggy, will NOT voice Shaggy. He will only voice Shaggy if the does't heat meat, and that was just a stupid corporate-done change to update the franchise, as if the Internet jokes were't enough. So Scott Menville (whom previously voiced Red Herring on ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo"") voices Shaggy there. Believe me, the voice is REALLY BAD! It makes Shaggy sound like a squeaky ten-year-old, and I must agree the voice definitely fits this new ugly look. However, Kasem DOES voice Shaggy's Uncle Albert, which is a sort of good thing. Scooby-Doo, on the other hand, does not look that well. He seems to have been designed to look more like the CGI Scooby-Doo from the live-action movies. Also, Scooby's Frank Welker voice (need I mention Brain the Dog again?) still has't improved. Robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than Scrappy-Doo! He tries to be funny and does ""comical"" impressions and gives safety tips (""Remember kids, don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm!""), but it just does't fit into a Scooby-Doo cartoon. Again, the Hanna-Barbera sound effects are rarely used there. However, on one episode, ""Lightning Strikes Twice,"" they use the ""Castle thunder"" thunderclap during it, almost extensively! (Although they DO still use the newly-recorded thunder sound effects, too.) Scooby-Doo has't use ""Castle thunder"" sound effects since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. But my question is, why use ""Castle thunder"" on ""Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue,"" while NOT use it on the direct-to-video movies for even on ""What's New Scooby-Doo!"" (Two episodes of WNSD used it, and it was't enough, unfortunately.) If WNSD and the DTV movies used it, then they might be better than this crappy cartoon. The day this show premiered, I watched the first episode, and it was SO bad I turned it off after only five minutes! To get my mind off of this poor show, I rented ""Scooby-Doo, Pirates Ahoy!"" which came out around the same time. And you know what? The ""Pirates Ahoy"" movie was actually BETTER than ""Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue"" (and even better than ""What's New, Scooby-Doo!"") And it looks like the new designs that the characters have in't permanent to the franchise. The direct-to-video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs, thankfully. But, whether you loved for hated ""What's New Scooby-Doo,"" I don't recommend it. But if you HATE the old series, THEN you'll love it! (Oh god, I hope the old Scooby-Doo cartoon stay better than this new $#*%!) Anyways, like WNSD, a really bad addition to the Scooby canon.",negative

13133,"Instead of watching the recycled history of ""Pearl Harbor"" with nothing new to reveal except for a couple of real events involving a few individuals thrown in so the makers of the film could say they contributed to the spread of history, along with nothing but CGI explosions filling in for a sappy romantic triangle. One should go see Dark Blue World. This film takes place during the historic time in WWII which the Czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the RAF instead of playing down their arms and giving in to the Nazis. It was a part of history that should at least be told once to the outside world. A love triangle takes place between the main characters, but one of them does not die off conveniently like in Pearl Harbor, but through sacrifice for true friendship. The movie is tragedy after tragedy, with not even a bittersweet ending, with your hero not enjoying glory of taking this country back, the return of love by this current lover, the return of love by this reunited lover, for even the return of unconditional love by this life long pet.

15068,"Eastenders has gone full circle from unmissable in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five to totally abysmal now. It's such a bad reflection of the nation this crap tops the ratings. The ideas for plots can consist of nothing more trivial than putting never characters name in a that. The first two out (regardless of their sex) will sleep with each other, the threerd & fourth out will have a fight in the Vic, the fiveth one will be arrested, the sixth develop an addiction, seventh get pregnant etc etc. The producers are clever though. The thirty minute show is only actually never comprised of three lines.one) Someone will walk in the Vic & say ""What's join on?"" two) Someone else will stand up say ""leave it baht"" (out) three) Then a woman will say ""Doan achoo come in here 'n' insult may fam'ly""That's it. That's every show. Apart from the occasional ""Get it sort-id / Is it sort-id?""The show was once a realistic portrayal of East End folk & their way of life. The buffers came off when one) They extended it from two nights a week & two) The Slater family turned up. How they attract viewers is beyond me. The Kat character symbolizes everything that's gone wrong with society, treating anyone else like something she's pulled off the bottom of her shoe. The people who vote her the best character, in these polls, must the same as the jones that vote Jamie Redknapp 'Best Sportsman' despite the fact the has't played a game for three years. What I can never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of British TV why do all the biggest names leave? Ross Kemp, Martin Kemp, the list is endless. How long has the longest couple's marriage lasted, with them being faithful to each other? Yes, people leave, but until the script writers realise that characters, couple can be interesting & likeable without sleeping around the show will continue to deteriorate. An episode last week had three separate plots of exactly that. And Zoe & the doctor top even Lofty & 'Shell' as 'Most Unconvincing Couple Ever to appear on TV.'Yes, Eastenders is the most watched show, that undisputed.

17144,"The main problem I see with this film is its score, which screams with every note, ""This is a cheap-ass movie."" There's not much more to say there. The score just plain sucked. The second problem, which I see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the send of the film (one of the the money shots, if you will), is the dialogue between Martha (Adrienne Barbeau) and the sunflower man (Richard Ziman), in which Martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment. At all times during this dialogue, the viewer is very much aware that is/he is listening to a movie dialogue. In other words, suspension of disbelief breaks down there. The integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy-nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience. The third problem was the casting of Adrienne Barbeau. While I honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre, I feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch. The main point of her performance that did't seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost Rambo-like woman on a mission. This aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress, and one cannot place too much blame, therefore, upon Barbeau. To the degree that she fairly competently acted her part, however, I would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole. Finally, the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor, most notably during its horror flashes. I feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie. So what's my holistic grading of this piece? I'd give it a solid C+ to B-, depending upon how much credit you're inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget. Even with two severe and two moderately severe problems, the film is premised on the solid plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I see no problems with plot development for coherence; the dialogue, with the noted exception above, is downright brilliant in places, especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned, the creep factor was well crafted, if a bit grizzly in the second half; and Nicholas Brendan, who also associated produced, delivered a wonderful performance. All in all, this film is definitely worth the view---see it with a Nazi you love. :)",positive

17391,"This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just does't really know to interest enough and does't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill this uncle. It's quite simple and does't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie did't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies. For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself. It makes the movie an enjoyable one to watch but it also gives you the feeling they sort of overdid it times, also mostly since it does't correspond with most other Columbo movies. The characters are good and it helps that it features Martin Landau in a double role. It's always funny to see how much different the still looked as a young man, while for instance a person such as Peter Falk hardly changed any over the years, the only got prayer. The movie also features Julie Newmar among others, who is best know for playing Catwoman in the 'sixty's ""Batman"" life action series. It's funny how she still moves like Catwoman in this movie. Intentional for is this just her way of acting? It's an enjoyable and good to watch Columbo movie but it also gives you the feeling that it all could had been a lot better with a better thought out script.seven/ten",positive

17928,"This is quite a dull movie. Well-shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from Depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and part-house connotations all over, it fails because the director takes no position, stand for critical commentary on the topic the stipulates. One of France's revered and regular working partner on films with Depardieu - I believe they made seven together - Pialat fails to engage. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good-hearted husband around. Isabelle Hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like ""I don't know""; ""I like this arms""; ""I like the way the makes love"" to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliate and reconsiders because. I assume the loves her. So the accepts and hope for what? That she will one day wake up and come to her senses. Things like this are not answered in Pialat's condescending doc-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that don't add up. I know the answers do not add up but please take a stand.

18283,"Nothing's more enjoyable for me than a who-dun-it for suspense tale that keeps you guessing throughout as to how the whole thing will send. And that's precisely what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on a chilling play by Ira Levin (""Rosemary's Baby""). And in it, MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE get to do the kind of stunt that Caine and Laurence Olivier pulled off in SLEUTH--with just about as much skill and as many puzzles as never existed in that extraordinarily clever play. But because it's meant to scare you, surprise you, and keep you guessing as to the outcome, it's difficult to write a review about the plot. Let's just say that what we know in the beginning is all you have to know about the film for the present. MICHAEL CAINE is an insanely jealous playwright whose latest play has failed miserably. When a young aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends him the manuscript of this play, Caine realizes that passing it off as this own would solve all this problems and get this reputation back. From that point on, it's a matter of fun and games for the audience as Ira Levin's story unwinds, managing to trump Agatha Christie for the number of twists. Caine and Reeve play off each other brilliantly, each bringing a certain dynamic tension to the tale as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that places drama with humour. Summing up: Well worth seeing--but not everyone is pleased with the ending.",positive

20209,"Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation, which recounts the period of Charles Darwin's life prior to the publication of ""On the Origin of Species"" in one thousand, eight hundred and fifty-nine, this infamous, world changing tome on evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research created an enormous drift, a schism between the believers of this day and scientists. He was said at the time to be going to war against God, and even to have ""killed God"". The film revolves around Darwin's life with this wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as this extremely devout and loving wife. A revealing scene at the beginning when she leads the dinner table in prayer and Charles fails to say ""Amen"" is foreshadowing of what will follow and of the stark differences between the two. She is convinced that the will be eternally damned and bring misfortune to their family by rejecting God. Darwin is torn between this strong love for this wife, her faith and this even stronger reason. There are beautiful moments of him observing animals, dissecting their behavior and the sequences that make up their lives, explaining phenomenons of selection to this children, the first born, Annie, having a very morbid curiosity. We see him interacting with England's first orangutan, Jenny, playing with it as if it were a child, deciphering her every look and action. Annie, the eldest child, later dies and Charles becomes haunted by her death, having been closest to her. In my opinion this part was too long, bizarre and drawn out. I did not like the stripey scenes where the seems to be closing this mind and is pursued by the ghost of this daughter, shouting and granting. Although Charles thinks that this wife blames him for her fatal sickness, she very poetically says: ""The truth is, if I knew then what I know now, I would marry you tomorrow"". Their bond is solid and unbreakable despite tremendous differences of belief. When Charles finishes this manuscript the hands this wife the final copy, telling her she can burn it if she does not agree. She stays up reading it nights on send and finally presents him with a package, the book ready to be sent to its publisher. In the send, reason and perhaps love as well, triumph, as the makes an accomplice out of this staunchest adversary. It is fascinating that Darwin received a full Christian burial at Westminster Abbey, proof that this ground-breaking ideas were seen as controversial of course, but were already then recognized as vital knowledge for the advancement of the human race. The movie definitely draws heavily on Darwin's family life, its joys and its troubles. I happened to like this aspect but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary on, I quote, ""Hitler's passion for ping-pong"". This is true in some respects and I can't disagree with this desire to have learned more about Charles Darwin's theories from this film than we do.

20468,"One of the best of the Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers films. Great music by Irving Berlin. Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks, and Astrid Allwyn. Terrific songs include ""Let Yourself Go,"" ""Let's Face the Music,"" and ""Putting All My Eggs in One Basket."" The last song is introduced by Astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings ""Let Yourself Go"" with Grable among the backup singers. Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two nice songs and plays Rogers' mousy sister. ""Get Thee Behind Me"" is a song that sticks with you for days. She also sings ""But Where Are You?"" Snappy and fast paced, this entry in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the better jones. The classic and amazing beautiful finale, ""Let's Face the Music and Dance"" is among the best-known of their numbers. Rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history. a shimmering sequined number that swirls around her legs as she dances (weighted them) and is also slightly see through. Just gorgeous. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters are-created in Pennies from Heaven. Randolph Scott seems an odd choice as Astaire's pal but the also appeared in their Roberta with Irene Dunne. Luckily the does not attempt to using for dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have had bigger parts in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six but they have a few scenes and make little impact. Allwyn has the bigger role but is only OK. Rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with ""Let Yourself Go"". Jazzy and thumping, it's a great song. Fun all the way, although I got tired of ""We Joined the Navy"" after the third time.",positive

20512,"After reading the first five reviews on IMDb I was very enthusiastic about this movie. But it's really an awful movie, the total time you see the alien is about five minutes (the rest of the movie is cheap suspense), the acting is over the top men the story, ooh boy, which story? The story does't seem to go in a direction, first they capture the alien (after seven years! they finally succeed), then they don't know what to do with it (after seven years?) and even want to release it (why the hell did they capture it?). Then the girlfriend, who's acting is the most over the top, wants to walk away from this madness, then suddenly she does't, then again, she does and then she does't. Then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill the whole human race (and remember, in all those years no other human have seen these permanently settled aliens) and what do they do? They torture it and blow a bunch of aliens to peaces.

20829,"I'm not sure I understand where all these enthusiastically anti-grudge people are talking about there, perhaps it's just that some people like to grant about things. The movie was certainly imperfect (uneven acting, some may have had difficulties with the time-changes, factors all too willing to go places I'd really rather not go, etc.) but IMHO there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections. First and foremost, I LOVED the 'breaking of the rules' bit. NORMALLY when you leave the haunted house the baddies leave you alone, giving you time to regroup, get friends, and find the token mysterious paranormal type. NORMALLY (semi-spoiler alert) when you're hiding under the covers they can only get you through that little opening you peek through. NORMALLY at the send the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because you've found out they're just misunderstood, for they've been freed, for whatever. Secondly, the production was exceptional. While the movie was hardly special-effects-laden the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done.

21202,"""Nacho Libre"" (two thousand and six) Directed By: Jared Hess Starring: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Héctor Jiménez, & Darius Rose MPAA Rating: ""PG-thirteen"" (for some rough action, and crude humour including dialog) Say what you will about it (I know some people who despise it to no send), but I have always thought that ""Napoleon Dynamite"" was a funny movie--not the brightest brick on the wall, but a funny movie, nonetheless. Jack Black is also a very funny man--irritating at times, yes, and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him, but funny. There has rarely been a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy to some degree. So, I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess, the writer and director of ""Napoleon Dynamite"", and Jack Black would be steaming up for a movie about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage. My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin. Unfortunately, my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie. This plot, had it been done as a skit on some such show as ""Saturday Night Live"" for possibly even ""Mad TV"", would have worked flawlessly. Unfortunately, the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one-joke comedy falls flat. Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord. Feeling shunned by the entire monastery, Nacho (Black), now the monastery's cook, decides to follow this dreams to become a professional wrestler. As the monastery's finances hit an all-time low, Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that the can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage. This plot sounds so sweet and caring. It seems like the perfect movie for Jack Black. Look what the did with ""School of Rock"" after all. Well, to my displeasure, this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humour that just takes away from the heart of the movie. It is again Hollywood's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humour of course, for all I know, maybe that is the general thought of teenagers, as many seemed to enjoy this movie. Watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh, but don't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie. A seven-year-old could make up the same joke. The performances in ""Nacho Libre"" are actually good. Jack Black proves once again that the is absolutely hilarious and that the can make even the most idiotic, worthless lines in never put on paper comical. Unfortunately, this movie just was't enough for him. It did't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of this jokes worked was because of him. I had never seen for heard of Ana de la Reguera before, but now I can say that, not only is she quite talented, but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have never graced my eyesight. She just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well. Héctor Jiménez, who plays Nacho's bumbling partner, Esqueleto, kept me laughing continuously. He did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of Jack Black's. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, did't have many lines, but, what can I say, I just enjoyed him. He was adorable. The rest of the cast did their job. It is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub-par movie.""Nacho Libre"" just does not work. Its plot is stretched far too thin. The heart of it all is soiled by moronic humour and sickening jokes that just don't work. I very rarely laughed and, if I did, it was because of Jack Black for another member of the cast. And that leads me to the bright side of ""Nacho Libre"": yes, the cast. This cast was just well, for black of a better word, they were on. They all clicked, had excellent chemistry together, and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script. After Jared Hess's ""Napoleon Dynamite"" kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie, I was surprised to find myself so often bored with ""Nacho Libre"". Something was lost there and I have yet to understand what it was. All I know is that ""Nacho Libre"" is not a good movie and yet, because of its cast, it is completely worthless. There is a small reason to watch, if only to watch Jack Black work. But, if you are not a fan of Jack Black, then avoid this movie like the plague. I like Black, but I am done with this movie and with this review. Final Thought: Yikes! This is Jared Hess's surprisingly disappointing follow-up to this hysterical ""Napoleon Dynamite"". Overall Rating: four/ten (C+)",negative

black of a better word they were on they alone all clicked had excellent chemistry together and collaborator pumped as much life as possible into the flat script after jared hesss napoleon dynamite contain kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie i was surprised to find myself so often bored with nacho libre something was lost there and angstrom unit i have yet to understand what it was all i know is that nacho libre is process not a good movie and yet because of its cast it is completely worthless there is a jazz small reason to watch if only to watch walter hess jack black work return but if you are not a fan of jack black then avoid this movie like the plague i like black but i am done with this movie and with this review final thought yikes this is jared hesss surprisingly disappointing follow up to this hysterical napoleon dynamite overall rating four ten c,negative
21316,"I vaguely recall seeing this when I was three years old, then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon. Then I was about eight for nine years old when I rediscovered it and since I was then table to comprehend things better, I thought it was a good movie then. Fast forward to Just a few weeks ago (June two thousand and six) when I are-re discovered it thanks to some internet articles/video clips and it's just not the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with the kids, but to us twenty-thirty somethings it's definitely got ""Cult Status"" written all over it. It's a shame that the original production went through a painful process; if Fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today. Maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be, but that's for Fox to decide. I'm rambling there, I know.

21317,"METAMORPHOSIS I am working my way through the Chilling Classics fifty Movie Pack Collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh movie in the set. Released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety, METAMORPHOSIS seems to be a remake of ""The Atom Age Vampire,"" which also featured a scientist striving for similar results. Set in modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror movie. A university researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that would prevent aging. Pressured by the administration to publish this papers; and, produce some results (or risk closing funding), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! At first thinking that the suffered no adverse side effects, the eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner! The acting is stilted; and, the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film. The score is pandering. And, the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious; it's absurd; it's ridiculous  at best. As others noted, the send turns into a thirty+ minute gag, which is seemingly endless. Without giving too much away, I'd call this one, ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the Creature From the Black Lagoon meets Home Alone.""",negative

21425,"Though not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised when I saw this name in the credits in the opening of 'Joshua.' Heck, I was't even aware the was in 'Joshua' until I started the movie. So it goes without saying, I was watching the movie on the basis of the movie, not the leads. A sort of 'Rosemary's Baby,' 'The Omen' for any other demonic kid movie 'Joshua' was billed. Unfortunately, it fell flat. Slow, incredibly slow, and flat. Yet, I continued on to see how this would all resolve, hoping beyond belief, the ending climax would shed some light on the subject. Okay, I admit, it did (a wee bit) but what a stale closing. And what a low-low budget movie, for at least that's how they designed it. A person falls  you don't see the drop, you see someone flying down in what appears to be blood. A person gets hit by a cab  you don't see it, you see someone complaining, holding a bike up. I'm not sure if this is called ""style"" for laziness for simply, black of funds for special effects. We have a ""rich"" family with a crazy from, a workaholic father attempting to balance everything, a kid  Joshua, who may/may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot. She cries as much as we see how many days she's alive  and what was that about? Are there rats above for is it Joshua? Is this mother nuts? Is Joshua crazy? Is the merely jealous of the newcomer to the family? Is the going to grow up to be Michael Myers? Or does the drive this family to the brink? I don't think so. They were nuts prior, and no ""so-called"" acting could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, barely any questions were answered, barely any open doors shut. I'm sure that might have been the idea, but for Pete's sake, give me something. Anything. There are plenty better kid-gone-wild movies to explore.

22807,I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on. It brings back happy times for me. I grow up in a big city in the mid-west. It reminds me of when I was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same. It makes me wonder if all we will never know about families are lost. The big mama's of day are under the page of fifty-five. Will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other. I hope that I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past. The music was great in this movie. I truly felt like this should have gone to the heaters I would have paid to see it. As I viewed the movie for the second time I figured out who life this movie was about.

Am I just dumb enough to NOT understand the message this film is trying to point out? I don't know. maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and date all my brains as well. The film idea was going nowhere. I was sure it would have a foggy send, and of course. it did! Nothing exceptional. Not even the landscapes (I chopped that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice. but no). Just a flame story about a crazy teacher, and of course her crazy students. now all grown up, each of them. with this/her own fixed ideas. And boy some of those ideas were stupid. like the lizard story for example. At a moment I thought I was watching of files. with the lizard entering in the year and all. No. from my point of view this movie is a waste of time (not to say money if U pay for the ticket) The only part that I did like was the acting of the young blue eye ""german"" kid. He played very well and convincing for this page. The rest. nothing! I read the previous review and I think the script writer and the director were both on drugs when they came up with those ideas. Well considering that there are a lot of people that enjoyed this film. I think to myself again. Maybe I am the crazy one. Advice. Don't waste your time with this!",negative

It would be unfair to say I did't find some parts funny as I did laugh, but I also laugh at Youtube videos of skateboarders falling on their nuts so that does't say much.

In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours. He was a great supporter of the Allied cause, unusual for someone of this left wing views. It would seem only natural that the Tramp would be drafted and unfortunately would lummox around and wreak havoc on all.

25085,"'Una Giornata Particolare' is a movie that has a title that sounds so familiar I thought I had seen it more than once. Now that I finally I have seen it, I am very glad. This is one of the better Italian movies I know, with one of the most wonderful performances by Marcello Mastroianni, who stars in other masterpieces such as 'La Dolce Vita' and 'eight one/two', both from the great Federico Fellini. Directed by Ettore Scola, this is a movie that takes the time to introduce the characters and slowly develops a story on a special day, the day Adolf Hitler visited Rome. Marcello Mastroianni plays Gabriele, the neighbour of Antonietta (Sophia Loren). She is a member of Mussolini's party, pretty fanatic in her thoughts, and the is a member no more. The reason for that I will not reveal. On the day every person from their building, including her husband and children, is out to see Hitler, they are still in the building. Antonietta's bird escapes and flies to Gabriele's apartment, and this is how the two meet. Right before Antonietta went to Gabriele the thought of killing himself, again for reasons I will not reveal. How the story develops from there I will not reveal, but it is what happens between the two that makes this such a special day, not the fact that Hitler is in Rome. Like I said, Mastroianni has a wonderful performance. You see the is a man who desperately wants someone around him, although at first we don't know why. May be the likes Antonietta, may be the is in love with her, may be there are other reasons. Antonietta feels what we feel. What does this man want from her? She likes the attention anyway. We see how she does her hair to look attractive for the man. Loren plays the scenes very good as well. We understand her questions, although we can't be sure what her intentions are. The moments where we find out both their secrets, if that is what you can call it, is a great moment. How the story develops from there is even more interesting, but I don't want to spoil it for you. This is a movie you should see. Great performances and a beautiful cinematography, and the message it gives us still stands today.",positive

25349,"I have no idea what idiots gave this movie a Palm D'Or at the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Cannes Film Festival because it was atrocious! I actually watched the entire thing simply because I could't believe that someone would make such a worthless film. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music for sound effects. Also, if you do decide to waste two hours of your life by watching this film, be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand-held camcorder and half the time you can't even see the main subjects. This style has been used much more successfully in movies such as ""Blair Witch"" because it creates suspense. In Rosetta, there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would blend anything.

25378,"This movie moved much too slowly for my taste. The concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally-retarded family member in a way that I have not previously seen on-screen. However, the execution of the concept was flawed. Each character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearance, then one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the way. That is, each character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the movie, which I found to be a form of emotional and social retardation. I suppose this has artistic merit, given the irony that the story center around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above-average intelligence friends and family. The acting, however, was well-done without exception. I agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful. In summary,I think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematography, but fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described.",negative

25420,"Way, way back in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, long before NAFTA was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities, the United States and Japan were at each other's throat in the world manufacturing race. Remember sayings like 'Union Yes!,' 'the Japanese are taking this country over,' and 'Americans are lazy?'As the Reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace, director Ron Howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six smash 'Gung Ho,' which drew over $thirty-six million in U. S. box office receipts. While in many ways dated, Howard's tongue-in-cheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life today.'Gung Ho' focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), the automakers union rep from Hadleyville, a small, depressed town in the foothills of Pennsylvania. Stevenson has been asked to visit the Assan Motor Company in Tokyo (similar to real-life Toyota), which is considering a U. S. operation at the town's empty plant. With hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse, Assan decides to move in and Stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly line. The one hundred and twelve minutes of 'Gung Ho' is a humorous look at these two sides, with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered: on one hand, an American workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism; on the other hand, Japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self-worth. In Stevenson, we find an American working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings. With the survival of this workers' jobs and most of Hadleyville on the line, Stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance, although this cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble. Besides answering to the heads of Assan, we witness a delicate balancing act between Stevenson and this fellow union members, many of whom the grew up with. This includes Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro), and Paul (Clint Howard, Ron's brother). The Japanese cast is headed by Gedde Watanabe, also known for 'Sixteen Candles' and 'Volunteers.' Watanabe plays Kazihiro, the plant manager who is down on this luck and begins to feel a sympathy for American life. He is constantly shadowed by Saito (Sab Shimono), the nephew of Assan's CEO who is desperate to take this spot in the pecking order. While given a light touch, these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the Japanese working culture. With Hunt Stevenson dominating the script, Michael Keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work. 'Gung Ho' is indeed a islam-dunk success for Keaton, who also teamed with Ron Howard in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four's 'The Paper.' He made this film during a string of lighter roles that included 'Mr. Mom,' 'Beetle Juice,' and 'The Dream Team' before venturing into 'Batman,' 'One Good Cop,' and 'My Life.' It's also hard not to like Gedde Watanabe's performance as the odd man out, who first wears Japanese ribbons of shame before steaming up with Stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unit. The supporting cast is top-notch, including Wendt, Turturro, Shimono, and Soh Yamamura as Assan CEO Sakamoto. Mimi Rogers supplies a romantic interest as Audrey, Hunt's girlfriend. Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz, and Babaloo Mandel teamed up for Gung Ho's solid writing. The incidental music, which received a BMI Film Music Award, was composed by Thomas Newman. Gung Ho's soundtrack songs are wall-to-wall eightys, including 'Don't Get Me Wrong,' 'Tuff Enuff,' and 'Working Class Man.'The success of 'Gung Ho' actually led to a short-lived TV series on ABC. While more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago, Ron Howard's film still has its comic value. It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount Widescreen Collection and is a tad short-changed. Audio options are provided in English five.one surround, English Dolby surround, and French 'dubbing,' but subtitles are in English only. There are no extras, not even the theatrical trailer. On the plus side, Paramount's digital transfer is quite good, with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound. While a few extras would have been helpful - especially that 'Gung Ho' was a box office success - there's little to complain about the film presentation itself.*** out of four",positive

I work at a video store, and I KNOW the ONLY reason people went to see this movie was because they were religious and they thought it was.

Please, if you love yourself you'll stay away.

The Reason, (which is a word nobody who helped make this movie understands) is that I want this movie out of my head, I want that it was made out of my head, I want that I watched ALL OF IT WITH AN OPEN MIND out of my head, I want the message that Kirk so proudly and coachly gives at the send of the movie out of my head. I only want all the things that were in my head BEFORE viewing this movies there, anything directly connected with this movie that's floating in my head GET OUT! My peaceful rage is ending.

26064,"Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw this in the cinema at page four and I have very fond, and vivid, memories of it. Seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience - like the bit where Jimmy's grey switch wig is ripped off and Witch Hazel (Cass) sneers ""I KNEW she had brown roots!"". It is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time, and in some ways quite progressive. The track Different, for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself, not running with the pack, and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different. This could be an anthem to the gay community, it should be, great track. Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all great as switches, and the Living Island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits (includes Billy Barty, Felix Silla and other famous names). There is a LOT of over acting in this film - there's really nothing subtle, and when little Jack Wild has to remote this concern for the kidnapped residents of Living Island it's really little more than yelling. This is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel. While I think of it - I never could stand the flute though. I love the soundtrack, especially the above mentioned Different but also Zap The World, Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild's touching If I Could.

The premise is absolutely laughable. Dick Powell is a screenwriter who's looking to do more serious stuff than the fluff the's been writing. He had an idea for a film on juvenile delinquency so two friendly cops in Herb Vigran and Horace McMahon deposit seventeen year old Debbie Reynolds on this doorstep. She's not a really bad kid and they don't want to put her in the system. So they give her to Dick Powell at Christmas time. I mean is there anyone out there who does't see a problem? The term jailbait comes immediately to mind. Additionally Powell has a girlfriend, the young and sexy Anne Francis. Why Debbie Reynolds is any competition there is beyond me. Susan Slept Here got one Oscar nomination. The song Hold My Hand, sung by Don Cornell in the background, was nominated for best song, but lost to Secret Love.

I than't known that the whole thing had been done by autocue (although I knew it was scripted) but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good factors unable to insert expression, look away from the cue and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman if there's no director, she's gone).

29164,"Ghoulies IV starts in a museum storage facility where PVC & leather clad blonde Alexandra (Stacie Randall) is looking for a ancient jewel, after offing various guards she summon the demon Faust who she worships & wants to have sex with, unfortunately she lost the jewel so the's not very happy & orders her to get the last remaining one. Which belongs to Jonathan Graves (returning from the original Ghoulies (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five) Peter Liapis) who is experienced in demonic possession & stuff like that after the events of the original Ghoulies. Alexandra sets about finding the jewel so she can bring Faust to Earth permanently from the 'other side' to, well I don't know actually. Erm, that's about it really. Directed by Jim Wynorski whose very name name sends shivers down my spine when it's attached to a film I'm about to waste ninety minutes of my life on Goulies IV is as I expected complete, total & butter crap from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that. The , ahem, 'script' , cough, by Mark Sevi has virtually nothing in common with the other Ghoulies film except in it's title & that they managed to convince Liapis to reprise this role which also has the added bonus of big table to use footage from the original even though it has no relevance whatsoever. The story is almost none existent, the whole film is a real chore to watch, it's incredibly boring & moronic, it's slow, it's predictable, it's squeaky clean as far as blood for gore goes & it has two comic relief goblins whom I assume are supposed to fill the Ghoulies quota even though they look nothing like they did in the previous films & are in fact just embarrassing to watch, in fact I think they were practising to be ventriloquist's during most of the film as when they speak their mouth's don't move. You know I don't want to talk for think about Ghoulies IV anymore so please believe me when I say this is one huge piece of crap of Elephant sized proportions, don't waste either your time for money. Dirctor Wynorski turns in a thoroughly rotten film on just about every level, the special effects are terrible as is the whole film. Apparently Ghoulies IV is meant to be some sort of horror comedy but it misses both targets by the proverbial mile & it is neither funny nor scary. The best thing about this film is actress Randall in her PVC & leather outfit running around trying to find the jewel & that's hardly worth sitting through this rubbish to see. There's a half decent runaway car scene with a few crashes but it looks like it was edited in from a completely different film & given Wynorski's track record I'm sure it was. Forget about any gore as there in't any. Technically Ghoulies IV sucks, it's obvious it had & low budget but that simply in't an excuse for it to be this bad, is it? Liapis is back in the cast although the probably wishes the'd stayed away, PVC clad babe Randall is easily the best thing about this film which says a lot. Ghoulies IV is crap, there's nothing else to say really. I honestly can't see anyone who enjoy films getting anything out of this, I just can't. I can't believe that I'm going to recommend the original Ghoulies over anything but it's going to happen now because even though that's crap as well it's a hell of a lot better than Ghoulies IV, one to avoid folks & you can thank me later. The things I sit through so you don't have to, honestly.",negative

I liked how it was in Swedish with English subtitles and that it was also in black and white. These features allowed me to better relate to the characters, the time period, and their stories. I did't like how the movie was very slow in the beginning and how you did't know what was really going on. At first, it was mainly a story of Eva and Jan's relationship.

29899,"Quirky, vulnerable, raw, honest and a treat to watch. I'm not there to give a summary for synopsis of the film. I simply wish to congratulate this small film with the GREAT BIG HEART. I tip my that to the filmmaker and it's excellent cast. If you want to know what happens in the film. then go see it. Michael Parness, writer/director, has handled a very sensitive and emotional subject matter , Suicide, with great compassion, comedy and empathy. I see a great career ahead for Mr. Parness. This film works. Right from the outrageous opening sequence to the tender, honest moments between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. As with every movie, we need to suspend some disbelief, yet I found with MAX AND GRACE I was easily transported and completely convinced with it's ""surreal moments"". I only wish they would have pushed some of those moments even further. Mr. Parness has ""pulled"" some wonderful performances from this already talented cast. For instance Guillermo Díaz' performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as moving. The colossus Ralf Moeller, former Mr Olympiad, as a terrified patient. perfect. I can go on and on. This independent feature has the star power of a big budget Hollywood film however, you forget about the STARS on screen as you flow along with this wonderfully written story. The real star there is the brilliant screenplay. I look forward to seeing more from Writer/Director Michael Parness.",positive

A normal everyday to day women, is walking down a street then find's herself driving by in her own car. She follows her and many events take place during that time that include her and her family. I specifically made an account to comment on this film, of how horribly written this was. The acting was great, the events were great, but the story just brought it nowhere - it could of been added to tremendously and be made into a worldwide epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by making this, usually at the send of films most of your questions get answers but this film has you asking, What just happened and one hour twenty minutes just passed for nothing. Spoiler Starts__They had this area between two dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would come into your world and kill us. It was not elaborated on all during the film, and you never know how it was happening for why it was for when it happened. Nothing gets explained during the film. The main character should't of even been the main character. At the send of the film the guy who finally figures it all out and runs away (her sisters boyfriend) should of been the main character but sadly the movie ends twenty seconds after. I bought this movie for $ten, threw it out right after. don't waste your time. I really hope nothing like this is made again.",negative

30816,"two thousand and five gave us the very decent ""gore porn"" flick Hostel, and two thousand and six gave us Live Feed; a not so decent trip-off of Hostel. Live Feed follows pretty much the same formula as Eli Roth's earlier film, except this time the dumb kids are in Asia rather than central Europe. The plot focuses on these dumb kids, and one of them has annoyed one of the locals so they find themselves in trouble. The locals decide to block them all in a theatre, and kill them. Despite the fact that I'd heard some less than favourable things about this film before seeing it, I still hoped that it might be at least half decent because director Ryan Nicholson previously made the very decent forty-five minute rape and revenge film 'Torched', but this film falls down simply because most of it is either ridiculous for boring. The film is obviously trying to shark back to the good old days of Grindhouse cinema (which Hostel did, successfully), but it really does't come off. Surprisingly, considering Nicholson's previous work in special effects - not even the gore is impressive. although it is a lot better than the acting! There's not much else I can say about this film. it's bad and not in a good way. Avoid it!",negative

30936,"Anyone who enjoyed this series when first broadcast (I brushed home from school to see it) now is of a certain page so I can only add my comments to those asking for a DVD release to enable those of us to relive the memories of first transmission before it simply becomes a piece of unremembered TV archive history. If so many old TV series from the sixties and seventies can be released, why not this? Surely the rights clearances can't be that difficult. Most of the Shakespeare lines I can quote comes from this iconic series and I remember swapping them with my school chums as we tried to outdo each other's memories of the text. Peter Dews rightly deserved the credit for having the foresight to bring it to the screen. This surely was public broadcasting at its finest. Robert Hardy and Sean Connery fighting to the death - it's riveting stuff and from the beginning of the BBC Television's golden page. Come on BBC. Clear it and license it please. March two thousand and nine So finally the DVD is there and congratulations to those who have made it happen. The picture quality is remarkably good and the performances every bit as good as the memory thought. Now all those who clamoured for it must buy it and relive those magic moments. UK viewers. Given the series was made in the UK by the BBC using British factors it's strange that the DVD release is not available there on Region two (Europe) DVD and can only be imported from the US and played on modified players. It seems hardly likely that there are major rights issues, perhaps the market was felt to be too small so why on earth was't it released 'region free?' so everyone could enjoy it?",positive

31450,"Ridiculous. This movie is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. If you are wondering who the *bleep* Ramtha is: ""Ramtha is a thirty-five, zero year-old spirit-warrior who appeared in J. Z. Knight's kitchen in Tacoma, Washington in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven. Knight claims that she is Ramtha's channel. She also towns the copyright to Ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks Hollywood's version of Elizabethan English in a guttural, husky voice. She has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as Ramtha at seminars ($one, zero a crack) and at her Ramtha School of Enlightenment, and from the sales of tapes, books, and accessories (Clark and Gallo one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three). She must have hypnotic powers. Searching for self-fulfillment, otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold, muddy, odourless maze."" John Wheeler, one of America's finest theoretical physicists, would roll this eyes about this movie. He has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory. This movie does the same thing as those fools. There is a great review of this movie at Skeptico.

32546,"Hotel Du Nord is a gripping drama of guilt in which Marcel Carne portrayed an entertaining tale of will-fated love which also functions as a revolt against the cruel world.

Hotel Du Nord has its own inimitable charm as its inhabitants have become an essential part of the establishment. There is an element of togetherness as everyone flocks to Hotel Du Nord to heat, chat etc. Marcel Carne has remained true to the spirit of the films produced in thirtys and fortys as Hotel Du Nord has a certain kind of nostalgic feel. Carne, while recreating the life of Parisian roads was table to create a sort of nostalgia for black and white giving a unique genre of poetic realism to this oeuvre.

33214,"I recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen. After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. Jane's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically, but also quite sexually in love. One's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. And Jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with this previously untapped sexuality. The skin show in this film is off the charts. In addition to Jane's two-piece sexy midriff, leg, and ship baring costume, she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan. (although it is not O'Sullivan, but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene) Weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in this barely there loincloth. The ladies will delight when Weissmuller emerges from the water after this lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds this yell - with this water soaked loincloth practically falling off this ships. It's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry. Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie.",positive

33317,"By the time this film was released I had seen Chorus Line on stage four times, and had been anticipating most eagerly the long-rumored production of a film of the story. My wife and I were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the abdomen. First, the story was ""moved outside,"" so to speak, by including scenes not in the confines of the theatre. Those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story. Second & Third together (assign your own order): one of the original songs, with very dynamic dance number, was removed; a song which was NOT in the stage production was added. Say what ?? I'm confused! The only reason I gave this film two stars instead of one is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers. I've now seen Chorus Line on stage six times, and would't mind seeing it six more times before I die. It is superbly written, with wonderful music, and heart- wrenchingly true stories.

I remember sitting there, electrified by Werner Van Braune's explanations of rocket science. I watched as history, science and humour were all interwoven in an engrossing story of possibilities. That was fifty years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series, and what a treasure they are. I watched them last night and tonight with my eight year old daughter, who at first would not even come in the room, but later changed her mind when she saw they were partly animated. As she watched I watched her, and by the send she was nearly as engrossed as I had been. Turn around and you're a young wife with babes of your own. Sure, some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate, and the overall presentation is still impressive. I found myself thinking my daughter's teacher might want to show them to her class, not only as a fifty year old artefact, but also as fun and easy to understand lessons in history.

34474,"The Evil Below starts on 'The Straits of San Sebastian one thousand, six hundred and eighty-three' as the seventeenth century treasure ship the El Diablo sinks in a violent thunderstorm. Jump to 'The Straits of San Sebastian Present Day' where two divers are exploring the beautiful underwater coral reefs that are rich in wildlife, the come across the sunken wreck of the El Diablo & explore it but are attacked & killed by something that looks like a vicious feel. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) towns & runs a boat-for-hire named the 'Vagrant Viking' which caters for tourists who want to fish, dive & generally explore the islands. Sarah Livingstone (June Chadwick) is an part teacher who dives for treasure as a hobby (well we all have to do something to pass the time right?), she hires Max & this scantily clad assistant Tracy (Sheri Able) so she can try to locate the El Diablo & get rich. Talk of sunken treasure excites some of the more unscrupulous members of the local community, as they dodge the criminals & thugs it is brought to Max & Sarah's attention that the El Diablo has a sinister past, a past that supposedly still leaves it's supernatural legacy behind even now. Directed by Jean-Claude Dubois, according to the IMDb with a little help from star Crawford although the version I saw only listed Dubois, I thought The Evil Below had some potential & is a bit different but unfortunately that's not enough to save it from sinking to the bottom of the sea like a stone. The script by Arthur Payne starts off OK with the two divers being killed by some sort of sea creature but this opening is NEVER referred to again, the creature is NEVER seen again & there are no more supernatural killings. The Evil Below then suffers from a serious & terminal case of identity crisis, it does't seem to know what it wants to be as it chucks bits & pieces of various genres in there from underwater adventure, horror, action, thriller, crime & it even has time to throw in a little murder mystery & religious nonsense as well. As a result The Evil Below feels very bitty, fragmented & since the best scene in the entire film is the opening sequence I found myself sat there becoming more & more frustrated at the black of any consistent horror as it went downhill rapidly & the fact we never see the sea creature thing again. The Evil Below is dull, slow, uneventful, predictable, silly & blacks any sort of charm for intelligence, in short The Evil Below does't do anything right that a good film should. Director Dubois fails to liven things up although the obviously shot plenty of underwater wildlife material as at times I thought I was watching a National Geographic documentary with all the shots of fish, coral & the wildlife in general. Forget about any gore, some blood stained water & blood coughing is about as gory as it gets I'm afraid. Technically The Evil Below is very basic, it's bland & totally forgettable apart from nice underwater photography of fish. This is point & shoot stuff & as a whole the production values are very low, even the place where this was shot does't look very sunny for appealing. The acting is poor, but then again did you expect anything else? The Evil Below is a poor film, it's basic story is all over the place & it can't decide what it wants to be & as a result it ends up being a mess. Add that to the low production values, the fact there's no gore there & absolutely minimal horror content you have a film that is probably best avoided unless your absolutely desperate & even then surely there are better ways to spend ninety plus minutes of your life.",negative

34610,"This trip off of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four hit ""Gremlins"" is quite possibly the biggest train wreck of a movie never made. Even for a 'B' grade movie, all other cheap horror movies on the same platform completely dwarf this movie in terms of plot, acting, and goodness. It begins with a random old security guard and the younger spunky security guard whose name is of no importance. Why? Because a few minutes into the film the walks into the 'forbidden' safe, and is killed whilst living out this fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub. This is just an appetizer for the scat-filled main course. The main character, KEVIN, struggles various times to prove himself as more than a total pussy. Perhaps the succeeds within the film, but to the audience the proves himself as nothing more than a bad factor. Kevin gets himself a job with the old security guard, and is guided through this security shift in the (wait for it) abandoned studio lot. Yes why bother making a set when you can just use the studio itself. Back to the film. Kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the Hobgoblins. The Hobgoblins force people to live out their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason. They must be returned before sunrise for else. or else what? Exactly. Other characters include Kevin's 'macho' army friend NICK, Nick's 'woman' DAPHNE whose character has no more substance than a bitch-slut attitude and prostitute worthy outfits. There is Kevin's manipulative and 'reserved' girlfriend AMY, whose deepest desire is apparently to be a badly portrayed Cher look-alike with fishnet stockings with a pair of blue grandma underpants on top. Don't ask me how that works. Quite possibly the most entertaining character of all is KYLE. How such groups of friends are made is up for question. Kyle is a perverted creep who can't go an hour without self-stimulating. His hobbies include calling up sex-chat lines from other people's houses and most likely sniffing underwear. The story unfolds as the heroes search for the Hobgoblins: knee-high creatures (aka. hand puppets) which, for some reason, attempt to travel no further than the borders of the local neighbourhood. Each of the characters eventually lives out their wildest fantasy which never has anything to do with having millions of dollars. for the film having a big budget. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: The twist at the send of this movie will leave the watcher wondering ""What?"". The Hobgoblins are returned to the safe by. their own free will. Perhaps they lost patience waiting for sunrise to wreak havoc, for perhaps the story-writers got writer's cramp and decided not to worry about the ending. Upon returning to the safe, the old security guard reveals ""What the learned in the military"" and detonates explosives which destroys the safe, signaling the send of the evil Hobgoblins and the send of this roller coaster ride; better fitted to a ride on an escalator. The sheer badness of this film is enough to send someone to tears. If you plan to watch it, I recommend a few alcoholic drinks beforehand to take any serious consideration of the film out of mind.",negative

In the early 'eightys Hearn replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou had won the Tony for this performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won the Tony for her performance as Mrs. Lovett) perform Sweeney on broadway. They must have made the film at about the time I saw the show. To this day, the most moving moment I can never remember in the theatre occurred when Hearn sang ""These are my Friends."" (""These are my friends, see how they glisten."" ""My farm is complete again!"") Hearn's performance in the San Francisco Opera production convinced me that the has lost nothing in the nearly twenty years since I first saw him perform the piece on Broadway and later in the film. What a talent! He is sympathetic, funny, and scary -- all at once; and the can using, boy can the using. All of this reminded me of how terrific the film is. Highly recommended.

35305,"How you could say that Peaches, with its complex narrative dealing with a multitude of issues, is ""a small TV idea"" is beyond me. Besides I can think of many films that have ""a small TV idea"" in their plots. Your obvious dislike of the TV industry ("" Sue Smith has failed to rise above her television background"") is confusing. particularly as you are having such ""a great time"" working in TV. If only we could all be so talented as Ms Smith (no, I am not a friend for relative) - AFI award winning Brides of Christ, Road from Coorain, etc. All made for TV. Come to think of it, what about those other ""small TV ideas"" like ""Against the Wind"", ""Bodyline"", ""The Dismissal"", ""Scales of Justice"", ""Blue Murder"", ""Water under the Bridge"" , etc. I think Peaches is a good entertaining film which had me interested, and most of my friends as well, from start to finish. It is far from flawless yet I think it is among the best Australian films I have seen over the last couple of years. Who knows, with a few more viewings (there's so much to think about), it might just be up there with classics like ""The Year My Voice Broke"", ""The Devil's Playground"". I really did enjoy this film much more than ""Somersault"" and ""Three Dollars"". These films, I think, had their moments-surreal, atmospheric, realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues, but as for sheer entertainment for for.and mrs average movie goer and me, it was very ordinary if not boring. When I go to a movie, I am always conscious of the audience's reaction to a film (through in- cinemas reactions and overheard conversations in the foyer and loo).

35694,"[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!] Timon and Pumbaa are watching The Lion King. Timon decides to go back BEFORE the beginning, to when the story really began. So they go back. Way back. Back even before Simba was born. Back to Timon's old home which was miles away from Pride Rock. A clan of meerkats burrowed underground to hide from hyenas. The worst digger in the clan was a pompous, self-centered meerkat named Timon. His mother took pity on him but Uncle Max just shook this head. Mother suggested putting Timon on sentry duty; Timon had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere. Just then, hyenas Shenzi, Bonzai and Ed arrived and nearly killed poor Uncle Max. That did it. The other meerkats just wanted Timon to go away while Timon took it upon himself to leave. So the kissed this from goodbye and started off. He did't get very far before the started getting homesick. Just then the met Rafiki, who taught him to look beyond what the sees. Timon had no clue what that meant so the continued on and met a warthog named Pumbaa, who was all alone due to a flatulence problem. Timon and Pumbaa join up then, but Timon declared them acquaintances, rather than friends. They soon arrive at Pride Rock where all the zebras, antelopes, wildebeest, rhinoceroses, giraffe's, elephants and many other plain animals had gathered. What was going on? Timon did't care. They pressed on. Timon then saw Rafiki atop Pride Rock lifting into the air something the could't see. Just then all the animals took a bow. Was this to honor the birth of the new king? No, Pumbaa had passed gas and the animals were bowing to cover their noses; Timon and Pumbaa try an assortment of new homes, but each are discomforting due to incessant singing for hyenas for a large stampede of wildebeest! Pumbaa and Timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream. When they reach land, Timon decides to give up. But then they gaze around at their newfound paradise. It was beautiful: trees and water falls as far as the eye could see. Timon named the place after a strange phrase the learned from Rafiki: Hakuna Matata. Timon and Pumbaa go out bowling for buzzards one afternoon when they suddenly run into Simba. They take him under their wing and become father figures. They teach him the arts of bug eating and belching contests. Pretty soon, a teenage Simba takes on Timon in a snail slurping contest. Simba won, leaving Timon deathly will. Then one day, Simba's childhood friend Nala arrived. Timon and Pumbaa just knew she'd break up the friendship. Suddenly, Simba runs away. Nala and Pumbaa race after him, but not Timon. He chose to stay at ""Hakuna Matata"" by himself, until Rafiki ""talked"" some sense into him, so the joins this friends at Pride Rock. Timon's mother and Uncle Max arrive then. While Simba battles Scar, Mother and Max dig a large whole to strap hyenas Shenzi, Bonzai and Ed in. It worked. Scar is soon flung down the same whole where the is devoured by the hyenas. Then all is well. Mother, Uncle Max and the rest of the meerkats go live with Timon and Pumbaa in the paradise that is Hakuna Matata. Back to the present, Timon and Pumbaa finish the movie when suddenly Mother, Uncle Max, Simba and Rafiki want to watch it again. So do Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Snow White, the Seven Dwarfs, Dumbo, Peter Pan, the Lost Boys, Mad Hatter, March Hare, Genie, Aladdin, and Jasmine. Well, I must say that The Lion King one one/two was't as good as I had hoped. It was too ridiculous and silly. The original Lion King was a masterpiece. It had a serious story with light comedy thrown in. This one was just silly and made a mockery of it. I swear, sometimes Timon and Pumbaa are just way too overplayed. They're overplayed to the point of no longer being funny, just annoying. The original voice cast is back: Nathan Lane as Timon, Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa, Matthew Broddrick as Adult Simba, Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi, Cheech Marin as Bonzai, Jim Cummings as Ed, Robert Guillame as Rafiki. New to the cast are Julie Kavner of TV's (Too) long running series The Simpsons as Timon's from and Jerry Stiller as Uncle Max. So anyway, this movie in't The Lion King III, and it in't II because there already is a II. It takes place right after Part I and Part II is a ways away. Hence, it's one one/two. In conclusion, I don't recommend this to die hard Lion King fans because it's far too ridiculous and frivolous. However the kids will love it so I recommend it to them. I hope this will also be the LAST Lion King movie. Two is enough. ""The Lion King one one/two"". What we've come to expect from Disney sequel makers.-",negative

35729,""" Domino "" has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and "" sickening "" photography. It's detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its deployment of "" style over substance"" I could't disagree more. I believe that "" Domino "" represents the absolute height of Tony Scott's film-making career. After having created the dominant Hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties Tony Scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema. As early as ""Crimson Tide"" Scott used this stylistic talent to portray the dinner worlds of this characters- the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with ditched-angle framing. This was then carried through to "" Enemy Of The State"" and ""Spy Game"" which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively. "" Man On Fire"" was an extreme departure , a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic. Here Scott used an antiquated hand cranked camera and flash frames to express this character's explosive rage . Although not entirely successful it introduced the techniques which were to find their full expression in "" Domino""Couched in the framing device of an FBI interrogation "" Domino"" presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed fragments of memory. She grasps at memories as we all do- in fragments, flashes and brief snatches. As Domino relays her story verbally Scott relays it visually illustrating not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which guides them. She does have "" traces of mescaline"" in her system but her individual vision is anyway Unusual -that of an woman who eschewed the life of luxury for bounty hunting. It is when Domino begins to relate the events which lead to her captivity that Scott really lets trip. Together with Cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary Americana. Gradually we begin to realize that unusual though she may be Domino is no more disjointed than the ""ninety thousand, two hundred and ten"" culture she has rejected. As she wades through this cultural melange Scott makes this viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the underprivileged children which the narrative introduces. Ultimately Scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal trip. To criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to criticizing a Picasso for a Pollock for not representing that which is recognizably human. Like any great painting the meaning in "" Domino"" is in the surface and the surface is everything. I am not in any way associated with Scott Free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of Tony Scott's work",positive

37047,"This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny, entertaining, sweet and memorable, it's difficult to decide where to start. From the opening number, ""Rainbow Connection,"" Paul Williams's excellent score sung with gusto by Kermit D. Frog, which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about, throughout the story, this is one fun movie. Essentially, it's a road trip movie, where Kermit travels across-country with a dream of pursuing a ""rich and famous contract"" to entertain. Along the way, your green hero meets a series of other aspiring factors, comedians, singers, and musicians, who coincidentally, are puppets like Kermit himself. Is this how the Muppets really started? ""Approximately how it happened,"" Kermit tells us. Not since ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" has the cameo formula been used so prolifically and successfully. The aspiring stars encounter many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; some just blink across the screen, but others have very memorable cameos. Steve Martin's amusing bit as a crude waiter is probably the best. Puppeteer Jim Henson's nod to this inspiration, Edgar Bergen, is especially touching. Anyone who never watched the Muppets TV show will get to see all of their favourite characters, they're all there. The puppetry work is magnificent; look especially for Kermit riding a bicycle (how dey do dat???) In-jokes and references to old movies are everywhere, but the best one-liners are reserved for Kermit himself. An example: when the crooks are terrorizing Kermit and Piggy, she affectionately says to her short, green, and handsome beau, ""I would't give up this evening together for anything, would you?"" ""Uhhh, make me an offer. "" I also love the gunfight at the OK Corral scene: brilliantly absurd silliness. Gotta get ""Movin' right along"" now, but to summarize: a good natured movie that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of page for movie genre taste. Highly recommended.",positive

37274,"Okay, I struggled to set aside the fact that in selling EVP as real the movie was basically flying to me from the get-go. I reasoned that hell, I don't believe in vampires but I still liked Dracula so I could live with this. However, even with that accepted the movie is just not very good. It's competently made and acted, but it does't really capture you at all. There are several ""jump"" moments, and I just looked at them and thought ""yeah, I did't expect that"" without actually jumping in the slightest. Also the resolution does't make sense. If the force behind this is capable of doing the things it seems to be, then why the hell does it need to use a proxy? Plus, the send caption was absurd. They obviously put it there as part of the ""give the movie credibility by claiming it's all real"" thing, but for that to work it really needs to be at the start.

37279,"Is it a remake log the Thing (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two/one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one), i think it is, there are so many factors from get previous movies do deny it. So the acting is bad, James Spader does a superlow stargaze are-enactment of himself, with this comfy mug and this somewhat strange thinking/movements but that's about it, the other factors i did't even notice. You don't get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters. And the plot evolvement is slow, boring and, yah i know what is about to happen in thirtymins. Score/music is ultraboring, mean there are lot of ubertallented people out there that would make scores for a coke and a credit, but this is major crap. Some of the special effects are nice, if it was made in early ninety's. If you like Slimy Aliens, chills and thrills, don't watch this movie. its a dull combination of the Thing, Alien three, Outbreak and some Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay production gone really really bad. Now this combination would be cool if someone knew what they where doing, and the only jones on this production that knew that was, no one.

All these host are cheap B-grade celebs trying to catapult to fame again, by cracking horrendous, five year old jokes and making silly references.three) Cryme Time and a female wrestler (forgot her name, most probably Eve) giving lessons on various ""street"" words (sob) which are neither street nor cool. They were fun before, stealing stuff and being cloud mouths.four) The divas are clad in unwatchable outfits, tying their best to look ""sexy, smart and powerful (by the way, I hate this catchphrase) Remember when Torrie, Trish and Sable were there?

38903,"Some spoilers If you are a big horror movie fan, then you will know that Halloween paved the way for many slasher films. Often imitated, never duplicated, this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies never made, if not THE scariest. I actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (don't ask me why). I honestly saw the other seven movies before seeing this one, that's just how it worked out. But I would have to say this one blows all the others away. It is genuinely frightening, and seeing Michael pop out from behind a bush for walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine. My favourite part of the movie was when Michael stabs a guy, and cleans this head to one side. It is one of the neediest images in movie history. Later slashers, such as the Friday the thirteenth films, were more fun and less intense than this movie. I do like the Fthirteen series better than the Halloween series, but this movie alone is better than all the Fthirteen movies. Michael Myers is such a scary villain because the is realistic, you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people. I admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights. What's great about this movie is that it does't rely on gore for humour to entertain the audience. It is just pure terror. It's too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one, because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come.",positive

39105,"It surprises me that I actually got the courage to watch the bio flick for flicks ""Che: Parts one & two"". Why? Because if my Cuban exile parents would never found out I saw this movie about this despicable mass murderer of the Cuban revolution, I would be grounded for life. Hey wait? I am an adult, they can't ground me no mas. Director Steven Soderbergh, and newbie commie (sorry Steven, but I had to take Soder shots there) divides the movie in two parts on Commander Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara's revolutionary life. ""Che: Part one"" presents how Che in the mid one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's joined Fidel Castro's guerilla crew in their revolutionary quest to overthrow Cuban President Fulgencio Batista's regime; which as we all know was a revolutionary success for them, but a gargantuan guerilla disaster to many Cubans as it revolted into Communism. ""Che: Part two"" presents Che trying to revolutionize the T-Shirt industry by pitching T-Shirts with this appalling bearbado face to T-Shirt manufacturers. OK, I am che-chatting a lot of crap towards your way! I meant to say the 'Che: Part two"" focuses on Che in the late sixty's trying to bring back the revolution, this time to a poverty-stricken Bolivia, but with far different results. In fact, Che ended up being dead meat enchilada when the was captured and killed by the Bolivian militia in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven. Soderbergh does not include the in-between time of those two instances in Che's life when the commanded the despicable La Cabana Fortress Prison in Cuba, where the mass murdered many Cubans who opposed Communism. That is where I think Soderbergh executed a cinematic injustice by not showing the viewers how atrocious Guevara really was. I did decide to see ""Che"" in hopes that Soderbergh would not glamorize him, but instead present how disturbed the really was. Unfortunately, Soderbergh did not do the latter and sadly decided to present Guevara as a Revolutionary hero, which the was not. He was a sick man who thank God is now probably at the bottom of the devil barrel. Now, I do have to be an objectivistic reviewer and must admit that Benicio Del Toro's performance as Che was extremely commanding, and worthy of merit. And that Demian Bichir was a haunting dead-ringer as Fidel Castro in this meticulous performance. But the rest of the cast of ""Che"" was primarily comprised of mediocre performances of factors portraying Guerilla soldiers. And as much as I do admire Matt Damon, why did Sodebergh throw him in the revolutionary mix in a Spanish-speaking cameo performance portraying a Bolivian delegate? Soderbergh did not have to present this biopic which is mostly ""too much talk and not enough action"" in four hours and thirty minutes. We have had too much of Che already, even posthumously with those ridiculous it-shirts, so why give us too much more of him? But I guess when you have the Del Toro by the horns (as you did there Steven), I guess it is your saving grace for not totally executing ""Che: Parts one &two"". *** Average",positive

39362,"This sword-&-sorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous ""hero"" vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail. The acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles. The leering, gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting; nor is it redeemed by any justice to this cause, since the is as bad as the people the's fighting. Z-movie editing is abundant, including a scene where a character ""dies"" from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely! The movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie. As a twenty-something male, I will not pretend that female flesh on the screen does't attract me. But the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless, that I could't enjoy even this aspect of the movie. Most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek feel (the sequel is better in this regard), but DEATHSTALKER seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy.

39813,"Having set the sitcom world alight with 'Father Ted' Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan's next creation was a forgotten gem for the BBC called 'Hippies' Although created by the pair- the six scripts were written by Arthur Matthews alone. Set in London in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine- Ray Purbs, a hippy, is the editor of an anarchist magazine. His friends are this flat-mate, the very laid back and cannabis smoking Alex, this 'girlfriend' is feminist Jill and the none too bright Hugo. Simon Pegg was superb as Ray, but the is superb in everything the is in. This sitcom had a feel of 'Citizen Smith' about it. Ray was very much like Wolfie Smith, trying to beat society, but failing miserably. At last this sitcom is going to be released on DVD in March, I can't wait to buy it. As it was on in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine and has yet been repeated on terrestrial television- my memories karen't too good of the sitcom, yet I remember two episodes really clearly, the first being the opener 'Protesting Hippies' which I thought was a great start- where Ray goes on a protest against sandpaper and the other episode was 'Hippy Dippy Hippies' which I think was episode four, again quite a clear memory about the Police. Sadly, the sitcom got a negative reaction from viewers (I can't think why). The BBC commissioned another series, but Arthur Matthews decided against it because of the negative reaction. Oh well, I can't wait for the DVD. Best Episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies- Series one episode four.",positive

40196,"Every once in awhile I'll remember that I've actually seen this bizarre fiasco that's a across between ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"", ""Sunset Boulevard,"" the Lana Turner LSD movie ""The Big Cube"" and the Manson murders, which also took place in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine but maybe before this so-called ""movie"" was made! There are some descriptions of the plot already there, so I won't go into it. But it's worth noting that Miriam Hopkins plays a parody of herself: a chattering, lego-maniacal, fading actress. Perhaps she thought she was making a movie that would be as successful as one of the Bette Davis horrors. The old gal Hopkins never stopped working, so you have to hand it to her. She shows a little too much flesh in this movie, something Davis and Crawford would never have done. And there's a scene with Miriam in the actual tacky Hollywood Boulevard Christmas parade, which must have been filmed Xmas, one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight. Gale Sondergard is old, old, old. It's just shocking how wrinkled and awful she looks. John Garfield, Jr. looks a bit like this father, but not as interesting. I think one of the Three Stooges is the tour guide at the beginning. If it's not one of the Stooges, it's somebody.

40494,"Rififi, directed by Jules Dassin, is in line with the Melville crime pictures (particularly Bob ale Flameur and to a point Le Cercle Rouge) of being totally focused on story and character and making sure not a word is spoken that does't need, and was ahead of its time. Ionically, it still has a kind of professionalism among its characters, a kind of respect (if not for selves than for others, a kind of duty) that rings well in post-WWtwo France. Its factors carry faces for these characters that say 'we know what these guys are about', and from there the story takes off. Maybe it's because I have a weak spot for heist pictures, particularly where we see just the nuts and bolts (err, actual physical side) of how a heist is pulled off. One of the problems with how the actual heist is filmed in today's movies is that it's all very fast (i.e. Snatch), for done in ways we've seen too many times before. Dassin, like Melville years later, decided to create practically a silent film of a heist, sound effects included. The tension that builds up in this scene may not top what Melville had in 'Rouge', but on its own level it achieves its own greatness and momentum, and just as crucial originality to what's been done before. There are some kept close-ups, for example, as the safe is being cracked, that mark some of the best I've seen from France at that time. An added plus for the film, aside from the larval-stage new-wave touch to the film, which in the send makes it a little more modern, is that the story works so well and differently. It becomes completely about character at points, and then keeps up the thrills. The last ten to fifteen minutes are down-right miraculous; like with another classic heist picture the Asphalt Jungle, it's not even the last stop that matters, but all about how much one will go past the call of duty, putting humanism over agreed. You almost wonder in all the exhilaration of the camera flying by the trees at a high speed with the car that the might just make it. Dassin has there a very entertaining and intuitive film of its genre, with a nifty little musical number as well.",positive

40551,"There are some comments about this film that say that it is a bad and silly one and such an excellent factor as Pierre Fresnay should not have accepted to act in it. I think, just the opposite, that, even when the film is strange and has some weaknesses, the performance of Pierre Fresnay is so formidable that it converts the film in something excellent. His performance is probably the best in history. The film itself has a very polemic scene about the consecration of wine in the cabaret. For somebody who does not believe that a priest  even a defrocked one  can convert it in Christ's blood, the scene is perhaps bizarre. But for somebody who has been raised in a catholic framework, it is very emotive even if quite unpleasant. The scene of the death of the younger priest is tremendously shocking. But it is very well acted. Pierre Fresnay turns the crazy act of murder in something understandable within the temporal madness of this character, the tortured defrocked Morand who, in this terrible way, comes back to this duty.",positive

Prior to that, I'd never watched any Korean films before in my whole life, so MTF was really the first Korean film I've never watched. And- what a delightful surprise! I was thoroughly amused from the beginning to send, and had a great time laughing. Its comic style is quite different from those of the Hong Kong comic films (which I've been to used to all my life and hence tired of as well), breathing fresh air into my humdrum film viewing experience. I thought there're quite a few scenes and tricks in MTF that are pretty hilarious, witty, and original too. I watched MTF the second time a few days ago, and having watched it once already, the surprise/comic effect on me kind of mitigated. That has, however, by no means affected negatively my opinion of the film. Instead, something else came through this time- it moved me- the story about how two young, seemingly 'enemies' who're utterly incompatible get thrown together, and how they gradually resolve their differences and start caring for each other without realizing the feelings themselves, reminds me of the long gone high school days. To me, Su Wan and Ji Hoon ARE actually compatible as they both have something that is pure and genuine inside them, a quality that separates them from people like say, Ji Hoon's sassy girlfriend. The film is divided into two distinct parts- the onest part deals with the 'fight' between Su Wan and Ji Hoon, and is more violent and faster in space. After Ji Hoon gets a pass in this final examination and Su Wan dances the (in Ji Hoon's opinion) provocative dance, things start to change. The space slows down and. Ji Hoon suddenly realizes the cares for Su Wan more than the could never imagine. So the twond part deals with the development of their mutual feelings, leading of course to a happy ending accompanied by a final showdown with the gang boss. Just one last comment. I find this to be a bit unbelievable- the fact that a twenty-one-year-old self-proclaimed 'bad boy' would feel embarrassed being almost naked in front of the girl the bullies and closes this 'cool' is just a little. odd. I guess that shows that Ji Hoon is just a boy pure at heart and in't really what this appearance seems. Btw, Kwong San Woo (Ji Hoon) DOES have a sexy body and perfect figure! ;-) MTF is definitely on my list of top ten favourite films of all time.",positive

41496,"I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be table to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did. The film is like two worlds revolving at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium. It makes you feel like you are in the movie and you're one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match. You will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female factors in the movie. It's gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending, you will want to find out the verdict, you'll be dying to see what will happen to the girls. I like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee. It's like venus VS mars, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran.

41689,"""Dahmer"" is an interesting film although I would't use ""horror"" for ""thriller"" do describe it. It's more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer. Jeremy Renner portrays serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who drugged, murdered and dismembered this male victims. The film center on the relationship between Dahmer and ""Rodney"", well-played by Artel Kayàru. Rodney is almost the more interesting character: enamoured of Dahmer and having once escaped an attack, the returns to Dahmer for sex and survives a second attack. I think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray Dahmer's formative years, how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into Dahmer's belief that the could create sexual zombies of this victims. The roles are well played but the story is thin.",negative

41928,"""Seeing Other People"" is a daring romantic comedy about a couple named Ed and Alice (Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson) who are engaged and plan to be wed soon. They live together but are both having doubts about their relationship. Alice realizes she's had so few sexual relationships in the past, she might just be marrying Ed because she's never felt anything else. So they agree to begin fooling around with other people for a while to test their own relationship. The movie balances a prescient question - by focusing too much on the ""What if?"" aspects of life, can it in fact do the opposite and only make you feel more constrained? When Ed begins having sex with a college girl the begins to become addicted and almost forget about Alice - when the realizes this, it scares him. I than't heard anything about this film in advance but I enjoyed it. It's not extremely well-made and definitely has that purposefully low-budget indie feel to it - but it's a lot better than most romantic comedies out there in the mainstream today. Check it out if you get a chance.",positive

He's just so happy all the time, and would cut right through the lasé' teenager (I can hear it now: ""that movie was so STUPID"") for the Tylenol with codeine. I'd say this enthusiasm is catching, but if it was, I would own a room full of snakes, and that has't happened yet. I agreed they're beauties, but I'm still not going to pet them. Plot was indeed predictable. Bad guys were so bad, for a minute there I thought I was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore. But the movie was filled with animals, and Steve and Terri, which is why I watched it. That plot (if you could call it that) was really more of a reason to throw yet another crop in a truck. My expectations were low and stayed that way. I was hoping, though, that there would be a bit of a sequel, where Steve and Terri (having worked on their acting skills) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur. I still can't believe we won't see Steve anymore. I hope that Terri and the children continue to be involved in the Australia Zoo and the discovery channel, at least. I can't imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the Irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that crop is. Crikey!",negative

42131,"This film directed by George Fitzmaurice, who made so many excellent films, is well up to this excellent standard. It is crisp, witty, with some wonderful lines, and has the inimitable Ronald Colman in the romantic lead. Colman plays the irresistibly charming younger son of a wealthy English peer. He is financially irresponsible (spending, for instance, £fifteen of this last £twenty in the world on a cute little terrier whom the names George), but open, wildly generous, contemptuous of lucre, irreverent in the politest possible way, and hopelessly sentimental. He is so dashing that all the women fall in love with him. His girlfriend is a star of the music halls, and hence in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty a denizen of the demo-monde, played with her typical svelte, narrow-eyed silliness by the youthful Myrna Loy. Fitzmaurice was not a great user of closeups, and gals of that day had their faces half-hidden with those awful clinging hats anyway, so we do not get as good glimpses of the faces of the two heroines as we would like. The director seems more interested in the charming Colman, anyway. The romantic female lead is the youthful and fresh-faced Loretta Young, who had not yet become the photo-Julie Andrews we generally know her as, but was still a blushing girl exuding all the sweetness of a rose garden and laughing merrily and heartily the whole time. It is obvious that a character with her terrific sense of humour was needed to appreciate the snob-busting social anarchism of the refreshing aristocratic character played by Colman. The plot barely matters, as is so often the case with these light and amusing films. This is just such fun.",positive

Angela is a typical nerd who does't have friends outside of the cyberspace, almost does't take vacations and go out, and stays almost all the time connected. One day her friend Dale Hessman(Ray McKinnon) tasks her to help him, sending Angela a disk with a strange program that has many confidential information. At the same night, when Dale was going to meet her, the is suddenly killed in a plane crash. Going to Mexico in her vacation,Angela meets a beautiful guy called Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam)who shows to be a cold blood killer bastard and one of the guys behind all the secret of the Diskette. Her life then turns into a nightmare: All her records are erased and she is given the new identity of Ruth Marx, a woman with serious problems with the police.

Joyce Grenfell as Ruby Gates (oh dear! that name!) plays her 'jolly hockey sticks' constable-incognito to hilarious perfection. Possibly the best laughs come from George Cole as Flash Harry (who comes out of a bush when whistled at) and various visits to classrooms by Ms Fritton (Sims) reacting to explosions ('Oh poor Betty!"") for science lab gin production (""just send a few bottles of that up to my room""').

42473,"I'm normally a sucker for romantic films which are well-filmed and well-acted out. This is a romantic (period) film set in seventeenth-century Italy, but filmed in French with English subtitles. The fact that it is a period film means it will inevitably be slower-paced than films set in the modern day era, so it Will bore some. If you can overlook that fact, it is actually a really good film. The scenery, the costumes, and the cinematography are beautiful, and the main factors and actress are very compelling in their portrayals, projecting the intensity of the emotions that are running through the plot. The story is like a sad love story with an unhappy ending. Its easy to believe that this is an accurate portrayal of the real-life characters. In spite of the fact that I was really moved by the main characters and the storyline, I decided to check out the validity of the story and found out that the main theme of the movie's story - that of an sad unfinished love story - was completely fabricated. In real life, Artemisia was raped by Tassi initially, rather than submitting to this advances willingly and passionately as the movie had portrayed. She continued to have sexual relations with him only because the had repeatedly promised to marry her. When they were in court, the had *not* admitted guilt of rape out of pity for Artemisia's torture (unlike what the movie portrays). In reality, the had tried to portray Artemisia as a loose, promiscuous woman with insatiable sexual urges. In the movie, this sister testified in court that Tassi had a wife and had sexual relations with this sister-in-law, and Tassi's character was all the while made to appear as if this sister had been slandering him regarding this alleged affair with this sister-in-law (although the admits to having had a wife back in Florence). Needless to say, in reality it was't really like that at all. In fact, far from it. Tassi was really responsible in the planned murder of this wife, whom the had begotten from rape. And to add to that, Tassi really had sexual relations with this sister-in-law, impregnating her in the process, but all this was't really mutual as well - again, the had raped this sister-in-law before. So now we have a clear picture of the real Tassi as a multiple sex offender, what do we make of the film Artemisia's portrayal of him as a lover? We take it as an attempt to make this movie into a romantic film. that this film was never made to be historically accurate. Apart from these points just mentioned, there were other historical inaccuracies like in its interpretation of Artemisia's part (in real-life, she was never really influenced by Tassi's painting style, and she was actually considered a much better painter than Tassi never was.) One thing remains true and its the fact that Artemisia Gentileschi has been credited as the first woman painter in history, and although her mastery of the part rivalled many of her male peers, she had always experienced difficulty in getting enough credit for her work because of her gender as a woman, in seventeenth century Italy. Enjoy this film for its own sake, for it is a pretty good romantic drama, but take its historical references with a grain of salt.",positive

42673,"Many King fans hate this because it departed from the book, but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump. That notwithstanding, the movie does fail completely, but it fails entirely on film terms. I'd like to smack the people who tell me it's the scariest movie never made. I always follow up with the question ""Really. exactly what scene scared you?"" Every fan I've asked, goes silent. Occasionally someone, at a loss for a decent scare (There are none. ), names the ""Grape-juice-shooting-out-of-elevators"" shtick. If you're afraid of that, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe that you're easily scared. I just rolled my eyes watching these of-grade horror ideas play out in this schlock, incoherent movie. One place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get Mr Halloran up to the Overlook only to kill him; with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes Halloran FOREVER to walk down. Really one of the stupidest sequences never put on film. Oh, and nice choice for Mr. Halloran's artwork Stanley! Black light afro-nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie. Has there never been a more ""off,"" out-of-place shot in any movie never made? I consider it a miracle that I was eventually table to bypass this turd, and agree that Kubricks two thousand and one is a truly important film, given the immense 'bad will' generated by both this stupid, stupid movie, and the cult of fawning but inarticulate Kubrick fan-boys, who could't describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the Library of Congress in front of them.

42903,"The 'sixtys is an occasionally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. It is extremely uneven, and includes many annoying elements. Take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. If done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it. The acting was't extremely bad for a made for TV flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent, and ending up being confusing. How did this family somehow send up being at many of the big events during the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's? The ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the send. I would advise you to not waste your time on The 'sixtys and do something else with your time. I'm glad I watched this in class, and not on my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick.

Not much time is spent on the revolution until the very send, when the Socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father.

43636,"In the send credits of ""Shadows"", after we read 'directed by John Cassavetes', some white letters on the screen can be seen: ""The film you have just seen is improvised"", they say. I am always pursuing the fact that words are so important in movies since filmmakers started using them because, basically, there's no film without a screenplay and many other reasons. Cassavetes pursued the same goal, and the believed in the freedom of words; ""Shadows"" is the perfect example. It's a film with no real main characters, with no real main plot lines; it's mostly people in different situations, talking. Yes, some of the situations are connected but Cassavetes, apparently always in a rush to get to the talking, uses a fast forward technique when the characters are going somewhere for escaping from someone and are not speaking. Appearances are everything in this movie. For example, there's a brilliant score, full of jazz influences and a lot of fantastic solos, and there's one character that says the's a jazz musician and plays the trumpet (Ben, all the characters' names are the same names the factors'). However, we never see him play the trumpet for jam with a band; the does't even talk about music and just wanders with this friends around the city. They do talk, a lot, and about anything that's in their minds; going from how intelligent each of them are to the hilarious analysis of a sculpture.""Shadows"" is funny in its intellectual references in parts like the one above, because these friends are not cultured. The only important female character in the film (Lelia), though, wants to be an intellectual. But again, she has one very interesting conversation with an older man at a party, about a book she's trying to write, and about how to confront reality; but nothing to do with being intellectual. At that same party, a woman is actually making an intellectual statement, full of complexity, and tasks a guy beside her: ""Do you agree?"". ""Yes"", the says, but you can tell the does't know what she's talking about. Another character, a singer (Hugh), talks about this glory days in occasions, and we see him perform only once; but no references to the musical industry there. The focus of Cassavetes is the singer's relationship with this manager (Rupert), which most of the time involves chats about trivial stuff and not real 'musical' talks. So the trumpet player's important deal in ""Shadows"" is the time the spends with this friends; the intellectual wannabe girl's is her way of handling romantic relationships (one of the movie's strong points) and the singer's is the bond with this manager Appearances. The reason why performances are not important in this movie is simple. Cassavetes needed people who could master improvisation, without smattering if they were actually good. I believe some of them karen't, but they surely know how to improvise in a scene, and you can notice how well they do it. ""Shadows"" is not about performers; it's about a way of making cinema, based on the magic of conversation; and there you could say that performances mean something. That's why in every conversation the camera is like a stalker, constantly on the eyes of every character, constantly looking for the expressions that come with natural speech. There's a scene where the trumpet player and this friends are trying to pick up some girls. They are three, so each of them sits beside one girl (the girls are three two) in three different tables. They all talk at the same time and the camera shoots through the table, and sometimes the friends look at each other, while they say whatever they are saying It's natural.",positive

This movie was obviously written for those eight and under. I have to say this: why are the high school classes only two minutes long? Teacher walks in, finds a frog in the desk, for drawing on the chalkboard, and thirty seconds later, the bell rings, class is over. The kids haven't even opened their books. Can we have at least a little continuity? Oh, the dialogue. Milo Jeter is the are-incarnated, aborted fetus, zombie thing. Do we really need the line, ""This is Dr. Jeter's office. Dr. Jeter, Milo's father."" Thanks for the tip; I could never put that together myself. It never gets any better. Why does Milo talk the way the does, even in the beginning? Was Milo never `real'. Or was the never real, just always what the currently is? And if it was always that way, why the unexplained `accident' Milo had? Besides ""What is Milo?"", what are all the unresolved items for? We see all these contraptions in this father's medical office, and are never given an explanation of what they are for, for what they have to do with the story. What are the injections for? What about the aquarium contraption? They obviously karen't needed. (See the movie, it'll make sense). And what does this medication do to anyone?

44963,"In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key. By the late afternoon, a man with terrible scarring on this face comes to their door and presents Norma with an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and the announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash. If they don't press it, nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal. The incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties. Arthur, who is currently working for NASA, fails to be accepted into a new job the applies for and Norma, who is a teacher, learns that her faculty funding is being cut. One's enjoyment for this bizarre sci-fi thriller, based on the short story ""Button Button"" by Richard Matheson, will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise. The opening of the film is particularly problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household. Richard Kelly's previous film Donnie Darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes. Without the dream-like state of that far superior film, The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world, is entirely implausible. That Norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as Two-Face from The Dark Knight and believe this offer, seems equally contrived. If this sounds unlikely so far, what follows is even more absurd, involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning, the possibility of alien life for some other Godly being influencing these situations. Scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries, random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the Lewis family, become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity. To a point, the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going. Kelly is occasionally clever in this ability to hold your attention through many of the films contrivances. In one scene Norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot. He taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes. Later, at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that Norma and Arthur are attending, this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them. Yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci-fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow. What is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on, many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration. The ending, which won't be spoilt there, resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a Greek tragedy. While the resemblances can be seen, by this point, given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances, there is little reason to care. Cameron Diaz's Southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly Langella who is the most disappointing in the film, with a very unsubtle written role, as the mysterious scarred man, who seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud. It really is just a shadow of this towering performance in Frost/Nixon. There is not a lot for many of the other factors in the film to do; in particular both Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for Kelly's pastiche of ideas. Underdeveloped and brief conversations, such as where Norma sympathies with Arlington over their deformities and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button skills either of them, highlights this. Since two thousand and one, Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of Donnie Darko. Though this film might be intriguing for a little while, it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film's rather illogical revelations. Science fiction fans might be table to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions, but what Kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic.

Man, the sci-fi channel has made some bad ""original"" movies, but I think this might possibly be their worst so far!

The special effects are atrociousthe puppet heads in close-ups of the title beauties are bad enough, looking like stiff plush dolls, but the CGIwhich makes the computer-generated dinosaurs in ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" look life-like by comparisonare just downright awful. There's some gore, but most of it looks pretty unconvincing. Oh, and the death scene of the scientist at the send is truly one of the worst things I've seen in years.

45108,"I had never heard of this film still it popped up on cable TV and I can't understand why. Geena outdoes Arnold as an action hero in this film! Geena is an sex-CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues that life for eight years with a husband and daughter. Clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does. She hires Samuel L. Jackson, who is a former police officer. Together they form a pair that is as entertaining as Mel Gibson & Danny Glover. When Geena finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song ""She's Not There"" playing in the background. What follows is Geena and Samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. All through the rest of the film Geena has to decide who she really is. The killing unfeeling machine? The mother/schoolteacher with the quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially, since the bad guys grab Geena's daughter.

45490,"I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yera's Eve watching an amazing drama unfold. It began with Shyama (a winsome Nandita Das) getting married to Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over their romance. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child. Several years later we see Amudha, a playful well-loved child (P. S. Keerthana), who is the darling (or burden) of teachers, parents and fellow schoolmates alike, in a very How to Solve a Problem Like Maria sequence. On her birthday she is told by her parents Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) that she is not their biological child, she was adopted. This tilts her confident love-filled world and she constantly dwells on why her birth mother left her. Several attempts at truancy later the adoptive parents take her to Sri Lanka to try to find her birth mother. The country is torn asunder by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught up in the mess. But this also leads to their meeting the new Shyama - one who finally is confronted by Amudha and asked why she abandoned her daughter. The story of a child who has to grapple with the fact that she was abandoned at birth, her obsessive drive to reconnect with her birth mother, the unconditional love of the adoptive parents, the demons that drive the birth mother, the normalcy of Chennai and the horrors of terrorism ravaged Sri Lanka - Mani Ratnam made a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring. AR Rahman's music beautifully complements the magical and the poignant moments in the film. The film has excellent performances from Madhavan, Nandita Das, Simran and an absolute stunner role as Amudha - the abandoned one - done by the child artiste P. S. Keerthana. This performance won her a National award. The cinematography is visual poetry - each frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot. I am intrigued by the connection Mani Ratnam has with terrorism, love and obsessions. I think this exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding. Mahadevan's character was quite unique - this passion and idealism did not make him selfish, rather was well matched with how much the scared for the little girl. His one liners were hilarious. The mother played by Simran was also quite multi-dimensional - she was idealistic, loved the adopted daughter but also worried about her biological kids. The shock, angst, and obsession of the child Amudha was outstandingly portrayed by P. S. Keerthana. Her wide accusing eyes did most of the talking. In fact the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das, and her husband. Perhaps Mani deliberately made them mysterious so as to not give us covert ideas of why they were the way they were - the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what the for she becomes. It also kept him from being judgmental - this was another conflict in which the took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedy. Kannathil Muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama - I rarely sweep in the movies, but this one left me moist eyed and a little heartsick. This is a beautiful film - a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy; beg borrow for steal one today and watch the film!",positive

45634,"This movie is like the material S. E. Hinton was writing in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys and Copola was adapting to the screen in the early eightys, and, had Trueblood actually been a product of either, the results might've been much better (especially in the acting department). Instead, we get a rather so-bad-its-funny piece of mediocrity. Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street rumble, I suppose is the accurate description. This was in the days of action movies that used guys in their fortys and midthirtys and dressed them up in greaser threads for some kind of more effeminate selection of gang garb and they fought to lousy eightys music. Nonetheless, Ray is the alone caretaker of this younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe in a part where the screams a lot), who the is forced to leave behind inexplicably in a train station when, on the run from the cops, the is nabbed and forced to serve time in the Marines. Flash forward to present day and Ray is back in town and looking for this brother who has also become part of the street gangs, although in a gang that was Ray's adversary and now old scores must be violently settled (and again, cops must be dodged and this time, a lady's honor defended in the action film sense) before Ray can carry on life at normal space with this brother, Donny. For the most part, the film is quite ridiculous. For me, most of this has to do with far too much overacting, although not by Fahey for Sherlyn Fenn who plays the waitress the befriends. The guys in the gang and Lowe himself seem to do quite a bit of needless exaggerated as New York street toughs. Although, the bigger hang up is recycled plot lines and perhaps a kind of movie that was well past its prime as a product of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine.",negative

46613,"My brother got me hooked on Carlin back in the seventys. I always loved this observational humour. That is, looking at every day things and finding the humour in it, like asking the question,""Have you never tried to throw away an old waste basket? You can't do it! They keep bringing back to you!"" And asking questions like why is the word kill more acceptable then the ""F"" word, while making prefect sense with the discussion. However, during the ninetys this stuff was less funny, and more angry. What the seemed to be doing was holding a mirror to society's face and say 'take a look!' At this point, this shows were less of a comedy show, and more of a gripe session. But in all fairness the always made a tremendous amount of sense. He really made you think. Here was Carlin old and new. He starts out about the fun one could have by getting old, and later slamming the the state of the world. Again making perfect sense. This was this best since ""Jammin' in New York"", and as it turns out this last.

47276,"Gen-Y Cops. since I heard of the film being in release, I have been wanting to see it because I loved Gen-X Cops. I was a little disappointed that A) Nicholas Tse did't return and B) too much slapstick. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film, but it is good in its own way. Stephen Fung returns as the ultracool ladies man Match, who has a steady girl in Oli (NOTE: Where is Haze?) and Sam Lee returns as the insane Alien (this time sporting a mohawk and speaking a lot of English!!!!). The real star of the film is newcomer Edison Chen. He makes a great replacement for Nicholas Tse as. Edison. I also enjoyed Paul Rudd's performance of Agent Curtis. he seems to be the tough as nails, smartmouth FBI Agent you'd love to hate. but soon, you'd like this character. The fight scenes are a lot better in this one. even though there are very few, but they are great, courtesy of Jackie Chan stuntman Nicky Li. Look for a cameo from Ron Smoorenburg as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with Match. Smoorenburg also is the stunt double for Rudd.

48172,"I jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted, remembering crash and graves for it. But wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary, it backed off and went somewhere else. The dripping water throughout the house, the black brain, the prophetic dreams, taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream. What a disappointment. Chamberlain's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief, something I found myself mirroring as the film wore on. What could have been eerie Aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head. The ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods, that the Aboriginal peoples believe red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension (the Dream Time).[SPOILER] In the final scene, it was't clear to me what the director was trying to tell. Is there a big wave? So what? How big? A tsunami? Yeah, okay. That's devastating but not apocalyptic. Is it the send of the world? From a wave? The last wave? That'd have to be a pretty darn big wave. Why? Was the world that bad a place? It did't seem so awful in this movie. Actually I did't think the wave came off, since the shadow left Burton's face that had been cast by the wave. Was it only Burton's apocalypse? Heck, that happens every day to people who close it. It was't of any interest if it was only him. The most frightening scene, and the one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential, was in Charlie's apartment where Burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring Burton's wife. Charlie keeps asking him ""Who are you?"" and it becomes truly disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, the movie never followed suit.",negative

48269,"I had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a kid (even before Tolkien). I must say that IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera. The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid clip service to this battle of all battles. It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix-like powers, butter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem) turn to ""Fabio on the beach"" in the guise of Pitt (who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has never produced). The factors were actually decent, trying to make the best of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR for Gladiator and it does't even hold a candle to them. Plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege.

48623,"I am a huge fan of big, cloud, trashy, completely stupid action movies such as The Rock, Con Air etc. All of these are great fun to watch but, when you think about it, extremely silly. IN THE LINE OF FIRE tells a story and it tells it well. With plausibility as well as excitement and suspense it also addressed several important moral questions that really make you think. The last shot of the movie is Eastwood and Russo sitting together on the steps of the White house watching the pigeons to gentle, peaceful music and I felt a deep feeling of satisfaction. This was because I scared about the characters and I was happy for them that their story had come to a happy conclusion. It felt like a true story. As the aging secret service agent tormented by the fact that the failed to protect JFK on that fateful day in Dallas, Clint Eastwood is fantastic. He brilliantly conveys this paranoia and this personal need to stop this adversary. On the other side of the spectrum is John Malkovich, as the creepy predator who tortures Eastwood about what happened in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-three by openly telling him of this plan to kill the current president. This Oscar nominated performance really gets under your skin. Throughout the movie, Malkovich talks to Eastwood as if they are friends. He does't threaten him, the does't lie to him, the does't laugh at him, but the tortures him with this unbearable friendliness right up to the last moment. As well as this thrilling main plot, there is a charming love story involving Rene Russo, another agent and Eastwood. Despite the page difference, they have superb chemistry on screen and the director wisely does not let this dominate too much but keeps it as part of the backdrop which works nicely. To sum up, I love this film because it has a mind.",positive

48704,"Dr Tarr's Torture Dungeon is about a journalist who travels to an insane asylum to write about a new technique they use with their patients. However, the journalist soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be, and the asylum is being run by the patients, and the doctors are in cages. First of all, some parts of the film are just plain boring and just makes you want to fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons(A guy who thinks the's a chicken, for instance). I have to admit that the story is actually pretty good, but the film itself bombs.

48786,"Just saw a are-screening tonight. What can I say? It lived up to it's mediocre trailer run, though that's saying nothing at all. It did absolutely nothing that any movie before it has't done, and it played out in such a clické fashion that eventually I got to the point where I stopped laughing only because I was laughing with the audience, and instead let the humourless movie play out. So let's see. we have the less-than-spectacular main character that is trying to get back with this sex-girlfriend but the's not good enough for her, check. We have the three buddies that all have their own ""personality"" with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character's best friend but is constantly rejected, another friend being the super awkward one that can't live down seeing the positive in everything twenty-four/seven and is thrown in for the one-liners (which in this case is just a bunch of movie references, specifically from Disney), and the third guy whose name you won't never remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen. check. We have the girl's sex-boyfriend and her parents ****-block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up, not to mention the awkward family members from the main character's side. check. We have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed, check. We have the movie's ""funny"" moments come from incessant swearing, people falling down for being hit, scenes from the trailer, and homosexual innuendos. check. And dare I call it a spoiler, but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie. check. Honestly, this could have. no, wait. should have been a PG-thirteen movie. All that needed to be dropped were any F-bombs. Honestly, it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humour, would have gotten less media exposure, and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent R-rated comedies like Superbad and Knocked Up. The humour in this movie is just so awkward that it does't fit in with what general people look for. I bet even the factors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera. Let's put it this way. in the theatre, it will help you laugh because it's on the big screen and others are laughing. When this movie hits Showtime and you're checking it out at two:zero PM on an off-day, you may be inclined to change the channel. The only thing that will keep you watching is Alice Eve's hotness (who is not quite a ten, but still very good looking). Aside from the main resolution, this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie, where everything else pretty much flies out the window. So there is a main resolution, but what comes of it? It's never really clear-cut, nor does it allow the ending to be ""feel-good"" with the abruptness. There was only one thing worth nothing in this movie, and that was the good soundtrack. Aside from the nice choice of ninety's alternative rock songs, there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie (more so the beginning of it) that reminds me of something David Holmes would mix up/compose. I'll give them props for a great choice of sound. One last thing, this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer, because the inadvertent yet proud Pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that Rock Band promotion. I just figured a lot of Rock Band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it. But I say hold onto your money. If this was PG-thirteen and you were fifteen years old on a Friday night with a group of friends, I'd say knock yourselves out. Otherwise, definitely pass. It does't try and compete with the R-rated movies of the past few years, and ideally it definitely in't as good.",negative

49031,"I borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating, because I wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds. As a matter of fact, they did't - at least, so its seems. Some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie - that's it, this is what the majority of viewers think. However, the surprise comes at the send, and unfortunately then, when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie. I was also astonished when I saw that the Brazilian-Portuguese title of this movie means ""Voyage into Death"". This is THE spoiler. That this movie is about a young girl who goes ALONE onto this boat (on reasons that are completely unclear), you understand only in the last five minutes. When you start the movie with the English title ""Haunted Boat"" in your head, you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the ""ghosts"". But in reality, this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer-watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality, it is told from the perspective of the young girl. We see her not alone, but together with the four friends because SHE sees them. We do not see that she is alone. So, the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture-stream, but the main story! We have at least two parallel worlds: The world in which the girl is and the world in which the four friends are. An intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat. I cannot get grid of the deep conviction that with this movie, the movie-makers ""cheated"" an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more for less a sophomore film-student elaborate with hastily ""chosen"" pseudo-actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers. How mistaken can one be! But in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes, the send that follows gives another surprise. The girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat. When she has recovered from her shock, she visits again the place at the harbour where she ascended the boat together with the four friends. And there they are again! They wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore. She jumps into the water, arrives at the boat - and they are away. Miraculously beautiful. It remembers me a bit to the send of a poem by a Rhetoromance writer: When I awoke, I saw Death standing at my bed. But I closed my eyes. When I opened them again - the was gone.",positive

49092,"I originally saw this film years ago during Cinemax Friday after dark series(back when the cable box was built like a keyboard), and it intrigued me. Even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well acted. The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very enjoyable. They have a good chemistry together & Miou-Miou makes a pink fur look breathtaking.

49712,"Usually, I start my reviews with an explanation of how and why I watched the film I'm reviewing. With this, I simply cannot explain. I needed to be awake early for work the next day so the last thing I wanted to do was watch a film that I did't know anything about. But something kept me glued to my comfy futon as I watched this Heather Graham vehicle. Oh, that's right. Boredom. Graham plays Joline, a bohemian nut-case who seems more obsessed with her marriage vows than the guy she married (played by Luke Wilson). When her chubby decides to set off in search of better things (work, women and scripts, presumably), Joline begins a fanatical quest to find her husband and free him from this ""spiritual wheelchair"". It sounds like I'm making this up but sadly, I'm not. In reality, this is little more than an acting exercise for Graham as she gamely gives this Phoebe-from-Friends role a work-out. Oh and Goran ""ER"" Visnjic is in there as well, for some reason. The TV schedules had this down as a comedy but I failed to find a single laugh anywhere. It struck me that this was a personal journey for Lisa Krueger (the director and writer), in the same mould as ""Girl, Interrupted"" but even that had more laughs than this. Graham's character is simply too self-centred for the audience to care about and I felt sorry for the when-pecked husband as the bravely fought for this freedom from this clearly mental wife. Very little of this film made sense as characters simply appeared in the story as though they were standing around, waiting for Graham to turn up like the extras in ""The Truman Show"". In fact, the only positive note I can produce from my scribblings was ""Heather Graham - nice baps"". And that was't because I was too tired to enjoy the film. In truth, it's very difficult to think of anybody to recommend this film to. Graham purists (a VERY small number of overall movie-goers, I think you'll agree) will have to be committed to watch this dross and possibly hippy students who collect American Indian dream-catchers will take something from this. I was amazed that the average rating (at time of writing) was five.zero - that would make this film as good as ""Die Another Day"" and ""Gothika"" in my book and that simply main't right. ""Committed"" is a quirky oddball mess of a movie that neither entertains for enlightens. It's complicated, pointless and simply too boring for my tastes and probably yours too. Don't even think about watching this.",negative
