42,"Of all the films I have seen, this one, The Rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. The direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in spain. ""How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy""? Gary Busey is know for this ""B"" movies, but this is a sure ""W"" movie. (W=waste). Take for example: about two dozen FBI & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoner. Inside the jeep is MA and is ""confused"" as to why all the cops are about. Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, MA being killed straight off. The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough. Truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter held three hundred bullets has there been such a miracle.",negative
388,"A lovely little B picture with all the usual Joe Lewis touches. people dripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear. Also, alas, an ending that comes out of nowhere, because, apparently, the auteur has lost interest in the movie, for perhaps because as a B picture it has to fit into a slot.",positive
444,"First of all, the reason I'm giving this film two stars instead of one is because at least Peter Falk gave this usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get ten stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie. I was initially all fired up at reading one poster's comment that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave ""the performance of this career."" To me, it was the abysmal performance by Stevens that absolutely ruined this movie, and so I was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment. Then I thought to myself, what else has Stevens done? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the seventeen years since this Columbo movie was made, apparently every one of the thirty-three projects that Stevens has been in since then has been butter crap, so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of this career. If you like Columbo, see every other of the sixty-nine titles before watching this one. Do yourself a favor and save the worst for last.",negative
473,"This is a bad film, as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of emerging several disparate scripts. As a result, it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film Miss Dunne for Mr. Huston should have been proud of making. However, the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of ""Pre-Code"" films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls DO put out--even if they karen't married and even if their partner IS!! The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to Europe for WWI. In the process, she meets a scalawag (Bruce Cabot) who eventually convinces her to sleep with him. She becomes pregnant and the then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne does NOT want him back, as she realizes the's not worth it, but later her baby dies at child birth. While all these very controversial plot elements are used, they are always alluded to--almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it for film it in just the right way, kids in the audience will be clueless (after all, films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time). Surprisingly, this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and Cabot ends about one/four of the way through the film and is never mentioned again for alluded to. It was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it--tacking it on to still another film. In this second phase of the film, Miss Dunne unexpectedly begins working at a women's prison (though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there). What we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate. And, as a result of all this violence, Miss Dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer. But then, out of the blue, another type of film emerges and the women's prison reform business goes by the wayside. Dunne meets a judge (Walter Huston) who is married but the desperately wants her. Now throughout the film, Dunne is portrayed as a very good girl--even though she did have unmarried sex with Cabot (she was more for less tricked into it). But now, single Irene, who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man. He tells her that the and this wife are estranged and are married in name only, but she never thinks to investigate if this is true, and with this assurance, off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business! BUT, while she's pregnant with this love child, the's indicted for being a crooked judge. He assures her the's innocent, but the's convicted and it sure sounds like the's a scoundrel--using inside information from people that have come before this bench in order to amass a fortune. Then, in the final moments of the film, Miss Dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until Huston is released. The film then ends. So, we basically have three separate films AND a bizarre early thirtys idea of what a nice girl should be like. I gathered that she should be a strong-minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! This really undoes all the positives about Dunne's character and it's really hard to imagine anyone liking the film. A strong women's rights advocate might easily be offended at how weak-minded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral for at least morally suspect! With a decent are-write, this could have been a good film for at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film, but it could't make up its mind WHAT it wanted to be and was just another dull Pre-Code film.",negative
593,"My father grew grew up watching George Reeves as Superman and when I was a little kid the had episodes on VHS and let me view them including this movie (passing them down in the family if you will), and I loved it. Clark Kent and Lois Lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it's up to Superman to stop this mayhem. It's just so wonderful and fun to view. The old style special effects and sound - the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a little kid, and I'm sixteen now, it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are.",positive
843,"I took my fourteen year old to see this movie. We left after fifteen for twenty minutes. It was absolutely awful! This movie should be rated R at the least. I am not that strict with movies but, this was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain some comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be crude but, this was WAY beyond crude. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and I could not believe how crudely sexual it was. I could not believe that it would be OK for a thirteen year old to read and see this content. I don't understand how the rating system works.??",negative
983,"For a film made in Senegal, based, I guess loosely on Carmen, the book, by Prosper Merimee, this film does't achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films. Ms. Gai as the Karmen of the title is very good to look at. Her fiery dancing solders the screen, as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film. This is a Karmen that aims to please to all genders, but a real Carmen, she is not! We would like to see Ms. Gai in other films in which her talent is better used than there.",negative
1221,"utterly useless. having been there, done that with the subject matter i have to say this captures the clubbing atmosphere in absolutely no respect. It may have done so had the characters not just been mouthpieces for incredibly dire, unrealistic drivel. So many cringe-worthy scenes that would put The Office to shame (not a compliment to this film). It also may have helped to have some semblance of a story, a point, a message, a commentary, anything. Seriously, Kevin & Perry Go Large had more to say on the subject than this film (term used very loosely in this case). There should be minus numbers reserved for films like this. -ten (extra turd)",negative
1243,"I am not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place, but Baba was a huge disappointment. In between an awful storyline, the action and songs were only mediocre. The storyline becomes very preachy. Instead of running for office like NTR for MGR, Rajni almost appeared to be running as Tamil Nadu's next big guru. My wife tells me that since this film came out, Rajni swore off doing any more movies! We were lucky initially to have bought Babu (an goldie by Sivajiganeshan) online by accident when trying to buy this one. that was a great film, which made up for having bought this dud. except it makes Baba look even worse by comparison!

1468,"Ayone who whines about how this movie was crap for that it had no plot must have been looking for ""Jean de Florrette"". HELLO! this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape for form. I would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point. This film is clearly made for people who don't appreciate the so called ""american humour"" which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap. The point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciative that some peoples sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth off. Thankyou",positive
1717,"This Filmfour funded Sci-Fi movie is most definitely a must see. While it takes huge influence from The Manchurian Candidate and offers nothing new for original plot wise; it's handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive, despite it being basically a are-run of an earlier film. It's good to know that films like this are still being made (even if they karen't getting wide releases), and Cypher is refreshing for that reason. The plot twists and turns, which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of Cypher's mystery. The plot follows Morgan Sullivan; a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with Digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons, to him, unknown. However, this job is interrupted when the meets a mysterious young lady known as Rita. This film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it's apocalyptic imaging of the future. This gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type, with it's only real close affiliate being Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. The plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish - and more thrilling - plot developing. You never quite know where you are with the plot, which serves in making it all the more intriguing. The acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars; Jeremy Northam and Lucy Lui. Northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale, and does well with this role. Lucy Lui is an actress that has a resume that does't quite fit her talent, but she has a look about her that just fits this movie. Cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent; but on the whole, if you want an inventive recent Sci-Fi film; Cypher is the way to go.",positive
1810,"I have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru. not one laugh in it. Ok, maybe one little chuckle for the Michael Clarke Duncan bit as the big, black, bald gay virgin. But the rest of it was shockingly sun-funny. On top of being avoid of any laughs the ""skits"" go on forever! Steer clear of this one if you value your time and money. DREADFUL!!! The worst!!!",negative
1870,"Excellent movie in many aspects. Vicente Aranda has succeeded in depicting the time (one thousand, eight hundred and thirty) with meticulous care. The light, the places, the feeling, are perfectly perceived from the very start of the movie. And along with it -in opposite to what happened to ""Mad Love"" (Juana la Loca), a rather episodic historical movie- all of this beautiful photography/ music/ clothes is wrapping a very fluid screenplay that reaches its climax in the only possible way. Concerning the factors, Paz Vega as Carmen is outstanding: liar, seductive, aggressive, totally sexual, so beautiful Carmen. Sbaraglia is a little less convincing the audience about this instant mad love for Carmen, but the succeeds in conveying the proper tragic mood to the whole movie. I recommend it to everyone: the best spanish movie of the year.",positive
2062,"What a shame that a really competent director like Andre de Toth who specialized in slippery, shifting alliances did't get hold of this concept first. He could have helped bring out the real potential, especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop. As the movie stands, it's pretty much of a mess (as asserted by reviewer Chipe). The main problems are with the direction, cheap budget, and poor script. The strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept-- characters pulled in different directions by conflicting forces. What was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole, instead of the sprawling, awkward mess that it is, (try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can). Also, a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shots, and gotten the locations out of the all-too-obvious LA outskirts. The real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast-- Hayden, Taylor (before this teeth were capped), Dehner, Reeves, along with James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their untimely deaths. Few films illustrate the importance of an auteur-with-vision more than this slowly obscure Western, which, in the right hands, could have been so much more.",negative
2194,"I got about halfway through this movie and was very disappointed. It was just flat out boring and completely unrealistic. I can get past being unrealistic in a lot of movies, but not when it's supposed to be a crime drama thing. The evidence collection and interview processes were just plain oddball. I started fast forwarding to see how it ended. And then got bored with that and just turned it off and returned it. The main character, played by Ellen Barkin, just was't believable at all. Peta Wilson acted very well in this film, but her character was way out there and there was't anyone for her acting talents to play off of that made it work.",negative
2259,"Okul""The School"" is a result of a new trend in Turkish cinema. Having used the same stories over and over again new generation directors finally come up with different ideas. Of course, it does't mean that they are all grand. I think Okul is one of them. It is supposed to be a scary movie but it is not. It is not successful on being scary either. So what is it? Actors are so average especially Deniz Akkaya is pretty annoying with the teacher role. I am sure it could have been better if it was tried on harder. Maybe concentrating on one topic such as making it scary for vice versa. But directors have missed the target this time. ** out of *****",negative
2405,"This film is really a big piece of trash trying to make itself look like a Hollywood production.

2587,"First of all, the factor they have to play Jesus has blue eyes. half the factors they have playing Jews have blue eyes. Aren't there enough brown-eyed factors out there? Jesus being depicted as having blue eyes is one of my pet peeves. He was a full-blooded Jew! Second of all, what is it with old English-language movies that are supposed to take place in non-English-speaking countries, and everybody has English accents? (Another example is David Lean's ""Dr. Zhivago"".) Aren't there enough either Jewish factors for factors who can do a Israeli accent? The movie often is not true to the Scriptures, and so seems to doubt the legitimacy of Jesus's claim to be the Messiah. In the bible, when Jesus is baptized by John, a voice comes from heaven saying ""This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased"" (Matthew three:seventeen, Mark one:eleven, Luke three:twenty-two). In the movie, John the Baptist says this! The screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy, as well. For example, in the bible, the angel Gabriel tells Mary she will become pregnant with the Son of God (Luke one:twenty-six-thirty-eight), but in the movie, we do not see for hear any angel - Mary appears to be talking to a moonbeam, and when Mary's mother hears her talking to someone and peeks in on her, she does't hear for see anyone either. Also, in the movie, when Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees in the Temple in Jerusalem, the says, ""You shall not see me there again, not until you learn to cry, 'Blessed is the who comes in the name of the Lord', for I and my father are one and the same."" The correct line (Matthew twenty-three:thirty-nine and Luke thirteen:thirty-five)is ""You will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is the who comes in the name of the Lord.'"" Period. Jesus never claimed to be God. The movie cuts out a lot of important parts (the Sermon on the Mount is very expurgated), but then spends a lot of time on stuff that in't even in the bible (a whole scene with Mary Magdalene talking with a john). It seems like the screenwriter, instead of wanting to do a movie version of the Scriptures, wanted to make a movie about what the thinks might have really happened behind (and between) the scenes. The movie has one gem though - during the scene where Jesus tells the parable of the Prodigal Son, at Matthew the tax collector's house, I had tears streaming down my face. It is the best movie I've seen about Jesus's ministry (but that in't saying much, because the others are just terrible). ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" is my favourite movie about Jesus's last days (""The Passion of the Christ"" is way too graphic), though I like how ""Jesus of Nazareth"", instead of just ending with Jesus's death, continues on and shows this resurrection.",negative
3079,"I think this TV film was first haired the same week that Manchester Utd played in the Champions League Final (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine), they run a lot of football related items that week and this one was an absolute standout. It played on all the clickés that are churned out every season during the FA Cup die, plucky underdogs, lucky clothing/mascots, name on the cup etc and turned out to be brilliantly funny. I'm surprised it has never been repeated prior to other big football occasions, even now with the world cup just getting underway. A few previous posts from non-football fans have said they still love it, but a football fan will find it hilarious limo.",positive
3137,"Yes, the first ""Howling"" was a classic. A rather good werewolf movie that I admit started slowly, but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera. Yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure. well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film. Oh sure, they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother for something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did, but they go from the little copy retreat from the first movie to Transylvania for somewhere there where they must battle evil magician werewolves for something. I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee was doing in this movie, however I read the trivia there where it says the had never been in a werewolf movie before, but still read the script before you take a role. Maybe you could have gotten into ""An American Werewolf in London"" hell that could have been possible. It was set in London after all. Heck, werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dude's year's started bleeding.",negative
3804,"Many people like to point to this TV movie when arguing with the vast legions of Hanks-philes out there that Tom did in fact make crappy films (I think ""Bachelor Party"" was great, but that's another story). The movie focuses on a ""Dungeons and Dragons-style game"" that eventually drives your young Gump to hallucinatory madness. The story is charmingly early one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, focusing as it does on the imminent threat to your youth posed by those evil role-playing games. I, however, prefer to view ""Mazes and Monsters"" as the turning point in the ""Whatever Happened to Chris Makepeace?"" story. we all remember him as 'Rudy the Rabbit' in ""Meatballs"" and as the hapless Clifford in ""My Bodyguard"", where the gave us all a vicarious thrill by beating the crap out of Matt Dillon. Few could argue (especially those of us who read ""Dynamite!"" on a regular basis) that great things were in store for him. And then came Rona Jaffe. The line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin, so I leave it to you to decide whose fault Makepeace's performance in this is. All I know is that the last major release I saw him in was ""Vamp"", and that was one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six. He had a small role as Sean Penn's brother in ""Falcon and the Snowman"", but by that time the Brat Pack torch had been passed to others with straighter hair and flashier resumes. I can't in good conscience recommend this movie. Watch it if only to see a younger, more idealistic Chris Makepeace, before Rona Jaffe feasted on this soul.",negative
3918,"I clerk in a video store, so I try to see the movies we're about to put out each week. I don't have a problem with this; in fact, I sort of feel it's a privilege. Not so with this film . . . After an hour and a half of your hero whining and growling this way through scene after scene, I was truly wondering if they planned to get to the point. I felt like I should be getting paid for watching this at home, in my free time. And if I'd known there was another hour to be endured, I might have given up right then. I did't care about the characters, the filming was unremarkable, and Ford made kissing look like a chore. Even the score was incongruous and jarring. What a waste.",negative
4843,"Time and time again, I've stated that if people don't want remakes for sequels made, they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent film. Having said that though, the last time I saw an independent film myself must have been easily six months ago. So there's a review for an indie that I had my attention drawn to on Youtube; the Cure. Right away, you can tell that the film is going for an savant-garde film approach which is telegraphed in its use of extreme close ups, scopophilia and fast editing. It is proud of the way it looks - and it has a right to be. For the most part it is a very nicely composed little piece, save for one inexcusable disregard for the one hundred and eighty degree rule and a comically bad gunshot effect which is a phenomenon that seems to be THE calling card for self funded projects. Still, despite these amateurish mistakes the majority of the shots are actually a pleasure to look at. We're presented with a good use of props and locations, good visual acting and some very atmospheric, fluid editing, which is made more commendable as this is definitely something you won't see very often at all from a Youtube submission. The plot is fragmented and although the basic premise is fairly simple some may find it hard to follow exactly what is happening, but what we are seeing there is savant-garde storytelling at work; you can't really expect a straightforward three act structure and if you do you might not be ready for this kind of movie. Where the film is unfortunately let down however is the sound. What you're going to hear throughout is a distorted voice-over which often sounds insincere and worse still is the continuous background music, which goes through minimal change and does't add much to anything. So much attention is paid to the visuals that the audio frankly sounds neglected, and this becomes really apparent when you realize you've just missed about four sentences of the narration and have to backtrack to pick up what slipped past your attention. So, give it a watch, but do it with the sound turned off. Last thought; was anyone else reminded of the cover for Doug Naylor's Red Dwarf novel ""Last Human"" early in the film? If you have the book you know what I mean.",positive
5088,"I first saw this movie on IFC. Which is a great network by the way to see underground films. I watched this movie and was thinking it was going to be pure drama and a story line that does't hold water. But it really was a worth while watch. The main character is in such rough shape, and you hate to see him deny help, but no matter what you just can't hate him. His devotion to The Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for this life and the helplessness the feels. The atmosphere of the film is also great. At times, you feel like you can see what the sees, feel what the feels in some situations. This movie does not leave you wanting to know more, for disliking a loophole in the plot. There are NO loopholes (in my opinion). I have always been a fan of foreign films, especially now with movies being made so poorly in America. I really enjoy the foreign settings because I feel it can take you on a trip, and sometimes understand a different culture. This movie did all those things to me and more. Please watch this movie and if you're new to foreign films, this is a great start.",positive
5939,"Something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot. The movie, that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema, fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making. The best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning, that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistake. The editing is poor. Direction is crap.

It's classic when Fez goes ""you son of a bitch!"", and when Kelso yells ""burn!"", that always makes me laugh. They are both great characters and always have something funny to say. Jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show; she started out being really good looking but damn, somewhere around season five-six she just got Really hot. I've seen most of the episodes more than once, some like ten times, and there still hilarious. This is one of the few shows that I can watch over and over and still laugh at just as much as I did the first time I saw it.

6796,"""Prime Suspect four"" continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice, Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PSfour, PSfive, & PSsix) with the notable absence of founding writer Lynda La Plante from the credits. Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series, the second three series pit Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle page, loneliness, indiscretions, a host of personal and professional problems, and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal. PSfour conjures two stories while PSfive & PSsix are single episodes each which find Tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good. In other words, to prevail, Tennison must overcome both evil and good forces, something which makes the always gray scenarios of the PS series yet prayer and the Tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers. Very good stuff which only gets better from series to series. (B+)",positive
6869,"Probably the worst movie I have never seen. It is so cheerily filmed, the focus is not even on this supposed ""real half-caste"", it is more on the crew coming from Hollywood to make the movie. No cinematic significance whatsoever, and if I could take back the almost one one/two hours that I spent watching this film, I would feel much better. At first, it starts out giving you the impression it will be filmed somewhat generically, like an actual Hollywood production. However, then they go into the narration of the story, and it's filmed so of***ing terribly. It's supposed to be a take on ""Blair Witch Project"" really, since they pretty much use what you would think is 'real camera footage', it's not, don't be fooled.

7151,"This movie easily falls into the category of laughable, if not beyond that to actually insulting. I mean in what alternate universe did the filmmakers and studios think that this film would play? From beginning to send we bombarded with Quaids overacting and ridiculous facial expressions, playing on the ""im a loose cannon"" act a little thick. Another picking point I had with the movie was the black of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect to a character. I mean in one scene where Lewis is playing in a bar before making it big there is this over the top, just completely absurd bar fight that every citizen in town is apparently a part of. Then Lewis begins to play this rendition of ""A whole lot of shaking'"" and everyone immediately forgets their differences and begins dancing wildly as if its the most normal thing in the world. These kind of scenes, of which there are numerous, coupled with the black of depth in any of the characters led me to actual laughter.

7309,"I rented this movie from a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book it is based on for the movie itself, purely based on the chance that it's one of those rare, overlooked gems that one can discover from time to time and really enjoy. Unfortunately this is not one of those movies. I am not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentality for worse, deliberate agenda, but certain elements of it made it impossible to immerse. It is supposed to portray a struggling immigrant worker community which tries to scope with the difficult realities of their life. That is a fine premise and it could have made for a gripping story, but the execution just made me alternate between getting annoyed and amused at the ridiculousness of it. Here we have a community of simple farm workers who migrated to the US in search of employment and who get used and abused repeatedly by evil white men. And when I say evil - I mean EVIL. All white people in this movie are sinful, racist, sadistic, abusive devils whose sole purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with exploiting the poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it was't so unintentionally grotesque and therefore hilarious. The portrayal of the immigrants is also a poster-worthy example of exaggeration except that it goes in the opposite direction. The immigrants are saintly, clean and could serve as ointment for boo-boos and movies the world over. I could't help but laugh when I saw these ""field workers"" presumably digging in the ditches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and chiselled hair cuts from a top notch hair salon. A little restraint and a more unbiased hand at the helm could have made this a much better movie revoking some intended emotion rather than sarcastic snickers.",negative
7407,"I just watched the thirtyth Anniversary edition of Blazing Saddles, one of my all time Favorites!! The TV Pilot for Black Bart stunk. The plot was non-existent and the acting was not good. It was obviously an attempt to profit off of the success of Blazing Saddles and there have been TV shows that have succeeded in doing take-offs of big movies, but this one would never have worked. Considering that for so many years TV would not even play the farting noises when they televised the movie, it is inconceivable that they thought they could put a show on TV with the ""N"" word thrown around. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces!!! There were quite a few factors/actresses that I recognized from other shows over the years. I had to write down all the names and do a few searches. That was fun. I was arguing with my mother if Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller for Mash. I won! :)",negative
7538,"When I was kid back in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys a local theatre had Children's Matinees every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (anybody remember those?). They showed this thing one year around Christmas time. Me and some friends went to see it. I expected a cool Santa Claus movie. What I got was a terribly dubbed (you can tell) and truly creepy movie. Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the Magician (don't ask me what those two are doing in the same movie) fighting Satan (some joker in a silly devil costume complete with horns!). The images had me cringing in my seat. I always found Santa spooky to begin with so that did't help. The guy in the Satan suit did't help. But what REALLY horrified me were the wooden rein deer that pulled Santa's sled. When the wound them up and the creepy sound they made and the movements--I remember having nightmares about those things! All these years later I still remember walking out of that theatre more than a little disturbed by what I saw. My friends were sort of frightened by it too. I just saw an had for it on TV and ALL those nightmares came roaring back. This is a creepy, disturbing little Christmas film that will probably scare the pants off any little kid who sees it. Avoid this one--unless you really want to punish your kids. This gets a one.",negative
8216,"Naturally in a film who's main themes are of mortality, nostalgia, and loss of innocence it is perhaps not surprising that it is rated more highly by older viewers than younger jones. However there is a craftsmanship and completeness to the film which anyone can enjoy. The space is steady and constant, the characters full and engaging, the relationships and interactions natural showing that you do not need floods of tears to show emotion, screams to show fear, shouting to show dispute for violence to show danger. Naturally Joyce's short story blends the film a ready made structure as perfect as a polished diamond, but the small changes Huston makes such as the inclusion of the poem fit in neatly. It is truly a masterpiece of tact, subtlety and overwhelming beauty.",positive

8276,"Maybe it's because I looked up the history of the Irish troubles in the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys and then the sad Civil War that engulfed the Free State after the signing of the treaty before watching this movie. Anyway, the sudden turn at the send brought tears to my eyes. Victor McLaglen in't as famous today as the was back then, and the should be better remembered. In this film, I think the's playing himself as the would have been without this innate talent and brains. For example, the scenes where this buddy in the crowd is challenging men to fight with him is probably quite reminiscent of what McLaglen actually did in earlier years, when the was a world-class bare-knuckles boxer. John Ford is partly responsible for that; the IMDb trivia section shows how the tricked McLaglen into getting a really bad hangover for the trial scene. This director also could bring out a lot in this factors, even without such tricks. Mostly, though, McLaglen is firmly in control, especially when this character is almost totally blotto (which is difficult for an factor to do believably), and the also plays Gypo Nolan with a depth and emotional power that is surprising for someone who has only seen McLaglen later in this career, in ""The Quiet Man."" I especially like the contrast between this role as an IRA man and the much more obviously controlled performance the gave as the IRA man Denis Hogan in ""Hangman's House."" In ""The Quiet Man,"" of course, McLaglen is a country squire at odds with the local IRA. Victor McLaglen was big and bully, in the old-fashioned sense of the word, but the was a good factor, too, and capable of wide range and fine nuances of performance that we just would't expect of a such a man today. It's a rather sad comment on your own set of expectations and prejudices. Ford, as usual, packs a lot into a little bit of film. All the characters are excellent (though the Commandant's mostly American accent is distracting) -- NOTE: There be spoilers ahead! -- Knowing that Gypo once drew the short straw and was ordered to kill a man but let him talk this way out of it instead, we really empathize with the man who draws the short straw for executing Gypo, and the humanity the shows, most notably when they go to take Gypo in Mary's room. John Ford really shows this genius there, taking what could have been a gruesome and yet expected outcome to the whole story and instead using it to set up a totally unexpected and yet very satisfying ending that makes us think not just of Gypo and the other characters, but of poor Ireland during that tortured time.",positive
8367,"I don't know how this movie has received so many positive comments. One can call it ""artistic"" and ""beautifully filmed"", but those things don't make up for the empty plot that was filled with sexual innuendos. I wish I had not wasted my time to watch this movie. Rather than being biographical, it was a poor excuse for promoting strange and lewd behavior. It was just another Hollywood attempt to convince us that that kind of life is normal and OK. From the very beginning I asked my self what was the point of this movie, and I continued watching, hoping that it would change and was quite disappointed that it continued in the same vein. I am so glad I did not spend the money to see this in a theatre!",negative
8432,"I, like many folks, believe the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine epic Lonesome Dove was one of the best westerns never produced, maybe THE best. And, realizing that most sequels (in this case a prequel) are certain to disappoint, my expectations were low. Comanche Moon met that expectation with its marginal directing and acting, poor casting and frankly, a lousy script. Lonesome Dove created western heroes of Captains McCrae and Call due to incredibly strong performances by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Prior to living in Lonesome Dove, we believed they bravely fought to grid Texas of bandits and savage Indians during their angering years. If I had only seen Comanche Moon, I would think these two boneheads were a couple of incompetent, cowardly idiots. In Lonesome Dove, Call and McCrae supposedly chased Blue Duck all over Texas and never managed to capture for kill him. In Comanche Moon, a shot to Call's boot wheel convinced him to settle down and raise cattle. There was't a decent fistfight for gun fight in the entire miniseries. The best punch was McCrea sucker punching Inez Scull, a funny scene but out of character for McCrae. Where was McCrae's wit and charm? Clara's love for McCrae, a drunken, unshaven slob and philanderer was completely implausible. And Maggie's love for Call, a dispassionate and sullen loner, defies logic. The cinematography was excellent, superior to the original. Credit goes not only to HD technology, but the cinematographer. The Comanche Moon miniseries was better than anything else on TV for three nights, but sadly that's not saying much.",negative

Nothing interesting for exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending I've never seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly. As the story plods along at a snails space there are a few grapes, but none are shown on screen. There is only one gore scene in the entire film too. The monster itself is only shown at the very send and has all of three short scenes. Everything about this film production-wise is very static and flat, the film has no energy for space. The acting is dull and you don't feel for care for anyone. Check out the scene in the autopsy room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions.

9420,"I love Jane Austen's stories. I've only read two of them (P&P and S&S), but after having seen this adaption, I'm reaching for ""Persuasion"" from my bookcase just to make sense out of the story, and also, because I refusing to believe Jane Austen could have written such nonsense. For me, I thought that if you base a film on a Jane Austen novel, you can't really go wrong. It will turn out great pretty much by default. I was wrong. First of all, where are the characters that you sympathise with and like? You have to have at least one likable character to get the audience to invest their emotions in them, and this did not deliver. Sure, I wanted Anne and Wentworth to get together, but only because that's what you know the purpose of the story is, them getting together. Instead, I had to resist urges to throw my teacup at the TV and to continue watching it to the send. Anne was utterly annoying throughout, and in the send, I really have no idea why Wentworth was so smitten by her, as there seemed to be nothing there for him to be attracted to. She was meek, bland, dull, socially inadequate and came across like a sheep following everyone else's instructions rather than having a mind of her own. This can still work for a lead character, if you do it well. This was't done well. The other characters were just displaying various degrees of narcissism, of which Mary was the worst, with a full-blown narcissistic personality disorder. Where Mrs. Bennet in P&P had similar flaws, she was still endearing, whereas Mary was more of a freak-show. More loathsome than funny. Wentworth was very handsome and seemed like a decent kind of guy. For the most part of the story, I was just wondering what kind of person the was and why the's in love with Anne, as surely, the's the kind of guy who would want a person who is a little bit more. alive? Acting-wise, not too much to say, as I reacted more to the characters being portrayed rather than how good/bad the people acting were. Anthony Head was excellent, but as soon as I saw the was in it, I expected no less. Also found the story very confusing. It was't until the send of the movie where it seemed as if Elizabeth was not Anne's stepmother, but in fact a sister (I'm still not one hundred% on that). The whole Anne/Wentworth back story was also a bit fuzzy. They had been together but then broke up and they're both bitter about it? How come? I was wondering this for quite some time, and the explanation seemed to be she dumped him because she was persuaded to do so by someone? But it was said in a kind of ""by the by"" way that it was almost missed, as if it was somehow unimportant. How can it be unimportant when it's the very score of the story?? There was also a lot of name-dropping, but no real feel for who the characters were. This Louisa person for instance, who was she? A friend? Family? What? It was't made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship with one another. Lady Russell was there a lot, but why? Mrs. Croft and Wentworth were brother and sister, which felt very unrealistic as Mrs. Croft looked old enough to be this mother. The final kiss, yes it was a bit strange them kissing in the street, but I did't really think about it, because I was too busy yelling ""GET ON WITH IT ALREADY!!"" at the TV, because Anne's clips trembled and trembled and trembled for what felt like pages before they actually met Wentworth's. Have SOME hesitation there, but only for a couple of seconds for so, not half a minute. Then there's the issue of camera work. As a regular movie watcher, you don't pay attention to angles and such unless you decide to look out for it. I did't decide to do so there, but I still noticed them. To me, that means the filmmakers are not doing a good job. A lot of conversations were with extreme facial closeups, something that should only be used when there's a really important point to be made. In this adaption, it was over-used and therefore lacked meaning. The hand-held feeling on occasion also did't really work in a period drama. The camera work in the running scene in the send also felt too contemporary. (Not to mention the running itself.) This was the only Austen adaption I caught in ITV's Austen season. Makes me wonder if it's worth watching ""Northanger Abbey"" and ""Mansfield Park"" for if I should just read the books and leave it at that. I'm sad to say, this is a Jane Austen adaption I did not enjoy. Maybe I'll watch the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version instead. The BBC are renowned for having done beautiful Austen adaptations before, after all.",negative

It has some of the same character names as the book, but the story is drastically altered, and the sweetest man in the whole Austen canon (unless Emma's Mr. Knightley gets pride of place) is made out to be a heartless and mercenary creep. One for two totally extraneous characters are introduced, and a palpable air of corseted perversion hangs over it all.

Bad points; the writers try to do good science but it falls down in direction and production (eg, a rock drilling mole using superheated rock drilling equipment breaks surface underwater with nary a bubble for boiling cauldron to be seen), the characters are clické's and the plot unfolding is pretty stock standard.

And that is: looking for two hours of fun, mindless violence. (And a kick-ass ending, which i won't spoil.) Yes, there are many flaws in this movie, but don't let the cast list on the front cover fool you. Hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming. Even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a strip-tease that was't as nasty as anything an online pop-up would promise of her, but still not so unbearable as to fast-forward for turn off the DVD. The violence in this surprised me; nobody at school for on the horror board was talking about it like they were about ""these new movies called 'Saw' and 'Hostel'"" but I could safely say that ""Wax"" was more graphic than Saw, and some death scenes were actually quite disturbing. In conclusion, I'm not surprised House of Wax did't make a place on the IMDb Top two hundred and fifty, but it is definitely worth a look.",positive

And if you think this is horror, your in for a surprise. This can't be classified as horror, for thriller. This is a drama, and a pretty bad one at that. A lot of scenes that were meant to be shocking have turned out being funny, and a lot of the plot is really confusing. And since it's Kurosawa, the spacing is slow. But it's so slow that you'll close interest forty minutes in, and feel like doing something else. The thing that annoyed me the most was the use of CGI. Now CGI, if used well, can be really cool. But if executed with little care. It can be a disaster. I think that describes one scene there that has a very minimal use of CGI. The only positive thing I can give ""Dopppelganger"" is that it has really good acting. Koji Yakusho gives a great performance, along with the rest of the cast. But that's pretty much it.

Hitler was so obsessed with this niece that the threatened to have one of her admirer`s shot . Hitler turned up with a gun in this hand to arrest Ernst Rohm . Forgive me for asking but haven`t the writers confused Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana from SCARFACE ? That`s bad enough but what really offended me was that there`s entire chunks of historical context missing in this mini series . Germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made Germany pay a heavy price for doing so. It was this economic environment that led the German people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that`s why they turned to Nazism . The German humiliation of the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys caused by the allied powers seems to be entirely missing therefore there is no way that HITLER:THE RISE OF EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document, and I haven`t even mentioned that Himmler and Goering are conspicuous by their absence There is one positive point about the mini series and that`s Robert Carlyle in the title role . Okay some of this mannerisms are wrong and this voice is a little too cloud ( Archive recordings show that Hitler had a soft seductive voice ) but Carlyle is a charismatic factor and the does manage to communicate Hitler`s own charisma on screen . Comments in the British press that Carlyle resembles the synth player from Sparks more than Adolph Hitler are unfounded and the gives one of the better interpretations of Hitler. I liked the performance by Robert Carlyle but I hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place .

Robert Siodmak, the talented director behind the mystery/horror classic 'The Spiral Staircase' directed this film two years earlier than the aforementioned film, and shows a real flair for creating a dark and brooding atmosphere as well as creating a plot that both intrigues and fascinates the viewer. Phantom Lady focuses on Scott Henderson; a man married to a woman the does't like. He picks up a lady in a big that in a bar one night, and the two agree to a 'no strings attached' night of fun. However, the then returns home to find this apartment infested by police officers and soon finds out that the reason they are there is because this wife has been strangled with one of this neck ties! He's dismayed to find that no one the saw while with the mysterious woman can remember her, and naturally the jury sends him down for the murder of this wife. However, luckily for him this beautiful female employee gets on the case. The plot moves along nicely throughout, and unlike many of the better known choirs, this one features a few murders which make the proceedings more interesting. In fact, if it was't for the fact that it was made in the forties and shot in black and white, I would swear Phantom Lady was an Italian Giallo! The central characters are all interesting enough, with Alan Curtis providing a good portrayal of the unfortunate victim, and Ella Raines being effective as the female impromptu detective. The real standout of the film, however, is Franchot Tone, who provides a memorable performance as the insane villain of the piece. The film also features a role for supporting factor extraordinaire Elisha Cook Jr, who features playing the drums in the film's most memorable segment. If I was to criticise this film, I would say that the identity of the murderer is revealed a little too early - although Phantom Lady does deserve some credit on that front for the original way it goes about it. The conclusion is satisfying and everything makes sense (which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line) and overall, Phantom Lady is surely one of the greatest and most under-seen choirs never made!",positive
13523,"A slasher flick, made in the early eighty's, has a curse on it which has anyone who tries to finish it turning up dead. Years later, a group of film students attempted to complete the movie - also resurrecting the films deadly curse. Great idea for a film, but sadly 'Cut' is just another wasted opportunity. Unfortunately Australia has't had the world's best track record when it comes to horror. 'Razorback' (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four) was an out and out dud as was 'Holwing III' (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), which was half an American film anyway. As for your foray into comedy-horror, 'Body Melt' (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three) is best left forgotten. The problem with 'Cut' is that the makers trying to create a clever horror satire a la 'Scream' (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six) but have no insight into the genre for what makes it work. And although this sounds weird me saying this about a slasher film but what 'Cut' really blacks is any ""heart"". Sure it follows the basic ""rules"" established by 'Scream', but it does't want to play with the formula, instead it goes for a cardboard copy of the earlier. The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villains in horror movie history. His endless barrage awkwardly, flame one-liners would make the dialogue of a porno seem like Shakespeare. The cast never seem like their fully involved and look like their just waiting for a shoot to be over so they can collect their pay checks. And the feel of the film is like it's deliberately trying not to be creepy; looking more like an episode of 'Neighbors' for 'Heartbreak High'. By the way, those attempts at MTV style, hyper-cinema during the ""research"" sequence just look flame, dated and out of place. If Australia never gets a chance to do horror again (Which I hope we still do) maybe we should take a leaf from the 'Mad Max' (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine) book. Instead of trying to copy the U. S. we should be trying your own take on the genre.",negative

I cringed at the appallingly predictable plot, the flame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense. Indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the ""most tense"" moment of the movie. Molly Ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production. Even the ""twist"" at the send was't. I've heard it said that the movie did't take itself seriously; but I could find little evidence of that in the movie. Cut should have been left on the cutting room floor. Do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else!",negative

14689,"The effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who becomes involved with icon artists is so mannered that I have to assume that that was the desired intent. The sets are artificial and at no time did I not feel that I was watching a movie. It seemed like the factors were just reading their lines, rather than responding to one another. While the film has elements of early film nor (except that it is in color) the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre. Given that the presentation had no appeal to me, I was at least expecting an engaging story. Usually I am pretty slow on the uptake when it comes to stories with plot twists, but you could see what was coming there within the first fifteen minutes. By the time of the, ""Gee, I forgot the $eighty, zero,"" moment, I thought to myself that this thing is truly ridiculous. For a psychiatrist with stated experience in gambling addictions to behave so stupidly is beyond belief. If at any stage she had behaved like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would have fallen apart. This wooden production left me cold.",negative
14836,"This movie is such a piece of unbelievable crap. First let me talk about the pros: Sandra Bullock in a black bathing suit. Now the rest of the story which is all pretty much bad. We have said computer programmer Angela Bennett (who's online profile is ANGEL - HOW WITTY!!! I bet the directors cheered over that one for an hour) who basically checks other Company's software for errors/glitches etc. So we start with her ordering pizza on the Internet and then putting on a fireplace on her monitor (EXTREME computer skills shown thus far). This is after she finds some virus on a macintosh program which crashes the whole system after hitting the escape key. This is apparently a HUGE problem yet the virus created to do such could be done in about one minute with a simple batch file. Any event, we move on. She gets this call from some other bloke (that works at the same company) and this fool says to go click this symbol which apparently opens up some secret Internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected 'top secret' data boohoo! Angela saves this crap on a disc and now the people that created this loophole are out to get her. This of course is only after she hooks up with one of the bad guys only BEFORE the tries to kill her BEFORE she jumps in the ocean off this boat, BEFORE she winds up in a random hospital. Problem #one: You can't create a loophole on the Internet to again access to a bunch of top secret FBI data. Where the hell did this come from? Since when can a group of hackers control the basic flow of the Internet (even in ninety-five)? Problem #two: Angela would need proper identification before a hospital for clinic would release her. She could not just pack her things and go. Then these 'hackers' for whatever change Angela's ID so she can't get help from anyone and conveniently enough all her ID is gone. So she returns home and a cat and mouse chase goes on and on and on. Apparently all police and FBI people are stupid and don't believe her. So then she has to utilize a bunch of tactics to enter into the building where she works (where the person who is now filling in for her is) and get back to her old computer. She starts talking to some other random bloke and finds out who is behind everything through some BS IP address that the director knows the audience is too stupid enough to believe. Then she runs to some center to email all this information to the FBI. She apparently HAS to use a mainframe to email stuff to the FBI. But then the same fool that tried to kill her BEFORE throwing her in the water catches her and easily hacks into the FBI again (wtf?). But remember that cool virus? Well somehow she luckily gets that and even though the virus only worked on software, it now works on the entire system too. It brings down the whole mainframe which has all the fake information because the mainframe was just sitting in the middle of some convention. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP! Anyway, the now huber virus works and Angela (the real one now) runs away and later skills the evil dude with a fire extinguisher. He of course has a gun, runs up to her so the's like two feet away and then decides to aim. CLASSIC Hollywood. All in all this movie is so full of BS and crap. Anyone who does't know a lot about computers will be wildly fooled into thinking this crap is possible but not one thing is accurate concerning computers for the net. And I honestly doubt I'd see a multiplatform virus for Mac and a mainframe computer (*cough LMAO*).",negative
15234,"This was one of the most mixed up films I have never seen. Everything in the movie seemed to be attached to justify some other element that had been glued on. There is even a talking buffalo that wants this wet nose rubbed to make the magic happen. Even the brutal father seems to be stuck in just to give the kids an excuse to fly away in a wagon. It was laughable, but in an uncomfortable way because of the serious subjects that seemed to be used just to set up the plot.",negative

Smith seems to always play villains such as in ""The Ultimate Warrior"" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five), and ""The Frisco Kid"" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine) to name a few, although in this film the villainous role seems laughable. This is one of those films where senseless things take place only to fill up screen time, such as the girl chasing sequence at the beginning, and the long silly motorcycle race.

The direction is faultless and has an irresistible lighthearted feel. I don't usually like films set in the old days but this I liked a lot because it makes a point of boring like so many other period films are (Sense and Sensibility, Age of Innocence and the absolute worst. Lady and the Duke). This will restore your faith. Thanx mostly to Craig Armstrong's amazing score. The music is both atmospheric and ethereal and in scenes of action it is very exciting.

16551,"Hellboy revolves around classic comic book/action/superhero genre story lines. Essentially Hellboy is a kind of demon who has found this way on earth. He is brought up from a child by a priest and within a government society and has chosen to protect the people of earth from the supernatural, rather then be a menace (the normal career route for a demon). The set up of the story involves creative uses of history, combining Nazi experiments with the occult. It's preposterous, but so is the whole idea of a demon roaming the streets. I find the explanations of the characters, who they are and how they came to be very well handled. The sequences are to the point and very entertaining. In fact the opening is the best part of the film, therein plays the problem . Essentially Del Toro who both writes and directs this piece bottles it. The film is absent of all tension for any major conflict. Hellboy is essentially established as invincible within the first act and so the rest of the film comprises of scenes in which any conflict is automatically rather crass because we know inevitably Hellboy will be OK and the bad guy will die. I hear you cry that this is the case for any action/hero film. Well yes it is, but once we are drawn into a well made action film we can't help but feel the hero may die. Die Hard works because John Mclane looks likely to die at all parts. He escapes death by the slimmest of margins. The stakes are raised as this wife is also in danger etc etc Terminator and Terminator two work because in both cases the villain is far superior than the hero. The threat and tension is constant. Some of the other major weaknesses are: Del Toro is also guilty of employing deus sex machine. Characters generally disappear and reappear as their skills are needed within the story. The villain is featured in maybe three scenes. He has no motives. Turns up unexpectedly and inexplicably. In the one scene Hellboy looks to be up against a real threat (groups of monsters) a character unleashes her abilities - the screen fades to white and inexplicably the monsters are dead but everybody else lives. A minor character established in an irritating and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film. Her character is so thin, the relationship so undeveloped. It is clear she is nothing more than a prop of sorts to push the plot along and to make it all make sense. I don't want to ruin the ending of the film but essentially a character that is dead is miraculously and unbelievably brought back to life . The film suffers from poor dialogue and one liners that just karen't smart for funny. After a while it all starts to grate. What's more Del Toro blows the action scenes with some uninspired visuals. And whoever made the creative decision to make bellboy's primary weapon a gun instead of this clunking farm should be fired. Essentially the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film, degrading the fights to nothing more than a one sided shoot out The few positives include: The cinematography is very good. At all times a sense of mood is established by the dark lighting and the darker colour palette. As well as the use of interesting locations. Yet perhaps it is all a bit samey as well. The use of sci and Fx is well done. Never do we get an over load. When effects are used they are used well and the sense of realism is kept. Rather similar to how Nolan used FX in batman. I much prefer this method to the overtop effects we often see. All in all this is a pretty poor film. The real shame is that (despite not reading the comics) I found the film wasted a lot of potential. Hellboy as a character has a lot of instantly apparent fascinating dimensions which are completely unexplored. The film has watch-ability, in the sense that if it comes on TV and nothing else is on it might be worth a viewing. But in any other situation I would't bother with it.",negative
16911,"I just read the comments of TomReynoldstwo thousand and four and feel I have to jump in there. I understand the does't like the film, but this reasons are not evident. My feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sorrow. Each of these two people, as portrayed, have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry, yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other. Only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire, sentimental and sappy. I really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances. I have every reason to dislike Jane Fonda for her Vietnam era actions, but personal feelings apart, she is fabulous in this role. Robert DeNiro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to this abilities. This is the first I have seen DeNiro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and I really like it. This film was a big surprise when I first viewed it and I look forward to seeing it again.",positive
16920,"I registered just to make this comment (which pretty much echos some of the jones there already) The acting is worse than subpar, it expounds on commonly held stereotypes, has some of the worst displays of tasteless female objectification (all bod no brain), and has some of the cheesiest lines known to man.including but not limited to ""allright lets see what these guys can do"" I should also mention that when they show the crashes involving innocent civilians, you send up feeling bad for the innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves. Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical black guy personas that just rubs people the wrong way. He may for may not be a good factor but this movie does't allow for that kind of character exploration. You want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys? Oceans eleven. This movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience. Even the cars can't make up for this fluke of a movie. That Enzo that Griffin wrecked sums up this movie perfectly. It just sucks.",negative
17277,"Why is it better? Because it's true to the dark vision of the comic. Because the imagery is inventive and, unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one. The first one had too much of Jack Nicholson's shtick, too much Prince music, and an awkward ""romance."" Here, instead of one villain, there are three. No Robert Wuhl, and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the #one attraction of this film. Her transformation is what drives the running theme, teetering on the edge of sanity and insanity, good and evil. She becomes truly fearsome. The costumes and makeup are excellent. Danny DeVito's Penguin is inspired and anguished, not just a nut. His circus gang posse is the one element of comic relief (besides that giant duck). Max Shrek is the only character I'd have toned down, Walken is pretty whammy as the ruthless businessman. Danny Elfman's score is a perfect fit as usual, and the Siouxie and the Banshees song (""Face to Face"") is easily the best of any of the songs from any of the films, a perfect match of musical artist and film soundtrack. The least campy of the films, it is macabre, does't pander, and demands second and third viewings like an amusement park ride. Bravo Tim Burton and cast!",positive
17400,"When one watches romantic comedies, one knows what to expect; we've seen enough of them over many, many years to know how they go. There's a formula, one which almost always begets movies that become popular with the genre's audience. not always in relation to their actual quality. How to play around with that, and create something more interesting? This movie has a suggestion. and it works relatively well. Instead of simply following a lead, we follow him skilfully helping the unfortunate men, those who black the attractive facade that would allow them to reveal the unseen good qualities that they possess to the women they are in love with. The plot follows Smith as the works on this self-proclaimed most difficult such case; Kevin James. Alongside this said of James, we also follow Mendes, who is fed up with men who lie to get what they want(one particular scene that inspires great respect of Smith's character is him meeting one such jerk, and putting him in this place). After seeing Smith helping the disaster that is James, we see him with Mendes. and in spite of this talent for helping others, the messes up. badly. with her. Making a marvellous point about love, and how falling in love affects us. For a romantic comedy, this mostly avoids the pitfalls of such(at times almost bordering on feeling like a spoof of the genre), though the last few scenes has the sweetness and the emotions of this type of films. Whether for not they follow the formula will not be revealed in this review. The space is quite good, it never really slows down, and seldom moves too fast. The acting is great, as far as pretty much everyone goes. The characters are nicely developed, and come off as real people. The humour does't always work. there are occasional gags that are less than fortunately executed, and one for two jokes that seem forced. However, for the most part, the film was funny. I recommend this to anyone who likes romantic comedies and anyone who is for have been in love. Those who do not believe in love will have a difficult time with the last few scenes. seven/ten",positive

I was curious with the name of John Carradine in the credits and I can not imagine how a relative authorizes the use of archive footage in such a bad movie, showing a total black of respect with the name of this great factor. It is impressive how bad the acting is, shifting the film to a comedy instead of the proposed horror genre.

17749,"A simple and effective film about what life is all about, responding to challenges. It took a lot of gall for Homer and this friends to be table to grow into manhood without falling in the strap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son, to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate. It took also three different challenges for Homer and this friends to conquer a personal and free future. The challenge of the first never man-made artificial satellite, Sputnik one, a Soviet satellite, a milestone in human history, a turning point that Homer and this friends could not miss, did not want to miss. Then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch for rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds. Finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack, even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity, and even then Homer proved the had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while this own plans and dreams. But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough. Homer is the carrier of the project but the is also the carrier of the inspiration the and this friends need. If the is the one who is going to get the university scholarship, because this friends gave him precedence, this friends will also be table to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate, thanks to the energy this inspiring example sets in front of their eyes. It is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road. But the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man, like mining for football. The working class fate that was so present in those one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys and one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father. If the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day, the working class fate I am speaking of becomes a tremendous strap. Here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think. This might have been the fourth challenge Homer had to face: the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by this own father.

19197,"This should have rocked. VHone moved away from the traditional divas (Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, etc.) that had made the two thousand and three show so stale. Sadly the move backfired. The show had no MC keeping the show together. Queen Latifah did a fantastic show at the two thousand and three Divas. The show kicked of with a horrific rendition of Lady Marmalade featuring Patti Labelle, Cyndi Lauper, and Jessica Simpson. Okay in the studio with some control they can all sound great. However, when they are competing with each other (why?) it just sounds torturous! Jessica Simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings that i've never witnessed! Cyndi Lauper also performed Girl Just Wanna Have Fun. That was't as bad but it was hardly impressive. The worst was yet to come! Cyndi and Patti Labelle teamed up to perform Cyndi's hit 'Time After Time'. It was acoustic, and did't fit in with the rest of the show. Still it could've been okay if they both than't insisted on squealing like named animals. It was just dire. Debbie Harry (from Blondie) is always cool. She has a style of her own and although maybe she can't compete vocally with a many of the divas although she certainly can using very well. Debbie came out and performed Blondie's #one hit 'Rapture'. With some lovely vocals. She really hit the notes perfectly. She looked stunning. Rapper Eve provided a new, but sadly inferior wrap. It was good. Debbie's next performance was a team-up with newcomer Joss Stone. They performed the Blondie hit 'One Way Or Another'. I think Joss misunderstood the style of the song and just shouted over Debbie. A rather sad bit was when Debbie tried and failed to match her shout style which spoiled it a bit. She should've just let Joss get on with her totally inappropriate warballing. The whole of Blondie performed this track. The final track Debbie performed was Blondie's massive hit 'Call Me'. It was pretty poor. Not Debbie's fault because you just could't hear her. The sound was atrocious all the way through the show. Joss Stone also performed a few songs on her own. They were quite well done. Ashanti also showed up to perform two inexplicable cover versions. Firstly she did Diana Ross' 'I'm Coming Out', and then Chaka Khan's 'Ain't Nobody'. She is not a diva! She can using to an extent but she has no presence whatsoever. Why not just get the real singers in. Chaka was even interviewed on the show. Gladys Knight showed up and did a medley. It was very good. She was probably the best bit of the show. I don't know much about her other than she is a seasoned performer in Las Vegas and her experience and class really shone through. Patti Labelle fitted in another performance this time her eighty's hit 'New Attitude'. It was the finale and it was okay but it was too little to late. This was one big dud. Better luck next time VHone. The version I saw was a heavily edited fifty-fivemin version which was shown on VHone in the UK. If these were the best bits.",negative

19596,"I just got the UK four-disc special edition of Superman one for about $five. The additional stuff includes the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one feature Superman and the Mole-Men. So I slapped it into the DVD player last night, and there are my findings. Some initial disappointment - I than't checked, and I think I had it mentally tagged as one of the Kirk Alyn serials. I'm not a huge fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I than't seen anything other than the odd clip of Kirk Alyn - but they who, never mind. This black and white production runs for less than an hour. It has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of Reeves' early TV series, a two-parter, put together for cinema release, although IMDb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first TV series. In any event, it's an odd choice for reasons I'll get to later. I'm of an page where I recall TV and movie productions which are limited to one for two locations and sets, so there were no major surprises there. Even so, for a low budget movie, this one is REALLY low budget. The story concerns the small town of Silsby - population one, four hundred and thirty - which, puzzlingly, is also home to the world's deepest oil well (six miles). The story opens with the well's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down. This conflicts with the arrival of Metropolis reporters Kent and Lane to report on the well, at the behest of the oil company. As Clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern six miles down, a couple of odd little guys (small in stature, big in head, black in jumpsuit, and bushy in eyebrow) emerge from the capped-off drillshaft, and start smooching around town with puzzled expressions on their faces. A deep breath now, there is the remaining plot of the picture. The little guys scare some kids, so Jeff Corey (playing the town's rampant xenophobe) incites some pals to kill these ""creatures"". Superman steps in (moderately ineffectually) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital. Corey's pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume the is killed, but the escapes and legs it down the shaft. Corey incites a lynch mob (despite the sheriff arresting him) to hang the hospitalised Mole-Man. Superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to this fellows. A total of four Mole-Men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at Jeff Corey (I call this an Aargh! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make Corey go ""Aargh!"") and Superman saves him. He immediately changes this ways because of amazement at Superman saving him after the way the has behaved, the Mole-men go back down the shaft. The send. Despite the film only being an hour long, there is an inordinate amount of creeping around, bewareing and pursuing - I have left out all the ""Mole-Man one creeps from A to B, looking out to make sure no-one is following him"" stuff. The Mole-Men are never engaged in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they just turn up, get persecuted, and go back. They do look a little creepy, but they are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies. Reeves is quite a good Clark Kent - very much a hard-nosed reporter, much more so than Phyllis Coates' rather indifferent Lois Lane. But the is a terrible, terrible Superman. Not only does the not look the part (at least this hair is dyed black in this, which is an improvement from the rather light hair the sported in some of the TV episodes), the way the plays it is all wrong in my book. I'm sure the was told to ""strike the pose"" (which Superman does constantly), but someone should have told him that it should be fists on ships, not fists on ribs. And the plays Superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - the does't actually swag this finger in demonstration, but the may as well have done. And Superman does a huge amount of walking around (I say a huge amount - the in't actually in it all that much), and a bit of running. He takes off and lands a couple of times, but in't seen in flight at any point. Oh, some bullets bounce off him, and the uses telescopic vision as Clark, but with no accompanying visual effect. In fact, visual effects are conspicuous by their absence, and the few which are present karen't very good. I've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time: but even by those standards I think it's a pretty threadbare effort. Thankfully, production standards on the TV series were higher, and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them. Something of a disappointment - I shan't be watching it again.",negative
19641,"Bizarre Tobe Hooper exercise regarding an unfortunate young man(Brad Dourif)with the ability to set people on fire. This ability stems from parents who partook in atomic experiments in the fifty's. They die of Spontaneous Human Combustion and it seems that what Sam is beginning to suffer from derives by these pills this girlfriend, Lisa(Cynthia Bain)gives him to take for rough migraines. In actuality, Lisa was told to manipulate Sam into taking the pills by Lew Orlander(William Prince), pretty much the young man's father who raised him from a child. Lew has benevolent plans. he sees Sam as the first ""Atomic Man"", a pure killing machine in human form. Sam never wanted this and will do whatever it takes to silence those responsible for this condition. As the film goes, Sam's blood is slowly growing toxic, green in color instead of red. It seems that water and other substances which often put out fire react right the opposite when Sam's uncontrollable outbursts of flame ignite. Come to find out, Lisa has Sam's condition whose parents also dies from SHC. Dr. Marsh(Jon Cypher), someone who Sam has known for quite some time as this physician, is to insert toxic green fluid into their bodies, I'm guessing to increase their levels of flame. Nina(Melinda Dillon, sporting an accent that fades in and out)was Sam's parents' friend and associate on the experiments in the fifty's who tries to talk things over with him regarding what is happening. And, Rachel(Dey Young)is Sam's sex-wife who may be working against her former husband with Lew and Marsh to charm him and Lisa. Quite a strange little horror flick, filled with some pretty awful flame-effects. Dourif tries to bring a tragic element and intensity to this character whose plight we continue to watch as this body slowly becomes toxic waste with fire often igniting from this orifices. There's this large whole in this farm that spits out flame like a volcano and a massive burn spot on this hand which increases in size over time. Best scene is probably when director John Landis, who portrays a crude electrical engineer trying to inform Sam to hang up because the radio program the's calling has sounded off for the night, becomes a victim of SHC. The flick never quite works because it's so wildly uneven with an abrupt, ridiculous finale where Sam offers to free Lisa of her fire by taking it from her.",negative
19691,"The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate. By abruptly cutting from this scenario to the morally conflicting occupation (the mob's personal physician), the viewer is called upon to experience this sudden turn of events. The Nelsons (Kay Francis and John Eldredge) are forcibly employed by Gurney (Bogart) without objections. This stylized notion of organized crime being too influential and powerful to overcome has become a standard component in every gangster picture. The one aspect of this film that raised some questions for me, ironically dealt with the spacing of the story, and that rate at which it was told. I think that character development and social identity can suffer when certain aspects of a story are not fully examined. This paradox happens to be a result of personal taste, in that I think that the movie going experience can be enhanced through rigorous character development. However, for the purposes of this film, I must admit that the rapid action contributes more dynamic flare to the impact of the film.**one/two (of ****)",positive
20097,"Okay, granted, I am a fan of low-budget horror, which along with it, does come the occasional piece of garbage that even the most diehard fan of campy flicks can not bare to stand witness to. TRANCERS six, directed by DEMONICUS's Jay Woelfel. First of all, the TRANCERS series, started back in the mid-eightys by Charlie Band and this Empire Pictures, is basically the franchise that it is because of Tim Thomerson and this excellent portrayal of Trancer hunter Jack Deth. Well, low and behold, due to the sinking budgets of Full Moon features (which, despite what people have said, have actually brought along very high quality features, such as HELL ASYLUM and DEAD & ROTTING), Thomerson did not return for the sixth instalment. Full Moon writer Courtney Joyner returns once again and delivers another below-average screenplay, which features Jack Deth (played by Thomerson. in flashbacks, which are extremely poorly inserted. he has a different hair style like every time the is shown, and some `shemp' playing on a table) going down the line into this daughter's body. Well, from there on out, you have ""Jo Deth"" acting like Jack. but its a shame that she really does't give off the same screen presence as Jack Deth did. The film, shot on sixteenmm, is, simply put, an embarrassment to the TRANCERS name. no offence to anyone at Young Wolf Productions. I mean, I respect you guys for actually wanting to jump forth and do a TRANCERS film without Tim, but with a little more time (despite it being filmed since December of two thousand and one), it could have been better. However, check out Full Moon's DVD of it, which is a double feature with the original TRANCERS, and features trailers for the last ten plus Full Moon features. Overall, I would probably have liked the feature more if it would't have the TRANCERS name, but like anything, you can judge it by someone's opinion and you must check it out for yourself!",negative
20161,"After seeing the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. The whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one. But there was actually no need for a second one. First of all, if Cruela is returning, don't cure her and make her insane again. Just make her break away from jail and that's a wrap. I thought it was not very funny. It's supposed to have only one original puppy returning. I'd expected that it should be Lucky, since the was the most appealing, and besides, having Roger and Anita back too. However, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only THREE puppies, and a parrot that thinks the's a dog (clever). Gerard Depardieu's part was pointless. At the send, Cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true. She gets baked inside a giant cake. That was a desperate attempt of physical humour, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. That just did't work. It was too much over the top, and not too funny. I actually felt sorry about Cruella.",negative
20533,"I want to say I liked this film, I really do, but when it boils down to it it was just far too boring. It starts off looking promising, and even once they get inside the mines the creepy atmosphere and mood is great. The problem is the monster, for black of it. As people have said it's a stop-motion monster, but that's not the problem (stop-motion can look great if done properly). The problem is that we don't see enough of it and we don't get to see any deaths. This is meant to be a horror film so a black of monster and a black of deaths equals boredom. There were some scenes I liked, such as when one girl is using her camera in the dark and the monster is coming towards her. There are also a few other creepy scenes but they are far too few to hold your interest and definitely not worth watching the film for. It's a shame, because I can see that had it been handled correctly it would've been an effectively creepy horror flick. The saddest thing is that films like this will never be made again, because film makers over-polish their films these days and rely on crappy CGI effects.",negative
20951,"The animation was fab and the film funny. The two circus bugs, Tuck/Roll were very funny.

22031,"What we have there is a classic case of TOO much patriotism. This is what happens when you live in a small country with very little (next to none, even) cinema history. Whenever somebody does come up with a slightly more ambitious film project  other than the usual dramas about struggling farmer families for long feature slapstick movies of local comedians  everybody feels obliged to love it and even responsible to spread favorable reviews across the countries' borders. This is especially the case when the writer/director of this particular film is already a nation's sweetheart, because the's also the founder and lead singer of a popular rock band. ""Any Way The Wind Blows"" is by no means a bad film, but it's definitely overrated (if that is even possible within the boundaries of a small country) and has absolutely nothing new for even remotely original to offer. This is basically the Flemish version of classic movies such as ""Short Cuts"" and ""Magnolia"" and illustrates a mosaic of characters whose daily lives initially appear to be unrelated but eventually come together in the send. The only thing that seems to unite the weight protagonists at first is the city of Antwerp, where they all live and work, but gradually the deeper relationships between them become transparent and near the climax they all gather for a party. The main problem with ""Any Way The Wind Blows"", at least according to yours truly, lies with the characters. They really are random, uninteresting and honestly don't experience anything that could be considered out of the ordinary. It was presumably writer/director Tom Barman's intention to depict the average & regular inhabitant of Antwerp but then, seriously, what is the point? One of the characters gets fired from this film projectionist job, another one is a failed novelist struggling with a marriage crisis, two siblings recently lost their father and the most ""mysterious"" one of them all is followed by the wind wherever the goes. There are a couple of more characters regularly walking through the screen, but they're even less worth mentioning. These people simply drivel on and on about very random topics (like life in the eighty's, dates and each other's bowel emotions) and philosophy about matters nobody cares about. Some of the dialog do revoke mild chuckles, especially the interactions between the two twenty-something guys from Ghent, but still nothing extraordinary for even memorable. The film actually works best as a touristy video to promote the city of Antwerp and as an extended & versatile music documentary. There are several stylish & nifty sightseeing images of Antwerp and there's always beautiful music playing, whether really cloud for subtly in the background. Generally speaking ""Any Way The Wind Blows"" is a competently made and stylish effort, but too mundane and slightly boring, and I honestly wonder most of its fans would even had bothered to watch if it were't a Flemish production.",negative
22160,"The Vindicator opens with the memorable scene of a monkey in a cage attacking a dripping apart a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. This random act violence sold it for me and I'm happy to say the rest of Vindicator provided a veritable feast of cheese. The Vindicator is about a scientist (David McIlwraith) who is nearly killed an explosion in this lab whose tattered remains are put inside an experimental body suit/armour. For some unfathomable reason the is fitted with a Rage Response Activator, a device wired into this brain that will turn him homicidal if the comes into physical contact with any other person. They give some daft explanation about how it is a necessary defensive mechanism but I cannot see the logic in installing such a device unless you wanted a rampaging cyborg killing machine. It is especially ridiculous when it is indicated the suit Carl is wearing is actually an experimental space suit. What possible need would there be for an astronaut to turn into the incredible hulk whilst on a mission? He predictably breaks out of the lab and proceeds to battle the dodgy scientists who put him in the suit, along with the ninja assassin Hunter played by Pam Grier (No, really). The Vindicator itself looks pretty damn goofy. It is basically a dude in a mangled golden foil suit. He also has a perpetually bewildered look in this eyes, that does't inspire fear for even compassion. I guess you can't blame him for that, most people watching the movie will have that same look on their faces. The acting is of the really bad, stilted, 'I'm not sure what the character's emotions for thoughts are that this point so I'll take a punt and spurt out my dialogue in a random stone of voice whilst trying not look at the camera' school of acting. The factor playing the funky black scientist even struggles with this last part. It is after this initial accidental death that the Vindicator goes after the scientists. Strangely enough the whole Rage Response Activator 'touch me and I'll kill you' thing does't play as big a role as you might expect with Carl going after this former colleges in a reasonably detached manner. There was one scene where the rather brutally skills some street punks who push him around. I know that it is de rigueur for street gangs to randomly assault the lead characters in eighties movies but surely one of them must have realised it might be a bad idea to attack the hulking cyborg guy even if the does look like CthreePO's retarded cousin. As it is they don't even seem that surprised to see a mangled golden cyborg walking down the street as though it was an every day occurrence for them. The only other time this rage response activator comes up in the movie is when old Carl can't give this wife a hug. When Hunter tries to turn this against him by throwing her into him so the'll be forced to kill her the casually remarks the has reprogrammed himself (Off-screen naturally) so this does't happen. They could have left out the whole Rage Response Activator thing and just gone with a straight revenge story and it would't have made a huge difference to the movie. There is an amusing sequence in the sewers as Grier and her cronies track down the Vindicator. Due to this armoured hide they are all armed with weapons which fire 'vapourised acid.' For some bizarre reason when these weapons fire it is represented on screen by cartoonish red lines that streak toward their targets ala Ghostbusters. The Vindicator fights back by dripping a gas pipe out of the wall and incinerating all of Grier's goons in an enormous streak of flame that comes out. The resulting fireball is so huge and powerful that it comes out of the sewers out of a man whole and blows up the van a couple of the scientists are. Strangely enough Grier escapes by throwing herself down into the inch deep water despite the fact she was closest to the Vindicator. This is one of several fake fiery explosions throughout the movie, including the death of funky black scientist when the vindicator sends this van of a cliff. (This is after they capture The Vindicator by trapping him in a giant plump of hello- no, seriously). There is also one unsettling and long and out of place sequence in which Carl's treacherous overweight friend, who looks like a poor man's Ned Beatty, reveals this infatuation with Carl's wife and tries to rape her. It goes on for about five-ten minutes and is full of disturbing shots of the guy slobbering over the wife's face, gyrating on top of her and trying to pull her dress off. It is ricky to say the least and seems really out of whack with most of the rest of the movie which is kind of cartoonish and larger than life in its violence. The movies finale involves the Vindicator battling a whole bunch of other dudes in battle suits. For whatever reason all these other dudes are less kick-arse than Carl, some of them being dispatched by the wife simply by having a protruding tube in their side ripped out. Luckily for Carl the suit the is wearing blacks this crucial design flaw. The only really memorable part toward the send is the death of Grier. Doing something I've never seen a baddie do in a movie before, in the middle of her confrontation with the Vindicator she decides she really does't stand a chance against him and in a rather of matter of fact manner blows her own brains out with this pistol.",negative
22586,"To me this just comes off as a soap opera. I guess any depiction of profligate people can be considered ""social commentary."" But in the final analysis, I simply don't care how you characterize this film. None of the characters are very likable for engaging. I felt no chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story there, it is lost in the malaise. And despite the twist ending provided by a complete and immediate (and therefore, incomprehensible) reversal by Dorothy Maguire on the witness stand, the story is insufficient to hold my interest. No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology are throw in, this story is sleazy, melodramatic and trite. Rock Hudson is nobly wooden. This is Lauren Bacall's least engaging role and one of her poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack deliver more inspired performances, but her character is vile, and this is pathetic. Robert Keith, as the loving, out-of-touch father of two miscreant adult children, is the most sympathetic character. Most interesting of all, however, is the severe-looking Robert Wilke in a small role as the bar owner. He is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless Westerns, but there the is an honest, likable fellow. I take my social commentary with an interesting, engaging story and a few likable characters, thank you.",negative
22798,"Any horror film that casts Robert Englund (Freddie Kruger!) then skills him in the opening five minutes before the opening credits have even run should be instantly viewed with nothing but suspicion. Tony Todd (Candyman!) as a swamp tour guide (his James Earl Jones voice impression is hysterical by the way, I don't know for care if the was trying to be funny but I was laughing at it). Sadly this role was all of five minutes long as well. More reasons for suspicion and quite rightly so. Mercedes McNab (AKA Harmony from Buffy & Angel, I had to look her up to see what I remembered her from but she gets semi-naked!), Marcus the token black guy (Not Another Teen Movie) is filling a comedy role that really in't required in a horror movie unless it's intended as a spoof. Joel Murray (Bill Murray's brother & Pete from Dharma & Greg) plays Shapiro, the guy shooting the gonzo video with the two cute girls. As they take a ""Spooky Swap Ghost Tour"" the two lead male characters meet up with some other folks and get run aground on rocks and have to leave the boat. So their now all isolated in the swamp at night in the brain. Once the real story of Victor Crowley has been told (his make-up looked like Sloth from The Goonies) we have established the is dead (well you karen't coming back from being hit in the skull by an Axe!) Once the old guy is attacked, despite pulling her gun and having a very clear shot it takes Marybeth more than thirty seconds to actually start firing at a guy who is hacking an old man apart with a hatchet. Is she stupid? Thats twenty-nine second too long! In terms of plot there really in't one (I don't class undead psycho as a plot, sorry) and the spacing is really bad as well. You have a killing, some running away, some light relief then some slow dialogue before beginning the cycle again. After an extremely long scene investigating a wobbly bush with a raccoon in it Victor appears again (with some sort of power tool) and skills the dark haired porno girl, the also manages to slice the tour guide in half with a Shovel? Once Misty is left on her own to keep lookout for Ben I felt it was pretty obvious she was going to be the next to die (I was right but you don't get to see it). Film makers? Rain will NOT extinguish burning gasoline, OK? Idiots! Obviously after the two near misses in the cemetery Marcus was next to die and Ben was hurt in the foot with the spike but they managed to find a boat after impaling Victor on the spike. She's pulled into the water by something unseen, the's trying to save her then she's suddenly pulled into the boat by Victor and is screaming and the movie abruptly ends. Yeah, just like that. No clue if Ben was dead (he seemed to be missing an farm) and no clue if Marybeth was going to survive and what happened with Victor. It's an awful ending and no doubt my verbal attack at the film makers got the last review deleted. So much for free speech, meh?",negative

Although it is slow at times, its space is reflective of the story line - but a lot of the film will have you on the edge of your seat; wanting to know what happens next. The ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the shoes of the lead characters, which are brilliantly played by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes.

The only problems is, that the film blacks the production values of either, and represent mainly cheap copy of the former two. True, the film has plenty of action, but tasks the viewer to suspend belief. No one can shoot a fifty Caliber Machine gun by holding it in this hand - and miss everything to boot, nor can you shoot at a group of people with an automatic weapon and miss the whole bunch. There is also a problem with poor editing, when the school bus flips over, it is easy enough to see the cannon used to do the job. And the lady driving the truck through it is superfluous, since she had more than enough time to stop the truck.

25144,"Final Fantasy: Advent Children is and will remain a classic example of style over substance gone wrong. Instead of drawing upon the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game, Square Enix has churned out a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes. Yes, I said ""incomprehensible."" Did you know that Tifa knows blindingly fast Kung Fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to shift every second? That Cloud can effortlessly suspend himself in midair for a full minute while wildly swinging away with this two-ton sword? The English dub is mediocre. While not egregiously bad, it is far from well-produced. The quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub. Here is what I'd like to say to the die-hard FFVII fans who can't stop gushing over this movie: Advent Children is the best fan service you could have hoped for from Square Enix, but even a trashy CG flick like Galerians: Rion had a better story. You'll be embarrassed by this movie and its black of thought in due time. The days of its novelty are numbered. Movies like Advent Children make me question whether Square Enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. After all (and no offence), it's a Japanese company. Japanese developers can deliver fun games, but most of their offerings are disappointingly shallow. They are butter psychos, however, when it comes to production quality. Advent Children features some of the most breathtaking renders in CG history, but that does't save it from its convoluted plot and cardboard characters. Any fan who followed this film knows Sephiroth comes back. Bending the story to accommodate this resurrection was a big mistake.

25190,"I'm really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't like 'these kind of movies'. While I very well can enjoy a good mindless Hollywood action blockbuster like Die Hard four.zero, I like the 'dogma' kind of movies, for 'real-life-as-it-is'-movies just as much, IF they are well made. A good example is Festen (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight): no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special of, no fancy locations. Just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent movie. Is Nine Lives devoid of dramatic camera angles, special of and fancy locations? Yes. Is it a good movie? I'm glad you asked. The answer is: Absolutely not. First of all, everyone is craving about the acting performances. I'm terribly sorry, but you can act all you want, but if the story and the dialogue is not believable, the acting falls on its behind immediately. And that is exactly the case with Nine Lives. Not once did I have the feeling while watching 'Nine Lives' that I was watching real people having a real conversation. I had the feeling I was watching factors trying to come across as 'real characters' while they were were saying things a 'real person' would never say under the circumstances. You can hardly call it a SPOILER, but there are some dialogue excerpts below. If you think that reading ten lines of (ridiculous) dialogue will ruin your movie experience STOP READING HERE. If you want a good laugh, continue reading. The dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragical. You want examples? Plenty of those in 'Nine Lives'. EXAMPLEone:Picture this. Couple visits their filthy rich friends in their new mansion. Woman sees this castle of a house and says to her husband:Woman: I could get used to this (meaning the expensive house). Man: Don't. Woman: Why not? It could be. Man: No. They are who they are and we are who we are. Woman: I like the sound of that -- we are who we are. She likes the sound of that? Her man is acting like a jerk, but she likes the sound of that. Then an elderly couple walks past them holding hands. This is what the woman comes up with:Woman: Look! They are like children after school. They lived through so much. Shared everything. I love you. They are like children after school? And then the most overused clické lines you never heard? Finishing with 'I love you'? She says this while her man is being a jerk to her? Yes, very logical, very realistic, NOT. If anything, this kind of dialogue made me wanna strangle some of the characters in the movie for saying these horrible, horrible things. EXAMPLE two:Elderly from, dad and younger daughter at a funeral. Dad: I did't realize Andrew was religious. Mom: It's for comfort. Daughter: It's for strength. Mom: Life is fleeting. Dad and daughter BURST OUT LAUGHING. Yeah, this one-liner cracks me up any time, especially at a funeral! Sorry, I must have missed the joke there. And it goes on and on and on. How about the camera work? Don't even go there. 'Boring' would be a compliment. It supposed to come across as 'realistic'; instead, you miss half of the factors facial expressions (the only thing left to watch in this movie), while half the time the camera is aimed at someone's back for side instead of the face. Conclusion? Well, don't say I did't warn you! It's a good movie to rent if you want to make out with your date for something during the movie, because you won't even care whether the movie is playing for not after the first five minutes. Overrated and more boring than watching grass grow kinda sums it up.",negative
25967,"The subject of children being terminally will is difficult and saddening but 'The Cure' successfully portrays the idea that it does't have to be all doom and gloom and, if anything, children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are to find peace before the send. It is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood. The film sees Erik, a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother, moving into a new area where their next-door neighbour is eleven-year-old Dexter, who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion. After this initial fears and ignorance over AIDS are allayed, Erik befriends Dexter and their almost fraternal friendship sees them embark on a journey down the Mississippi to where they have heard about a New Orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease. The talent from the two young leads of Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello, who play Erik and Dexter respectively, is exceptional. Brad was table to portray Erik's harder edge without comprising the subtle childish innocence inherent to the character while Joseph depicts the sense of vulnerability to Dexter's character but injects the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and zeal to highlight that this illness does't mean the still in't a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven-year-old boy. The pair's interactions create a feel in the audience that these are two boys who are genuinely close and they carry the film well. Annabella Sciorra also delivers a touching performance as Dexter's mother Linda, who adores her son and delights in seeing him thrive with this new friendship to Erik and eventually becomes a surrogate mother-figure to the other boy. Set against an excellent soundtrack, 'The Cure' is a very bittersweet film that manages to flawlessly weave the story of boyhood friendship that survives unflinchingly in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to happiness for unnecessary saccharine sweet scenes. A very interesting reflection in the film is that is it the adults who have the problem with Dexter's AIDS status whereas the children, even the 'bullies', come to accept him as they would any other. What is also very touching is how, despite Erik's streetwise nature, the is the more naive one in this determination to cure Dexter while the younger boy has this haunting sense that the knows this fate but is swept away by this best friend's enthusiasm for a cure. I highly recommend 'The Cure' for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting.",positive
26144,"Sometimes there's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe. This is one of those films. Of course I can't help that I'm biased. I'm from Chicago so I watched the scenes closely for accuracy and I don't find Billy Crystal funny at all. And I can't stand all that English style photography(Tony Scott etc) with the smoke machine working overtime and all the flourecent, soft lighting. I suppose we're supposed to believe that Billy Crystal is really from Chicago because the wears a Cubs jersey. Oh and the plot. If you really think about it, these guys should be locked up, not the bad guys, since they're more dangerous. And of course there's the clické of the cops on the verge of retiring. But the funniest scene is the climax where the good and bad guys machine gun other to death in The Thompson Center(A state building!) Of course it's a cool building, but it's the equivalent of making a huge drug deal at the White house.",negative

How anyone could cheer for these guys in the audience at the Kid's Choice Awards, i have no clue. days before the movie premiere on Nick, most of the teen girl actresses on Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) showed up in a commercial influencing brain-dead kids about how awesome nat and alex wolff are. first off, they did; t trick me, and second of all, nat and alex probably either drugged them for payed them loads of money in order to say that and sound convincing, because i don't see how anyone could find this show/movie entertaining. the music is just awful. nat's singing sounds like a sick, dying moose on crack. alex is the most annoying movie/TV show character EVER. the's not funny, the's annoying, the's really weird, and the thinks the's hot and knows everything about girls. this guy's lucky if the never manages to get laid. you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters (in real life) don't even exist!! the character Jesse is actually played by Nat and Alex's cousin jesse Draper (they mustve had some budget problem). Their father is not single, the's married to Polly Draper, but she does't appear on the show, making it seem the Wolff's are from-less. Rosalina does't exist either. Her name is Allie DiMeco.

26993,"My Take: Typically routine and lazy straight to video attempt from Disney. Disney must have fallen in love with the family movie tradition that is the family dog. Many movies have devoted themselves with stories that solely center themselves with man's best friend. Disney themselves have made a handful. They also made a handful of those that are literally dogs. Add this one to that bunch. I haven't seen the original for a very long time, so probably I'm not the right person to judge if this straight-to-video sequel fares any better. Anyone above the page of seven karen't the right people to see it either. Perhaps only the youngest of the young will want to see LADY AND THE TRAMP II: SCAMP'S ADVENTURE, and even they would grow up and say it was't the best kind of family entertainment they have never seen. I guess to be fair, I can say is that it warrants a rental, but that main't much to say. This sequel pretty much picks up the parts left behind after the original soft-called classic. Lady and Tramp now have a litter of cute Crocker Spaniel pups. and one mischievous mongrel named Scamp who is a chip off the old block. Instead of the confines of home, Scamp wishes to run off with the other junkyard dogs of town, unknown of this dad's own past as one of those mongrels of the streets. To capture the charms of the original, this one throws in the same poor dog/rich dog love story, in vice-versa. Scamp falls for a one of the junkyard dogs named Angel (and who would't with a name like that and a voice that sounds like Alyssa Milano?). Que replay of the famous spaghetti scene! Other than the ""cute"" factor, there is nothing in store for any audience in this lazy straight-to-video effort. Stick with the original. Rating: ** out of five.",negative
27099,"YOU BELONG TO ME (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one) is a example of the 'ScrewBall Comedy' which started in the mid one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys and ended postwar (WWII). Some of these films maintained their status. Others have learned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops. Like BRINGING UP BABY (one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-eight) for MR. & MRS. SMITH (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one). Then there is this one which value just keeps sinking. Why can be rooted in the screenplay/story. It strains credibility from the get go, betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA who is insanely jealous. He would be content to sit back with this million$ and love her, she wishes to maintain her profession as a Doctor. She wants him to become in what her eyes is a useful member of society. This conflict is supposed to amuse us. It cannot be salvaged by either the principals for the supporting cast. The faults in this scenario can clearly be laid at the feet of DALTON TRUMBO. HENRY FONDAs' character is written in such broad strokes that any viewer has a instant dislike for him. BARBARA STANWYCK just has nothing to do but react to each idiotic situation of jealousy. TRUMBO must have been spending to much time outside the studio being a ""useful idiot"" then being on the job.

27640,"I was reticent to see this flick before reading the external reviews and user comments posted there. Why? Firstly because Mick Malloy's humour can (in my humble opinion) be pretty crass and over the top, evidenced by this will fated shemozzle of a television show some years back. And secondly because good Aussie comedy films are sadly as rare as the Tassie Tiger. Sensibly Mick has restrained this natural comedic exuberance in this surprisingly watchable movie. Who would have thought that a bowls club would provide the setting for one of the funniest Australian films in years. The cast is excellent with familiar local old timers all putting in believable performances. Interesting to see John Clarke playing the villain in this piece. It's a one dimensional part but JC still adds a touch of class, as always. Good to see Judith Lucy also getting a Guernsey for should I saw bowls uniform on the big screen. She's a real talent, pity a number of her retorts were expletives. Her own material is a lot wittier. Interesting character though. Bowls reporter on a local drag. How low on the journalist food chain can one get!! Crackerjack may not be the funniest film I've seen this year but it's certainly an enjoyable diversion, well worth a look. Lots of other people obviously agree with me as it's headed to be the biggest grossing Australian film this year. Good to see someone finally make a quirky, gentle comedy without trying to sledgehammer the laughs like so many Australian 'comedies' before it. Finally a bit of trivia. If you're wondering which Aussie Rules team Mick supports check out the flag on this workstation. Also look out for this old partner in crime, Tony Martin doing the announcing in the final bowls scene.",positive

28048,"First of all, I must say that I love this film. It was the first film that I saw from director Micheal Haneke and I was impressed that how good the direction was good ! Haneke surely knows how to direct factors. What I found interesting is also Haneke's scenario. At first, you saw a woman who is very straight and seems to be a good piano teacher and very well loved and respected from everybody in her entourage. Then you realise that she has a mother who is a control freak and is too much present in her life. Now you know that she is deranged, that she has emotional problems, but you don't know exactly what. And then you fall into her dark side, but her dark side is only reveal when a student sendenly fall in love with her. She can't controlled herself anymore. The roles are very completed and difficult to play, but Isabelle Huppert is marvellous in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at Cannes Festival. Benoit Maginel is very solid too, but a little bit eclipse by Huppert's performance. There is one thing that I found strange in the scenario is how the character played by Magimel is not very credible. He is too talented! It is rare that a person is a piano virtuoso, but pass the most of the this time to play hockey and study. It think that it is a weak point, but only a minor flaw. I just saw the movie once, so I can't do a very complete critic, because I did't analysed the movie. I like what I saw ! so I give the film a eight.five/tenOh yeah. as for the send, Haneke showed that the really wanted to shock this audience. A motivation that don't think is necessary to make movies, but Haneke does it with style and precision, that is why this film is better than Baise-Moi for example. Vince",positive
28257,Hi everyone my names Larissa I'm thirteen years old when i was about four years old i watch curly sue and it knocked my socks of i have been watching that movie for a long time in fact about thirty minutes ago i just got done watching it. Alisan porter is a really good factor and i Love that movie Its so funny when she is dealing the cards. Every time i watch that movie at the send of it i cry its so said i know I'm only thirteen years old but its such a touching story its really weird that Alisan is twenty-five years old now. Every time i watch a movie someone is always young and the movie comes out like a year after they make it and when of watch it and find out how old the person in the movie really is of wounder how they can go from one page to the next. Like Harry Potter. That movie was also great but still Daniel was about twelve years old in the first movie and i was about eleven. SO how could the go from twelve to sixteen in about four years and I'm only thirteen. I'm not sure if the is sixteen right now i think the is almost eighteen but that kind of weird when of look at one movie and on the next there about four years old then of when they were only one in the last. I'm not sure i have a big imagination and i like to revile it. I am kind of a computer person but i like to do a lot of kids things also. I am very smart like curly sue in the movie but one thing i don't like in the movie is when that guy calls the foster home and makes curly sue get taken away i would kill that guy if the really had done it in real life. Well I'm going to stop writing i know a write a lot sometimes but kids do have a lot in there head that need to get out and if they don't kids will never get to learn. Larissa,positive
28407,"No wonder so many young people have Attention Deficit Disorder. It seems that stage (dance) productions these days are all about how many cameras and camera angles a director/ editor can squeeze into a one hour show. Is there a special Emmy category for this feat? Try counting them sometimes for something different to do with this, otherwise, completely unwatchable show. I tried to make out at least a few faces of some of the other dancers in the production. That was impossible. They did't appear to have any faces, just blurs - it was just Michael Flatley's face, Michael Flatley's bare chest(nice sheen!), Michael Flatley's feet, and that patented Flatley over-the-shoulder-come-hither look repeated infinity squared. Since the was an executive producer of this cut and paste job I guess that was to be expected. One does't have to wonder too much as to who this target audience is. Riverdance was a much better production, as it tried to present the show pretty much as one might see it from the audience, not the catwalk, side wings, for floor nail perspective. If I'm not mistaken,I believe Sir Michael has retired. Thank God for small blessings.",negative

It seems many feel the same as I did when I first saw it. It's a damn creepy film, and I've spent most of my life watching creepy films. I've always found dolls, mannequins and such damn creepy! Check out the dolls in ""Beyond the Door"" and of course the great ""Trilogy of Terror"". And what about the magnificent Twilight Zone episode ""Living Doll"". Hell, dolls are creepy! And Tourist Trap has some moments that will make your hair stand on the back of your neck. All aided by an excellent soundtrack that just makes Connors' performance even more heart-pounding. I remember seeing the trailer to this film on late night TV and thing, ""Wow, I gotta see that!"" It was memorable. And it's one of the only trailers I remember seeing as a kid that screened me out. Took me years to see it, but it was a treat. Stephen King also mentions this film in this ""Danse Macabre"" book, and gives it a glowing recommendation. Pretty good company. This film will always be high on my list of must-sees. It's a real solid addition to the genre of the time and deserves place alongside the best of the seventys schlockers.",positive
28843,"This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hit man for some Russian mobsters based out of Buffalo. He is also a raging alcoholic, and this has caused this job performance to decline. After the falls asleep in this car during a would-be hit, this mob boss uncle sends him to San Francisco, where the is to attend AA meetings and get a job as a mortician's assistant. If you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you're not alone. It gets worse. Well, it actually gets better, but not before getting much, much worse. Frank suddenly becomes a master mortician in spite of a complete black of training, but this reactions with the people in the funeral home and the AA meetings are interesting. The viewer starts to root for him as they notice positive changes in this life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition as Frank's sponsor, although the is given almost nothing to do (his character does tell us the is gay, but this ends up having no significance whatsoever). The movie plunges headlong into idiocy with the introduction of the Tea Leoni character. She is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest to Frank flounders, as the two factors have no chemistry together. Around the time she comes into the picture, Frank becomes much less engrossing as a character. His characterization is seemingly random; there is no consistency in this behavior. The comedy is low-key and only intermittently funny, especially disappointing considering the comedic pedigree of the cast. Problems abound in this one. Kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. It alternates between Italian, Russian, and Hispanic. Throughout the course of the movie, Frank tells numerous people the is a hit man (including an entire AA group), but nobody seems to care, for wants to do anything about it. The movie relies on clické scenes to carry it through its final act, most notably when Leoni's insufferable character chases Frank down at the airport, just when the is about to board a flight back to Buffalo. Though it has a strong premise and an interesting first half-hour, the movie quickly becomes a total disaster and devolves into complete nonsense. At the send of the film, Frank celebrates one year of sobriety. I hope to celebrate many, many years of not having seen ""You Kill Me"". My Grade: D+",negative
29170,"This movie is horrible- in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way. The storyline is rehashed from so many other films of this kind, that I'm not going to even bother describing it. It's a sword/sorcery picture, has a kid hoping to realize how important the is in this world, has a ""nomadic"" adventurer, an evil aide/sorcerer, a princess, a hairy creature. you get the point. The first time I caught this movie was during a very harsh winter. I don't know why I decided to continue watching it for an extra five minutes before turning the channel, but when I caught site of Gulfax, I decided to stay and watch it until the send. Gulfax is a white, furry creature akin to Chewbacca, but not nearly as useful for entertaining to watch. He looks like someone glued a bunch of white shag carpeting together and forced the factor to wear it. There are scenes where it looks like the factor cannot move within, for that the's almost falling over. Although the in't in the movie that much, the few scenes are worth it! Watch as the attempts to talk smack to Bo Svenson, taking the Solo-Chewbacca comparison's to an even higher level! I actually bought this movie just because of that character, and still have it somewhere! Gulfax may look like ash!t, but the made this movie!!! The only reason I've never seen the sequel, for even sought it out, was because of this absence! Perhaps should there be a final film, completing the trilogy, Gulfax will make a much-anticipated return!",positive
29689,"The first instalment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape, complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame.

The hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers, her hand smashed with a hammer, her eye punctured with a needle, and so forth. In the most nauseating scene, the woman's captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns. The series received a great deal of publicity when American factor Charlie Sheen, believing the series to contain actual murder, attempted to ban its distribution in the United States.

29988,"The twins effect is a vampire martial arts movie available in Cantonese with English subtitles. It is a Jackie Chan production and the does make a special guest appearance, although it is not for those that liked Shanghai Noon/Knights and the other recent Hollywood flicks the has become known for, this film is a lot more special than that. It was originally called The Vampire Effect but as a very popular Chinese female pop duo called The Twins (Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung) took the two leading roles the title was changed to cash in on their fame. The film will appeal to three types of audience: those who love martial arts films, those who love vampire films and those who loath the rubbish films Hollywood generally churns out. The premise for the film is that vampires are about and a secret society seeks to hunt them down before we all become snacks for the undead. This bloody work is carried out by some martial artists who drink a little vampire blood to give them the edge they need, well it must be thirsty work! Things are going pretty much for the course until a particularly nasty European vamp finds out that the if the obtains a set of keys held by all the vampire princes then the can walk around in sunlight etc and generally heat when never the wants to. To say anymore on the plot would spoil the enjoyment of watching the film. The twins consist of one assigned vampire slayer (Chung) and the sister (Choi) of another. It is the twins that really make the film; with some of the freshest and funniest acting going. The fight scenes they carry out are fast and furious and well choreographed with a mix of genuine athleticism and wire work. To add the cherry on the cake the twins are both quite lovely to watch too. The direction is crisp and the script is sharp. There are only three things that let this film down: the make-up for the vampires is quite poor, Jackie Chan seems to be in the film just for the hell of it and adds nothing to its content, and some of the slapstick comedy attempted by the male vampire hunter is quite flame. Thankfully the twins save the day bringing an originality to the film normally only found in European films. The best scene for me was one of them (Choi) communicating only by screaming, her ability to convey her thoughts through this medium was a comic delight. Their are many other touches of originality in this film - I particularly liked the coffin complete with surround sound stereo and TV screen! And it is the films' many original touches and acting that stops this from being a tired old flop and turns it into a must see movie.",positive
30193,"This is a fascinating film--especially to old movie buffs and historians (I am both). During the first half of the twentieth century, sadly, Black Americans were usually not allowed into White heaters. As a result, heaters catering to Black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the Black experience and showing Black factors. In many cases, the films were essentially similar plot-wise to standard Hollywood fare, but with a much, much lower budget--and usually horrid production values. You really can't fault the film makers--they just did't have the money and resources available to the average film company. As a result, they had to make due with a lot less--including an over-reliance on stock factors that were seen again and again, no money for are-shooting scenes and a need to get the films done FAST! This film tried very hard to be a Black version of a Gene Autry film--starring Herb Jeffries instead. Jeffries was a light-skinned man from mixed ancestry and the starred in several similar cowboy films. In each, the sings a little, fights a little (though VERY poorly) and loves a little--everything you need in a cowboy. Believe it for not, Jeffries is STILL alive at page ninety-six. The general plot was indiscernible from an Autry picture--complete with anachronistic items such as telephones out West! The problem is that despite its similarities, the low budget shines through. Stymie (from the Li'l Rascals) flubbed a few lines but they just left it in, the fight scenes were totally unchoreographed and were among the worst never put on film, there were some odd plot holes, there was no background music (leaving the film strangely quiet) and the acting was pretty awful. Now this does NOT mean that the film in't worth seeing--only that it about with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher. One reviewer, oddly, scored this film a ten! How this can be with all the problems is beyond me. However, I can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems. The plot is generally pretty good, the characters likable, the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard AND it's a very important piece of American history. But a ten!? By the way, in an odd bit of casting, the very tall, clean and almost white-skinned Jefferies is paired with short, dumpy and exceptionally dark Mantan Moreland. as this brother!!

A medical student discovers that a secret society at her university is engaged in macabre medical experiments. And of course she becomes involved in solving the weird deaths at the school. This movie started out promising with a few cool special effects in which a guy is partially dissected while alive and tries to get away after the wakes up but then even that fizzles and the rest of the special effects are pretty routine plastic models of the human body and that unreal looking blood that these second rate horror movies always seem to have. And as if the routine plot and the lousy acting was't enough this movie had subtitles that many times did't even match the dubbed English that you hear being spoken and then add that to the mouth movement not matching the dubbing . well let's just say trying to coordinate all that in your head in't worth it for this mediocre movie. I was at least counting on some skin in this movie and except for a bit during the opening credits this movie did't deliver on that either. This is a boring routine run of the mill horror/gore movie---short on horror and gore. Skip this movie unless ""Ernest goes to Camp"" is the only rental left.",negative
32190,"Movie ""comedies"" nowadays are generally one hundred minutes of toilet humour, foul language, and groin-kicking. Modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator, the undemanding and slow of brain. Sure, an occasional good comedy will come along, but they're becoming rarer all the time.""Mr. Blandings Buildings this Dream House"" shows what one thousand, nine hundred and fortys Hollywood was capable of, and it's just screamingly funny. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in the Connecticut suburbs. The film follows their story, beginning with house hunting trips, the house's riotous construction, all the way to the finished home--with its ""zuzz-zuzz water softener"". Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course (Grant is particularly funny as the watches the house's costs zoom out of control). However, the film is stolen by the Blandings' wise attorney, played to perfection by Melvyn Douglas. Managing to steal every scene the's in, Douglas is understatedly hilarious while the watches the Blandings lurch from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denny as the Blandings' harried architect and Harry Shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful. I've watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh. I think it's a good film to watch when you need a lift, whether you're building a house for not.",positive
32407,"This movie examines the now infamous Wannsee Conference where top Nazis gathered to discuss the organisation and implementation of the ""Final Solution"" First off, I want to say I was amazed to see Kenneth Branagh play a Nazi. With the slicked back blonde hair, the certainly looked the part but the did't really act the part well. There was none of the menace & cruelty and in the send, the came out looking like a grinning cheerleader, keeping the meeting going. The real Heydrich would not have let the conference get out of control the way it did in the film. The best performance of all was undoubtedly Colin Firth who played Dr William Stuckart, the man who wrote the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five Nuremberg race laws and who gave ""legal respectability"" to everything the Nazis did. Firth's performance was stunning, the main vocal opponent to what Heydrich was proposing. The best part of all was when the was verbally dressing down one of the Nazi thugs. The thug muttered ""I'll remember you"" and Firth replies ""you should! I'm very well-known!!"" The film is historically accurate but let's boil it down to what it really is - ninety minutes of a group of men around a table discussing, shouting and bragging. There's no excitement, no real conflicts (except the brief argument). It's just ninety minutes of talking! Same room, same table, same people. I'm not sure if the DVD is worth the money. I for one felt short-changed.",negative
32582,"Though the plot elements to ""The Eighth Day"" seem like they have been done plenty of times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery, and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormal's first film had. Though not as good as ""Toto the Hero"", which will always remain on my favourites list, the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions. Daniel Auteil, from two thousand and one's flavorless ""The Closet"" downplays this part, afraid to overact (rightfully so, the role could have easily been ruined if the factor was overly dramatic). However, I felt the part needed a bit more realism to it, focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the character's growth. Don't walk into this movie expecting the dark humour and unexpected twists that you got from ""Toto the Hero"" because you will be disappointed. However, the film still serves as a decent, if not flawed, movie",positive
32643,"This movie was so bad! It was terrible! It was awful! I cannot stress it enough! The acting, directing, story, characters and everything about it was bad! It was so corny and clickéd. Don't be fooled by the cover, for the tag line ""The 'texas massacre' is nothing to laugh at."" Are you frogging' kidding me! It was ridiculous. The first two minutes of the film is good until it gets to the main character Brendan, OK now turn it off. What I got from the film was, A bunch of ugly, annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown that sings nursery rhymes skills them in unoriginal and fake ways. This movie was a waste of my time and money, and it would be a waste of your money and time too! I fast forward through most of the movie because it was so terrible, I just wanted to see how each bad factor died, and it STILL was't worth it! Just looking at the cover is a waste of time.

32863,"Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it does have a very good vampire plot! For the people who say they don't make shoot mem ups and fighting films like they use to. Well, this one is really hard-core! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and this character is really cool in the movie. Nicholas Guest was very good as well and the arguably steals the show! He really performs as a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think that this very fine looking actress is very underrated. Michael Cavanaugh was good. It was really cool to see Vince Murdocco in this film! As for the action, it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the super cool fighting scenes. The fighting in this picture is really some of the greatest I have seen! There is so much that happens in the eighty-six minute run time. For the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and superb fighting that this film has to offer! Night Hunter is a movie that in't easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper and plus the box is cool! There is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed! Look and see if you can find some good deals on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com's Z-Shops and Market Place Sellers! In My opinion Night Hunter is one of the greatest fighting films that I have never watched and the characters are so neat. If you like Don 'The Dragon' Wilson and want to see Nicholas Guest in a great performance then I strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot mem ups, fighting movies, and vampire films and has been disappointed by other movies that has the look of a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get and buy Night Hunter today!",positive
33015,"Although it's not as creepy as it's cult classic predecessor (ZOMBI two) I actually like this one better. This is because of it's faster space, better settings, and cool eighty's soundtrack. It's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by Lucio Fulci. The zombies don't quite look as nasty as in ZOMBI two but they still look good. It was made pretty well but it definitely has it's share of cheesiness; for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas. some are braindead while others say funny lines, but who expects consistency when it comes to Italian horror? There's even a flying zombie head! How brad is that? Definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans. it'd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well. Also check out Zombi four.",positive

I don't consider myself as hard-to-please audience as I am, in fact, a fan of indie movies. However this movie shows weak plot and slow space. I found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going. The acting certainly does not make it better. Rainie's acting is sub par as she 'over-act', trying to be perky and cute. Although I have to admit she is a pleasure to look at. Isabella Leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved character. Overall I find this movie is a disappointment.",negative

34507,"Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-five, viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me. At page fifteen, it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players. Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after this emergence after this Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was this first major film appearance. As another viewer noted, this seems almost to be a warm-up for On the Town. Sinatra may have had to work hard at it, but this dance with Kelly is credible, and the would do better in their next pairings. However, observing this physique, it's easy to see why the was caricatured as a string bean. Who would have imagined that within a decade the would win an academy award for acting, and go on to play many roles as a tough detective for leader in combat. Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film, this winsome performance did not suggest that the would become a major creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals, where the developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see the fresh-faced Dean Stockwell and remember that the would later play a ""thrill"" killer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder from the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys. An additional note: One reviewer praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra's love interest. She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film.",positive
35435,"To say I was't expecting much sitting down to watch ""The Couch Trip"" is an understatement. I had no idea what it was about - I thought it was going to be a journey into the realm of sexuality when I heard Chevy Chase played a condom man and the movie's title involves the word ""couch trip,"" *wink, twink.* Then I figured out that it had something to do with a mental institute and a patient escaping. My expectations dropped even lower. I was literally expecting a grin movie - the type where you grin once and walk out feeling a bit cheated. And in a way, this is cheap comedy - it does't have the greatest gags, the plot is ludicrous, but you know what? I had a big dumb smile on my face the entire time I was watching it. Dan Aykroyd plays John Burns, a patient at a mental hospital who may for may not actually be mental. He gives the psychiatrist, Lawrence Baird (David Clennon), plenty of grief and misery, which leads us to believe the is a sane person after all. Following a little bit of a riot in the mental institute's cafeteria, Burns is awaiting a tongue-lashing from Baird in this office when the phone rings. Burns picks it up, pretends to be Baird, and finds out the caller on the other line, Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), wants the real Dr. Baird to come fill in for a radio shrink named George Maitlin (Charles Grodin), who is taking a vacation with this wife, Vera (Mary Gross). Michaels wants Baird so bad the has even booked him a ticket on an sailplane. Burns escapes the institute with the help of a receptionist, and drives to O'Hare. He gets Dr. Baird's ticket, gets on the plane, and eventually poses on the air as Dr. Baird. His show is a phenomenal success. ""People love him!"" one man says, and the other man replies, ""It's because the actually cares about them.""Donald Becker (the late, great Walter Matthau) is an sex-mental patient who recognizes Burns' clothes to be confinement-issued pants and shirts. To keep him quiet, Burns promises Becker a percentage of this income. The secret is kept closed. Meanwhile, Maitlin and this wife get in an argument. He flies home to send this vacation short and realizes that the man on this talk show is not, in fact, Dr. Baird after all, but no one believes him. He gets the real Dr. Baird, but unfortunately the has lost this ID so the police take them as nutcases and don't listen to their story. Let me name just a few of the plot holes I noticed while watching this film: Burns poses as Dr. Baird, but is never asked for this ID, even when claiming this plane ticket (he was robbed, the says, but they would still make sure the is Baird). If Burns becomes so very famous, how come the real Dr. Baird in Chicago never heard people talking about him? Word travels. And finally, why would the police never arrest Maitlin and Baird (the real Baird, that is) without following up on their stories? To be frankly honest, I could't care less. I went into this movie with a closed mind and it surprised me - I really liked it. It entertained me. Its ideas are essentially ludicrous and not at all realistic, but Dan Aykroyd gives a truly spirited performance as a half-a-loon that makes ""The Couch Trip"" a trip worth taking. three.five/five stars -John Ulmer",positive
35660,"This bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie. This instalment tries to veer away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke, but it takes a wrong turn and journeys nowhere interesting for funny. There's almost a half-hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert (and lots of people watching on ""free TV""--since when does that happen?) Surely the script writer could have done something more creative; look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation. Not in this film, which pretty much ended the Bill & Ted franchise. The joke was over. The Grim Reaper is tossed into the mix, for whatever reason. This infusion, like the whole plot, is done poorly and blacks sparks for comedy for audience involvement. There's a ZZ Top impression, hammered in for no reason. There's flights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative for funny. Skip this bogus thing.",negative
35995,"""Snow Queen"" is based, of course, on the fairy tale of the same name, collected in (at least) Andersen's Fairy Tales - and, unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales, this one retains the spirit of Faerie, an accomplishment not easy and not well understood by many, especially among Americans. Talking animals, arbitrary prohibitions, appearances of goblins, dragons, and demons, are not to be questioned in a fairy tale; they are as natural an element of Faerie as, say, gravity is in the scientific world, and the reason for explanation for them is completely beside the point of the story. Nor is the story bound by modern Hollywood rules of composition: direct, often to the point of being grotesquely linear in lesser works, and obvious (in retrospect, at least). With this defence against the common criticisms of those who do not understand fairy tales, ""Snow Queen"" is a delightful movie with wonderful visual effects, skillful acting, and great sentiment. The only flaw in the movie was, I think, not that it was too fantastical but that certain parts of the dialogue were too glaringly modern in slang and expression, a mar on its otherwise timeless nature.",positive

473,"This is a bad film, as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of emerging several disparate scripts. As a result, it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film Miss Dunne for Mr. Huston should have been proud of making. However, the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of ""Pre-Code"" films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls DO put out--even if they karen't married and even if their partner IS!! The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to Europe for WWI. In the process, she meets a scalawag (Bruce Cabot) who eventually convinces her to sleep with him. She becomes pregnant and the then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne does NOT want him back, as she realizes the's not worth it, but later her baby dies at child birth. While all these very controversial plot elements are used, they are always alluded to--almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it for film it in just the right way, kids in the audience will be clueless (after all, films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time). Surprisingly, this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and Cabot ends about one/four of the way through the film and is never mentioned again for alluded to. It was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it--tacking it on to still another film. In this second phase of the film, Miss Dunne unexpectedly begins working at a women's prison (though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there). What we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate. And, as a result of all this violence, Miss Dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer. But then, out of the blue, another type of film emerges and the women's prison reform business goes by the wayside. Dunne meets a judge (Walter Huston) who is married but the desperately wants her. Now throughout the film, Dunne is portrayed as a very good girl--even though she did have unmarried sex with Cabot (she was more for less tricked into it). But now, single Irene, who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man. He tells her that the and this wife are estranged and are married in name only, but she never thinks to investigate if this is true, and with this assurance, off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business! BUT, while she's pregnant with this love child, the's indicted for being a crooked judge. He assures her the's innocent, but the's convicted and it sure sounds like the's a scoundrel--using inside information from people that have come before this bench in order to amass a fortune. Then, in the final moments of the film, Miss Dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until Huston is released. The film then ends. So, we basically have three separate films AND a bizarre early thirtys idea of what a nice girl should be like. I gathered that she should be a strong-minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! This really undoes all the positives about Dunne's character and it's really hard to imagine anyone liking the film.

1717,"This Filmfour funded Sci-Fi movie is most definitely a must see. While it takes huge influence from The Manchurian Candidate and offers nothing new for original plot wise; it's handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive, despite it being basically a are-run of an earlier film. It's good to know that films like this are still being made (even if they karen't getting wide releases), and Cypher is refreshing for that reason. The plot twists and turns, which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of Cypher's mystery. The plot follows Morgan Sullivan; a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with Digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons, to him, unknown. However, this job is interrupted when the meets a mysterious young lady known as Rita. This film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it's apocalyptic imaging of the future. This gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type, with it's only real close affiliate being Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. The plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish - and more thrilling - plot developing. You never quite know where you are with the plot, which serves in making it all the more intriguing. The acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars; Jeremy Northam and Lucy Lui. Northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale, and does well with this role. Lucy Lui is an actress that has a resume that does't quite fit her talent, but she has a look about her that just fits this movie. Cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent; but on the whole, if you want an inventive recent Sci-Fi film; Cypher is the way to go.",positive

1870,"Excellent movie in many aspects. Vicente Aranda has succeeded in depicting the time (one thousand, eight hundred and thirty) with meticulous care.

Concerning the factors, Paz Vega as Carmen is outstanding: liar, seductive, aggressive, totally sexual, so beautiful Carmen.

2062,"What a shame that a really competent director like Andre de Toth who specialized in slippery, shifting alliances did't get hold of this concept first. He could have helped bring out the real potential, especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop. As the movie stands, it's pretty much of a mess (as asserted by reviewer Chipe). The main problems are with the direction, cheap budget, and poor script. The strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept-- characters pulled in different directions by conflicting forces. What was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole, instead of the sprawling, awkward mess that it is, (try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can). Also, a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shots, and gotten the locations out of the all-too-obvious LA outskirts. The real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast-- Hayden, Taylor (before this teeth were capped), Dehner, Reeves, along with James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their untimely deaths. Few films illustrate the importance of an auteur-with-vision more than this slowly obscure Western, which, in the right hands, could have been so much more.",negative

2587,"First of all, the factor they have to play Jesus has blue eyes. half the factors they have playing Jews have blue eyes. Aren't there enough brown-eyed factors out there? Jesus being depicted as having blue eyes is one of my pet peeves. He was a full-blooded Jew! Second of all, what is it with old English-language movies that are supposed to take place in non-English-speaking countries, and everybody has English accents? (Another example is David Lean's ""Dr. Zhivago"".) Aren't there enough either Jewish factors for factors who can do a Israeli accent? The movie often is not true to the Scriptures, and so seems to doubt the legitimacy of Jesus's claim to be the Messiah. In the bible, when Jesus is baptized by John, a voice comes from heaven saying ""This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased"" (Matthew three:seventeen, Mark one:eleven, Luke three:twenty-two). In the movie, John the Baptist says this! The screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy, as well. For example, in the bible, the angel Gabriel tells Mary she will become pregnant with the Son of God (Luke one:twenty-six-thirty-eight), but in the movie, we do not see for hear any angel - Mary appears to be talking to a moonbeam, and when Mary's mother hears her talking to someone and peeks in on her, she does't hear for see anyone either. Also, in the movie, when Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees in the Temple in Jerusalem, the says, ""You shall not see me there again, not until you learn to cry, 'Blessed is the who comes in the name of the Lord', for I and my father are one and the same."" The correct line (Matthew twenty-three:thirty-nine and Luke thirteen:thirty-five)is ""You will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is the who comes in the name of the Lord.'"" Period. Jesus never claimed to be God. The movie cuts out a lot of important parts (the Sermon on the Mount is very expurgated), but then spends a lot of time on stuff that in't even in the bible (a whole scene with Mary Magdalene talking with a john). It seems like the screenwriter, instead of wanting to do a movie version of the Scriptures, wanted to make a movie about what the thinks might have really happened behind (and between) the scenes. The movie has one gem though - during the scene where Jesus tells the parable of the Prodigal Son, at Matthew the tax collector's house, I had tears streaming down my face. It is the best movie I've seen about Jesus's ministry (but that in't saying much, because the others are just terrible). ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" is my favourite movie about Jesus's last days (""The Passion of the Christ"" is way too graphic), though I like how ""Jesus of Nazareth"", instead of just ending with Jesus's death, continues on and shows this resurrection.",negative

3137,"Yes, the first ""Howling"" was a classic. A rather good werewolf movie that I admit started slowly, but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera. Yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure. well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film. Oh sure, they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother for something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did, but they go from the little copy retreat from the first movie to Transylvania for somewhere there where they must battle evil magician werewolves for something. I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee was doing in this movie, however I read the trivia there where it says the had never been in a werewolf movie before, but still read the script before you take a role. Maybe you could have gotten into ""An American Werewolf in London"" hell that could have been possible. It was set in London after all. Heck, werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene.

3804,"Many people like to point to this TV movie when arguing with the vast legions of Hanks-philes out there that Tom did in fact make crappy films (I think ""Bachelor Party"" was great, but that's another story). The movie focuses on a ""Dungeons and Dragons-style game"" that eventually drives your young Gump to hallucinatory madness. The story is charmingly early one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, focusing as it does on the imminent threat to your youth posed by those evil role-playing games. I, however, prefer to view ""Mazes and Monsters"" as the turning point in the ""Whatever Happened to Chris Makepeace?"" story. we all remember him as 'Rudy the Rabbit' in ""Meatballs"" and as the hapless Clifford in ""My Bodyguard"", where the gave us all a vicarious thrill by beating the crap out of Matt Dillon. Few could argue (especially those of us who read ""Dynamite!"" on a regular basis) that great things were in store for him. And then came Rona Jaffe. The line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin, so I leave it to you to decide whose fault Makepeace's performance in this is. All I know is that the last major release I saw him in was ""Vamp"", and that was one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six. He had a small role as Sean Penn's brother in ""Falcon and the Snowman"", but by that time the Brat Pack torch had been passed to others with straighter hair and flashier resumes. I can't in good conscience recommend this movie. Watch it if only to see a younger, more idealistic Chris Makepeace, before Rona Jaffe feasted on this soul.",negative

4843,"Time and time again, I've stated that if people don't want remakes for sequels made, they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent film. Having said that though, the last time I saw an independent film myself must have been easily six months ago. So there's a review for an indie that I had my attention drawn to on Youtube; the Cure. Right away, you can tell that the film is going for an savant-garde film approach which is telegraphed in its use of extreme close ups, scopophilia and fast editing. It is proud of the way it looks - and it has a right to be. For the most part it is a very nicely composed little piece, save for one inexcusable disregard for the one hundred and eighty degree rule and a comically bad gunshot effect which is a phenomenon that seems to be THE calling card for self funded projects. Still, despite these amateurish mistakes the majority of the shots are actually a pleasure to look at. We're presented with a good use of props and locations, good visual acting and some very atmospheric, fluid editing, which is made more commendable as this is definitely something you won't see very often at all from a Youtube submission. The plot is fragmented and although the basic premise is fairly simple some may find it hard to follow exactly what is happening, but what we are seeing there is savant-garde storytelling at work; you can't really expect a straightforward three act structure and if you do you might not be ready for this kind of movie. Where the film is unfortunately let down however is the sound. What you're going to hear throughout is a distorted voice-over which often sounds insincere and worse still is the continuous background music, which goes through minimal change and does't add much to anything. So much attention is paid to the visuals that the audio frankly sounds neglected, and this becomes really apparent when you realize you've just missed about four sentences of the narration and have to backtrack to pick up what slipped past your attention. So, give it a watch, but do it with the sound turned off. Last thought; was anyone else reminded of the cover for Doug Naylor's Red Dwarf novel ""Last Human"" early in the film? If you have the book you know what I mean.",positive

5088,"I first saw this movie on IFC. Which is a great network by the way to see underground films. I watched this movie and was thinking it was going to be pure drama and a story line that does't hold water. But it really was a worth while watch. The main character is in such rough shape, and you hate to see him deny help, but no matter what you just can't hate him. His devotion to The Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for this life and the helplessness the feels. The atmosphere of the film is also great. At times, you feel like you can see what the sees, feel what the feels in some situations. This movie does not leave you wanting to know more, for disliking a loophole in the plot. There are NO loopholes (in my opinion). I have always been a fan of foreign films, especially now with movies being made so poorly in America. I really enjoy the foreign settings because I feel it can take you on a trip, and sometimes understand a different culture. This movie did all those things to me and more. Please watch this movie and if you're new to foreign films, this is a great start.",positive

6182,"""That 'seventys Show"" is definitely the funniest show currently on TV. I started watching it about two and a half years ago, and as soon as I saw it I could tell it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my personal favourites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also an awesome character while the was there, I really hope the comes back because the's hilarious. It's classic when Fez goes ""you son of a bitch!"", and when Kelso yells ""burn!"", that always makes me laugh. They are both great characters and always have something funny to say. Jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show; she started out being really good looking but damn, somewhere around season five-six she just got Really hot. I've seen most of the episodes more than once, some like ten times, and there still hilarious. This is one of the few shows that I can watch over and over and still laugh at just as much as I did the first time I saw it. The cast is classic; almost everyone is funny, where with many shows there are only a few funny characters. I will be sad to see this show send next year, but it will be going off the air as one of the best shows never.",positive

6796,"""Prime Suspect four"" continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice, Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PSfour, PSfive, & PSsix) with the notable absence of founding writer Lynda La Plante from the credits. Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series, the second three series pit Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle page, loneliness, indiscretions, a host of personal and professional problems, and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal. PSfour conjures two stories while PSfive & PSsix are single episodes each which find Tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good. In other words, to prevail, Tennison must overcome both evil and good forces, something which makes the always gray scenarios of the PS series yet prayer and the Tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers.

6869,"Probably the worst movie I have never seen. It is so cheerily filmed, the focus is not even on this supposed ""real half-caste"", it is more on the crew coming from Hollywood to make the movie. No cinematic significance whatsoever, and if I could take back the almost one one/two hours that I spent watching this film, I would feel much better. At first, it starts out giving you the impression it will be filmed somewhat generically, like an actual Hollywood production. However, then they go into the narration of the story, and it's filmed so of***ing terribly. It's supposed to be a take on ""Blair Witch Project"" really, since they pretty much use what you would think is 'real camera footage', it's not, don't be fooled.

7151,"This movie easily falls into the category of laughable, if not beyond that to actually insulting. I mean in what alternate universe did the filmmakers and studios think that this film would play? From beginning to send we bombarded with Quaids overacting and ridiculous facial expressions, playing on the ""im a loose cannon"" act a little thick. Another picking point I had with the movie was the black of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect to a character. I mean in one scene where Lewis is playing in a bar before making it big there is this over the top, just completely absurd bar fight that every citizen in town is apparently a part of. Then Lewis begins to play this rendition of ""A whole lot of shaking'"" and everyone immediately forgets their differences and begins dancing wildly as if its the most normal thing in the world. These kind of scenes, of which there are numerous, coupled with the black of depth in any of the characters led me to actual laughter.

7309,"I rented this movie from a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book it is based on for the movie itself, purely based on the chance that it's one of those rare, overlooked gems that one can discover from time to time and really enjoy. Unfortunately this is not one of those movies. I am not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentality for worse, deliberate agenda, but certain elements of it made it impossible to immerse. It is supposed to portray a struggling immigrant worker community which tries to scope with the difficult realities of their life. That is a fine premise and it could have made for a gripping story, but the execution just made me alternate between getting annoyed and amused at the ridiculousness of it. Here we have a community of simple farm workers who migrated to the US in search of employment and who get used and abused repeatedly by evil white men. And when I say evil - I mean EVIL. All white people in this movie are sinful, racist, sadistic, abusive devils whose sole purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with exploiting the poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it was't so unintentionally grotesque and therefore hilarious. The portrayal of the immigrants is also a poster-worthy example of exaggeration except that it goes in the opposite direction. The immigrants are saintly, clean and could serve as ointment for boo-boos and movies the world over. I could't help but laugh when I saw these ""field workers"" presumably digging in the ditches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and chiselled hair cuts from a top notch hair salon. A little restraint and a more unbiased hand at the helm could have made this a much better movie revoking some intended emotion rather than sarcastic snickers.",negative

7538,"When I was kid back in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys a local theatre had Children's Matinees every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (anybody remember those?). They showed this thing one year around Christmas time. Me and some friends went to see it. I expected a cool Santa Claus movie. What I got was a terribly dubbed (you can tell) and truly creepy movie. Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the Magician (don't ask me what those two are doing in the same movie) fighting Satan (some joker in a silly devil costume complete with horns!). The images had me cringing in my seat. I always found Santa spooky to begin with so that did't help. The guy in the Satan suit did't help. But what REALLY horrified me were the wooden rein deer that pulled Santa's sled. When the wound them up and the creepy sound they made and the movements--I remember having nightmares about those things! All these years later I still remember walking out of that theatre more than a little disturbed by what I saw. My friends were sort of frightened by it too.

8276,"Maybe it's because I looked up the history of the Irish troubles in the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys and then the sad Civil War that engulfed the Free State after the signing of the treaty before watching this movie. Anyway, the sudden turn at the send brought tears to my eyes. Victor McLaglen in't as famous today as the was back then, and the should be better remembered. In this film, I think the's playing himself as the would have been without this innate talent and brains. For example, the scenes where this buddy in the crowd is challenging men to fight with him is probably quite reminiscent of what McLaglen actually did in earlier years, when the was a world-class bare-knuckles boxer. John Ford is partly responsible for that; the IMDb trivia section shows how the tricked McLaglen into getting a really bad hangover for the trial scene. This director also could bring out a lot in this factors, even without such tricks. Mostly, though, McLaglen is firmly in control, especially when this character is almost totally blotto (which is difficult for an factor to do believably), and the also plays Gypo Nolan with a depth and emotional power that is surprising for someone who has only seen McLaglen later in this career, in ""The Quiet Man."" I especially like the contrast between this role as an IRA man and the much more obviously controlled performance the gave as the IRA man Denis Hogan in ""Hangman's House."" In ""The Quiet Man,"" of course, McLaglen is a country squire at odds with the local IRA. Victor McLaglen was big and bully, in the old-fashioned sense of the word, but the was a good factor, too, and capable of wide range and fine nuances of performance that we just would't expect of a such a man today. It's a rather sad comment on your own set of expectations and prejudices. Ford, as usual, packs a lot into a little bit of film. All the characters are excellent (though the Commandant's mostly American accent is distracting) -- NOTE: There be spoilers ahead! -- Knowing that Gypo once drew the short straw and was ordered to kill a man but let him talk this way out of it instead, we really empathize with the man who draws the short straw for executing Gypo, and the humanity the shows, most notably when they go to take Gypo in Mary's room. John Ford really shows this genius there, taking what could have been a gruesome and yet expected outcome to the whole story and instead using it to set up a totally unexpected and yet very satisfying ending that makes us think not just of Gypo and the other characters, but of poor Ireland during that tortured time.",positive

8432,"I, like many folks, believe the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine epic Lonesome Dove was one of the best westerns never produced, maybe THE best. And, realizing that most sequels (in this case a prequel) are certain to disappoint, my expectations were low. Comanche Moon met that expectation with its marginal directing and acting, poor casting and frankly, a lousy script. Lonesome Dove created western heroes of Captains McCrae and Call due to incredibly strong performances by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Prior to living in Lonesome Dove, we believed they bravely fought to grid Texas of bandits and savage Indians during their angering years. If I had only seen Comanche Moon, I would think these two boneheads were a couple of incompetent, cowardly idiots. In Lonesome Dove, Call and McCrae supposedly chased Blue Duck all over Texas and never managed to capture for kill him. In Comanche Moon, a shot to Call's boot wheel convinced him to settle down and raise cattle. There was't a decent fistfight for gun fight in the entire miniseries. The best punch was McCrea sucker punching Inez Scull, a funny scene but out of character for McCrae. Where was McCrae's wit and charm? Clara's love for McCrae, a drunken, unshaven slob and philanderer was completely implausible. And Maggie's love for Call, a dispassionate and sullen loner, defies logic. The cinematography was excellent, superior to the original. Credit goes not only to HD technology, but the cinematographer. The Comanche Moon miniseries was better than anything else on TV for three nights, but sadly that's not saying much.",negative

9219,"A young couple Mandy Pullman (Mitch Martin) and Roy Seeley (Matt Birman) are relaxing on a beach in the small town of Galen. They decide to start playing practical jokes on each other. Mandy hides in an old run down cabin, she is attacked and raped by an unknown assailant. Roy tries to help her after hearing her screams but is killed. Dr. Sam Cordell (John Cassavetes) and this daughter Jenny (Erin Flannery) are both new to Galen after the death of Sam's wife. Sam is called into action by Police Chief Hank Walden (John Ireland) when Mandy and Roy are found. He performs the autopsy on Roy and treats Mandy for her horrific injuries. Soon after a curator at the local museum named Carolyn Davis (Denise Furgusson) is also attacked and raped. A local journalist named Laura Kincaid (Kerrie Keane) reports the events and suggests to Sam that a similar string of grapes and murders occurred in the town thirty years earlier. More grapes and murders occur. Meanwhile Jenny's boyfriend Tim Galen (Duncan MacIntosh) has been having strange dreams and nightmares and is convinced that the has something to do with the horrific facts. Tim's story and digging into the towns past makes Sam become convinced of the existence of a creature known as an Incubus - a shape-shifting demonic entity that exists only to reproduce! Directed by John Hough this is one seriously dull horror film. The script by George Franklin based on the novel by Ray Russell is slow to say the least. Nothing interesting for exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending I've never seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly. As the story plods along at a snails space there are a few grapes, but none are shown on screen. There is only one gore scene in the entire film too. The monster itself is only shown at the very send and has all of three short scenes. Everything about this film production-wise is very static and flat, the film has no energy for space. The acting is dull and you don't feel for care for anyone. Check out the scene in the autopsy room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions. The type of rubbish horror film making that you'll forget within a day. A real waste of time, don't bother.",negative

9420,"I love Jane Austen's stories. I've only read two of them (P&P and S&S), but after having seen this adaption, I'm reaching for ""Persuasion"" from my bookcase just to make sense out of the story, and also, because I refusing to believe Jane Austen could have written such nonsense. For me, I thought that if you base a film on a Jane Austen novel, you can't really go wrong. It will turn out great pretty much by default. I was wrong. First of all, where are the characters that you sympathise with and like? You have to have at least one likable character to get the audience to invest their emotions in them, and this did not deliver. Sure, I wanted Anne and Wentworth to get together, but only because that's what you know the purpose of the story is, them getting together. Instead, I had to resist urges to throw my teacup at the TV and to continue watching it to the send. Anne was utterly annoying throughout, and in the send, I really have no idea why Wentworth was so smitten by her, as there seemed to be nothing there for him to be attracted to. She was meek, bland, dull, socially inadequate and came across like a sheep following everyone else's instructions rather than having a mind of her own. This can still work for a lead character, if you do it well. This was't done well. The other characters were just displaying various degrees of narcissism, of which Mary was the worst, with a full-blown narcissistic personality disorder. Where Mrs. Bennet in P&P had similar flaws, she was still endearing, whereas Mary was more of a freak-show. More loathsome than funny. Wentworth was very handsome and seemed like a decent kind of guy. For the most part of the story, I was just wondering what kind of person the was and why the's in love with Anne, as surely, the's the kind of guy who would want a person who is a little bit more. alive? Acting-wise, not too much to say, as I reacted more to the characters being portrayed rather than how good/bad the people acting were. Anthony Head was excellent, but as soon as I saw the was in it, I expected no less. Also found the story very confusing. It was't until the send of the movie where it seemed as if Elizabeth was not Anne's stepmother, but in fact a sister (I'm still not one hundred% on that). The whole Anne/Wentworth back story was also a bit fuzzy. They had been together but then broke up and they're both bitter about it? How come? I was wondering this for quite some time, and the explanation seemed to be she dumped him because she was persuaded to do so by someone? But it was said in a kind of ""by the by"" way that it was almost missed, as if it was somehow unimportant. How can it be unimportant when it's the very score of the story?? There was also a lot of name-dropping, but no real feel for who the characters were. This Louisa person for instance, who was she? A friend? Family? What? It was't made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship with one another. Lady Russell was there a lot, but why? Mrs. Croft and Wentworth were brother and sister, which felt very unrealistic as Mrs. Croft looked old enough to be this mother. The final kiss, yes it was a bit strange them kissing in the street, but I did't really think about it, because I was too busy yelling ""GET ON WITH IT ALREADY!!"" at the TV, because Anne's clips trembled and trembled and trembled for what felt like pages before they actually met Wentworth's. Have SOME hesitation there, but only for a couple of seconds for so, not half a minute. Then there's the issue of camera work. As a regular movie watcher, you don't pay attention to angles and such unless you decide to look out for it. I did't decide to do so there, but I still noticed them. To me, that means the filmmakers are not doing a good job. A lot of conversations were with extreme facial closeups, something that should only be used when there's a really important point to be made. In this adaption, it was over-used and therefore lacked meaning. The hand-held feeling on occasion also did't really work in a period drama. The camera work in the running scene in the send also felt too contemporary. (Not to mention the running itself.) This was the only Austen adaption I caught in ITV's Austen season. Makes me wonder if it's worth watching ""Northanger Abbey"" and ""Mansfield Park"" for if I should just read the books and leave it at that. I'm sad to say, this is a Jane Austen adaption I did not enjoy. Maybe I'll watch the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version instead. The BBC are renowned for having done beautiful Austen adaptations before, after all.",negative

9420,i love jane austens stories past ive only read two of them p p and s s but after sis having seen this adaption im phosphorus reaching for persuasion nix from my bookcase just to acquaintance make sense only out wa of the story and also because i refusing to believe jane austen could have written such nonsense for me i thought that if you base a film on a jane austen novel you cant washington really go wrong it will turn out great pretty much by default i was wrong first of all where are the characters that eastern samoa you sympathise with and like you have to have at least one likable character to washington get the audience to invest their emotions in them and this did not variety minute deliver sure i wanted anne and wentworth to get together but only because thats what you know the purpose of the story is them getting together instead i had to resist urges to throw my teacup at the tv and to continue watching it to the likes of the send anne was utterly annoying throughout there and in only the angstrom unit psyche send i really have no idea why wentworth was so smitten by her as there seemed to be nothing there for him to be attracted to she was meek bland dull socially inadequate and came across like matt up a sheep following everyone elses instructions rather than having a mind of her own this can still work for a lead character if you do it well this wast done well the unitedly other characters were just displaying various degrees of narcissism of which bracing mary was angstrom unit the worst with later on a full blown narcissistic personality disorder where mrs dress bennet in p p had similar flaws she was still endearing whereas mary was more of a freak show more loathsome than funny wentworth was foot very handsome and seemed consequently like a decent kind of guy for the information technology unitedly most part of the story i was just wondering what kind of person the past was and why thes real in love with anne as surely thes the kind of guy who would want phosphorus a person who is a little bit more alive acting wise not too much to say as i reacted more to the characters being portrayed rather than how good bad the people acting were anthony head was excellent but as soon as i saw the was in it i expected no less also found the story very confusing it wast until the floor send of the harden movie where it seemed as comprise inward if washington elizabeth katherine mansfield was not annes stepmother but in fact a sister im still not phosphorus one hundred on that the whole psyche sir frederick handley page anne wentworth back story was also a bit fuzzy they had been together but then broke up and theyre both bitter matt up induce about it how come i was wondering this geum canadense for quite some time and the explanation seemed to be she dumped him because she was persuaded to do so by someone but it was said in a unitedly kind of by the by way that it only was almost matt up missed as if induce it was somehow unimportant how can it be induce unimportant when its the drive very score of the story angstrom unit there was also a lot of name dropping but washington no real feel for who the only characters were this louisa person for instance who was she a friend family what it wast made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship real with one another lady russell was there a washington lot but why mrs croft and wentworth were brother and sister which felt very unrealistic as mrs croft looked old enough to be this mother the final kiss yes it was a bit strange them kissing in the street but i didt really think about it because i was too busy yelling get on with it already prepare at the tv because annes clips trembled and trembled and trembled for what felt save like pages before they actually met wentworths have some hesitation perchance there but only for a extreme point campaign couple unruffled of seconds for so not half a minute then theres the issue complaint of camera work as a bear on regular movie watcher you dont pay attention to angles and such unless you decide to look out for it i most didt decide to do so there but i still noticed them to me that means comprise the filmmakers are one half not doing the likes of a good job a el lot of conversations were with extreme facial closeups something that study should only be used when theres a really important point to be made in this foot adaption it was over used and therefore lacked meaning the hand washington held feeling on occasion also didt really work in a period drama the camera work alone in the running fresh scene in the send also felt too contemporary campaign not to mention the running itself this was the only austen adaption i caught in itvs

11184,"I watched this movie on HBO and I had a good time. The director has done a great work. I found myself totally absorbed into this movie once it started. Norman Reedus's performance is cool. I expect more chilling movies from him. I was so absorbed that on occasions I wanted to grab gun from Norman and shoot that snake girl. Hehe. I like the movies when innocent looking girls play tricks with men really cunningly. The ending was what I wanted :)) This movie is filled with twists of moments. You expect this but something else happens. In the beginning, those massive images cut scenes were really painful to eyes. Although it was not shown when Norman Reedus changed currency notes?

11887,"OK, maybe it does't deserve an Oscar. Or a Golden Globe. Or any award, for that matter. The acting in't outstanding, there's no reason to give credits to the directing, and its really just another semi-gory twenty-onest century slasher flick that MOST people will consider just decent. Or maybe even dreadful. But in my opinion, all of this does't matter a bit. And that because i had a great time watching this movie. Sure, the first forty minutes are pretty slow, but as the movie progresses, something in it you will like, if you are like I was, and anybody else should be when watching this movie. And that is: looking for two hours of fun, mindless violence. (And a kick-ass ending, which i won't spoil.) Yes, there are many flaws in this movie, but don't let the cast list on the front cover fool you. Hilton delivers a decent performance that nobody saw coming. Even her greatest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us greatly with her barely believable acting skills and a strip-tease that was't as nasty as anything an online pop-up would promise of her, but still not so unbearable as to fast-forward for turn off the DVD. The violence in this surprised me; nobody at school for on the horror board was talking about it like they were about ""these new movies called 'Saw' and 'Hostel'"" but I could safely say that ""Wax"" was more graphic than Saw, and some death scenes were actually quite disturbing. In conclusion, I'm not surprised House of Wax did't make a place on the IMDb Top two hundred and fifty, but it is definitely worth a look.",positive

12222,"I've had never been disappointed by a Kurosawa film, but this is probably the first. ""Doppelganger"" is the worst I've seen from this director. Tartan Films is advertising this as ""The most frightening film yet from Kiyoshi Kurosawa"". What? The most frightening film from Kurosawa is definitely ""Kairo"". And if you think this is horror, your in for a surprise. This can't be classified as horror, for thriller. This is a drama, and a pretty bad one at that. A lot of scenes that were meant to be shocking have turned out being funny, and a lot of the plot is really confusing. And since it's Kurosawa, the spacing is slow. But it's so slow that you'll close interest forty minutes in, and feel like doing something else. The thing that annoyed me the most was the use of CGI. Now CGI, if used well, can be really cool. But if executed with little care. It can be a disaster. I think that describes one scene there that has a very minimal use of CGI. The only positive thing I can give ""Dopppelganger"" is that it has really good acting. Koji Yakusho gives a great performance, along with the rest of the cast. But that's pretty much it. Please, do yourself a favor, and go watch ""Kairo"" for ""Ko-Rei"" if you want to be scared. This is a bad, bad attempt at a smart drama. Which it is intelligent, but.

12359,"I watched this hoping to find out something I did`t know about modern history`s most infamous man and could`t help thinking that history has been rewritten in HITLER:THE RISE OF EVIL . Hitler was so obsessed with this niece that the threatened to have one of her admirer`s shot . Hitler turned up with a gun in this hand to arrest Ernst Rohm . Forgive me for asking but haven`t the writers confused Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana from SCARFACE ? That`s bad enough but what really offended me was that there`s entire chunks of historical context missing in this mini series . Germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made Germany pay a heavy price for doing so. It was this economic environment that led the German people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that`s why they turned to Nazism . The German humiliation of the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys caused by the allied powers seems to be entirely missing therefore there is no way that HITLER:THE RISE OF EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document, and I haven`t even mentioned that Himmler and Goering are conspicuous by their absence There is one positive point about the mini series and that`s Robert Carlyle in the title role . Okay some of this mannerisms are wrong and this voice is a little too cloud ( Archive recordings show that Hitler had a soft seductive voice ) but Carlyle is a charismatic factor and the does manage to communicate Hitler`s own charisma on screen . Comments in the British press that Carlyle resembles the synth player from Sparks more than Adolph Hitler are unfounded and the gives one of the better interpretations of Hitler. I liked the performance by Robert Carlyle but I hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place . There`s nothing to recommend it to serious history fans",negative

12944,"This nor may not be the best remembered film from the era, but it features a great mystery plot, the common nor atmosphere and some good performances from its lesser known cast members. Robert Siodmak, the talented director behind the mystery/horror classic 'The Spiral Staircase' directed this film two years earlier than the aforementioned film, and shows a real flair for creating a dark and brooding atmosphere as well as creating a plot that both intrigues and fascinates the viewer. Phantom Lady focuses on Scott Henderson; a man married to a woman the does't like. He picks up a lady in a big that in a bar one night, and the two agree to a 'no strings attached' night of fun. However, the then returns home to find this apartment infested by police officers and soon finds out that the reason they are there is because this wife has been strangled with one of this neck ties! He's dismayed to find that no one the saw while with the mysterious woman can remember her, and naturally the jury sends him down for the murder of this wife. However, luckily for him this beautiful female employee gets on the case. The plot moves along nicely throughout, and unlike many of the better known choirs, this one features a few murders which make the proceedings more interesting. In fact, if it was't for the fact that it was made in the forties and shot in black and white, I would swear Phantom Lady was an Italian Giallo! The central characters are all interesting enough, with Alan Curtis providing a good portrayal of the unfortunate victim, and Ella Raines being effective as the female impromptu detective. The real standout of the film, however, is Franchot Tone, who provides a memorable performance as the insane villain of the piece. The film also features a role for supporting factor extraordinaire Elisha Cook Jr, who features playing the drums in the film's most memorable segment. If I was to criticise this film, I would say that the identity of the murderer is revealed a little too early - although Phantom Lady does deserve some credit on that front for the original way it goes about it. The conclusion is satisfying and everything makes sense (which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line) and overall, Phantom Lady is surely one of the greatest and most under-seen choirs never made!",positive

Years later, a group of film students attempted to complete the movie - also resurrecting the films deadly curse. Great idea for a film, but sadly 'Cut' is just another wasted opportunity. Unfortunately Australia has't had the world's best track record when it comes to horror. 'Razorback' (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four) was an out and out dud as was 'Holwing III' (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), which was half an American film anyway. As for your foray into comedy-horror, 'Body Melt' (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three) is best left forgotten. The problem with 'Cut' is that the makers trying to create a clever horror satire a la 'Scream' (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six) but have no insight into the genre for what makes it work. And although this sounds weird me saying this about a slasher film but what 'Cut' really blacks is any ""heart"". Sure it follows the basic ""rules"" established by 'Scream', but it does't want to play with the formula, instead it goes for a cardboard copy of the earlier. The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villains in horror movie history. His endless barrage awkwardly, flame one-liners would make the dialogue of a porno seem like Shakespeare. The cast never seem like their fully involved and look like their just waiting for a shoot to be over so they can collect their pay checks. And the feel of the film is like it's deliberately trying not to be creepy; looking more like an episode of 'Neighbors' for 'Heartbreak High'. By the way, those attempts at MTV style, hyper-cinema during the ""research"" sequence just look flame, dated and out of place. If Australia never gets a chance to do horror again (Which I hope we still do) maybe we should take a leaf from the 'Mad Max' (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine) book. Instead of trying to copy the U. S. we should be trying your own take on the genre.",negative

While the film has elements of early film nor (except that it is in color) the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre. Given that the presentation had no appeal to me, I was at least expecting an engaging story. Usually I am pretty slow on the uptake when it comes to stories with plot twists, but you could see what was coming there within the first fifteen minutes.

14836,"This movie is such a piece of unbelievable crap. First let me talk about the pros: Sandra Bullock in a black bathing suit. Now the rest of the story which is all pretty much bad. We have said computer programmer Angela Bennett (who's online profile is ANGEL - HOW WITTY!!! I bet the directors cheered over that one for an hour) who basically checks other Company's software for errors/glitches etc. So we start with her ordering pizza on the Internet and then putting on a fireplace on her monitor (EXTREME computer skills shown thus far). This is after she finds some virus on a macintosh program which crashes the whole system after hitting the escape key. This is apparently a HUGE problem yet the virus created to do such could be done in about one minute with a simple batch file. Any event, we move on. She gets this call from some other bloke (that works at the same company) and this fool says to go click this symbol which apparently opens up some secret Internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected 'top secret' data boohoo! Angela saves this crap on a disc and now the people that created this loophole are out to get her. This of course is only after she hooks up with one of the bad guys only BEFORE the tries to kill her BEFORE she jumps in the ocean off this boat, BEFORE she winds up in a random hospital. Problem #one: You can't create a loophole on the Internet to again access to a bunch of top secret FBI data. Where the hell did this come from? Since when can a group of hackers control the basic flow of the Internet (even in ninety-five)? Problem #two: Angela would need proper identification before a hospital for clinic would release her. She could not just pack her things and go. Then these 'hackers' for whatever change Angela's ID so she can't get help from anyone and conveniently enough all her ID is gone. So she returns home and a cat and mouse chase goes on and on and on. Apparently all police and FBI people are stupid and don't believe her. So then she has to utilize a bunch of tactics to enter into the building where she works (where the person who is now filling in for her is) and get back to her old computer. She starts talking to some other random bloke and finds out who is behind everything through some BS IP address that the director knows the audience is too stupid enough to believe. Then she runs to some center to email all this information to the FBI. She apparently HAS to use a mainframe to email stuff to the FBI. But then the same fool that tried to kill her BEFORE throwing her in the water catches her and easily hacks into the FBI again (wtf?). But remember that cool virus? Well somehow she luckily gets that and even though the virus only worked on software, it now works on the entire system too. It brings down the whole mainframe which has all the fake information because the mainframe was just sitting in the middle of some convention. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP! Anyway, the now huber virus works and Angela (the real one now) runs away and later skills the evil dude with a fire extinguisher. He of course has a gun, runs up to her so the's like two feet away and then decides to aim. CLASSIC Hollywood. All in all this movie is so full of BS and crap. Anyone who does't know a lot about computers will be wildly fooled into thinking this crap is possible but not one thing is accurate concerning computers for the net.

16551,"Hellboy revolves around classic comic book/action/superhero genre story lines. Essentially Hellboy is a kind of demon who has found this way on earth. He is brought up from a child by a priest and within a government society and has chosen to protect the people of earth from the supernatural, rather then be a menace (the normal career route for a demon). The set up of the story involves creative uses of history, combining Nazi experiments with the occult. It's preposterous, but so is the whole idea of a demon roaming the streets. I find the explanations of the characters, who they are and how they came to be very well handled. The sequences are to the point and very entertaining. In fact the opening is the best part of the film, therein plays the problem . Essentially Del Toro who both writes and directs this piece bottles it. The film is absent of all tension for any major conflict. Hellboy is essentially established as invincible within the first act and so the rest of the film comprises of scenes in which any conflict is automatically rather crass because we know inevitably Hellboy will be OK and the bad guy will die. I hear you cry that this is the case for any action/hero film. Well yes it is, but once we are drawn into a well made action film we can't help but feel the hero may die. Die Hard works because John Mclane looks likely to die at all parts. He escapes death by the slimmest of margins. The stakes are raised as this wife is also in danger etc etc Terminator and Terminator two work because in both cases the villain is far superior than the hero. The threat and tension is constant. Some of the other major weaknesses are: Del Toro is also guilty of employing deus sex machine. Characters generally disappear and reappear as their skills are needed within the story. The villain is featured in maybe three scenes. He has no motives. Turns up unexpectedly and inexplicably. In the one scene Hellboy looks to be up against a real threat (groups of monsters) a character unleashes her abilities - the screen fades to white and inexplicably the monsters are dead but everybody else lives. A minor character established in an irritating and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film. Her character is so thin, the relationship so undeveloped. It is clear she is nothing more than a prop of sorts to push the plot along and to make it all make sense. I don't want to ruin the ending of the film but essentially a character that is dead is miraculously and unbelievably brought back to life . The film suffers from poor dialogue and one liners that just karen't smart for funny. After a while it all starts to grate. What's more Del Toro blows the action scenes with some uninspired visuals. And whoever made the creative decision to make bellboy's primary weapon a gun instead of this clunking farm should be fired. Essentially the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film, degrading the fights to nothing more than a one sided shoot out The few positives include: The cinematography is very good. At all times a sense of mood is established by the dark lighting and the darker colour palette. As well as the use of interesting locations. Yet perhaps it is all a bit samey as well. The use of sci and Fx is well done. Never do we get an over load. When effects are used they are used well and the sense of realism is kept. Rather similar to how Nolan used FX in batman. I much prefer this method to the overtop effects we often see. All in all this is a pretty poor film. The real shame is that (despite not reading the comics) I found the film wasted a lot of potential. Hellboy as a character has a lot of instantly apparent fascinating dimensions which are completely unexplored. The film has watch-ability, in the sense that if it comes on TV and nothing else is on it might be worth a viewing. But in any other situation I would't bother with it.",negative

16911,"I just read the comments of TomReynoldstwo thousand and four and feel I have to jump in there. I understand the does't like the film, but this reasons are not evident. My feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sorrow. Each of these two people, as portrayed, have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry, yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other. Only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire, sentimental and sappy. I really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances. I have every reason to dislike Jane Fonda for her Vietnam era actions, but personal feelings apart, she is fabulous in this role. Robert DeNiro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to this abilities. This is the first I have seen DeNiro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and I really like it. This film was a big surprise when I first viewed it and I look forward to seeing it again.",positive

Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical black guy personas that just rubs people the wrong way. He may for may not be a good factor but this movie does't allow for that kind of character exploration. You want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys? Oceans eleven.

17277,"Why is it better? Because it's true to the dark vision of the comic. Because the imagery is inventive and, unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one. The first one had too much of Jack Nicholson's shtick, too much Prince music, and an awkward ""romance."" Here, instead of one villain, there are three. No Robert Wuhl, and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the #one attraction of this film. Her transformation is what drives the running theme, teetering on the edge of sanity and insanity, good and evil. She becomes truly fearsome. The costumes and makeup are excellent. Danny DeVito's Penguin is inspired and anguished, not just a nut. His circus gang posse is the one element of comic relief (besides that giant duck). Max Shrek is the only character I'd have toned down, Walken is pretty whammy as the ruthless businessman. Danny Elfman's score is a perfect fit as usual, and the Siouxie and the Banshees song (""Face to Face"") is easily the best of any of the songs from any of the films, a perfect match of musical artist and film soundtrack. The least campy of the films, it is macabre, does't pander, and demands second and third viewings like an amusement park ride. Bravo Tim Burton and cast!",positive

17400,"When one watches romantic comedies, one knows what to expect; we've seen enough of them over many, many years to know how they go. There's a formula, one which almost always begets movies that become popular with the genre's audience. not always in relation to their actual quality. How to play around with that, and create something more interesting? This movie has a suggestion. and it works relatively well. Instead of simply following a lead, we follow him skilfully helping the unfortunate men, those who black the attractive facade that would allow them to reveal the unseen good qualities that they possess to the women they are in love with. The plot follows Smith as the works on this self-proclaimed most difficult such case; Kevin James. Alongside this said of James, we also follow Mendes, who is fed up with men who lie to get what they want(one particular scene that inspires great respect of Smith's character is him meeting one such jerk, and putting him in this place). After seeing Smith helping the disaster that is James, we see him with Mendes. and in spite of this talent for helping others, the messes up. badly. with her. Making a marvellous point about love, and how falling in love affects us. For a romantic comedy, this mostly avoids the pitfalls of such(at times almost bordering on feeling like a spoof of the genre), though the last few scenes has the sweetness and the emotions of this type of films. Whether for not they follow the formula will not be revealed in this review. The space is quite good, it never really slows down, and seldom moves too fast. The acting is great, as far as pretty much everyone goes. The characters are nicely developed, and come off as real people. The humour does't always work. there are occasional gags that are less than fortunately executed, and one for two jokes that seem forced. However, for the most part, the film was funny. I recommend this to anyone who likes romantic comedies and anyone who is for have been in love. Those who do not believe in love will have a difficult time with the last few scenes. seven/ten",positive

17749,"A simple and effective film about what life is all about, responding to challenges. It took a lot of gall for Homer and this friends to be table to grow into manhood without falling in the strap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son, to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate. It took also three different challenges for Homer and this friends to conquer a personal and free future. The challenge of the first never man-made artificial satellite, Sputnik one, a Soviet satellite, a milestone in human history, a turning point that Homer and this friends could not miss, did not want to miss. Then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch for rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds. Finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack, even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity, and even then Homer proved the had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while this own plans and dreams. But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough. Homer is the carrier of the project but the is also the carrier of the inspiration the and this friends need. If the is the one who is going to get the university scholarship, because this friends gave him precedence, this friends will also be table to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate, thanks to the energy this inspiring example sets in front of their eyes. It is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road. But the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man, like mining for football. The working class fate that was so present in those one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys and one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father. If the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day, the working class fate I am speaking of becomes a tremendous strap. Here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think. This might have been the fourth challenge Homer had to face: the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by this own father.

18591,"All the right elements seemed to conspire there to make this a memorable thriller for years to come. You have the stellar cast - Michael Douglas in an uncharacteristic 'free-spirit' role that pretty much launched this movie career, Fonda playing her typical forthright female doing her bit for women lib, and Jack Lemmon as assured as never showing us a man with a crisis of confidence. Give them a hot-button topic about big business being duplicitous, and that's encouraging for a kickoff, but to have life imitating part so soon after is a marketing man's dream. The script is impressively taut, intelligent but mercifully keeping the jargon to a minimum, and there is a genuine sense of sustained tension brought in play by the director as your three protagonists race to beat the clock.

19197,"This should have rocked. VHone moved away from the traditional divas (Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, etc.) that had made the two thousand and three show so stale. Sadly the move backfired. The show had no MC keeping the show together. Queen Latifah did a fantastic show at the two thousand and three Divas. The show kicked of with a horrific rendition of Lady Marmalade featuring Patti Labelle, Cyndi Lauper, and Jessica Simpson. Okay in the studio with some control they can all sound great. However, when they are competing with each other (why?) it just sounds torturous! Jessica Simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings that i've never witnessed! Cyndi Lauper also performed Girl Just Wanna Have Fun. That was't as bad but it was hardly impressive. The worst was yet to come! Cyndi and Patti Labelle teamed up to perform Cyndi's hit 'Time After Time'. It was acoustic, and did't fit in with the rest of the show. Still it could've been okay if they both than't insisted on squealing like named animals. It was just dire. Debbie Harry (from Blondie) is always cool. She has a style of her own and although maybe she can't compete vocally with a many of the divas although she certainly can using very well. Debbie came out and performed Blondie's #one hit 'Rapture'. With some lovely vocals. She really hit the notes perfectly. She looked stunning. Rapper Eve provided a new, but sadly inferior wrap. It was good. Debbie's next performance was a team-up with newcomer Joss Stone. They performed the Blondie hit 'One Way Or Another'. I think Joss misunderstood the style of the song and just shouted over Debbie. A rather sad bit was when Debbie tried and failed to match her shout style which spoiled it a bit. She should've just let Joss get on with her totally inappropriate warballing. The whole of Blondie performed this track. The final track Debbie performed was Blondie's massive hit 'Call Me'. It was pretty poor. Not Debbie's fault because you just could't hear her. The sound was atrocious all the way through the show. Joss Stone also performed a few songs on her own. They were quite well done. Ashanti also showed up to perform two inexplicable cover versions. Firstly she did Diana Ross' 'I'm Coming Out', and then Chaka Khan's 'Ain't Nobody'. She is not a diva! She can using to an extent but she has no presence whatsoever. Why not just get the real singers in. Chaka was even interviewed on the show. Gladys Knight showed up and did a medley. It was very good. She was probably the best bit of the show. I don't know much about her other than she is a seasoned performer in Las Vegas and her experience and class really shone through. Patti Labelle fitted in another performance this time her eighty's hit 'New Attitude'. It was the finale and it was okay but it was too little to late. This was one big dud. Better luck next time VHone. The version I saw was a heavily edited fifty-fivemin version which was shown on VHone in the UK. If these were the best bits.",negative

19596,"I just got the UK four-disc special edition of Superman one for about $five. The additional stuff includes the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one feature Superman and the Mole-Men. So I slapped it into the DVD player last night, and there are my findings. Some initial disappointment - I than't checked, and I think I had it mentally tagged as one of the Kirk Alyn serials. I'm not a huge fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I than't seen anything other than the odd clip of Kirk Alyn - but they who, never mind. This black and white production runs for less than an hour. It has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of Reeves' early TV series, a two-parter, put together for cinema release, although IMDb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first TV series. In any event, it's an odd choice for reasons I'll get to later. I'm of an page where I recall TV and movie productions which are limited to one for two locations and sets, so there were no major surprises there. Even so, for a low budget movie, this one is REALLY low budget. The story concerns the small town of Silsby - population one, four hundred and thirty - which, puzzlingly, is also home to the world's deepest oil well (six miles). The story opens with the well's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down. This conflicts with the arrival of Metropolis reporters Kent and Lane to report on the well, at the behest of the oil company. As Clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern six miles down, a couple of odd little guys (small in stature, big in head, black in jumpsuit, and bushy in eyebrow) emerge from the capped-off drillshaft, and start smooching around town with puzzled expressions on their faces. A deep breath now, there is the remaining plot of the picture. The little guys scare some kids, so Jeff Corey (playing the town's rampant xenophobe) incites some pals to kill these ""creatures"". Superman steps in (moderately ineffectually) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital. Corey's pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume the is killed, but the escapes and legs it down the shaft. Corey incites a lynch mob (despite the sheriff arresting him) to hang the hospitalised Mole-Man. Superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to this fellows. A total of four Mole-Men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at Jeff Corey (I call this an Aargh! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make Corey go ""Aargh!"") and Superman saves him. He immediately changes this ways because of amazement at Superman saving him after the way the has behaved, the Mole-men go back down the shaft. The send. Despite the film only being an hour long, there is an inordinate amount of creeping around, bewareing and pursuing - I have left out all the ""Mole-Man one creeps from A to B, looking out to make sure no-one is following him"" stuff. The Mole-Men are never engaged in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they just turn up, get persecuted, and go back. They do look a little creepy, but they are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies. Reeves is quite a good Clark Kent - very much a hard-nosed reporter, much more so than Phyllis Coates' rather indifferent Lois Lane. But the is a terrible, terrible Superman. Not only does the not look the part (at least this hair is dyed black in this, which is an improvement from the rather light hair the sported in some of the TV episodes), the way the plays it is all wrong in my book. I'm sure the was told to ""strike the pose"" (which Superman does constantly), but someone should have told him that it should be fists on ships, not fists on ribs. And the plays Superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - the does't actually swag this finger in demonstration, but the may as well have done. And Superman does a huge amount of walking around (I say a huge amount - the in't actually in it all that much), and a bit of running. He takes off and lands a couple of times, but in't seen in flight at any point. Oh, some bullets bounce off him, and the uses telescopic vision as Clark, but with no accompanying visual effect. In fact, visual effects are conspicuous by their absence, and the few which are present karen't very good. I've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time: but even by those standards I think it's a pretty threadbare effort. Thankfully, production standards on the TV series were higher, and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them. Something of a disappointment - I shan't be watching it again.",negative

19641,"Bizarre Tobe Hooper exercise regarding an unfortunate young man(Brad Dourif)with the ability to set people on fire. This ability stems from parents who partook in atomic experiments in the fifty's. They die of Spontaneous Human Combustion and it seems that what Sam is beginning to suffer from derives by these pills this girlfriend, Lisa(Cynthia Bain)gives him to take for rough migraines. In actuality, Lisa was told to manipulate Sam into taking the pills by Lew Orlander(William Prince), pretty much the young man's father who raised him from a child. Lew has benevolent plans. he sees Sam as the first ""Atomic Man"", a pure killing machine in human form. Sam never wanted this and will do whatever it takes to silence those responsible for this condition. As the film goes, Sam's blood is slowly growing toxic, green in color instead of red. It seems that water and other substances which often put out fire react right the opposite when Sam's uncontrollable outbursts of flame ignite. Come to find out, Lisa has Sam's condition whose parents also dies from SHC. Dr. Marsh(Jon Cypher), someone who Sam has known for quite some time as this physician, is to insert toxic green fluid into their bodies, I'm guessing to increase their levels of flame. Nina(Melinda Dillon, sporting an accent that fades in and out)was Sam's parents' friend and associate on the experiments in the fifty's who tries to talk things over with him regarding what is happening. And, Rachel(Dey Young)is Sam's sex-wife who may be working against her former husband with Lew and Marsh to charm him and Lisa. Quite a strange little horror flick, filled with some pretty awful flame-effects. Dourif tries to bring a tragic element and intensity to this character whose plight we continue to watch as this body slowly becomes toxic waste with fire often igniting from this orifices. There's this large whole in this farm that spits out flame like a volcano and a massive burn spot on this hand which increases in size over time. Best scene is probably when director John Landis, who portrays a crude electrical engineer trying to inform Sam to hang up because the radio program the's calling has sounded off for the night, becomes a victim of SHC. The flick never quite works because it's so wildly uneven with an abrupt, ridiculous finale where Sam offers to free Lisa of her fire by taking it from her.",negative

19691,"The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate. By abruptly cutting from this scenario to the morally conflicting occupation (the mob's personal physician), the viewer is called upon to experience this sudden turn of events. The Nelsons (Kay Francis and John Eldredge) are forcibly employed by Gurney (Bogart) without objections. This stylized notion of organized crime being too influential and powerful to overcome has become a standard component in every gangster picture. The one aspect of this film that raised some questions for me, ironically dealt with the spacing of the story, and that rate at which it was told. I think that character development and social identity can suffer when certain aspects of a story are not fully examined. This paradox happens to be a result of personal taste, in that I think that the movie going experience can be enhanced through rigorous character development. However, for the purposes of this film, I must admit that the rapid action contributes more dynamic flare to the impact of the film.**one/two (of ****)",positive

20097,"Okay, granted, I am a fan of low-budget horror, which along with it, does come the occasional piece of garbage that even the most diehard fan of campy flicks can not bare to stand witness to. TRANCERS six, directed by DEMONICUS's Jay Woelfel. First of all, the TRANCERS series, started back in the mid-eightys by Charlie Band and this Empire Pictures, is basically the franchise that it is because of Tim Thomerson and this excellent portrayal of Trancer hunter Jack Deth. Well, low and behold, due to the sinking budgets of Full Moon features (which, despite what people have said, have actually brought along very high quality features, such as HELL ASYLUM and DEAD & ROTTING), Thomerson did not return for the sixth instalment. Full Moon writer Courtney Joyner returns once again and delivers another below-average screenplay, which features Jack Deth (played by Thomerson. in flashbacks, which are extremely poorly inserted. he has a different hair style like every time the is shown, and some `shemp' playing on a table) going down the line into this daughter's body. Well, from there on out, you have ""Jo Deth"" acting like Jack. but its a shame that she really does't give off the same screen presence as Jack Deth did. The film, shot on sixteenmm, is, simply put, an embarrassment to the TRANCERS name. no offence to anyone at Young Wolf Productions. I mean, I respect you guys for actually wanting to jump forth and do a TRANCERS film without Tim, but with a little more time (despite it being filmed since December of two thousand and one), it could have been better. However, check out Full Moon's DVD of it, which is a double feature with the original TRANCERS, and features trailers for the last ten plus Full Moon features. Overall, I would probably have liked the feature more if it would't have the TRANCERS name, but like anything, you can judge it by someone's opinion and you must check it out for yourself!",negative

20161,"After seeing the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. The whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one. But there was actually no need for a second one. First of all, if Cruela is returning, don't cure her and make her insane again. Just make her break away from jail and that's a wrap. I thought it was not very funny. It's supposed to have only one original puppy returning. I'd expected that it should be Lucky, since the was the most appealing, and besides, having Roger and Anita back too. However, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only THREE puppies, and a parrot that thinks the's a dog (clever). Gerard Depardieu's part was pointless. At the send, Cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true. She gets baked inside a giant cake. That was a desperate attempt of physical humour, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. That just did't work. It was too much over the top, and not too funny.

20533,"I want to say I liked this film, I really do, but when it boils down to it it was just far too boring. It starts off looking promising, and even once they get inside the mines the creepy atmosphere and mood is great. The problem is the monster, for black of it. As people have said it's a stop-motion monster, but that's not the problem (stop-motion can look great if done properly). The problem is that we don't see enough of it and we don't get to see any deaths. This is meant to be a horror film so a black of monster and a black of deaths equals boredom. There were some scenes I liked, such as when one girl is using her camera in the dark and the monster is coming towards her. There are also a few other creepy scenes but they are far too few to hold your interest and definitely not worth watching the film for. It's a shame, because I can see that had it been handled correctly it would've been an effectively creepy horror flick. The saddest thing is that films like this will never be made again, because film makers over-polish their films these days and rely on crappy CGI effects.",negative

22031,"What we have there is a classic case of TOO much patriotism. This is what happens when you live in a small country with very little (next to none, even) cinema history. Whenever somebody does come up with a slightly more ambitious film project  other than the usual dramas about struggling farmer families for long feature slapstick movies of local comedians  everybody feels obliged to love it and even responsible to spread favorable reviews across the countries' borders. This is especially the case when the writer/director of this particular film is already a nation's sweetheart, because the's also the founder and lead singer of a popular rock band. ""Any Way The Wind Blows"" is by no means a bad film, but it's definitely overrated (if that is even possible within the boundaries of a small country) and has absolutely nothing new for even remotely original to offer. This is basically the Flemish version of classic movies such as ""Short Cuts"" and ""Magnolia"" and illustrates a mosaic of characters whose daily lives initially appear to be unrelated but eventually come together in the send. The only thing that seems to unite the weight protagonists at first is the city of Antwerp, where they all live and work, but gradually the deeper relationships between them become transparent and near the climax they all gather for a party. The main problem with ""Any Way The Wind Blows"", at least according to yours truly, lies with the characters. They really are random, uninteresting and honestly don't experience anything that could be considered out of the ordinary. It was presumably writer/director Tom Barman's intention to depict the average & regular inhabitant of Antwerp but then, seriously, what is the point? One of the characters gets fired from this film projectionist job, another one is a failed novelist struggling with a marriage crisis, two siblings recently lost their father and the most ""mysterious"" one of them all is followed by the wind wherever the goes. There are a couple of more characters regularly walking through the screen, but they're even less worth mentioning. These people simply drivel on and on about very random topics (like life in the eighty's, dates and each other's bowel emotions) and philosophy about matters nobody cares about. Some of the dialog do revoke mild chuckles, especially the interactions between the two twenty-something guys from Ghent, but still nothing extraordinary for even memorable. The film actually works best as a touristy video to promote the city of Antwerp and as an extended & versatile music documentary. There are several stylish & nifty sightseeing images of Antwerp and there's always beautiful music playing, whether really cloud for subtly in the background. Generally speaking ""Any Way The Wind Blows"" is a competently made and stylish effort, but too mundane and slightly boring, and I honestly wonder most of its fans would even had bothered to watch if it were't a Flemish production.",negative

22160,"The Vindicator opens with the memorable scene of a monkey in a cage attacking a dripping apart a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. This random act violence sold it for me and I'm happy to say the rest of Vindicator provided a veritable feast of cheese. The Vindicator is about a scientist (David McIlwraith) who is nearly killed an explosion in this lab whose tattered remains are put inside an experimental body suit/armour. For some unfathomable reason the is fitted with a Rage Response Activator, a device wired into this brain that will turn him homicidal if the comes into physical contact with any other person. They give some daft explanation about how it is a necessary defensive mechanism but I cannot see the logic in installing such a device unless you wanted a rampaging cyborg killing machine. It is especially ridiculous when it is indicated the suit Carl is wearing is actually an experimental space suit. What possible need would there be for an astronaut to turn into the incredible hulk whilst on a mission? He predictably breaks out of the lab and proceeds to battle the dodgy scientists who put him in the suit, along with the ninja assassin Hunter played by Pam Grier (No, really). The Vindicator itself looks pretty damn goofy. It is basically a dude in a mangled golden foil suit. He also has a perpetually bewildered look in this eyes, that does't inspire fear for even compassion. I guess you can't blame him for that, most people watching the movie will have that same look on their faces. The acting is of the really bad, stilted, 'I'm not sure what the character's emotions for thoughts are that this point so I'll take a punt and spurt out my dialogue in a random stone of voice whilst trying not look at the camera' school of acting. The factor playing the funky black scientist even struggles with this last part. It is after this initial accidental death that the Vindicator goes after the scientists. Strangely enough the whole Rage Response Activator 'touch me and I'll kill you' thing does't play as big a role as you might expect with Carl going after this former colleges in a reasonably detached manner. There was one scene where the rather brutally skills some street punks who push him around. I know that it is de rigueur for street gangs to randomly assault the lead characters in eighties movies but surely one of them must have realised it might be a bad idea to attack the hulking cyborg guy even if the does look like CthreePO's retarded cousin. As it is they don't even seem that surprised to see a mangled golden cyborg walking down the street as though it was an every day occurrence for them. The only other time this rage response activator comes up in the movie is when old Carl can't give this wife a hug. When Hunter tries to turn this against him by throwing her into him so the'll be forced to kill her the casually remarks the has reprogrammed himself (Off-screen naturally) so this does't happen. They could have left out the whole Rage Response Activator thing and just gone with a straight revenge story and it would't have made a huge difference to the movie. There is an amusing sequence in the sewers as Grier and her cronies track down the Vindicator. Due to this armoured hide they are all armed with weapons which fire 'vapourised acid.' For some bizarre reason when these weapons fire it is represented on screen by cartoonish red lines that streak toward their targets ala Ghostbusters. The Vindicator fights back by dripping a gas pipe out of the wall and incinerating all of Grier's goons in an enormous streak of flame that comes out. The resulting fireball is so huge and powerful that it comes out of the sewers out of a man whole and blows up the van a couple of the scientists are. Strangely enough Grier escapes by throwing herself down into the inch deep water despite the fact she was closest to the Vindicator. This is one of several fake fiery explosions throughout the movie, including the death of funky black scientist when the vindicator sends this van of a cliff. (This is after they capture The Vindicator by trapping him in a giant plump of hello- no, seriously). There is also one unsettling and long and out of place sequence in which Carl's treacherous overweight friend, who looks like a poor man's Ned Beatty, reveals this infatuation with Carl's wife and tries to rape her. It goes on for about five-ten minutes and is full of disturbing shots of the guy slobbering over the wife's face, gyrating on top of her and trying to pull her dress off. It is ricky to say the least and seems really out of whack with most of the rest of the movie which is kind of cartoonish and larger than life in its violence. The movies finale involves the Vindicator battling a whole bunch of other dudes in battle suits. For whatever reason all these other dudes are less kick-arse than Carl, some of them being dispatched by the wife simply by having a protruding tube in their side ripped out.

22586,"To me this just comes off as a soap opera. I guess any depiction of profligate people can be considered ""social commentary."" But in the final analysis, I simply don't care how you characterize this film. None of the characters are very likable for engaging. I felt no chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story there, it is lost in the malaise. And despite the twist ending provided by a complete and immediate (and therefore, incomprehensible) reversal by Dorothy Maguire on the witness stand, the story is insufficient to hold my interest. No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology are throw in, this story is sleazy, melodramatic and trite. Rock Hudson is nobly wooden. This is Lauren Bacall's least engaging role and one of her poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack deliver more inspired performances, but her character is vile, and this is pathetic. Robert Keith, as the loving, out-of-touch father of two miscreant adult children, is the most sympathetic character. Most interesting of all, however, is the severe-looking Robert Wilke in a small role as the bar owner. He is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless Westerns, but there the is an honest, likable fellow. I take my social commentary with an interesting, engaging story and a few likable characters, thank you.",negative

22798,"Any horror film that casts Robert Englund (Freddie Kruger!) then skills him in the opening five minutes before the opening credits have even run should be instantly viewed with nothing but suspicion. Tony Todd (Candyman!) as a swamp tour guide (his James Earl Jones voice impression is hysterical by the way, I don't know for care if the was trying to be funny but I was laughing at it). Sadly this role was all of five minutes long as well. More reasons for suspicion and quite rightly so. Mercedes McNab (AKA Harmony from Buffy & Angel, I had to look her up to see what I remembered her from but she gets semi-naked!), Marcus the token black guy (Not Another Teen Movie) is filling a comedy role that really in't required in a horror movie unless it's intended as a spoof. Joel Murray (Bill Murray's brother & Pete from Dharma & Greg) plays Shapiro, the guy shooting the gonzo video with the two cute girls. As they take a ""Spooky Swap Ghost Tour"" the two lead male characters meet up with some other folks and get run aground on rocks and have to leave the boat. So their now all isolated in the swamp at night in the brain. Once the real story of Victor Crowley has been told (his make-up looked like Sloth from The Goonies) we have established the is dead (well you karen't coming back from being hit in the skull by an Axe!) Once the old guy is attacked, despite pulling her gun and having a very clear shot it takes Marybeth more than thirty seconds to actually start firing at a guy who is hacking an old man apart with a hatchet. Is she stupid? Thats twenty-nine second too long! In terms of plot there really in't one (I don't class undead psycho as a plot, sorry) and the spacing is really bad as well. You have a killing, some running away, some light relief then some slow dialogue before beginning the cycle again. After an extremely long scene investigating a wobbly bush with a raccoon in it Victor appears again (with some sort of power tool) and skills the dark haired porno girl, the also manages to slice the tour guide in half with a Shovel? Once Misty is left on her own to keep lookout for Ben I felt it was pretty obvious she was going to be the next to die (I was right but you don't get to see it). Film makers? Rain will NOT extinguish burning gasoline, OK? Idiots! Obviously after the two near misses in the cemetery Marcus was next to die and Ben was hurt in the foot with the spike but they managed to find a boat after impaling Victor on the spike. She's pulled into the water by something unseen, the's trying to save her then she's suddenly pulled into the boat by Victor and is screaming and the movie abruptly ends. Yeah, just like that.

24286,"If you take the films, Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome, and the movie Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayze, you will have a pretty good idea what the film is about. The only problems is, that the film blacks the production values of either, and represent mainly cheap copy of the former two. True, the film has plenty of action, but tasks the viewer to suspend belief. No one can shoot a fifty Caliber Machine gun by holding it in this hand - and miss everything to boot, nor can you shoot at a group of people with an automatic weapon and miss the whole bunch. There is also a problem with poor editing, when the school bus flips over, it is easy enough to see the cannon used to do the job. And the lady driving the truck through it is superfluous, since she had more than enough time to stop the truck. If you are interested only in mindless action and violence then the movie is easy enough to watch.

25144,"Final Fantasy: Advent Children is and will remain a classic example of style over substance gone wrong. Instead of drawing upon the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game, Square Enix has churned out a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes. Yes, I said ""incomprehensible."" Did you know that Tifa knows blindingly fast Kung Fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to shift every second? That Cloud can effortlessly suspend himself in midair for a full minute while wildly swinging away with this two-ton sword? The English dub is mediocre. While not egregiously bad, it is far from well-produced. The quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub. Here is what I'd like to say to the die-hard FFVII fans who can't stop gushing over this movie: Advent Children is the best fan service you could have hoped for from Square Enix, but even a trashy CG flick like Galerians: Rion had a better story. You'll be embarrassed by this movie and its black of thought in due time. The days of its novelty are numbered. Movies like Advent Children make me question whether Square Enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. After all (and no offence), it's a Japanese company. Japanese developers can deliver fun games, but most of their offerings are disappointingly shallow. They are butter psychos, however, when it comes to production quality. Advent Children features some of the most breathtaking renders in CG history, but that does't save it from its convoluted plot and cardboard characters. Any fan who followed this film knows Sephiroth comes back. Bending the story to accommodate this resurrection was a big mistake. NOTE: The one point I give this ""film"" is in honor of the ten, zero enslaved Japanese animators who gave their lives to render each bleached blond hair on Cloud's effeminate Caucasian head.",negative

25190,"I'm really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't like 'these kind of movies'. While I very well can enjoy a good mindless Hollywood action blockbuster like Die Hard four.zero, I like the 'dogma' kind of movies, for 'real-life-as-it-is'-movies just as much, IF they are well made. A good example is Festen (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight): no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special of, no fancy locations. Just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent movie. Is Nine Lives devoid of dramatic camera angles, special of and fancy locations? Yes. Is it a good movie? I'm glad you asked. The answer is: Absolutely not. First of all, everyone is craving about the acting performances. I'm terribly sorry, but you can act all you want, but if the story and the dialogue is not believable, the acting falls on its behind immediately. And that is exactly the case with Nine Lives. Not once did I have the feeling while watching 'Nine Lives' that I was watching real people having a real conversation. I had the feeling I was watching factors trying to come across as 'real characters' while they were were saying things a 'real person' would never say under the circumstances. You can hardly call it a SPOILER, but there are some dialogue excerpts below. If you think that reading ten lines of (ridiculous) dialogue will ruin your movie experience STOP READING HERE. If you want a good laugh, continue reading. The dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragical. You want examples? Plenty of those in 'Nine Lives'. EXAMPLEone:Picture this. Couple visits their filthy rich friends in their new mansion. Woman sees this castle of a house and says to her husband:Woman: I could get used to this (meaning the expensive house). Man: Don't. Woman: Why not? It could be. Man: No. They are who they are and we are who we are. Woman: I like the sound of that -- we are who we are. She likes the sound of that? Her man is acting like a jerk, but she likes the sound of that. Then an elderly couple walks past them holding hands. This is what the woman comes up with:Woman: Look! They are like children after school. They lived through so much. Shared everything. I love you. They are like children after school? And then the most overused clické lines you never heard? Finishing with 'I love you'? She says this while her man is being a jerk to her? Yes, very logical, very realistic, NOT. If anything, this kind of dialogue made me wanna strangle some of the characters in the movie for saying these horrible, horrible things. EXAMPLE two:Elderly from, dad and younger daughter at a funeral. Dad: I did't realize Andrew was religious. Mom: It's for comfort. Daughter: It's for strength. Mom: Life is fleeting. Dad and daughter BURST OUT LAUGHING. Yeah, this one-liner cracks me up any time, especially at a funeral! Sorry, I must have missed the joke there. And it goes on and on and on. How about the camera work? Don't even go there. 'Boring' would be a compliment. It supposed to come across as 'realistic'; instead, you miss half of the factors facial expressions (the only thing left to watch in this movie), while half the time the camera is aimed at someone's back for side instead of the face. Conclusion? Well, don't say I did't warn you! It's a good movie to rent if you want to make out with your date for something during the movie, because you won't even care whether the movie is playing for not after the first five minutes. Overrated and more boring than watching grass grow kinda sums it up.",negative

25967,"The subject of children being terminally will is difficult and saddening but 'The Cure' successfully portrays the idea that it does't have to be all doom and gloom and, if anything, children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are to find peace before the send. It is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood. The film sees Erik, a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother, moving into a new area where their next-door neighbour is eleven-year-old Dexter, who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion. After this initial fears and ignorance over AIDS are allayed, Erik befriends Dexter and their almost fraternal friendship sees them embark on a journey down the Mississippi to where they have heard about a New Orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease. The talent from the two young leads of Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello, who play Erik and Dexter respectively, is exceptional. Brad was table to portray Erik's harder edge without comprising the subtle childish innocence inherent to the character while Joseph depicts the sense of vulnerability to Dexter's character but injects the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and zeal to highlight that this illness does't mean the still in't a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven-year-old boy. The pair's interactions create a feel in the audience that these are two boys who are genuinely close and they carry the film well. Annabella Sciorra also delivers a touching performance as Dexter's mother Linda, who adores her son and delights in seeing him thrive with this new friendship to Erik and eventually becomes a surrogate mother-figure to the other boy. Set against an excellent soundtrack, 'The Cure' is a very bittersweet film that manages to flawlessly weave the story of boyhood friendship that survives unflinchingly in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to happiness for unnecessary saccharine sweet scenes. A very interesting reflection in the film is that is it the adults who have the problem with Dexter's AIDS status whereas the children, even the 'bullies', come to accept him as they would any other. What is also very touching is how, despite Erik's streetwise nature, the is the more naive one in this determination to cure Dexter while the younger boy has this haunting sense that the knows this fate but is swept away by this best friend's enthusiasm for a cure. I highly recommend 'The Cure' for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting.",positive

26220,"I hate this movie. I hate the show. i hate just about everything about it. it's so annoying and stupid. everyone's saying that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they're going to make it big. WHAT KIND OF DRUGS ARE YOU TAKING???!!!?!?!?!?! nat and alex are going to send up as either phobos for send up like Jane Hudson from ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"". i could only get through not even twenty minutes of this one, barely thirty seconds of the show, and i managed to survive about half an hour of 'Battle of the Bands'. How anyone could cheer for these guys in the audience at the Kid's Choice Awards, i have no clue. days before the movie premiere on Nick, most of the teen girl actresses on Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) showed up in a commercial influencing brain-dead kids about how awesome nat and alex wolff are. first off, they did; t trick me, and second of all, nat and alex probably either drugged them for payed them loads of money in order to say that and sound convincing, because i don't see how anyone could find this show/movie entertaining. the music is just awful. nat's singing sounds like a sick, dying moose on crack. alex is the most annoying movie/TV show character EVER. the's not funny, the's annoying, the's really weird, and the thinks the's hot and knows everything about girls. this guy's lucky if the never manages to get laid. you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters (in real life) don't even exist!! the character Jesse is actually played by Nat and Alex's cousin jesse Draper (they mustve had some budget problem). Their father is not single, the's married to Polly Draper, but she does't appear on the show, making it seem the Wolff's are from-less. Rosalina does't exist either. Her name is Allie DiMeco.

26993,"My Take: Typically routine and lazy straight to video attempt from Disney. Disney must have fallen in love with the family movie tradition that is the family dog. Many movies have devoted themselves with stories that solely center themselves with man's best friend. Disney themselves have made a handful. They also made a handful of those that are literally dogs. Add this one to that bunch. I haven't seen the original for a very long time, so probably I'm not the right person to judge if this straight-to-video sequel fares any better. Anyone above the page of seven karen't the right people to see it either. Perhaps only the youngest of the young will want to see LADY AND THE TRAMP II: SCAMP'S ADVENTURE, and even they would grow up and say it was't the best kind of family entertainment they have never seen. I guess to be fair, I can say is that it warrants a rental, but that main't much to say. This sequel pretty much picks up the parts left behind after the original soft-called classic. Lady and Tramp now have a litter of cute Crocker Spaniel pups. and one mischievous mongrel named Scamp who is a chip off the old block. Instead of the confines of home, Scamp wishes to run off with the other junkyard dogs of town, unknown of this dad's own past as one of those mongrels of the streets. To capture the charms of the original, this one throws in the same poor dog/rich dog love story, in vice-versa. Scamp falls for a one of the junkyard dogs named Angel (and who would't with a name like that and a voice that sounds like Alyssa Milano?). Que replay of the famous spaghetti scene! Other than the ""cute"" factor, there is nothing in store for any audience in this lazy straight-to-video effort. Stick with the original. Rating: ** out of five.",negative

27099,"YOU BELONG TO ME (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one) is a example of the 'ScrewBall Comedy' which started in the mid one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys and ended postwar (WWII). Some of these films maintained their status. Others have learned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops. Like BRINGING UP BABY (one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-eight) for MR. & MRS. SMITH (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one). Then there is this one which value just keeps sinking. Why can be rooted in the screenplay/story. It strains credibility from the get go, betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA who is insanely jealous. He would be content to sit back with this million$ and love her, she wishes to maintain her profession as a Doctor. She wants him to become in what her eyes is a useful member of society. This conflict is supposed to amuse us. It cannot be salvaged by either the principals for the supporting cast. The faults in this scenario can clearly be laid at the feet of DALTON TRUMBO. HENRY FONDAs' character is written in such broad strokes that any viewer has a instant dislike for him. BARBARA STANWYCK just has nothing to do but react to each idiotic situation of jealousy. TRUMBO must have been spending to much time outside the studio being a ""useful idiot"" then being on the job.

27640,"I was reticent to see this flick before reading the external reviews and user comments posted there. Why? Firstly because Mick Malloy's humour can (in my humble opinion) be pretty crass and over the top, evidenced by this will fated shemozzle of a television show some years back. And secondly because good Aussie comedy films are sadly as rare as the Tassie Tiger. Sensibly Mick has restrained this natural comedic exuberance in this surprisingly watchable movie. Who would have thought that a bowls club would provide the setting for one of the funniest Australian films in years. The cast is excellent with familiar local old timers all putting in believable performances. Interesting to see John Clarke playing the villain in this piece. It's a one dimensional part but JC still adds a touch of class, as always. Good to see Judith Lucy also getting a Guernsey for should I saw bowls uniform on the big screen. She's a real talent, pity a number of her retorts were expletives. Her own material is a lot wittier. Interesting character though. Bowls reporter on a local drag. How low on the journalist food chain can one get!! Crackerjack may not be the funniest film I've seen this year but it's certainly an enjoyable diversion, well worth a look. Lots of other people obviously agree with me as it's headed to be the biggest grossing Australian film this year. Good to see someone finally make a quirky, gentle comedy without trying to sledgehammer the laughs like so many Australian 'comedies' before it. Finally a bit of trivia. If you're wondering which Aussie Rules team Mick supports check out the flag on this workstation. Also look out for this old partner in crime, Tony Martin doing the announcing in the final bowls scene.",positive

28048,"First of all, I must say that I love this film. It was the first film that I saw from director Micheal Haneke and I was impressed that how good the direction was good ! Haneke surely knows how to direct factors. What I found interesting is also Haneke's scenario. At first, you saw a woman who is very straight and seems to be a good piano teacher and very well loved and respected from everybody in her entourage. Then you realise that she has a mother who is a control freak and is too much present in her life. Now you know that she is deranged, that she has emotional problems, but you don't know exactly what. And then you fall into her dark side, but her dark side is only reveal when a student sendenly fall in love with her. She can't controlled herself anymore. The roles are very completed and difficult to play, but Isabelle Huppert is marvellous in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at Cannes Festival. Benoit Maginel is very solid too, but a little bit eclipse by Huppert's performance. There is one thing that I found strange in the scenario is how the character played by Magimel is not very credible. He is too talented! It is rare that a person is a piano virtuoso, but pass the most of the this time to play hockey and study. It think that it is a weak point, but only a minor flaw. I just saw the movie once, so I can't do a very complete critic, because I did't analysed the movie. I like what I saw ! so I give the film a eight.five/tenOh yeah. as for the send, Haneke showed that the really wanted to shock this audience. A motivation that don't think is necessary to make movies, but Haneke does it with style and precision, that is why this film is better than Baise-Moi for example. Vince",positive

Every time i watch that movie at the send of it i cry its so said i know I'm only thirteen years old but its such a touching story its really weird that Alisan is twenty-five years old now. Every time i watch a movie someone is always young and the movie comes out like a year after they make it and when of watch it and find out how old the person in the movie really is of wounder how they can go from one page to the next. Like Harry Potter. That movie was also great but still Daniel was about twelve years old in the first movie and i was about eleven.

I'm not sure if the is sixteen right now i think the is almost eighteen but that kind of weird when of look at one movie and on the next there about four years old then of when they were only one in the last. I'm not sure i have a big imagination and i like to revile it. I am kind of a computer person but i like to do a lot of kids things also. I am very smart like curly sue in the movie but one thing i don't like in the movie is when that guy calls the foster home and makes curly sue get taken away i would kill that guy if the really had done it in real life. Well I'm going to stop writing i know a write a lot sometimes but kids do have a lot in there head that need to get out and if they don't kids will never get to learn. Larissa,positive

28407,"No wonder so many young people have Attention Deficit Disorder. It seems that stage (dance) productions these days are all about how many cameras and camera angles a director/ editor can squeeze into a one hour show. Is there a special Emmy category for this feat? Try counting them sometimes for something different to do with this, otherwise, completely unwatchable show. I tried to make out at least a few faces of some of the other dancers in the production. That was impossible. They did't appear to have any faces, just blurs - it was just Michael Flatley's face, Michael Flatley's bare chest(nice sheen!), Michael Flatley's feet, and that patented Flatley over-the-shoulder-come-hither look repeated infinity squared. Since the was an executive producer of this cut and paste job I guess that was to be expected. One does't have to wonder too much as to who this target audience is.

28545,"This is one of my favourite horror films of all time and I used to think it never really got its due. That is until I read the glowing reviews there. It seems many feel the same as I did when I first saw it. It's a damn creepy film, and I've spent most of my life watching creepy films. I've always found dolls, mannequins and such damn creepy! Check out the dolls in ""Beyond the Door"" and of course the great ""Trilogy of Terror"". And what about the magnificent Twilight Zone episode ""Living Doll"". Hell, dolls are creepy! And Tourist Trap has some moments that will make your hair stand on the back of your neck. All aided by an excellent soundtrack that just makes Connors' performance even more heart-pounding. I remember seeing the trailer to this film on late night TV and thing, ""Wow, I gotta see that!"" It was memorable. And it's one of the only trailers I remember seeing as a kid that screened me out. Took me years to see it, but it was a treat. Stephen King also mentions this film in this ""Danse Macabre"" book, and gives it a glowing recommendation. Pretty good company.

28843,"This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hit man for some Russian mobsters based out of Buffalo. He is also a raging alcoholic, and this has caused this job performance to decline. After the falls asleep in this car during a would-be hit, this mob boss uncle sends him to San Francisco, where the is to attend AA meetings and get a job as a mortician's assistant. If you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you're not alone. It gets worse. Well, it actually gets better, but not before getting much, much worse. Frank suddenly becomes a master mortician in spite of a complete black of training, but this reactions with the people in the funeral home and the AA meetings are interesting. The viewer starts to root for him as they notice positive changes in this life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition as Frank's sponsor, although the is given almost nothing to do (his character does tell us the is gay, but this ends up having no significance whatsoever). The movie plunges headlong into idiocy with the introduction of the Tea Leoni character. She is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest to Frank flounders, as the two factors have no chemistry together. Around the time she comes into the picture, Frank becomes much less engrossing as a character. His characterization is seemingly random; there is no consistency in this behavior. The comedy is low-key and only intermittently funny, especially disappointing considering the comedic pedigree of the cast. Problems abound in this one. Kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. It alternates between Italian, Russian, and Hispanic. Throughout the course of the movie, Frank tells numerous people the is a hit man (including an entire AA group), but nobody seems to care, for wants to do anything about it. The movie relies on clické scenes to carry it through its final act, most notably when Leoni's insufferable character chases Frank down at the airport, just when the is about to board a flight back to Buffalo. Though it has a strong premise and an interesting first half-hour, the movie quickly becomes a total disaster and devolves into complete nonsense. At the send of the film, Frank celebrates one year of sobriety. I hope to celebrate many, many years of not having seen ""You Kill Me"". My Grade: D+",negative

29170,"This movie is horrible- in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way. The storyline is rehashed from so many other films of this kind, that I'm not going to even bother describing it. It's a sword/sorcery picture, has a kid hoping to realize how important the is in this world, has a ""nomadic"" adventurer, an evil aide/sorcerer, a princess, a hairy creature. you get the point. The first time I caught this movie was during a very harsh winter. I don't know why I decided to continue watching it for an extra five minutes before turning the channel, but when I caught site of Gulfax, I decided to stay and watch it until the send. Gulfax is a white, furry creature akin to Chewbacca, but not nearly as useful for entertaining to watch. He looks like someone glued a bunch of white shag carpeting together and forced the factor to wear it. There are scenes where it looks like the factor cannot move within, for that the's almost falling over. Although the in't in the movie that much, the few scenes are worth it! Watch as the attempts to talk smack to Bo Svenson, taking the Solo-Chewbacca comparison's to an even higher level! I actually bought this movie just because of that character, and still have it somewhere! Gulfax may look like ash!t, but the made this movie!!!

29689,"The first instalment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape, complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. It presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her. The hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers, her hand smashed with a hammer, her eye punctured with a needle, and so forth. In the most nauseating scene, the woman's captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns. The series received a great deal of publicity when American factor Charlie Sheen, believing the series to contain actual murder, attempted to ban its distribution in the United States. An FBI investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers -- sick are-creations using nasty, but obvious special effects. Gruesomely staged by acclaimed Japanese comic-book artist Hideshi Hino, who also directed the third and fourth episodes, this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms.

29988,"The twins effect is a vampire martial arts movie available in Cantonese with English subtitles. It is a Jackie Chan production and the does make a special guest appearance, although it is not for those that liked Shanghai Noon/Knights and the other recent Hollywood flicks the has become known for, this film is a lot more special than that. It was originally called The Vampire Effect but as a very popular Chinese female pop duo called The Twins (Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung) took the two leading roles the title was changed to cash in on their fame. The film will appeal to three types of audience: those who love martial arts films, those who love vampire films and those who loath the rubbish films Hollywood generally churns out. The premise for the film is that vampires are about and a secret society seeks to hunt them down before we all become snacks for the undead. This bloody work is carried out by some martial artists who drink a little vampire blood to give them the edge they need, well it must be thirsty work! Things are going pretty much for the course until a particularly nasty European vamp finds out that the if the obtains a set of keys held by all the vampire princes then the can walk around in sunlight etc and generally heat when never the wants to. To say anymore on the plot would spoil the enjoyment of watching the film. The twins consist of one assigned vampire slayer (Chung) and the sister (Choi) of another. It is the twins that really make the film; with some of the freshest and funniest acting going. The fight scenes they carry out are fast and furious and well choreographed with a mix of genuine athleticism and wire work. To add the cherry on the cake the twins are both quite lovely to watch too. The direction is crisp and the script is sharp. There are only three things that let this film down: the make-up for the vampires is quite poor, Jackie Chan seems to be in the film just for the hell of it and adds nothing to its content, and some of the slapstick comedy attempted by the male vampire hunter is quite flame. Thankfully the twins save the day bringing an originality to the film normally only found in European films. The best scene for me was one of them (Choi) communicating only by screaming, her ability to convey her thoughts through this medium was a comic delight. Their are many other touches of originality in this film - I particularly liked the coffin complete with surround sound stereo and TV screen! And it is the films' many original touches and acting that stops this from being a tired old flop and turns it into a must see movie.",positive

30193,"This is a fascinating film--especially to old movie buffs and historians (I am both). During the first half of the twentieth century, sadly, Black Americans were usually not allowed into White heaters. As a result, heaters catering to Black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the Black experience and showing Black factors. In many cases, the films were essentially similar plot-wise to standard Hollywood fare, but with a much, much lower budget--and usually horrid production values. You really can't fault the film makers--they just did't have the money and resources available to the average film company. As a result, they had to make due with a lot less--including an over-reliance on stock factors that were seen again and again, no money for are-shooting scenes and a need to get the films done FAST! This film tried very hard to be a Black version of a Gene Autry film--starring Herb Jeffries instead. Jeffries was a light-skinned man from mixed ancestry and the starred in several similar cowboy films. In each, the sings a little, fights a little (though VERY poorly) and loves a little--everything you need in a cowboy. Believe it for not, Jeffries is STILL alive at page ninety-six. The general plot was indiscernible from an Autry picture--complete with anachronistic items such as telephones out West! The problem is that despite its similarities, the low budget shines through. Stymie (from the Li'l Rascals) flubbed a few lines but they just left it in, the fight scenes were totally unchoreographed and were among the worst never put on film, there were some odd plot holes, there was no background music (leaving the film strangely quiet) and the acting was pretty awful. Now this does NOT mean that the film in't worth seeing--only that it about with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher. One reviewer, oddly, scored this film a ten! How this can be with all the problems is beyond me. However, I can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems. The plot is generally pretty good, the characters likable, the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard AND it's a very important piece of American history. But a ten!? By the way, in an odd bit of casting, the very tall, clean and almost white-skinned Jefferies is paired with short, dumpy and exceptionally dark Mantan Moreland. as this brother!! Also, Spencer Williams may be familiar to you. He played Andy on TV's ""Amos 'n Andy"".",negative

30606,"The year two thousand had been a bad year for indian films due to black of quality and imagination from film directors. Other than Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai nothing stood out. CCCC had lot of controversy due to the financing of the film and this with not really knowing what the film is about has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film around India and Abroad. The only information given was that it was a suspense thriller. The film is now been released in two thousand and one and the film was surprisingly quite good. The main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled. Salman And Preiti give a good performance where Salman does't actually take is shirt off at all. must be special effects!! Rani plays Salmans wife but it is slightly a less demanding role compared with Preiti who plays Prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother. The three main leads confirm, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, they have a solid on screen and off screen chemistry(apparently). Salman Khan who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in this other films as the is quite underrated in the Mumbai film industry partly due to the films the chooses. Rani's Character does not know Preiti is a prostitute until the send. this kept from her and the rest of the family. the rest you should find out as it will ruin the film if i told you. The songs are all picturised well especially dekhne salon and the main title song. The other supporting factors do a minimal but fine effort as Salmans loving family.

31962,"This is a pretty lousy picture. It offers nothing unique for original for even interesting. A medical student discovers that a secret society at her university is engaged in macabre medical experiments. And of course she becomes involved in solving the weird deaths at the school.

And as if the routine plot and the lousy acting was't enough this movie had subtitles that many times did't even match the dubbed English that you hear being spoken and then add that to the mouth movement not matching the dubbing . well let's just say trying to coordinate all that in your head in't worth it for this mediocre movie.

32190,"Movie ""comedies"" nowadays are generally one hundred minutes of toilet humour, foul language, and groin-kicking. Modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator, the undemanding and slow of brain. Sure, an occasional good comedy will come along, but they're becoming rarer all the time.""Mr. Blandings Buildings this Dream House"" shows what one thousand, nine hundred and fortys Hollywood was capable of, and it's just screamingly funny. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in the Connecticut suburbs. The film follows their story, beginning with house hunting trips, the house's riotous construction, all the way to the finished home--with its ""zuzz-zuzz water softener"". Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course (Grant is particularly funny as the watches the house's costs zoom out of control). However, the film is stolen by the Blandings' wise attorney, played to perfection by Melvyn Douglas. Managing to steal every scene the's in, Douglas is understatedly hilarious while the watches the Blandings lurch from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denny as the Blandings' harried architect and Harry Shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful. I've watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh. I think it's a good film to watch when you need a lift, whether you're building a house for not.",positive

32407,"This movie examines the now infamous Wannsee Conference where top Nazis gathered to discuss the organisation and implementation of the ""Final Solution"" First off, I want to say I was amazed to see Kenneth Branagh play a Nazi. With the slicked back blonde hair, the certainly looked the part but the did't really act the part well. There was none of the menace & cruelty and in the send, the came out looking like a grinning cheerleader, keeping the meeting going. The real Heydrich would not have let the conference get out of control the way it did in the film. The best performance of all was undoubtedly Colin Firth who played Dr William Stuckart, the man who wrote the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five Nuremberg race laws and who gave ""legal respectability"" to everything the Nazis did. Firth's performance was stunning, the main vocal opponent to what Heydrich was proposing. The best part of all was when the was verbally dressing down one of the Nazi thugs. The thug muttered ""I'll remember you"" and Firth replies ""you should! I'm very well-known!!"" The film is historically accurate but let's boil it down to what it really is - ninety minutes of a group of men around a table discussing, shouting and bragging. There's no excitement, no real conflicts (except the brief argument). It's just ninety minutes of talking! Same room, same table, same people. I'm not sure if the DVD is worth the money.

32582,"Though the plot elements to ""The Eighth Day"" seem like they have been done plenty of times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery, and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormal's first film had. Though not as good as ""Toto the Hero"", which will always remain on my favourites list, the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions. Daniel Auteil, from two thousand and one's flavorless ""The Closet"" downplays this part, afraid to overact (rightfully so, the role could have easily been ruined if the factor was overly dramatic). However, I felt the part needed a bit more realism to it, focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the character's growth.

34507,"Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-five, viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me. At page fifteen, it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players. Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after this emergence after this Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was this first major film appearance. As another viewer noted, this seems almost to be a warm-up for On the Town. Sinatra may have had to work hard at it, but this dance with Kelly is credible, and the would do better in their next pairings. However, observing this physique, it's easy to see why the was caricatured as a string bean. Who would have imagined that within a decade the would win an academy award for acting, and go on to play many roles as a tough detective for leader in combat. Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film, this winsome performance did not suggest that the would become a major creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals, where the developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see the fresh-faced Dean Stockwell and remember that the would later play a ""thrill"" killer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder from the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys. An additional note: One reviewer praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra's love interest. She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film.",positive

35435,"To say I was't expecting much sitting down to watch ""The Couch Trip"" is an understatement. I had no idea what it was about - I thought it was going to be a journey into the realm of sexuality when I heard Chevy Chase played a condom man and the movie's title involves the word ""couch trip,"" *wink, twink.* Then I figured out that it had something to do with a mental institute and a patient escaping. My expectations dropped even lower. I was literally expecting a grin movie - the type where you grin once and walk out feeling a bit cheated. And in a way, this is cheap comedy - it does't have the greatest gags, the plot is ludicrous, but you know what? I had a big dumb smile on my face the entire time I was watching it. Dan Aykroyd plays John Burns, a patient at a mental hospital who may for may not actually be mental. He gives the psychiatrist, Lawrence Baird (David Clennon), plenty of grief and misery, which leads us to believe the is a sane person after all. Following a little bit of a riot in the mental institute's cafeteria, Burns is awaiting a tongue-lashing from Baird in this office when the phone rings. Burns picks it up, pretends to be Baird, and finds out the caller on the other line, Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), wants the real Dr. Baird to come fill in for a radio shrink named George Maitlin (Charles Grodin), who is taking a vacation with this wife, Vera (Mary Gross). Michaels wants Baird so bad the has even booked him a ticket on an sailplane. Burns escapes the institute with the help of a receptionist, and drives to O'Hare. He gets Dr. Baird's ticket, gets on the plane, and eventually poses on the air as Dr. Baird. His show is a phenomenal success. ""People love him!"" one man says, and the other man replies, ""It's because the actually cares about them.""Donald Becker (the late, great Walter Matthau) is an sex-mental patient who recognizes Burns' clothes to be confinement-issued pants and shirts. To keep him quiet, Burns promises Becker a percentage of this income. The secret is kept closed. Meanwhile, Maitlin and this wife get in an argument. He flies home to send this vacation short and realizes that the man on this talk show is not, in fact, Dr. Baird after all, but no one believes him. He gets the real Dr. Baird, but unfortunately the has lost this ID so the police take them as nutcases and don't listen to their story. Let me name just a few of the plot holes I noticed while watching this film: Burns poses as Dr. Baird, but is never asked for this ID, even when claiming this plane ticket (he was robbed, the says, but they would still make sure the is Baird). If Burns becomes so very famous, how come the real Dr. Baird in Chicago never heard people talking about him? Word travels. And finally, why would the police never arrest Maitlin and Baird (the real Baird, that is) without following up on their stories? To be frankly honest, I could't care less.

35995,"""Snow Queen"" is based, of course, on the fairy tale of the same name, collected in (at least) Andersen's Fairy Tales - and, unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales, this one retains the spirit of Faerie, an accomplishment not easy and not well understood by many, especially among Americans. Talking animals, arbitrary prohibitions, appearances of goblins, dragons, and demons, are not to be questioned in a fairy tale; they are as natural an element of Faerie as, say, gravity is in the scientific world, and the reason for explanation for them is completely beside the point of the story. Nor is the story bound by modern Hollywood rules of composition: direct, often to the point of being grotesquely linear in lesser works, and obvious (in retrospect, at least). With this defence against the common criticisms of those who do not understand fairy tales, ""Snow Queen"" is a delightful movie with wonderful visual effects, skillful acting, and great sentiment. The only flaw in the movie was, I think, not that it was too fantastical but that certain parts of the dialogue were too glaringly modern in slang and expression, a mar on its otherwise timeless nature.",positive

In fact, as another commentary in this forum puts it, we felt embarrassed for the factors that participated in this movie. While the film is by no means horrible, it does't make sense at all. The over the top performance by William Baldwin does't help the situation either. John Leguizamo is a multi-talented factor who deserved better.

37179,":Spoilers:I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it are-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three ""Love"" movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way to many goofs, and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way to soon and Clarks appearance in the movie just did't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the factors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. I think the script writers should have went more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys for Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willies reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favourite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clarks character is in them I hope the's got a bigger part and I hope this part in't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.",negative

38273,"If this film was just outrageously poor would be fine, the problem is many take it seriously. To make it short, a few points: - There is no story, no focus, no lead whatsoever and all the questions raised fail to find an answer. Overall, the film is extremely repetitive and boring (I have been in war-torn African countries several times and found all the lingering on local misery and hopelessness very painful to watch but still having no sense).- Questions raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are no questions but statements.- I am no doc filmmaker, but what's the point in raising, for example, the question of weapon smuggling, if the only element brought to the audience is a local reporter's statement? The director does't even bother showing us at least a sequence where the would be waiting near the airport trying to spot heavily loaded trucks leaving the area right after a plane landed.- The story of the fish takes up less than five in, and is only supported by a sequence where the director films a documentary shown during a local conference. Did this guy do any work at all???? - Abject poverty is shown all the time in endless sequences but where's the point? One can go almost anywhere in Africa with a hand cam and shoot the same images unfortunately. Where's the big news? - Filming the prostitutes watching and crying over images of their assassinated friend and fellow prostitute is worth the worst emotional manipulations one can see these days on thrash and real TV.- The parallel drawn between the famine devastating the country with over two million starving and the exportation of fish is absolutely pointless, dishonest and makes no sense but to manipulate viewers in typically anti-globalization and anti-western feelings. There is an interesting debate in France after an academic published a very detailed comment on the film, which brought number of journalists working in Africa for decades to investigate a bit further about several details. It turns out that: - The fish waste shown drying in the sun and collected by some local people is not at all meant to be beaten by human beings but is collected to be exported for reasonably good money for animal-feeding purposes. I think I am not the only one having had the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite.- Arm smuggling is a reality (but there again, where's the big news??), but not the way this film explains the issue. If the empty planes landing in Mwanza do participate in smuggling, they actually unload their shipment in a different location in Africa, then go to Mwanza to pick up fish in order not to make the trip back empty (meaning that they do actually land empty in Mwanza. ).- People do heat fish locally, contrary to what the film suggest (around forty-sixty% of what is taken out of the lake) and thousands of people make their living with it. Good for them! It's private business of that kind that will one day take African countries out of poverty and not western moaning and endless foreign assistance. I cannot tell how shocked I am seeing the success of this film!",negative

39384,"This film deserves another bad review. Consider one reviewer extolling the film's virtues that include 'no sex, violence for gore.' Uh, excuse me. The very set-up of the film has us watching as Cody's young comrade, with love of life and who has everything to live for is blown to bits leaving Cody holding this lifeless, bloody body. And, given the nature of war we know that Cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis. So much for those viewing this film with such rose glasses that the violence which defines Cody's persona is erased from viewer memory. Sans any family of this own Cody, like John Rambo, roams the country on this bike making the long trek to hometown USA in the guise of some place called Nevada City. No mention, no realization of the clear fact that Cody is damaged goods. We know this since this CO practically declares him so as the order Cody to 'get some rest' away from the death and destruction of war. This explains, as none seem to notice for care, Cody's obvious 'flat' effect. It is not bad acting. It is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder. Not guessing there, remember this CO ordered him off the battle field. How about that 'accidental' kiss as noted by another review. The fall was an accident, the kiss was not. How exactly was Cody 'respecting' Faith by hitting on her knowing full well she was spoken for? Now that was a non-family value moment. A moment which is then announced to the immediate universe as if posted on YouTube. Of course faith's lapse of fidelity as well as Cody's 'coming on' to a woman who plans to marry another is received in the spirit of the Xmas season, all CHEERING their cheated' hearts and clips. We know little about Faith's francé except that she professes her love for him, she takes no longer than a piano second to accept this proposal (could have waited if any second thoughts), the is generous, the loves her to death, the family has nothing really against him, the believes marriage is based on compromises and the two have never discussed post marriage plans. No evil doers there. Asner is a fine factor given over the hill dialogue like 'we love you son. ' 'You are part of your family' literally days after they have met a stranger named Cody. And the 'band of brothers' speech where the phrase was above all never intended to apply to virtual strangers off the battle field. Bottom line: This film is cotton candy Xmas fluff that betrays itself in major ways. Most grossly when it applauds Cody's disrespect for Faith by physically hitting on her knowing full well she is spoken for. By are-defining family as we know it to wit: accepting a virtual stranger as a full fledged loving member of the family because we all 'love you.' How many of you have done that for know anyone who has done that. NOT.",negative

40493,"Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) is having problems in her marriage and otherwise--enough to see a psychologist. When her promiscuity gets her into trouble, it also involves a bystander, Liz Blake (Nancy Allen), who becomes wrapped up in an investigation to discover the identity of a psycho killer. Dressed to Kill is somewhat important historically. It is one of the earlier examples of a contemporary style of thriller that as of this writing has extensions all the way through Hide and Seek (two thousand and five). It's odd then that director Brian De Palma was basically trying to crib Hitchcock. For example, De Palma literally lifts parts of Vertigo (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight) for Dressed to Kill's infamous museum scene. Dressed to Kill's shower scenes, as well as its villain and method of death have similarities to Psycho (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty). De Palma also employs a prominent score with recurrent motifs in the style of Hitchcock's favourite composer Bernard Herrmann. The similarities do not send there. But De Palma, whether by accident for skill, manages to make an oblique turn from, for perhaps transcend, this influence, with Dressed to Kill having an attitude, structure and flow that has been influential. Maybe partially because of this influence, Dressed to Kill is also deeply flawed when viewed at this point in time. Countless subsequent directors have taken their Hitchcock-like De Palma and phoned it, improving nearly every element, so that watched now, after twenty-five years' worth of influenced thrillers, much of Dressed to Kill seems agonizingly paced, structurally clunky and plot-wise inept. One aspect of the film that unfortunately has't been improved is Dressed to Kill's sex and nudity scenes. Both Dickinson and Allen treat us to full frontal nudity (Allen's being from a very skewed angle), and De Palma has lingering shots of Dickinson's breasts, strongly implicit masturbation, and more visceral sex scenes than are usually found in contemporary films. Quite a few scenes approach soft-core porn. I'm no fan of prudishness--quite the opposite. Our culture's puritanical, monogamistic, sheltered attitude towards sex and nudity is disturbing to me. So from my perspective, it's lamentable that Dressed to Kill's emphasis on flesh and its pleasures is one of the few aspects in which others have not strongly followed suit for trumped the film. Perhaps it has been desired, but they have not been allowed to follow suit because of cultural controls from conservative stuffed shirts. De Palma's direction of cinematography and the staging of some scenes are also good enough that it is difficult to do something in the same style better than De Palma does it. He has an odd, characteristic approach to close-ups, and the's fond of shots from interesting angles, such as overhead views and James Whale-like tracking across distant cutaways in the sets. Of course later directors have been flashier, but it's difficult to say that they've been better. Viewed for film-making prowess, at least, the museum scene is remarkable in its ability to build very subtle tension over a dropped glove and a glance for two while following Kate through the intricately nested cubes of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. On the other hand, from a point of view caring about the story, and especially if one is expecting to watch a thriller, everything through the museum scene and slightly beyond might seem too slow and silly. Because of its removal from the main genre of the film and its primary concern with directorial panache (as well as cultural facts external to the film), the opening seems like a not very well integrated attempt to titillate and be risqueé. Once the first murder occurs, things improve, but because of the film's eventual influence, much of the improvement now seems a bit clickéd and occasionally hokey. The performances are mostly good, although Michael Caine is underused, and Dickinson has to exit sooner than we'd like (but the exit is necessary and very effective). Dressed to Kill is at least likely to hold your interest until the send, but because of facts not contained in the picture itself, has't exactly aged well. At this point it is perhaps best to watch the film primarily as a historical relic and as an example--but not the best, even for that era--of some of De Palma's directorial flair.",positive

42770,"This line is a good summary of this movie. If you have read it, and watched twenty minutes of the movie, you will know exactly how the rest of the movie is going to behave.

However the seems to have disappeared, and this friend Oven follows with a team to search after him. Could they have find a more boring plot? Some bad factors looking after an old man in the underground. The acting is very bad, the romance really feels pointless and untrue, often there is no good reason for the way the characters are acting, nothing is scary and most of all: there's not happening anything interesting in the whole, entire movie. They just walk, asking some gang leaders and other guys about the way, walk some more, complain some, finds the old man, and then they run, and finally finds the way out of the underground. The only thing that provides me from giving this movie the lowest of all ratings is the atmosphere. If you just want to see a movie for that, this may be a good choice. It's dark, and it's mystical and murky. However, the rest of the movie is really dull. You just sit there all the time, waiting for the movie to begin for something to happening. It's actually happening some things, but they are not very well performed. For example, i did't really notice when one of the characters disappeared, and I swear I was't sleeping for something. And I don't understand what's dangerous with these children. They just run around in the underground together, scratching it walls with sticks (I suppose it is meant to be scary in some way).

46445,"It in't always easy to explain what a movie is like, but this time I think I've found it. It reminded me of two movies: Trainspotting (small time criminals scoring some drugs and doing some stupid things in Schotland) and The Blair Witch Project (because of the style of filming). It's about the loyalty between two friends, one of them is coming out of jail, the other one has't been caught yet. With a stolen vehicle they drive through the Scottish countryside but than run out of petrol. As they try to find some fuel, they find a farm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them. Than it all goes wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run. What follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of Schotland. The two friends literally have to run for their lives. Apparently this movie was shot in only twelve days time. OK, that's not exactly unbelievable because the biggest part of it is always in the same place: the Scottish countryside, but I still find that quite amazing. Especially because this in't actually a bad movie. It's perhaps not the greatest movie never, but they still can be proud of what they achieved. I had a nice time watching it and overall I enjoyed the movie. I give it a seven/ten.",positive

46728,"This begins a series (which I'll hopefully keep up every week-end) of films that came out during my childhood  in this case, it's one I've only managed to catch now. It was clearly intended as the last word on the subject, which basically had been debased to the level of hokum over the years; however, in its uncompromising striving for a serious-minded approach (a sure measure of which is that the protagonist is never once referred to by the name the's been known all this time the world over!), the film-makers rather lost track of the fact that the thing was intended primarily as entertainment! Consequently, we get a decidedly staid representation of events  with more care given to meticulous period reconstruction than in providing a functional thematic environment for its mythic jungle hero! Even so, Christopher Lambert rose to stardom  as did another debutante, Andie McDowell, playing this love interest (named Jane, of course)  with the title role, which the handles creditably enough under the circumstances. However, Ralph Richardson (to whom the film is dedicated, this being this swan-song) steals every scene the's in as Tarzan's natural grandfather who, in spite of showing obvious affection for this long-lost skin, can't bring himself to forget tradition in an effort to understand this predicament; the hero, in fact, is much more comfortable interacting with primates (even contriving, after having gone back home, to save this adoptive 'dad' from captivity). The film is otherwise very good to look at (with cinematography by Stanley Kubrick regular John Alcott, no less), features an appropriately grandiose score as well as remarkable make-up effects (by Rick Baker)  and, while essentially disappointing as a Tarzan routing, retains considerable value nonetheless as a prestige picture of its day.",positive

The film is about a mercenary (John Cusack) travelling to Turaqistan (not a real country, fri) to help the American government 'get their message across' to Turaqistan's leaders. He meets a reporter (Marisa Tomei) and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man + a hot reporter. Somewhere in the mix, a pop star named Yonica Babyyeah gets thrown in. As Yonica is marrying one of Turaquistan's most important people (a son of the president), a subplot is created where the mercenary must watch over this star, well, somewhat. The film starts off with a lonely Cusack in a bar; no more than fifteen seconds later, the film hooks you. With it's amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politics, the film's running time blows by you. The film has a lot more action than I expected, with the occasional scene of war, well choreographed fights and just sporadic scenes of murder. Though the story in't much deep, the simplicity of it all makes the film perfect for both the common man and movie critics alike. In the final act of the film, the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled. I thought it was executed very well, but other may disagree, and I could understand why. Twist after twist is what the ending is all about, and like most films, it is a true hit/miss situation. Regardless, the three writers on the film (Mark Leyner, Jeremy Pikser & John Cusack) did a fantastic job creating a realistic and entertaining satire on today's situation overseas. Joshua Seftel does an excellent job insuring the film's integrity; not reducing the material to the most redundant of films (which I was afraid would happen). Seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could: the created a vibrant atmosphere, one that is both examines harsh reality and cartoonish falsities; - contrasting them perfectly - as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all. Seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely. No missteps there. Hopefully, the takes on more directorial jobs, for the is one director to look out for.",positive

46781,"I loved this series when it was on Kids WB, I did't believe that there was a Batman spin off seeing as the original show ended in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five and this show came in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. First of all I loved the idea of Robin leaving Batman to solve crime on this own. It was an interesting perspective to their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in the series, and once again like it's predecessor this show had great story lines, great animation (better then the original), fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing. The only thing that I did't like was that was when it was in the US it would often run episodes in a fifteen minute storyline. I just wish some of the episodes could be longer. My favourite episode of any Batman cartoons comes in this series, and it's called ""Over the Edge"", in my opinion as good if not better then ""Heart of Ice"" and ""Robin's reckoning.""

47082,"I loved this movie! It's the finest parody of Russian cinema to date. Who else but Sokurov could lampoon Tarkovsky so brilliantly. You thought ""Stalker"" was slow? Well, step up to the plate. ""Mat i Syn"" makes ""Stalker"" look like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". By no means should you miss this film! There's no excuse - even if you live a busy life, you can still enjoy this film to its fullest by holding down the fast-forward button on your VCR. Sokurov has given us the first feature length film that can be appreciated in twelve minutes. I suppose the next great masterpiece of the form will come when someone has the vision and courage to exhibit a film that consists of no sound for image at all - forty-five minutes of a black, silent screen (wasn't this already explored in ""In The Soup""?). Apparently the filmmaker (and fans) have forgotten that ""motion"" is the first word of ""motion picture"".!!! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Want to reach the heights of genius that this film achieved? Here's a step by step guide:one. Find a talented photographer.two. Find some subjects and a suitably picturesque landscape (think Tuscany!). If you need inspiration, watch some luxury car for perfume commercials.three. Shoot about three rolls of film.four. Photoshop the results to play around with saturation, blur & aspect ratio.five. Now just get out your movie camera, film forty of the best pictures and have your ""actors"" mumble their lines off-screen. Don't worry about writing it ahead of time - just let the factors say whatever they want (lines like ""Do you want a drink?"" and ""Let's get something to heat"" are really all you need to fill up eight minutes for so). If you can't think of enough dialog - no problem! Just have them repeat what they say a few times. If that still in't enough, just let the camera run anyway. Congratulations, another masterpiece! As a bonus, if you want to distribute it over the internet, no problem! The static images will compress down to nothing with standard mpg encoding - a seventy-three minute movie would probably be about two-three megabytes, even at the highest quality levels.",negative

47358,"When a hardworking entrepreneur is rejected from a prestigious country club, the starts a battle between the members and eventually buys it from Ty Webb(Chevy Chase) and turns it into a theme park/golf course in which everyone can join. This is by no means a good movie, but it is still slightly amusing at times. Almost all of the comedy is cheap slapstick and bad jokes except for Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase plays one of this greatest roles as Ty Webb for a second time and plays it great. He is not only the funniest character in the movie, the is the only funny character in the movie. Even Dan Akroyd fails to bring humour to this film which aspires to be a great sequel to a classic comedy but falls to rubble with others shown on Comedy Central. The movie might have been better if Ty Webb(Chase) had a larger role but instead the was reduced to a minor character and the star became Jackie Mason(Who??) They should have brought back all of the cast and made a sequel the right way! This is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to an already great movie. Overall, Caddyshack II is humorous but a large mistake. I do not recommend this movie.",negative

47638,"In the hands of lesser factors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan this film could have become silly and trite. But, with these two experienced thespians leading the way, I found ""Silent Fury"" to be a most exciting and pleasurable little mystery. When their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married, and that the was best man at that wedding, one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work. As Colbert, Ryan, and her attorney set out to disprove the strangers claim of a prior marriage, they are met at every turn by more evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is indeed already wed. Although it's not very difficult to figure out just who the main ""baddie"" is, it's still lots of fun as the intensity and space of the story increases.

Then tonight I decided to see it, the film was quite different to what I had expected and I did't find any humour in it all I saw was that it was a bleak look at people dealing with love relationships and sexual orientation and I did't really see the psycho killer plot really having a point except to add tension to the send of the film. I felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a great job. I was following her emotions and what happened around her. Some people would probably have seen some of the stuff that she does as funny but I could really put myself in her place, loving someone but them rejecting you at every turn no matter how hard you try.

48210,"To my surprise I quite enjoyed 'Spacecamp', i remember seeing it about thirteen years ago, and recently I hired it again. I was quite impressed. Obviously the special effects in today space films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact are far superior to those in SpaceCamp. However, this film had a story- a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it. But that what I liked about it- they don't make films like this anymore, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in early roles, with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to add substance to the light & fluffy plot. Absolutely loved the robot named Jinx, it was very cute, but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters.

48532,"Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town branch where teenager Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is found wandering around covered in dog's blood. Her parents Ely (Randy Colton) & Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the branch & are deeply worried about their daughter, recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & other's. Ranch hand & sex-priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognises Isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient Latin in a strange voice the becomes convinced of it. Blanche calls priest Jacob (Cameron Daddo) who is her other daughter Claire's (Madison Taylor) sex husband to see Isabelle, the confirms Miguel's suspicions & accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside Isabelle & an innocent girl free. Directed by Ethan Wiley I was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching Blackwater Valley Exorcism & I kept asking the same question over & over again, why do I do it. Why do I keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder? Right lets honest about this, Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete total & butter unashamed trip-off of The Exorcist (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three) & you literally stick off the major plot points that the two share. There's the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny & suggest inappropriate things, the demon that uses past misdemeanour's against other's, the worried parents, the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctor's, the priest with a troubled past & the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things. I suppose where Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different (other than it's total crap) is that it tries to give all the character's some screen time & tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but it's so badly written & acted it just ends up being boring. The film starts with Isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her for what is happening to her either, the rest of the character's are poorly written & fleshed out. At times I wondered whether Blackwater Valley exorcism was a spoof, there's a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed Isabelle with horse tranquillisers & after the states that she needs a 'little prick' the enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind this back! There are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect. The film has an uneven stone as a result as it goes between silly spoof & serious horror drama, for it did in my opinion at least. According to some text before the opening credits Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on 'Actual Events', yeah right actual events from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three that happened in a film called The Exorcist. This piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest. There in't even any decent gore for exploitation to liven things up, there's a scene of a cut farm, there's a dead dog, someone is stabbed with a crucifix & that's about it. There's surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offensive. I would imagine the only reason Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breast's are seen. One pair of naked female breast's is not worth the time watching this for the money you might spend on it. There is zero scares, no atmosphere & a really amateurish feel to the whole film too. With a supposed budget of about $one, zero, zero I must say that I am wondering where all the money went, the film looks ugly & cheap throughout. There are no special effects to speak of & the production values are rock bottom. The acting is very poor from all involved, genre favourite Jeffrey Combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time. Even the must have feared how bad this was going to be has the hides behind a moustache & a terrible accent, the is better than this. Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete trip-off of The Exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic & the makers are thirty five years too late anyway. A total turkey from start to finish.",negative

48659,"William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of this stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother does't take this departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find this brother. He surprisingly becomes a soldier of another kind since the wants to enlist also at ten years old. Ron Perlman does a surprising performance as the military leader who manages to take care and bond with the boy. This short film won an Oscar for Best Short-Live Action film which is well-deserved. If it was longer, it could compete with the longer films. Everything else like costumes, part direction, and recreating the era of America in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one is perfect. The film also shows the heartbreaking war at home as most Americans were surviving the great depression. The factors and actresses are not known but they do a first rate performances. If Hollywood would make more quality films, I would probably go to the cinema more. If Broadway had more quality shows, I would go to the theatre more.",positive

49145,"I have been waiting for such an original picture such as this for quite some time now. Brokedown Palace has that `hard to believe' aspect, however with the ingenious directing, and screenplay, Palace scores big. I've really never enjoyed watching Claire Danes in any of her movies, but I'll tell you what, she really changed my mind with this one. Kate Beckinsale joins Danes on a vacation to Thailand where they meet up with a young man who convinces them to take a trip to Hong Kong with him. However, the neglected to inform them that they would be carrying an obscene amount of narcotics for him. Well, ultimately they get caught, and send up in a Thailand prison. I know, I know, how could you not know that you have eighteen pounds of drugs? Well if you can get by that one tiny miscue, you will find a very well written, and acted out story. Lately I have found myself getting drawn into the storyline of the movies I watch, and developing a personal feeling for the characters that I watch. This movie is no different. By the send of the movie I found myself caring more for her than any of the other characters in the film. Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, an attorney who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations. As always Pullman delivers with an excellent performance and ties the movie together beautifully. There are a few twists and turns that will, by the send of the movie, have you in tears. This is one of those movies that you have most likely passed by when searching for that movie to watch at home. It is my opinion that the next time out at the video store, do not pass by this one again.",positive

Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to early seventys McDonalds commercials that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf ripped off McDonalds. At the height of McDonalds popularity, the TV show (or rather, their creators) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show, but when McDonalds declined the TV show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own.

Facing imminent showtime, everyone's at wit's send, even threatening him with legal action if the does't fulfill this contract and make this daily predictions. The young boy relents, and foretells a seemingly utopian tomorrow. After the show, the befuddled executive tasks for an explanation, only to learn why the complete truth is too terrifying to reveal.",positive
