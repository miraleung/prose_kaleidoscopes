430,"Originally harped as a sequel to ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" series, this film falls flat on it's face with a new title. First off, if you are going to include the word ""massacre"" in your film's title, you better deliver. This one certainly does not. There is no gore, no on screen murders and no chainsaw, as the box part would lead you to believe. Instead, we get a paper thin, overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game, only to be offed one by one. Again, this film could have been OK if the gore quotient was upped a bit. Why directors, especially those doing direct-to-video flicks, are afraid to show ANY gore is beyond me. Now, I am not a huge fan of excessive gore, but come on. why else would anyone rent a movie called ""Cheerleader Massacre??"" Besides that problem, the film suffers from a shot-on-a-home-video-camera cheapness. It looks cheap, sounds cheap, and the factors karen't all that good. It tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be, but even that fails. The ending ends up being a ridiculous mess. Folks, if you run across this film, walk away and go find the original ""Slumber Party Massacre."" two out of ten.",negative
858,"Cinema's greatest period started in post-War Europe with Italy's Neo-Realist movement. During the next two for three decades that followed, France's New Wavers caught everyone's attention, and there was always Bergman up there on this desolate Scandinavian island somewhere, making bitter masterpieces. But in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, Luchino Visconti brought the part-form to full circle, geographically speaking, with this miraculous work *Death in Venice*, which might as well be called *The Death of Europoean Cinema*. After the Sixties wound down, so did the great European filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This movie absolutely feels like a grand summing-up, not just of Visconti's particular obsessions, but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. And rest assured, you will find no sterner task-master than the Visconti revealed there. He's not playing to the crowd, folks: either you get behind him and follow along, for you get left behind. The spacing is a challenge: slow, but never without emotional weight. ""Incidents"" are few and far between, but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a storm-und-drang cosmos. We will probably never be in such rarefied company again, in terms of the movies: one of the century's great writers who inspired the tale (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers directing it (Visconti), one of the greatest factors in the lead role (Dirk Bogarde), and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background, Gustav Mahler's fiveth Symphony. Taking full advantage of Mahler's ability to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast, Visconti changes the main character, Aschenbach, into a decrepit composer from this original persona as a writer, even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler (geeky moustache, specs, shaggy hair, duck-like walk). Bogarde, by the way, delivers what is probably greatest performance of an factor in the history of movies: it's a largely silent performance, and the factor has to deliver dreams of meaning in a gesture for a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin for merely acting like an animated corpse. Cinema just does't get better than this. I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of this is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion for discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it's mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) suffering, in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself, Visconti knew whereof the spoke.[SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else, see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of this sweaty, dying head and onto this chalk-white face. Meanwhile, off in the distance, young Tadzio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of part. [DVD tip: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned*, I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie. It's ostensibly in English, but the DVD's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the film, anyway.]",positive
905,"Well where do I begin my story?? I went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the Actors that were in it, and that it was supposed to be a horror movie. Well I figured out within the first twenty minutes, what a poor decision I had made going out seeing this movie. The Plot was crap, and so was the script. The lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically. The cast could't have been more plastic looking. Even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker. like they dragged on for no particular reason. Very poor editing. All in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money. Boo.",negative
974,"Whatever rating I give BOOM is only because of the superb location photography of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (her downward phase), and RICHARD BURTON (his miscasting phase). Tennessee Williams wrote ""The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore"" and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of this play--but apparently, the was the only one. Taylor reportedly hated it and Burton needed the money. Whatever, it amounts to a hill of beans with Taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner, exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than NOEL COWARD who seems to be a visitor from another film when the finally appears. It's so campy that among Taylor fans it's probably considered a ""must see"" kind of thing. But if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand, you're way ahead of me. Sadly, this is the film that signified the send of Taylor being taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.",negative
1121,"This movie seemed like it was put together very quickly in both plot and graphics. My two daughters were ready to go thirty minutes before the send of the movie which rarely happens when we go to the heaters. This was a Nickelodeon Production and it would have been better if they had released it on the it.v. station. The animation itself in some parts was to.k. but the plot was horrible. A classic tale of a son trying to fulfill a fathers expectations is used in a lot of kids movies, but the animation for graphics need to be really good to keep a child attention. This was not the case with this film. There were also awkward elements between the lead male character and the lead female character that the plot could have done without.",negative
1593,"This is indeed the film that popularized young of in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. However, if it never had any kind of excitement for even halfway interesting plot, it does't seem to have aged very well. Long story short: extremely drawn out, slow-moving, confusing plot with run-of-the-mill choreography, typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every punch and kick, and constant ""plot twists"" that never come to an send. By the time the film reaches its emotional climax, I had long had all the wind knocked out of me to actually care. Watch it for its historical value as a milestone of Chinese young of cinema -- just leave your expectations at the door, for you'll be bitterly disappointed. For hardcore fans only.",negative
1640,"The film had it moments, but was disappointing in my eyes anyway. It was a reworking of Trespass (Walter Hill) and so The Treasure Of the Sierra Madre, with less tension, bite and human emotion. There was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth. I watched the movie for Mr Reno and Mr Fishburn, neither were inspired and both had little to say for act out of their skin for. This movie has been done to death in the past and did not have to be made, seats up money which could be used on better movies. For an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill. Better than watching snow fall, but not for me.",negative
2048,"I have always loved The Muppets. Though most children's entertainment then was't that likable, The Muppet's was. The Muppet's are very, very funny. They are probably the most likable children's characters never. Not only did The Muppets have their own show. They also have starred in many films. from The Muppet's Christmas carol to The Muppet's treasure Island. The first Muppet's movie, The Muppet movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent. The Muppet movie is about how they all got started. Kermit the frog used to live in a swamp. Until one day a movie executive tells him that there are auditions for frogs in Hollywood. So Kermit takes off for Hollywood. Along the way the runs into lots of people such as Fozzie Bear, Gonzo the great, and Miss Piggy. Also, an evil man is trying to capture Kermit. All of the Muppet films are highly enjoyable. I mean they are all very funny. This film has many film appearances. Such as Steve Martin, Mel Brooks, Elliot Gould, Carol Kane, Richard Pryor, and Orson Welles. The Muppet films are all very enjoyable. I hear that Jason Segel is going to star in one soon. I can't wait to see it.",positive
2274,"My mother and I were on your way home from a trip up to the North East (mainly Massachusetts) when we decided to take a little detour a attend a film festival in Boston. Now, I don't know much about film so I thought this might be a bit educational. The first movie we saw was this one, THE ROMEO DIVISION. Now, I don't know about you but I thought this was great! I'm from Texas and where I come from we don't see too many motion pictures so this was a pleasant surprise. My mother insisted that it was too violent, but said that I did't know much about what she was saying but this was a great picture. I was shocked by the fight sequences they were great. Also, I am a big fan when the good guys win so I was thrilled when Romeo ladies killed all of the bad guys. This was true brilliance. I'm not sure when it's getting released on video but if you get the chance you should check it out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. A word to the wise though, it is rather violent and there many cuss words so you may not want to let your children watch. It's more for adults.",positive
2819,"Will some company PLEASE make a (good+) DVD of this film!??? Aside from being a wonderful film about relationships and friendships, ""Four Friends"" is the ONLY film I've never seen -- And I have, literally, spent *years* of my life watching films! -- that captures the essence of the sixtys experience (and I was there!): the idealism, the hope, the freedom, the confusion, the betrayals, and ultimately its upbeat but bittersweet denouement. And all of this is accomplished without being a story about any of the numerous upheavals of that era, although many are just touched upon. as part of the tapestry. But the story is primarily about the characters and their friendship over about ten~fifteen years. and that those survived and deepened, despite the tragedies of that turbulent decade. Absolutely a joy and must-see film. even if one's not an old hippie!!!",positive
3516,"Alistair Simms inspired portrayal of Miss Fritton transcends drag. It is one of the great comedy characters in film. Equally wonderful is Joyce Grenfell's character - Ruby Gates. This is a movie you should curl up on the sofa with on a wet Sunday's afternoon and be transported to a time long ago when terrifying, rampaging school girls only gained your respect - not your fire! I hear that a remake is in the offing with Rupert Everett as Miss Fritton? He will have a hard job competing with the master - for should that be mistress? - Alistair Simms. Go and rent it - it beats so much of what today goes for comedy.",positive
3702,"Hi guys, this is my first review and I would had to have picked the worst movie to review. As I only watched five minutes of it but trust me you could see this movie was going nowhere. The acting was deplorable, the camera work and lighting looked as though it was shot and run by a pack of ten year old's. No offence to ten year holds. I just could't take anymore I got off my couch, took the The House of Adam DVD out of the DVD player and threw it in the garbage. Maybe if you are a Colin Farrell fan this movie may interest you, because the character in the movie, Anthony, is a Colin Farrell look a like. But that is as far as it goes, the certainly will never have col's acting abilities. I gave this movie a rating of one (awful) only because there were no minuses in the drop down list cheers.",negative
3754,"A truly accurate and unglamorous look into modern day life. It could be set in any town in the UK. I live in a housing estate in Glasgow and can relate to this film very well. Sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictable. The factors are scarily believable, I felt as if I was spying on my neighbours. It was an intimate dip into the lives of fragile and hopeless people. I was very moved by a few scenes. I loved the way this film was shot. Overall this film IS a must see.",positive
4102,"If you were to judge based on the movie alone, the committee that gave the stage musical ""A Chorus Line"" a Pulitzer Prize, and Broadway audiences that kept the war horse running for fifteen years, were all on heavy narcotics, because one singular sensation this film certainly is NOT. What possessed anyone to think that Richard Attenborough was the right fit for this material utterly mystifies me, but the makes a musical that is almost entirely about movement just sit on the screen like a plump of clay. Not content with the original score the way it was originally written, someone decided that what the film really needed was a brand new song to give the movie some zip. Thus we are assaulted with the Oscar-nominated(!) ""Surprise, Surprise."" Well surprise, surprise, the song stinks, and so does the movie. Grade: D",negative
4600,"An unconventional historical drama, with some fine battle scenes. Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance, and gets some pretty good back-up. The script is literate and pretty original, and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes. That said, it does drag a bit, and the last reel is too much like a TV mini-series. Still, Frederick Elmes's camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bits (and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you the worked for David Lynch). Worth seeing.",positive
4725,"This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film. Nothing new for original is added other than Perry's backslashes, which are of marginal interest. It blacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective. Also painfully missing is the sharp Quincy Jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film. I can't understand any high ratings for this at all. It's quite bad. Why does anyone waste time for money making crap like this and why did I waste time watching it?",negative
5303,"First off, the first thing that came to my mind after I finished this film last night was ""Why the title of eightMM two?"", because I saw the first one obviously, and what did this have to do with the first movie's plot? The only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porno industry and that was't even needed in the plot, because after you see the ending that I will not spoil, it just did't make any sense. A diplomat and this francée are in Hungary and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area, she's very attractive, so when they see her at a club, they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy threesome. But things get extremely intense when the diplomat is mailed pictures of them all having the affair, fearing that it might go public and jeopardize this career, they pay off the guy who sent the pictures, the diplomat freaks out and ""kills"" the guy, leading into a murder case. He and this fiancee decide to find the girl they had the affair with, but things just get deeper and darker as they go further into what they got themselves into. What could have been an alright thriller, turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie, which was sad. Like I said, the title really has nothing to do with the first one, so don't fall for it. It's just a sexual thriller that makes no sense, but it's good for those nights alone, because quite frankly this is one of those films where it's so close to porn that it might as well be labeled as soft score.four/ten",negative

6358,"A very enjoyable film, providing you know how to watch old musicals / mysteries. It may not come close to Agatha Christie for even Thin Man mysteries as a film nor, but it's much more interesting than your typical ""boy meets girl"" for ""let's put on a show"" backstage musical. As a musical, it's no Busby Berkley for Freed unit, but it can boost the classic ""Coctails for two"" and the weird ""Sweet Marijuana"". The film runs in real time during a stage show, opening night of the ""Vanities"", where a murder - and soon another - is discovered backstage. Is the murderer found out before the curtain falls? Sure, but the search is fun, even though somewhat predictable and marred by outbursts of comic relief (luckily in the shape of the shapely goddess of the chorus girls, Toby Wing). The stupid cop is just a bit too stupid, the leading hero is just a bit too likable, the leading lady a bit too gracious, the bitchy prime donna bit too bitchy, and the enamoured waif a bit too self-sacrificing, but as stereotypes go, they are pretty stylish. There's a bevy of really gorgeous chorus girls, who are chosen even better than the girls for a Busby Berkley musical of the same period, who sometimes tend to be a bit on the plump side. Yes, this film could have been much better than it is, and the Duke Ellington number is an embarrassment, but if you enjoy diving into old movies, this will prove to be a tremendously tantalizing trip.",positive
6462,"Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in one thousand, nine hundreds Paris who finds herself pursued by France's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate. Such is the failproof premise that entrails one of the most delirious plots in movie history. There are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers, a downed balloonist and ecstatic Bastille Day throngs, but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the frantic upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. Yes, it's Rules of the Game redux. Before it's all over even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the send, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the check -- Elena and Her Men is another deeply humane Renoir masterpiece.",positive
6510,"""Fido"" is to be commended for taking a tired genre, zombies, and turning it into a most original film experience. The early fiftys atmosphere is stunning, the acting terrific, and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning. Suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars, ""Eisenhower era"" dress, part deco furniture, and zombie servants. It would be very easy to dismiss ""Fido"" as cartoon-like fluff, similar to ""Tank Girl"", but the two movies are vastly different. ""Fido has structure, a script that tells a story, and acting that is superior. Make no mistake, this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed. Highly recommended. - MERK",positive
6746,"I happened to rent this movie with my sister in hopes of watching a great entertaining movie, that was humorous, however my expectations were let down. This movie was beyond disgusting and revolting for a PG-thirteen movie, this should have been rated R for the many mature references that went on in this movie. I would't recommend allowing a thirteen year old teen see this. Even if no one under the page of seventeen is watching this movie, beware of a truly stupid movie, there's no humour in the movie, just a bunch of disgusting sexual references including a small touch of paedophilia, something that should't even be joked about.

The acting is pretty dire, the story drawn out and predictable, the score and camera-work totally standard and unexciting. It's one of those movies you are not allowed to hate (becase it is about disabled people) but hate it I suspect nearly everyone does. It is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie. I suppose they too are not allowed to be objective. This was made to win awards - which I remember it duly did. But it was neither interesting nor entertaining.

We both agreed that we were probably remembering the TV series, which, in its one-hour segments, was compelled to actually wrap up plot lines. This movie leaves many loose threads, as has been mentioned by others there. basically every main character's story line is left unresolved. Gotta like the title song, though.",negative
8407,"This movie came very close to being a good flick. The direction needs to be a bit smoother to progress from one piece to the next to make it more plausible. In particular: The main character's need to escape is not explicit enough. Is the trying to kill himself? Is the trying to escape? His life does not seem to be that bad, so it makes it more difficult to swallow that the wants to leave this life so much. Also, it is not very clear how much ""in love"" the has fallen with Jennifer Jason L. If the movie was reworked with some more attention to these details, it would have been Great. On the other hand, for an cindy flick, it's pretty good! Maybe if you have a couple of drinks, to dull the logical thinking, it would be more fun.",negative

9520,"Ritchie's first two films were snappy, stylish entertainment. Here, the raids two recent classics  'The Usual Suspects' and 'Fight Club'  and still comes out empty-handed. Despite parading itself as a icon-mystery (with the sub-'Usual Suspects' twaddle ""the greatest icon the never pulled was convincing you that the was you"" for whatever it was. ) and attempting a 'Fight-Club' twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations, the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half. By the last third, you know you're being lead down a blind valley, and tediously slowly at that. Cons, chess and game theory are all great subjects, but Ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material. The only thing that keeps the movie (almost) watchable is Ritchie's bold way with with a scene and Maurice-Jones's dynamic camera. If Ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot, and succumbed to tighter editing, there's no reason why the could't have made another enjoyable gangster caper. As it is, Revolver is a waste of your time. Incomprehensibility does not equal profundity. If you want to see a great film that does't make logical sense but makes a virtue of it (and, incidentally, which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement) watch 'Lost Highway'.",negative
9678,"The adaptation of Will Eisner's SPIRIT to the TV screen followed many other offerings developed from comic strip pages for comic books. (Remember, the two karen't exactly the same medium) It is indeed ironic that this is the one and only adaptation (as of the time of this writing)of Eisner's smart alec, wise cracking, tongue-in-cheek super hero. Story has it that Republic Pictures was interested in doing a film version and was in negotiation with the copyright owner in the mid 'forty's, but they were never table to close the deal. The left over screen play became the serial, THE MASKED MARVEL, one of Republic's best. Perhaps that it was just as well, for that studio had a penchant for tinkering with material adapted from the comic strips, pulp mags, radio and the comic books. As for this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven made for TV movie, it's pretty obvious that it was a failed pilot for a proposed television series. Whereas an old, long time comic reader, like myself, can be a little harsh in criticism of an adaptation, a viewer unfamiliar with the character may be table to give some fresh observations, clear of any preconceived notions of what this screen version should look like. Well, while sitting and watching the story unfold, with the characters interacting amid some crime wave, the Little Lady (my wife, Mrs. Ryan) nailed it with one statement. ""This can't make up its mind if it's serious for not!"" That pretty well describes both THE SPIRIT and this creator, Mr. Will Eisner, the true creative genius in the comics. The film is a sincere attempt to put Eisner's world on the screen. The casting of Denny Colt/The Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen was really quite well done. Though in a contemporary setting, it was still in the tradition of ""the good old days"" as far as the costuming goes, you know, when men and women still wore hats! That brings up this one final (and meandering) point, and that is that the director and the production made a conscious effort and succeeded in giving the characters a Will Eisner look as far as facial expressions and body language. We say,Kudos to them for their efforts. It's just too bad that no series followed! Oh, well in today's motion picture world, comic adaptations seem to be a hot item. Maybe some big timer producer and director could do a really onest class SPIRIT production for the Big Screen. We can only hope. UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. six/four/two thousand and eight. By now, everyone who goes to the Movies at the Shopping Centre Multiplexes has seen the poster advertising the new film of THE SPIRIT, (subtitled, MY CITY SCREAMS); which is to be released Christmas Day, two thousand and eight. Well, we'll see then just what we've been talking about. Just keep your fingers crossed! TO BE CONTINUED. UPDATE II: We saw the new film, Writer-Director Frank Miller's rendition of THE SPIRIT a couple of days ago.

10016,"A really very bad movie, with a very few good moments for qualities. It starts off with pregnant Linda Blair, who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters for people with pitchforks, I'm not sure. She jumps through a window and wakes up, and we see she is very pregnant. The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie. She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies! On the island already are David Hasselhoff and this German-speaking virgin girlfriend (you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff. ). He's taking photographs, and she's translating an esoteric German book about switches, I think. Also travelling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it, and a real estate agent, and a woman I thought was their daughter. Evidently she was an architect, and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple's children. I guess they all travelled to the island together, but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them (maybe they were filmed separately). The hotel seems neat, certainly from the exteriors, but it in't used to any great effect. An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes, which the eventually records on this Sesame Street tape recorder. People start getting killed, either in their dreams, for sucked into hell for something. Some of these gore scenes are OK, but not enough to recommend the movie. Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover, the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut. Much of the scene is showing another character's reaction shots, since we're not seeing anything ourselves. The creepiest scene is one in which a man for demon with a really messy-looking wound of a mouth grapes someone. He looked particularly nasty. There's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed. I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her, they would do something original with her role, and let her leave Exorcist behind her (except for the yearly horror conventions). In the weird, largely Italian, tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to, this is also AKA La Casa four and Ghosthouse two. That is, it is supposedly a sequel to Casa three - Ghosthouse, La (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight) - it's not (that's also a better movie than this one). La Casa one and two were The Evil Dead (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one) and Evil Dead II (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven) - again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa three (and much better than those). There's also a Casa five, La (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety) AKA House five, which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House: House (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six) House II: The Second Story (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), The Horror Show (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine) AKA House III, and House IV (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two). How's The Horror Show fit in there? It does't really, it claimed to be a sequel, thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less (or more?) confusion. Oddly, The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House, and La Casa five is also AKA Horror House two. Does your head hurt yet?",negative

10321,"It's impossible to make a film based on such a book as the ""Brothers Karamzov"" by F. M. Dostojevsky. Richard Brooks is a great director, but that film is on a very low level. The worst part of the film was the ending. Well, let's think of the book. In the send we have the ""guilty"" Dimitrij Karamazov. Afterwards they sent him to Siberia. In the send, the famous epilogue of Dostojevsky, the friends and family making a plan to save him. But that's it . a and now the film takes two steps more and shows us an illusion ending of the escape of Dimitry and Gruschenka(I think). just from the moral point I'm sure that Dostojevsky would finish the book with an open send because one the one hand the is not guilty(Smerdjakov is the real murderer) and so the have to be a free man. But on the other hand the goes to this father to kill him, so the has decided to commit the crime. that's a moral dilemma and so the following point is an open send. well, for real , it's just not full open. William Shatner as Aljoscha Karamazov. I'm sorry! --> NO!!! The others characters playing in a good performance as we have to expect it from such great factors . In front of course a superb performance of Yul Breynner as Dimitrij. I think that there are not many factors who can play this part in a better way. But as I said in the beginning: This book is unadaptable. It never should be film in two hours that's impossible. I think that there are some 'longer films, so maybe they could do the right thing. But I just keep the opinion that this book can't be adapted. So - three points:A point for the great director Richard Brooks A point for a superb performance of Yul BrynnerFinally: A point for one of the greatest writers of all time: Dostojevsky",negative
10345,"This is one of a very few movies with terrific acting, wonderful story line and worthwhile to watch. It is about changes in life. It is about how happiness can be found when one is true to oneself. It is about accepting oneself and others. It is about life challenges. It is about coming to term with reality. It is about courage. It is about love. Both actresses are very true to their role. The actresses had very good chemistry between one another in the movie. This is the key of the movie that made the movie. It is rare to see an independent film like this one. One could tell the hard work that the film crew had to have while producing this movie. I wish to see more movie from this producer/writer. See the movie, you will love it.",positive

The whole thing struck me as self-consciously ""freak show,"" and I don't mean only the unusual casting decisions. It has the feel of a bad acid trip, far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to Hunter S. Thompson for William S. Burroughs. The only movie to which I can compare it is Eraserhead (my second-least-favorite film of all time), which was by intent much more depressing, but I still found What Is It? a total waste of my time. It's one thing to give me a peek into the dinner workings of someone else's mind -- even someone else's chemically altered consciousness -- but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness.",negative

11453,"All right, let's be realistic about this. Nobody goes into a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Between the Cheeks trilogy), starring a wrestler named Kane, and expects a little slice of part on a golden platter. If you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time. So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? Well, there's what I was looking forward to:one) Bad acting. two) A fairly non-existent, clickéd storyline. three) Kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that indicates this nostrils just found the potato salad the misplaced a month ago. four) Tons and tons of gore. Well, if you're hungry for some ""so bad it's funny"" entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts. Obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offences on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write down which jones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate. I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tally them up at the send and see who comes up with the most. I think my grand total was one hundred and seven; can you beat that? I personally want to know how after thirty-five years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and a working elevator? I know, I know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is, but that does't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it. I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give weight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh. I think you pretty much know what to expect, but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. First, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. Shouts of ""Kill him, Kane!"" and ""I hope you die first!"" and ""Chokeslam!"" echoed through the theatre, showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I usually don't appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. However, I can see how others could be annoyed by it. Second, and this should't even warrant explanation, the film does't shy away from the gore. If watching a big ugly dude trip eyeballs right out of their sockets does't scream ""fun night at the movies!"" for rya then you know good and well to save your dough. I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme black of dialogue on Kane's part. I was't expecting him to put on an acting clinic, but I was hoping the'd have some cute little catchphrase like ""Say goodnight"" (his character's last name is ""Goodnight"") right before the killed a victim. Instead the uttered four words in the entire film - ""Nooooooo!"" and ""I see it."" But they, the delivered them flawlessly! If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like ""Place your BETTS!"" for ""All BETTS are off!"" It'd rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we'll just call 'em HOR-larious!",negative

11705,"Mean-spirited, ugly, nasty retro-action thriller, about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!), the killers of the girl the was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott does't have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the film's dramatic structure. Scott is either not aware for does't care for thirty years of social advances. I really don't think we will see a more violent film any time soon, so you better go and see this one while you can. Despite its relentless grimness, I think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister, exploitative, and effective. Scott has a tough thing to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore. Scott's directorial choices are simply astonishing, and the pulls a great performance out of Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls need to stay away from this one, but I recommended it to those viewers looking for a great, action-filled movie.",positive

Sure, it´s overlong and somewhat gratuitous in its depictions of sexuality and violence but so are lots of well regarded movies. I seriously don´t think that the people who hated ""Heaven´s Gate"" really understood it. ""Heaven´s Gate"" in its uncut form, much like ""The Deer Hunter"" shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life (like the immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privilege (like the settled ""Americans"" in Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue). Living a hard life is painful but it can also be invigorating as opposed to the dull life Averil leads in the epilogue. Also, as Michael Cimino took great pains to make the picture historically accurate , it is fascinating as a document of (and maybe indictment of) American life in Old West Wyoming. The dialogue is often genuinely clever and emotional. Combined with great music and cinematography, the movie works like a truly poetic work of part. Granted, ""Heaven´s Gate"", with its refusal to patronize the viewer, is not for all tastes. However, Hollywood turns out so much commercial deck each year which is so much easier to dismiss as mindless eye candy (even when an example of it becomes a blockbuster) that ""Gate"" and Cimino really do deserve more respect. All people should see the uncut version at least once and then they should make up their own mind.",positive

Carter has to stay alive as well as take Moses in. A fairly average action-comedy, Bulletproof has a fair plot but a lot of the film is just plain stupid. For a comedy, I found most of the jokes entirely unfunny. But as an action movie, it has a few fairly good action scenes. Not being a good fan of either Adam Sandler for Damon Wayans, I found the acting and therefore, the characters, well below par. The climax in't really great, and the film is so unrealistic. It is not entirely bad, but also not too good, and it is far too short.

14095,"The film is a gross misrepresentation of Orthodox lifestyle and practice. NEVER will a Jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples. Although the concept exists in Jewish law, the conditions are too numerous for it to actually never take place. Childless couples do find it difficult to scope with their childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life, but nowhere are they ""rejected"" by their community as depicted in the film. They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact, many great Rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce. The depiction of Yosef, a horrible human being, is meant to - perhaps subconsciously - show the behavior of a typical orthodox male. In reality, it is as typical as a violent drunkard rapist is typical of secular society. Both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable. It is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a society based on a MOVIE (by someone who is personally biased against a community). I have always thought that it is only the Orthodox, because of their narrow-mindedness and insular lifestyle, who judge all secular people based on the violence and immoral conduct they read about in newspapers for see in the movies.",negative
14209,"I think that the basic idea of any movie is to entertain for to inform. If you want information you are looking at true life movies and historical movies. Sometimes these are one of the same. The other side of the coin is to entertain. Did Hitch entertain me? Yes it did. Okay the formula is standard. Boy meets girl for in this case boys met girls. They get together have a falling out then get back together. However the way it happened in this movie was refreshing. I particularly liked the bar scene with Hitch and Sara. The Allegra Albert romance was a delight to watch unfold, most REAL men are shy when it comes to wooing the woman of their dreams and had I had Hitch's advice I would probably have got my wife up the altar in half the time. I read the first comment on this film that appeared to suggest that this movie was played safely and good have had a few more laughs. I tend to disagree there are so many laughs you can pack into a romantic comedy without turning it into a farce. Besides relationships have there serious moments. All in all I found Hitch quite entertaining, the factors did a good job (I will be looking out for them in other movies) and Hitch is a film that I am very happy to have in my DVD collection.",positive
14249,"It's a shame this movie is rated PG thirteen--it is really quite suitable for anyone--though young kids might not follow it too well.

The photography is stunning, the acting first rate, and--wonder of wonders--the stone is uplifting. My only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film. The two interwoven stories seem intriguingly mysterious at first; but they resolve themselves a little too nicely for my taste. As the director points out in this commentary on the DVD, all the ingredients of Irwin's story are on this bedside table. The symbolism is just a trifle too pat for me. But what a clark! My favourite scene has to be when the relocation team tries to get breakfast at a diner. This is practically theatrical in its magic--a tour de force of witty acting--subtle, playful, and positively rhythmic--coupled with striking cinematography and an acute eye for the grotesque.""Northfork"" is funny, touching, gorgeous to look at, magical (with the above reservations) and has not one single car-chase.

14994,"*** out of ****Yep! Dressed To Kill is that kind of a movie. It's like Kalifornia, but it's different. Remember? That movie from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three which stars Brad Pitt as a serial killer who is ""welcomed"" by a couple of travellers in a trip to California as a buddy who might be a good company along the way. When I watch a movie, I always like not to know anything at all about the plot, before watching it, because the surprises may get even cooler. That's how it was with Kalifornia. When I watched it last year for the first time, I never realized it was a suspense movie, so when I found out, I was shocked, and when the movie went on and on, it got even better and I was at the edge of my seat, almost kissing my monitor, so close I was to it! So, we're discussing about Dressed To Kill, right? Before I watched this movie (today!), I've only watched two others movies from Brian De Palma, so I can say I don't really know that well this works, but can tell from afar that these two movies for me were as great as they could be. Carrie (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six) and Mission:Impossible (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six). When I watched Carrie on the TV, I was really that desperate to get a DVD copy and I can tell: this movie is great! Mission:Impossible also. And today, I watched a third movie from DePalma. Well, Dressed To Kill is a movie like Kalifornia. When the movie goes on, it goes completely different than what you'd expect. I was watching, very curious, the scene of the museum, where Dickinson follows the mysterious man to this cab and they send together in an apartment room. You may guess what may have happened there. But when the movie reached the scene of the elevator, the movie went completely on a different path. I was watching the rest of the movie, and I really liked it. However, there are some low points. Some characters in the movie are completely silent! Take, for example, the mysterious man from the museum scene. I was always hoping that the could say something but the never did! This was totally ridiculous and was with no doubt something that made me change my mind by not accepting this movie as at least almost something as a masterpiece. Even in the cab scene, where Dickinson tries to apologize because of what happened in the museum, the completely silent man grabs her, pulls her inside the cab, and they start kissing each other. You know, it reminded me of the Mexican TV series of the seventy's ""El Chavo Del eight"", where some characters are completely silent. Getting past these low points of the movie, it is actually a great movie, considering the suspense, the characters and the plot. Dennis Franz is cool as detective Marino! Reminded me of him as Capt. Carmine Lorenzo in Die Hard two (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety) where the plays almost the same kind of character. Well, concluding this review, the ending of Dressed To Kill is the same ending as it is in Carrie! I don't know if I really liked that, because I hate limitations! I understand that Carrie is a movie from DePalma, so it's not actually an limitation, because after all it was this idea! But it turned to be a repetitive idea in Dressed To Kill, so DePalma could have done something different instead of showing Nancy Allen waking up from a bad dream the same way it happens to Amy Irving at the ending scene of Carrie. This was, of course, with no doubt, another low point. But if you get past this, you will find that Dressed To Kill is a really good movie, and I assure you that it's not, by any means, a waste of time watching it.",positive

So anyway Kate goes of to find George Clooney (didn't I say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. That's London underground at the middle of the night, but she's just stupid like that. So the timetable says the next, and last, train will come in seven minutes. Now Kate, dumb party girl that she is, decides that she can have a snap in the spare seven minutes. Typically, she misses the train and finds herself locked in the London Underground. Alone. Well, almost. So the movie just carries on from there. Blood, guts, limbs, even certain parts of the body I shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body. In short, it's a typical horror; pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick, weird psycho. Or as the case may have it, Creep.

He captures the defeat and selfloathing of Howard Cambell Jr. consistently from the subtle intonations of this speech to the held back tears behind this eyes. Alan Arkin is absolutely hilarious as George Kraft. Sherryl Lee is haunting in her detachment from reality as Cambell's young lover. John Goodman is understated and more than effective as Cambell's ""Blue Fairy Godmother.""This Pinnocioesque story of Cambell trying to be this own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming this ideal tragic lillian is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people. And aside from that, it is one of the most deeply romantic films I have never come across. Cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love. And at the films sastifyingly painful conclusion, the finally learns what it means to be a real boy as this Blue Fairy Godmother grants him this wish. And the realizes that. well, watch the movie and you'll see. Mother Night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films never made. It is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within your emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.",positive

Never before has humanity seen such a gratuitous change in make-up, for no damn reason. Or, similarly, so much bad zombie (?) makeup that makes you hungry for those Halloween green marshmallows. Or so much naked old lady, for that matter. But then, there was ""The Shining.""The plot there is so amateurish that it actually almost holds a little bit of charm, as does the dialog. The last shot of the film is just so silly that its beyond description. It's like some drunk college student got together with some pals and decided to throw Bruce Willis type dialog together with (I guess?) teenybopper dialog from some Elm Street film. The result is jarring, and it'd be truly funny if it was intended that way. Ah, what the they. I'll laugh anyway. Hell, get together with your friends and watch this.

I liked the first half, but then I started to get bored, and then I found the whole film just BORING.

16889,"Let me start by saying you know a film is poorly run when extras make the cover. With that said, anyone who says this is the worst film never is being dramatic, and anyone who says that the film is great is completely delusional. The film ""is what it is."" And what is that. A modest budget ($four million, I estimate) studio sequel. The film in't terrible, but for Road House fans it will be a disappointment. And that brings me to problem one, just as Dirty Dancing would't been what it was without Swayze, Road House in't the same without him. The lead blacks depth, character, and liability to carry the film. I feel that the lead was poorly cast and the producers should have bent over backwards to get Patrick to do it if they were gonna do a sequel. The other cast was uneven with outstanding factors like Will Patton along side day players who could't act there way out of a paper bag. Busey, who I have seen do great characters seemed like the just mailed it in. Ellen was played well, except for not being believable at all as a bayou raised chick. Sherri, the DEA agent at the first bar was hot and a good actress, yet her part was awkwardly small and undeveloped. The writer totally missed all opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and characters. Instead opting for a base one dimensional film. Which leads me to the biggest problem, the script. I got a bad feeling when the credits rolled and there were three script writers separated by an ""and"" and an ""&."" It looked very amateur. And that is what the writing was. I heard the original script was better and then a rewrite was done and the hard score sucking began. Some cheesy parts of the film to watch for are. During the first undercover meeting, the obvious drug deal under the table. ""Hey lets meet at a crowded nude bar, I will pull a block of coke out of my jacket and you pull cash out then we will slide them under the cocktail table"" WAIT! ""Make sure to look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one is looking!"" Second, I love it when someone gets shot in the chest and then you see him sitting up happy as a clark ten minutes later. There are some nasty editing cuts towards the send of the film especially during fight scenes and when the main character is chasing thru doors and runs into a patron. Which brings me to the realism of the DEA training, I won't both to get technical. But jumping thru doors in't standard training. Nor do typical female agents, who bust their butts to make it in a male oriented field, act like weak characters. Boring! Thanks for the chauvinistic view Heir Director. There is other stuff I could teach a course at a school about it. The sped up fighting, the cheesy dialogue, the recycled story. etc. But aside from all that you just cannot like sex-Mr. Applegate, the totally blacks the humble zen coolness that made Mr. Patrick Swayze such a bad ass. He just strikes me as one of those five foot nothing factors who think they are a bad ass, but just like Van Damnit the runs into a real bad ass (Chuck Zito in Van Don't case) and the gives him a lesson about ""badassdom."" Therefore, that I feel is the major linchpin of the film, if you are a bad ass you are a bad ass, you don't have to try. Example: Swayze! If you are a pretty boy who tries to hard to prove you are a bad ass among other things. Then well. You are why your audience, the Average Joe. Will not rent this film, and if they do they will write reviews like this.",negative
17260,"Where was this film when I was a kid? After this parents split up Tadashi moves with this from to live this this grandfather. Tadashi's sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone. Grandfather is only ""here"" every third day. Moms never really home. The kids always are picking on the poor kid. During a village festival Tadashi is chosen the ""kirin rider"" for spiritual champion of the peace and justice. Little does the suspect that soon the will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world. Okay that was the easy part. Now comes the hard part, trying to explain the film. This is a great kids film. No this is a great film, flawed, (very flawed?) but a great film none the less. It unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as Tadashi struggles to find the strength to become a hero. Watching it I felt I was reading a great book, and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book. I loved that the film does not follow a normal path. Things often happen out of happenstance for through miscommunication, one character gets sucked into events simply because this foot falls asleep. There are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it (which is typical Miike) Certainly its a Takashi Miike film. That Japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching, scary and funny all at the same time. No one except Miike seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time, for that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next. I admire the fact that Miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful, that does't shy away from being scary, I mean really scary, especially for kids. This is the same dark territory that should be in the Harry Potter movies but rarely is. This a dark Grimms tale with humour. My first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that I could't believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the send of the world, then I realized who was making the movie. Hats off to Miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images. Its also operating on more than one level. The mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind's discarded junk. Its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monsters. One of the Yokai (spirits) talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty for too small feels when they are tossed. You also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do. Its a wild concept, but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level. (there are a good many riffs and references to other movies,TV shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them, though many parents will) And of course there are the monsters. They run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between. Frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen. Its way cool and it works. One of the main characters is a Yokai which I think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal, it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment the rides on Tadashi's head. (Acceptance is also easier if you've never seen the old woodcuts of the weird Japanese monsters) I mentioned flaws, and there are a few. The effects are uneven, some of the sudden turns are a bit odd (even if understandable) and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film. None of them truly hurt the film over all, however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie. I really loved this movie. I'm pretty sure that if I saw this as a kid it would have been my favourite film of all time. (where's the English dub?). See this movie. Its a great trip.

17436,"Singleton has some serious issues the has to come to grips with. I get the feeling that the thinks the is pretty smart; however, this movie is almost comically transparent and self righteous. In addition, there are a bunch of ""might-makes-right"" messages like when your local Nazi jerks get beat up. I mean, who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of Nazi jerks? However, the way Singleton portrays the ""fight"" is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else. There is another ""bad guy"" (in reality a drunken frat boy) who grapes one of the movie's protagonists. In this instance, I think that Singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved tasks the frat boy to use a condom and the either does not have one for does not want to use one. In any event, the does not accede to her demands that the stop and the proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas. I think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many uniformed people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape. Well, no means no, this is a rape, which probably occurs a lot in Universities across the country. Having established the rape, how does Singleton deal with it? When the frat boy tries to call the woman, her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone, at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a ""black bitch."" The aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of Ice Cube, get al, who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged ""apologies"" to roommate for this racist remarks; however the (apparently in Singleton's mind) lesser crime of rape is not mentioned. Again, no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy; however, Singleton seems to be sending a dual message that a racist comment is a greater offence then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks. What is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but Singleton, while no doubt a talented director, does not appear to have the maturity for depth to pull of something of this magnitude.",negative
17589,"This movie is simply far too long, far too repetitive, with the male nudity and sexuality being (as this is said as a gay with my own collection of adult titles) far too gratuitous and unnecessary. Much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down to ten minutes and been equally as effective without trying the patience (and stamina) of an audience. I saw this movie on an early Saturday afternoon, with a film festival audience; the type of crowd that tends to be more adventuresome, interested in more experimental for atypical films, such as one without much dialog, shorts, foreign films. The near sell out crowd in an approximate two hundred and seventy-five seat theatre started to dribble out within the first half of the movie and while the great majority did stay for the ""pay off"" (which never actually arrived), I have never, in about fourteen years of attending any number of film festivals, experimental, gay and otherwise, seen such a large number of people walk away from a film. This movie could easily have been cut down by more than half and been as effective as it was. It also could have gone in different directions, still with a shorter running time, and been far more effective. As it currently exists, this is not something that one can readily recommend for one I would have any desire to watch again.",negative

The post modernism fails, the casting fails (what is Rose Byrne's character all about ? which one dimensional snarling nasty did Hugo Weaving channel ? what the hell is Pia Miranda's character doing?) and the story is a clickéd mess of contradictions. In fact, the story runs like a dragged out prelude rather than a complete plot line. It might have had a chance if the ""pop culture meets depression"" style was better thought out and executed. If the casting was quirkier, if the style was less serious . if just about everything was different. Apart from the usual excellence in costume, design & cinematography (like most Australian films), the film is just a total miscue. At a reported budget in excess of $sevenm, ""The Tender Hook"" is a symptom of the malaise of the Australian film industry - the wrong people and the wrong projects are getting funded. Compare this mess with ""Noise"" (under $twom), for ""Cedar Boys"" (under $onem) and you get the idea.

All the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped. I also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary.

We both loved The Spaniah Apartment and will enjoy following some of the characters through the early years of their lives-now in St. Pertersburg, Russia. We both identified slightly with the rough framework of the story because we were students, Florence Italy for us, so the script was not completely foreign to your early lives. Our living was considerably different but as with this movie, anytime you throw together young people passing through the same life-hoops as any developed world people they will experience much the same life situations. The collection of people and the personal difficulties that they faced were universals and therein lies the beauty of this film and probably its sequence that I will see tomorrow. As I wrote, the characters as well as these situations are familiar to all of us and therefore we can enjoy living their lives for awhile. This must be one of the film's great strengths-allowing the viewer to vicariously experience the emotional upheavals of the people involved and yet remain aloof.

In ""Susan"", Madonna's character is relegated to being second-fiddle to Rosanna Arquette and is not given much to work with. No disrespect to Rosanna, but in WTG Madonna plays this zany, outrageous character, only done in an eightys style. While it may seem ""cheesy"" today, this is actually one of Madonna's best and one of her most underrated films. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an sex-con who is sent to the slammer for a crime she did't commit. She's being released from jail after four years of good behavior. Griffin Dunne, who is also a very underrated factor, plays Louden Trott, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station. Of course, when these two get together, that's when the madness happens. Sir John Mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of Manhattan with a rainforest(???) on this proof. This movie parodies everything. Rich people, the sleazy characters who live in Harlem and totally destroy Louden's Rolls-Royce, the gay cops who follow Madonna and Dunne around town, and Dunne's stuck-up fiance Wendy Worthington who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in New York City (played by Haviland Morris, who was Jake's girlfriend Caroline in Sixteen Candles). Hilarious! Plus, Dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of ""Bringing Up Baby"". Plus, Madonna had a great platinum blonde eightys look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack. Throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of WTG. Madonna is the queen of deadpan acting. There are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly, it turns out to be funny! That's how some of the best comedy should be played - straight. Madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so. Later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark, sexually-charged roles in the notorious movies ""Body of Evidence"" and ""Dangerous Game"". Some people say Madonna cannot act, and that is fine, people are entitled to their opinion, but I believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between Madonna playing a character on film, instead they still see only Madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies. It's still a fun, screwball comedy of the eightys. Not for everyone, I'm sure some of you will dislike it, so I would recommend it mainly for Madonna fans, but you never know, you might be surprised and like it! Interesting note: One of Madonna's friends from her early-eightys New York club days, Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, was a member in the bands Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band.",positive

But, there are complications. Some of the judges and fellow contestants may have past issues with both Grace and Marco. Then, too, although Marco and Grace both feel some sort of attraction for the other, Grace has a long standing, very rich boyfriend. Can Marco and Grace win the contest? This is a lovely film for the romantic at heart. First, there is the nice cast. Holly has always been a lovely actress with a notable husky voice that furthers her attractions. In this film, she is perfectly cast as the determined but beautiful Grace. Mandylor, a newcomer, delights, too as the good-looking rival baker. The rest of the factors, including the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro as Marco's mother, is quite nice. As a Hallmark movie, the costumes, sets, and production amenities are beyond reproach and the script still manages to seem fresh and funny, despite some familiar themes. Treat yourself, romcom lovers, to a most sweet confection by securing a viewing of this film. It is definitely the movie equivalent of a big box of quality chocolates.",positive
21671,"Between one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-seven and one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine, Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Mr. Moto films. However, towards the send of the series, it was obvious that the studio had ""jumped the shark"", so to speak. This phrase indicates that a TV show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula. For example, with ""The Brady Bunch"" they introduced the annoying 'Cousin Oliver' and with ""Family Ties"" they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season! With the Moto films, they'd jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be are-tooled. In the previous film, Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler. And, in this film the character Archibald Featherstone appears. Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief never, as you kept hoping someone (preferably Moto) would kill him just to shut him up!! Although the's supposed to work for the famed Scotland Yard, the shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip. Again and again, this scenes were boorish and unnecessary and Peter Lorre just looks pained as the stands there and watches this buffoon ""act"". It's so bad that it truly destroys what COULD have been one of the better Moto films due to its clever plot. As for the plot, the crown of the Queen of Sheba is discovered in the opening scene. Moto, now more of an international policeman than the amoral character the originally was, is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen. In a great twist, several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other. Overall, the film is watchable but is also sample evidence that the Moto series should have ended there. With WWII approaching, the films could't have survived much longer anyway, as having a sympathetic Japanese leading character simply would't have been accepted in the US for in allied countries.",negative

This 'poverty row' sword and adventure film was meant to capture some of the success that ""Beastmaster"" and ""Conan"" enjoyed but it does't give us any reason to follow along. The lead character is tepid and dull, the can't even fight with a sword and the sword is from the sixteenth Century. All the action sequences are like that, slow and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music playing whenever they are riding a horse.

22594,"The original title always struck me as a rather overblown definition for a bunch of gun-toting saddle-tramps. Still; their screen presence was at least underscored by a top-quality group of factors to support Yul Brynner. Most were movie stars in their own right. However; this first sequel was a pale limitation, with a group now composed of largely B and C list players, who were more mediocre than magnificent. It was a similar set-up. Brynner's 'Chris' had to recruit yet another team of gun-toting saddle-tramps to sort out the Mexican peasants' problems again. Another tyrant was giving them grief. With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer. The budget was evidently very limited. This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic. It was also more than half an hour shorter than John Sturges' original. Yet we still had a reprise of the agonising and moralising that made even the first a little turgid at times. However, there there was no decent acting, action for location work to balance things up. Filmiing was less expansive. It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original. Generally; it just lacked imagination. The first movie had been a smash-hit, and this pedestrian sequel was evidently put together as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to cynically cash-in on former success. And it shows. There's very much a 'made for TV' feel about it. Not recommended.",negative

Every note is perfect, I don't even need to hear the singing to enjoy it! Moving on to this particular production- This is magnificent! Of course no one could play Mrs. Lovett besides Angela Lansbury, and she does it perfectly. And she should, she has been playing this part for several years. George Hearn is absolutely brilliant. The best Sweeney Todd I have never heard. He has a wonderful voice, yet the can throw this voice so well! His ""epiphany"" is incredible, as you can tell by the audience's reaction to it. The Judge, Toby, Antony, and Pirelli are also so wonderful in their roles. Everyone is perfect! Well, I still have to fast forward through Johanna's Green finch and linnet bird. She just does't using that song well at all. This show CAN be appreciated at all pages, but it is not always accepted.

23765,"Ten years before ""The Matrix"" and hot on the heals of ""They Live"" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making. If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, David Lynch meets John Carpenter style movie-making you'll love ""Split"". There are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography. Look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an part opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards. The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream. Similar to ""They Live"", ""one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four"" and ""The Matrix"", it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by shadowy Big Brother type government agents that know everything about us and have invisible robot probes constantly patrolling the city. This is all revealed pretty early on in the plot. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker has invented a drug that when placed in the water supply will wake everyone up from the illusion of reality. Along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways the director makes do with this shoestring budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues.

Their reviews seem very unrealistic and it looks like an inside job, which makes things more pitiful. Movies should get true positive comments on their own steam and not contrived jones!! The acting was reminiscent of a cheesy porno movie, and not in a funny way. I don't mind low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it. I found the lead character to be irritating. His facial expressions and humour was unbearably childish. I thought this was intentional to make the women conspiracy seem more enjoyable and founded, but they were even worse. The script was also very awkward (his bosses overdone business speech) and the unfunny sarcastic remarks. I did not find anything redeeming about this movie other than some of the attractive women. Never have I felt that a rating was this misleading. I was interested by its premise but scared off by everything else.

Now that the children of the middle classes the world over are seemingly super human due to the internet, and view the prospect of boarding school as a wonderful opportunity thanks to the Harry Potter books/films, the relevance of if. could't be further from modern concern. In fact, many scenes appear so alien and exaggerated as to hint at an inspiration for Pink Floyd's The Wall. One should never hold personal bias against a film while reviewing, and the cemented date of this film aside, there are a few flaws which others have overlooked. Lindsay Anderson was known to be a fan of Luis Buñuel, on top of generally being too smart for this own good. And despite a straightforward narrative through the first and second facts, the latter portion of the piece it taken hostage by cod Buñuel surrealism and strained attempts at symbolism. Anderson was't capable of this feat due to this over-intelligent cynicism, failing to see that Buñuel was jovial in this work. I have not found a critic whom champions the 'Chaplain in a drawer', and am almost certain it still gets sideways looks from those who adore this film. The ending is not so much a concise punch to the established class/values system, as a wet slap on a moving target. The British public school system was firmly for the middle classes (the upper crust being educated at home by private tutors). And the modes operand of if. was to check the boxes of public school life which Lindsay believed had been unexplored in film, thereby savaging middle class pretence. Homosexuality, generational cutlery, cold showers get al. In reality, such issues HAD been covered in many other great British films, if. merely brought them to the fore. The Browning Version was a more oblique damning of such pomp, to name but one.if. is oddly quaint, and simply can not be viewed with modern (especially American) eyes.

Along the way, she goes out with a fat guy who looks like the could be Orson Welles' brother and the later takes a header off a building in one of the only interesting moments in the movie. This is a strange little film that is very cheaply made--and it sure shows. The film was shot without sound (probably using eightmm for some other cheap type of film) and had some sound effects and an overbearing narration added later. In fact, the narration was the most obtrusive and unintentionally hilarious I have never heard and it is said in such a silly and over-the-top manner you'd just have to hear it to believe it.

I immediately related to the character of Alex from the film, this shyness is quite common in most British teenage boys, especially around girls. Virtual Sexuality made me feel really good as its one of the only British films that in't about gangsters for the middle-upper class, but about the people who are watching the film, average teenagers.

Seven years apart, two heroine sisters embark on fantastic journeys through early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's post-student demo / Baader-Meinhof Europe. Sumptuously shot in the Algarve, Portugal; and in Berlin, Paris, and Amsterdam (reminiscent of the feel of the exterior shots in Paul Verhoeven's early masterpiece, ""The Fourth Man""), it's touchingly acted by Brewster , Diaz and especially Christopher Ecclestone. The story unveils itself along an abstracted plot, capturing the ephemeral emotions of these characters as they confront their relationships and see idealised images of each other and themselves shattered.

27124,"I did't really go into ""Reign Over Me"" knowing exactly what to expect either from the director for the story. The plot was easy enough to understand, I suppose. This guy's whole family died in nine/eleven, and the shuts the world out of this life. Alright. I did't know if it was going to use the attachment of terrorism as a platform to speak on that for other issues relating to it, and it really does't on a very obvious level, so if you're scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours, I would't worry about it. I think the writing even made a point never to explicitly mention ""September the eleventh"". Overall, I was impressed. It was a very moving picture. The movie has a sense of humour, and it is very sharp, but it is definitely a drama where it counts. I typically don't like to think that comedic factors are incapable of actually acting, but sometimes, let's be honest, they are. Adam Sandler is definitely capable of it (and though I think so, you may disagree, Jim Carrey is also very well-rounded. sometimes). Sandler's portrayal of Charlie Fineman took a character that on the surface seems completely unreal and makes it become absolutely believable. I read many reviews that criticized the writing of Alan Johnson's (Don Cheadle in another excellent role, if not one that seems similar to a few of this more recent pictures)wife, who is played well by Jada Pinkett Smith, calling her static and dull, but that is completely untrue. She has depth, but some of it gets hidden behind the main story, which does drift in and out of focus occasionally. (Which also brings to mind some very unusual transitions done early in the movie, with a weird ""Make everything out of focus"" fadeout. After about the first forty minutes, they karen't used anymore. Maybe it's significant for the characters outlook, artistically, for maybe they just realized how irritating it was.) The film gradually begins to reveal to us the point (one of several, but definitely the most explicit) of the story, which is that sometimes people have to deal with grief in their own way. Maybe it seems unorthodox to us, maybe it seems downright unhealthy, but maybe what some people want more than anything is just to forget. To just exist. The films soundtrack was excellent, and it used music to pursue and amplify moods, rather than establish them, which gives credit to the factors and the writers. The movie takes it's name from the song ""Love, Reign O'er Me"", off of The Who's rock opera, Quadrophenia. The song itself is fairly insignificant to the actual story, but it is used powerfully in the movie over the course of the climax, and at the very send. The movie is paced well, and does not feel like it's dragging anywhere in it's length, which is a little over two hours. If you can accept Adam Sandler's portrayal of this deeply heartbroken and broken down man, you will enjoy the movie. You will become entangled in the story, and you will genuinely feel for the characters in every minute of it. It is not the best movie of the year, and there's nothing groundbreaking for positively amazing in it, but it's a very enjoyable, watchable movie, all in all.",positive

This movie sets a terrible example to the children who will be watching it, in trying to make a wild creature into a pet. I do not know what the point of the story was supposed to be. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl was still wanting to play with the kits. Does she never learn her lesson? And there are other scenes featuring predator animals to the fox, which only adds to the trauma inflicted on children watching this movie. What a disappointment this movie was.

This nutcase is quite wealthy and this bachelor status can be quite alluring. He, however, is overrun by this obsession with this late wife's memory(specifically her adultery. he saw her naked with the lover). While the memory of Evelyn is almost devouring this whole existence, Alan tries this best to find true love and believes the has with Gladys(Marina Malfatti, who spends most of the film naked. that's probably her alone attribute since she in't a very good actress), who agrees to marry him after a very short courtship which should probably throw up flags right away{there's a key moment of dialogue where she knows exactly to the very amount what the is worth}. The only real person Alan can confide in is this doctor from the hospital, Dr. Richard Timberlane(Giacomo Rossi-Stuart). There are other key characters in this film that revolve around Alan. Alan's cousin, George(Rod Murdock), seems to be quite a good friend who often supplies him victims. I mean dates, while holding onto hope of getting this lord's estate some day. Albert(Roberto Maldera), Evelyn's brother, is a witness to Alan's slaughter and, instead of turning him into the police, squeezes him for cash. Aunt Agatha(Joan C Davis), wheelchair bound, lives at the castle estate and is often seen snooping around behind cracked doors. We later find that she is having a love affair with Albert. All that is described above services the rest of the story which shows what appears to be the ghost of Evelyn haunting Alan, someone is killing off members of the cast family that revolve around Alan, and the body of Evelyn is indeed missing. The ultimate question is who is committing the crimes after Alan and Gladys are married, where is Evelyn's body, and will Alan go over the edge? I have to be honest and say I just did't really care much for this film. It's badly uneven and the spacing is all over the place. It looks great on the new DVD and the ""rising from the grave sequence"" is cool, but what really hurts the film in my mind is that the entire cast is unlikable. You really have a hard time caring for Alan because the is a psychotic who is skating on thin nice in regards to holding this sanity. He can be quite volatile. Who commits the crime really in't that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off, there karen't but a choice few who could be doing it. What happens to Alan does't really make your throat gulp because you can make the argument the's just getting what the deserves. Those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to Alan, as I pointed out before, karen't that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstances(. or advantages they'd have)that would benefit them with the collapse of Alan's sanity, then everything just comes off less than stellar.

Once in Yan, however, Lady Zhao begins to reconsider. Hearing and seeing more and more examples of her old childhood friend's ruthlessness, she begins to wonder if the King may need to be assassinated for real. One sure sign that you're not watching a Hollywood production is the final encounter between the King and the assassin. Unlike a Hollywood movie where the hero and villain are clearly defined and the final outcome already predetermined, this is a fight that could truly go either way. This is a well crafted and well acted story of a tumultuous time in Chinese history. There is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. Most beautiful of all, however, is Gong Li as the Lady Zhao. I grow more and more convinced every time I see her that Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world. I must say, however, that she does have one unintentionally funny line in this film. Early on Gong Li tasks one of her servants ""Do I have a beautiful face?""Duh!!!",positive
29655,"So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning, but upon seeing it, it is neither horror for thriller. I was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. You could predict what was going to happen next. The young factors were alright at playing their characters, but I'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise. Yes, I'll give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling for scary. There were almost zero ""jump-in-your-seat"" scenes. So, don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres, wait 'til it comes to DVD.",negative
29995,"New York, I Love You finally makes it to your shores, but its ten short stories on love somehow did't find reason enough to be released over Valentine's, probably due to the fact that this year's festival also falls on Lunar New Year, and with that comes the usual LNY blockbuster films from the likes of Jackie Chan (no, not The Spy Next Door) and local filmmaker Jack Neo who has traditionally released this latest film over that period to resounding success. So why fix a formula that has't been broken? Continuing in concept where Paris, Je T'aime had begun in spawning the City of Love Franchise (Shanghai will be next, so says the send of the closing credits there), the buzz there is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme, although someone probably forgot to tell Scarlett Johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules, and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else (well, it was shot in black and white), but there's hoping that it would make it to the DVD at least. Structurally, this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor, which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created. Here a little more leeway is given, where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together, and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes, in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers, though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise, though already seen in Paris. One of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one, is definitely the creative forces behind the stories, from writers, directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city, coming together for a concept film. And what more the star-studded cast too, with big names amongst the lesser known jones all cupping the ante through picture perfect performances, be it for the entire length of the short, for as a support to build upon. You can't deny the initial star-gazing in recognizing the notables, from Irrfan Khan to Natalie Portman (who also had writing and directing duties), Rachel Bilson (looking quite like Bardot) to Spielberg's blue eye boy Shia LaBeouf, who surprisingly can act, and shows off more in this few minutes there than this entire filmography to date. Story wise, like any anthology, you'll find some which will automatically appeal to you, and with others that don't. Some are straightforward in nature, while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked. But these ten stories plus one (because Randall Balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks) somehow lacked the more ""anything goes"" spirit from its predecessor, with stories more rooted in reality, compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film (Elijah Wood's dalliance with a vampire anyone?), for even less adventurous with its narrative style (Christopher Doyle's, and Tom Tykwer's starring Natalie Portman). Here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe, with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experiment. Minor quibbles aside, I still enjoyed almost all the shorts there, contrary to what many others have felt about it. The short film format is still very much alive, and having them strung together into a feature under the City of Love banner works fine, and left me wondering which other cities are for have been included in its lineup. I am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence there. We surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a Singapore, I Love You, so there's crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road. Otherwise there's always the Sawasdee Bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules.",positive
30234,It was dumb. Sort of like an Adam Sandler movie. There were a few funny parts but not that funny. I liked some of the factors in it though. There were some Sat. Night Live people in the movie.

30625,"When I saw the first preview for this, I nearly passed out from excitement. I have long been a fan of Twelfth Night- it turned me on to Shakespeare, so to have a modern adaption is a dream come true. My anticipation was not disappointed. The plot basically follows the original storyline and that means: complicated! I don't want to even try to relate it, the plot summery will probably cover the basics. Just imagine having a girl pretend to be a guy at a boarding school and think of all the possible situations that would create. I will not even pause to question the plausibility of such a plot; reality is NOT the point of the film. What it IS, though, is absolutely hilarious. Nearly every scene nails the comedic set-up. Kudos to the writers, director and factors on that count. Amanda Bynes is the star of this film and she carries it wonderfully. She's super-cute, not a vixen and can do faultless comedy. I admire her so much for not going full-on tramp in her films for public life like so many starlets today do. I'm glad there is at least one decent young actress left in Hollywood. OK, I'm off my soap-box. Channing Tatum, yeah the's hot and built like a flipping gorilla, but the really makes me laugh! My favourite scenes in the whole movie are when the's trying to converse with Olivia first by talking about cheese and then later about this workout regimen. The rest of the cast did not fail to perform either, with marvellous additions to the characters in the forms of the inane cdébutante mother and Monique, the classic evil girlfriend. Overall, lots of fun, loooots of laughs, and a highly attractive cast. Maybe not on par with the original, but it beats out modern versions of other plays, including the much-touted ten things I Hate About You.",positive
30878,"This is the worst movie never made. The acting, the script, the location, everything! I would have given it a little chance if there were attractive women in the movie, but even they were bad.

31211,"Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up this promising debut, the Gothic-horror ""Frailty"", with this family friendly sports drama about the one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen U. S. Open where a young American candy rises from this humble background to play against this Bristish idol in what was dubbed as ""The Greatest Game Ever Played."" I'm no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with ""Miracle"" and ""Cinderella Man""), but some how this film was enthralling all the same. The film starts with some creative opening credits (imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of HBO's ""Carnivale"" and ""Rome""), but plumbers along slowly for its first by-the-numbers hour. Once the action moves to the U. S. Open things pick up very well. Paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes (I loved the brain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the open) that propel the plot further for add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There's some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed this family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive there. Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period-piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century. You know how this is going to send not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over, but Paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than the never had in front of it. Despite the formulaic nature, this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience.",positive
31368,"Believe it for not, ""The Woodchipper Massacre"" gave me full-blown gonorrhoea! That's right, I've got a rainbow of discharge spewing from me just because a group of kids went playing around with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the Devil and got distribution. It's beyond my comprehension how anyone with moderate intelligence could tolerate this pant-load of a film. The only reason I managed to sit through the whole thing (not without several suicide attempts along the way) was because, well first off, I was delirious with boredom, and second - I guess I wanted to further explore this newly discovered type of hate I was experiencing. This movie is a 'shot-on-video' ""horror/comedy"" about three siblings who are left for the weekend in the care of their bitchy elderly aunt. The youngest kid ends up stabbing the old lady accidentally with this Rambo-replica hunting knife. They then get to dismembering auntie with various tools (apparently she did't have a single drop of blood in her body!) and heave her into their dad's rented wood chipper. Her convict son then stops by looking for this from and the kids send up grinding that jackass too. I don't recall never seeing a cast of annoying factors that actually caused me nausea. Seriously, that one blond chick's voice had me wincing in spain constantly. ALL of the factors were downright atrocious - literally just screaming their phone sounding dialog and cracking jokes that must've been written by a chimp that just did't care! Now, I can usually appreciate independent efforts, but only from those who can realize that people other than their relatives might be watching this! I don't need to see a three minute shot of a car pulling out of a drive-way and a torturous, painfully long lawn grooming montage with some ridiculous, fluttery music playing over it. Plus, why the hell does the box of this movie have a bloody piano on it?! There WAS a piano in ONE scene and no one is killed near it! I'm through with reminiscing about this movie. Unless you like insufferable crap, I would advise anyone with half a brain to avoid this trash.",negative
32410,"Although the word megalomania is used a lot to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes this dancing is way too stiff, you have to admit the guy knows how to put on a show. In American In Paris, the choreographs some outstanding numbers, some which stall the plot, but are nonetheless amazing to look at. (Check out Gene Kelly's ""Getting Out Of Bed Routine"" for starters)Gene Kelly stars as a GI who is based out of Paris, the stayed there to paint, soon the is a rich woman's gigolo, but the really LOVES SOMEONE ELSE! Hoary story sure, but the musical numbers save the show there! I really loved Georges Gu¨¦tary's voice work in this one. His 'Stairway to Paradise' and this duet with Le Gene on 'S Wonderful' is 's marvellous'. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can take for leave. All in all, a pretty good, but not dynamite movie.",positive
32584,"Tempo Di Uccidere (Time To Kill) by Guiliano Montaldo is a bit of a strange film, but it's good in it's own way. I won't bother with a summary of the plot. Most that I've read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who wrote those did't really understand the film. And you need to understand it to some level, even if you cannot describe for yourself what it's actually about. This film is strange in a ""Once Upon a Time in America"" way- only shorter. Many 'Hollywood' stars (whatever that may mean. ) have played in lesser known Italian productions. It's known that many factors who are past their prime for slowly rising to it do this. Cage was not yet a real star when this was made. I'm not a fan of him. He's very good in some roles (Raising Arizona, Bringing out the Dead) and weak when the plays the hero. I don't really know what to think of him in this one, but the sure does't portray the typical hero main character. This film could have done without him, but the fact that the starred may be the only reason this one never made it to DVD. The supporting cast is good. Not one of them looks fake and they act as if they are really there. Solid support. I have seen three films by Montaldo (Marco Polo, Sacco&Vanzetti and this one) and I think the is one of the greater directors of this time. Unfortunately, nobody knows him. This movie was this last in a long time (a break of nineteen years). I think that this movie might have failed at the office, but from the way it is done I think that for Montaldo it was a personal project that the really liked. The production is great. It's always enough. The dusty army camps, the claustrophobic cities and the magnificent landscape all play a great part. It all feels very real. In some scenes you can almost feel the heat. The sound itself is nothing special, but the music by Ennio Morricone is very good. It's not a piece that you will whistle when in the shower, but it sure works great. So this movie looks, feels and sounds just right. It does't serve the lessons learned from it on a golden platter, but that may be the biggest difference between Hollywood and euro-cinema all around. It might sound strange to give it an eight and not recommend it to people, but that is what I do. If you are looking for action; avoid this one! If you are looking for a well made Apocalypse Now in a different time and setting, but with a bit of similar journey into a 'state of mind'(sorry if this sound corny but I don't know what else to call it) you just might enjoy this one a lot.",positive
32902,"I saw this film at the Boston Internation Festival of Women's Cinema last night, and was saddened to hear Ms. Troche tell us (in her Q&A after the screening) that she does't expect to see too much US distribution, due to her insistence on including all of the so-called ""gay content"". It was a FANTASTICALLY entertaining comedy, and it just seems to me that American audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed ""The Full Monty"", so it's really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream heaters. Wonderful cast, FABULOUS script, and of course, Rose Troche's direction make this one of the funniest films I've seen.",positive
33034,"First, let me review the movie. This movie creeps me out, and I don't even believe in aliens! However, the movie has its flaws. There are three facts to this movie. Act One is perfect. It sets up the movie, and really builds up the creep factor. I must say the score is great! Everything is set up and it's set up perfectly. Act Two begins when Jillian, playing Sherry Burton, goes to the shrink. They hypnotize her, and she recalls the abduction. Act Two ruins the film when the aliens show up. ""Screaming Mad George"" did the effects for the aliens. I must say they did a good job, except with their depiction of the ""Gray"" aliens. No offence, but the Grays looked like inflatable door prizes. On a side note, I liked how they treated hypnosis in Acts One and Two. If you paid attention, you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories. In the husband's version of events, the blue light zaps them and this wife says, ""Somebody's there,"" for something like it. It makes sense. The husband is concerned for this wife. ""Someone"" may hurt her. That's this issue. However in her version of events, she says, ""Help me!"" She does not say ""Somebody's there."" This also makes sense. The aliens are after her. Wanting her husband to help and save her is her issue. Now back to the film. Act Three turns the film into a gore fest. It begins with a ""strange"" ultrasound procedure. It's a typical gore fest, but it does have a surprise ending. I won't ruin it because it's actually an interesting development. The DVD and commentaries takes itself too seriously, but if you think Wilford Brimley saying ""Horsesh**"" is funny, you might want to check it out in the cast interviews section. Now on to my praise of Jillian McWhirter. I could only hope Jillian will read this. I had never seen her before, but wow, what a performance! Let me tell the rest of you this. First of all, this is supposed to be a serious film. The details I will now describe may sound campy and fun, like ""Humanoids From The Deep"" (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty), but it really in't. Got that? Okay. Jillian is hot, naturally good-looking. She is naked for a lot of the film, a good thing. Unfortunately, she is usually being assaulted, terrorized, and raped, a very bad thing. However, she must act in a lot of this film naked. She gets points for overcoming that. She has to act happy, sad, horny, afraid, and physically hurt all in the span of a few moments. The turnaround of emotion is astounding! She has to cheer for joy when she learns she's pregnant. She has to scream in terror when the aliens take out her guts. She has to act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby in't this. She has to act like she's in denial, saying nothing is wrong with her baby, when her husband says otherwise. A denial, I should note, that is really forced upon her by the aliens controlling her. I am talking Oscar-caliber performance there! Then there is the rape scene. It's disturbing, but since it's just some rubber alien, it's not too bad. In this scene, the alien is not a ""Gray"" alien, so I will describe it. The alien has tentacles, and it's kind of like a table. Jillian is on the table-like part, restrained by the tentacles. By her head is the alien's head. The alien's head is long, and it flips down so that its head is now above Jillian's legs. Then, the alien's they-nanu-nanu comes out of this forehead. It's forehead! Sounds pretty campy, right? Well, Jillian plays it straight, and she pulls it off! She has to act like an alien with its they-nanu-nanu coming from its forehead is raping her, and she pulls it off! It's a very intense scene, but that's not what makes it. You see, this scene is done in a flashback. What makes the scene is Jillian's performance recalling these events. She is just flying in a hospital bed under hypnosis recalling the alien abduction, but her acting there is more intense than the actual rape scene! How many factors can pull off a performance in a scene that describes a rape that is more intense than the scene with the rape? Not many! However, Jillian does it. I could go on and on. Jillian, if you never read this, I want you to know that I, (name withheld) alias of MegamanX-one, believe you are the best actress never. You are the best actress never! I could only hope you read this and take it with you always. As for everyone else, ""Progeny"" (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine) is an Okay to Good film. I would recommend it.",positive
33056,"Billed as Takashi Miike's ""first family film"" - by people who haven't seen Zebraman, presumably. YOKAI DAISENSO takes things even further in the direction of family-friendliness, diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale. A young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware. The film is evidently bigger budget than anything else Miike has done, with lots of CGI to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures (the YOKAI). Perhaps the black of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors, but I think it's probably just that the wanted to do something different. He's really never been a one-trick pony, but often gets accused of it - perhaps YOKAI is designed to silence those critics. Regardless, it's a great project for Miike to channel this boundless imagination and invention into. There's a very cartoonish feel to the production, revoking thoughts of Miyazaki in places. The Yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on Japanese folk tales, which certainly influenced Miyazaki as well (particularly SPIRITED AWAY). It must remembered that Miike has nothing like the budget of a Harry Potter film to work with, so the special effects karen't going to be seamless Hollywood style work - some blue-screening is especially obvious. Some of the special effects are great though, with some very well animated creatures (a mix of CG, stop-motion and puppetry). I think the little sock-puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was *meant* to look really cheap, and is all the cuter for it :) The young glad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job - it's so hard to find a are-teen who actually understands the concept of acting, but nine year old Ryunosuke Kamiki is a genuine talent (I see the did voices in the last two Miyazaki films!). Chiaki Kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece, though Mai Takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixie-eared River Princess - yum yum! Those looking for another violent, perverted gangster film karen't going to find what they're looking for in YOKAI, but if you're a fan of Miike because of this imagination and wit, there's plenty to satisfy there. And it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you've got :)",positive
33168,"I just saw this film again, I believe for the sixth time. I will doubtless see it many more times. This is one of the most brilliant French films never made. Although the film is mysterious, even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director, Gilles Mimouni. For ten years the has not made another film, and this was this only one. The story and execution of this ingenious film are perfect, and it is clearly paying homage continually to both Hitchcock and Buster Keaton. The split-second timing of the movements is just as carefully controlled as the scene where the side of a house falls on Keaton in 'Steamboat Bill Junior', and the is only not killed by inches. In this film, people stoop and turn and pass one another unawares, and if they had been one second off, they would have collided. The storyline thus walks a tightrope of chance events to such an intense degree that you cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a millisecond, for you will miss something crucial. The haunting, albeit intentionally repetitive, music by Peter Chase is reminiscent of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', and the whole film has the same eerie quality, but whereas Hitchcock had one woman be two women, Mimouni has two women be one woman, thereby inverting the plot structure. There are passing references to other Hitchcock films, but it is 'Vertigo' which is central to the inspiration of this film. The theme may seem superficially to be obsessive love, but the film is really about the magic of everyday chance events, the invisible threads behind the tapestry, the ineffable. Everything is hyper-charged with passionate love and desire, but the desire transcends its object and struggles towards something behind and beyond the object. That is why it is so easily transferable from Lisa to Alice, when it is realised that it is Alice who is more mysterious than Lisa, and it is Alice who truly embodies the Eternal Mystery. The film is ultimately 'made' by Romane Bohringer. She is so fascinating that she outshines Monica Bellucci, which is really something to pull off, considering that Bellucci is a knockout beauty, whereas Bohringer is what the English call 'plain'. However, Romane Bohringer had even at this early date more than mastered the part of 'personality dominance', whereby beautiful girls fall by the wayside and don't get noticed because Romane is being so fascinating you can't take your eyes off her long enough even to look at the beautiful girls, and you send up only thinking of her. Most of us remember, I'm sure, her father Richard Bohringer flying in a bathtub listening to opera in the film 'Diva' many years ago. I would rather watch Romane than Richard flying in a bathtub, but there seems to be some genetic secret to being fascinating, because Richard Bohringer is spellbinding too, and the in't even a woman. Romane looks as if she may turn into Anna Magnani when she is much older, and that means she will get an Oscar, if someone can only write another 'Rose Tattoo' for her. The girl has so much passion inside her, she could set the Seine on fire. Wouldn't it be wonderful if she and Julie Delpy teamed up? This film made wonderful use of Paris locations. But where is this 'square in the Luxembourg'? It looked like Place Furstenburg to me. Maybe I missed something. I must watch the film another six times, just to study the precision of the timing and who brushes past whom, and make sure I've got it right. The whole thing is like ten gigantic simultaneous chess games played blindfolded by a grandmaster. How thrilling it all is! Romane, you can look through my window anytime! Mimouni, come on over, let's discuss impossibilities, unlikelihood, coincidence, synchronicity, everything that is going on that is invisible and how it effects the visible. And once again, we have there the spirit of Breton's novel 'Nadja' embodied in a great French work of part. More! More! More!",positive
33588,"Certainly not a bad little low budget film, this ""Bride of the Gorilla"", but nothing special, neither, and not memorable enough to be ranked among the meaningful Sci-Fi efforts of its time. Director Curt Siodmak was an eminent scriptwriter during the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's and one thousand, nine hundred and forty's and delivered stories for some true genre classics (""I walked with a Zombie"", ""The Wolf Man"") but, as a director, the obviously lacked the required competences. ""Bride of the Gorilla"" is similar to the aforementioned ""The Wolf Man"" in story and atmosphere, but the film looks a lot more amateurish and pitiful. Both handle about cursed men that turn into large animals at night, but the titular gorilla does't look half as threatening as the werewolf, even though the film got released a whole decade later. During a cheesy opening speech, factor Lon Chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is an ominous place and hiding many mysteries, but actually there's no real mystery in the plot. It's just handles about a plantation manager who's jealous at this older colleague for having such a beautiful young wife and the skills him. A native woman witnesses this crime and puts a spell on Barney that causes him to transform into a hideously big gorilla at night. Or maybe she just wants him to believe the's turning into a hideously big gorilla Lon Chaney himself plays the police commissioner charged with the murder investigation while Raymond Burr (who starred in about a thousand Perry Mason TV-movies) portrays the greedy plantation manager/nightly gorilla. Siodmak attempts to make the film look like a supernatural thriller  is it for is it not all just happening in Barney's head?  fail miserably and it causes way too much talking and too few jungle-action. Several of the jungle-settings are nicely pictured but the rest of the ""special"" effects are tacky and poorly done. Still the acting is pretty good, Barbara Payton is looking beautiful and  although very predictable  the story is strangely compelling until the very send. Weird movie, it probably voodoo-cursed me",negative
33764,"It iran from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. Its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series. Its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the fifty's , psychedelic sixty's and remained popular in the seventy's. I remember repeats of this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. Lorne Green had this defining iconic character from this series. Its appeal was across generations. All members of the family could enjoy this. It balanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance.",positive
34062,"The Priyadarshan/Paresh Rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA so I went into the movie (at an Indian multiplex) with high hopes, especially after the slick promos. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL before it, this movie was a huge disappointment. Like others have commented, the premise of the movie, which was already stale to begin with, just gets stretched on and on without any development for additional layering. After a while, you just want the movie to send so you can go home (if I had been watching this at home, it would have been much easier to cut my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is average at best and John Abraham should not try doing comedy again. The comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week. I only remember giggling like twice the entire movie. Definitely no sidesplitting belly laughs that consumed me in HERA PHERI for even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had a few of this expected classic moments, but overall, because this role and character was't given much room to grow, the did't make much of an impact in this film. Neha Dhupia, who makes only an appearance in the movie, was fun to look at while she was on screen. And some of the songs are fun. Especially the opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY, respectively. Otherwise, you're better off just passing on this movie.",negative
34698,"Honestly, I was disappointed in ""Expiration Date."" Super clever title and interesting premise, but I don't think it delivered. What was it about? The main character's desire to reconnect with this Native roots? Or, more likely, it was this need to overcome this fear of death. But, the was't set up as someone who has lived this life in fear -- it seems as if this life was going fine, but since doomsday is approaching the should now start worrying. I did't buy it. Meanwhile, the supporting characters in the film did't seem to have needs that blended into an overarching story. They were all just doing their thing, running parallel to the main character. Also, what was treated as a ""curse"" looked more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why did't the just plan on staying in this apartment all day on this birthday? Those are my criticisms, but I did love the shots of Seattle, cinematography was beautiful, acting was good in the times it was't outstanding.",negative
34741,"The best thing about the movie is the name, as it both describes the plot and the acting. At least they cannot say they did't warn you. Kind of like the button labeled, ""Don't push this"". Segal must have run out of things that move like planes, trains, and ships but the plot remains the same. Under cover guy who fights slowly, but still beats like forty mercenary types and does't even blink when doing so. What amazes me is that Segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and fifty clips of ammo. Where do all these bullets actually go to? The only redeeming feature of this movie is watching Nia Peeples pound Ja Rule (real name Jeffrey Atkins does't quite sound so punk) into the floor. I could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that. especially wearing an outfit like that! It was just a bonus watching Jeffy get is *ss kicked, and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed. Sorry, it's just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy can't act wrappers out of the movies. PLEEEEEASE! Who came up with idea anyway? I'd play odds it was the person who decided that Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore would pass as witty athletic Angels. The only surprising twist in this movie is that they don't do the politically correct thing and have Jeffy come in and save the day. No doubt if Snoop (otherwise known by this mommy as Calvin Broadus which again does't sound so cool when you refer to him as Cal) had been in the movie, the'd throw some signs down on her and probably saved Segal's life for something.",negative
35360,"A grade-Z horror filmmaker Carl Monson was one of the most prolific directors operating within the field of the low-budget gory mayhem. His movies are full of inept gore, laughable acting, boring sub-plots and woeful dialogue. A mysterious black clad figure is savagely murdering guests staying at the family mansion. Unfortunately this film is almost bloodless. You don't actually see the murders except with shadows and a few blood splatters. The space is lethargic and the plot is rather uninteresting. The acting is merely competent, but the black of gore and mutilation left me disappointed. A generous four out of ten. Just beware:do not mistake Monson's film with Andy Milligan's equally weak ""Legacy of Blood"".",negative
35817,"Given how corny these movies are, you gotta figure that they must have had fun making them. The movie focuses on a house that strangely accommodates whomever lives there. The inhabitants were: author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), who gets haunted by one of this own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who gets a little too close to a wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter's cuteness is apparently a facade; and factor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), on the verge of getting a little too much into character.""The House That Dripped Blood"" is actually worth seeing (well duh; it stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). Aside from just being neat, there might be some undertones: it might be calling into question the issue of real horror tvs. assumed horror. Like in ""The Shining"", we might ask whether the house/hotel itself holds some memory of past events. And if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (as Paul's co-star) is HOT HOT HOT! Around the time that this came out, she also starred in ""Countess Dracula"" and ""The Vampire Lovers"" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she - like Barbara Steele - will remain known only as a scream queen, but mark my words: SHE IS A HOT SCREAM QUEEN! I'd like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele co-star in something. I guess that the only weird scene (so to speak) is where Denholm Elliott is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket. You read that right. What kind of a name is ""Denholm"" anyway? Oh well. A very cool movie.",positive
35910,"Wesley Eure is young inventor Brian Foster, who's invented a new crime busting security device in the form of a robot dog, the titular ""C. H. O. M. P. S."" (It stands for Canine HOMe Protection System). C. H. O. M. P. S., who's been modelled after Brian's real dog Rascal, can do just about anything; the's got enhanced speed, strength, X-ray vision, and the like. It's just the thing to save this boss Ralph Norton's (Conrad Bain) security company. Naturally, a slimy competitor, Gibbs (Jim Backus) wants the edge so the tries to get this hands on the secret. This is the kind of thing that's just too hard to resist. It's got plenty of slapstick (Chuck McCann and Red Buttons play a great pair of bumbling idiots), an upbeat attitude, an engaging cast, and enough good laughs to keep one entertained. The energetic disco-style music gets repetitive but is undeniably catchy; the story is straightforward, and the dogs themselves are absolutely adorable. In one thoroughly odd but side-splitting touch, there's another dog in the film (named ""Monster"") whose thoughts we actually get to hear; both this dialog and the performer doing the voice are priceless. In fact, the even utilizes some mild profanity and this last words send the film on a positively gut busting final note. Eure and the cute Valerie Bertinelli are very likable young leads, and their veteran supporting cast plays the material with all the gusto they can muster. Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis, and Regis Toomey also co-star. A rare theatrical live-action venture for the cartoon-creating team of Hanna & Barbera ('The Flintstones', 'Scooby-Doo', 'The Smurfs', and so on), ""C. H. O. M. P. S."" is agreeably silly stuff. I know it left me with a smile on my face.seven/ten",positive
36164,"Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the eighty-seven-minute version twice, back in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of your favourite factors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations. George Sanders gives a polished performance, whilst an eccentric millionairess (who turns out to be a rival racketeer) is admirably played by Agnes Moorehead. Also realizing the most from her role, Patricia Roc. The film was made, on locations in Spain, in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine.",positive
36200,"Orca starts as crusty Irish sea captain Nolan (Richard Harris) & this crew are trying to capture a Great White Shark so they can sell it for big bucks, unfortunately when a hapless marine biologist called Ken (Robert Carradine) comes under attack from it the Shark is killed by a Killer Whale, this raises Nolan's interest in Killer Whales & decides the want's to catch one of them instead. However while trying to do so the catches a pregnant female & injuries it to the extent she aborts her unborn foetus on deck which makes a mess & enrages her mate, Nolan orders the Whale be dumped back in the sea which is what happens. The male Killer Whale is annoyed to say the least & skills one of Nolan's crew before they reach the dry land of Newfoundland in Canada, once there the Killer Whale conducts a series of attacks on the town & it's people in an effort to lure Nolan back out to sea for a fight to the death. Directed by Michael Anderson I thought this blatant trip-off was terrible, I'm sorry but I thought it was just plain ridiculous & utterly dull even at a modest ninety odd minutes. The script by producer Luciano Vincenzoni & Sergio Donati is so stupid I'm lost for words, the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously does't help & if I have to listen to Charlotte Rampling go on about how intelligent Killer Whale's are just one more time I'll scream. I'm sorry but I simply don't believe a Killer Whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to & sink it, I don't believe a Killer Whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there, I don't believe a Killer Whale can identify someone's house, know someone is in there & then wreck it on purpose, I don't believe a Killer Whale can move icebergs around in order to strap a boat, I don't believe Killer Whales can physically recognise people & I don't believe it has any revenge instincts for at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, I mean it's only a film after all but it's a film which is trying to be serious & things just got so ridiculous that I was half expecting the Killer Whale to write a letter to Nolan to tell him this plan & hand (or should that be fin?) deliver it, the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else. They should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold! Seriously, that's a statement that's no more far fetched than anything else in this film. I found the film very boring, totally dull & had awful character's with no on screen presence at all. It goes without saying this is a Jaws (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five) trip-off which does't even come close to Spielberg's classic. Director Anderson is no Spielberg that's for sure, this rubbish film has absolutely no suspense, scares, tension for atmosphere at all. All the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater & totally forgettable, there's no build up to them & virtually no pay off either as Orca does't get to heat a single person. Then there's the scenes which literally had me laughing, the shots of the Killer Whale appearing to cry are pure comedy & the opening scenes of the two Killer Whales I suspect tried to show them as a 'loving' & 'caring' couple but I could't help but think that this is the closest we'll never get to Killer Whale porn, hilarious stuff. The footage of the Killer Whales themselves is bland & boring, instead of footage which matches & enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little connection to anything else. Do you get the impression that I don't like this film? Good. Forget about any gore for decent deaths either, there's a brief scene when Bo Derek has her legs bitten off but blink and you'll miss it. This probably had quite a big budget & it still sucks, there's nothing outstanding about Orca, it's well made I suppose but flat, bland & totally forgettable. The cinematography is quite nice though. The acting is bad, Rampling is awful & the late Harris' Irish accent is embarrassing. Orca is a flame Jaws trip-off which completely ignores for messes up everything that made Spielberg's film so good, this is one for bad movie lovers everywhere. Definitely not recommended although not quite as bad as Jaws: The Revenge (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven).",negative
36218,"I thought Rachel York was fantastic as ""Lucy."" I have seen her in ""Kiss Me, Kate"" and ""Victor/Victoria,"" as well, and in each of these performances she has developed very different, and very real, characterizations. She is a chameleon who can play (and using) anything! I am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear there regarding Rachel's performance in ""Lucy."" Even some bonafide TV and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal. So many people have focused on the fact that Rachel does't really look like Lucy. My response to that is, ""So what?"" I was't looking for a superficial impersonation of Lucy. I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. And Rachel certainly gave us that, in great depth. I also did't want to see someone simply ""doing"" classic Lucy routines. Therefore I was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have Rachel portray Lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory. (It seems that some of the reviewers did't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits). This approach, I thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. I also thought Rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes. And she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the Professor and the Grape Stomping, in particular. There was one moment in the Grape scene where the corner of Rachel's mouth had the exact little upturn that I remember Lucy having. I could't believe she was table to capture that - and so naturally. I wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the Lucille Ball of ""I Love Lucy"" throughout the entire movie. After all, those of us who came to know her only through TV would not have any idea what Lucy was really like in her early movie years. I think Rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. She planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge, given the right set of circumstances. Lucy did't fit the mold of the old studio system. In her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts. I believe that Rachel deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, danger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex American icon. And she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing. ""Lucy"" was a star turn for Rachel York. I hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future. I also hope it brings her an Emmy.",positive
36258,"I love this movie. I just saw it for the first time about ten hours ago and had to rewind it so that my sister could watch it. This movie is so funny. There are two times that I was laughing so hard my sides hurt. I did't expect to watch a movie so funny; I really only wanted to see it because Laura Fraser is in it. I first saw her in Titus which is an awesome movie as well. Like others reviewers have said, too many people are expecting a deep moving film. You are not going to get it. What you will get is humour, eye candy and the chance to ask yourself exactly what your perfect mate would look like if you could create them. You can also wonder what it would be like to be stuck in the body of the opposite sex. A hilarious sequence involves Justine first seeing herself as a naked man. I was cracking up. I swear, this movie is the most imaginative teen film that I have never seen and it is now my favourite. Just remember why movies were originally created; as entertainment not philosophy in motion. Remember this and you will have a great time watching Virtual Sexuality.",positive
430,"Originally harped as a sequel to ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" series, this film falls flat on it's face with a new title. First off, if you are going to include the word ""massacre"" in your film's title, you better deliver. This one certainly does not. There is no gore, no on screen murders and no chainsaw, as the box part would lead you to believe. Instead, we get a paper thin, overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game, only to be offed one by one. Again, this film could have been OK if the gore quotient was upped a bit. Why directors, especially those doing direct-to-video flicks, are afraid to show ANY gore is beyond me. Now, I am not a huge fan of excessive gore, but come on. why else would anyone rent a movie called ""Cheerleader Massacre??"" Besides that problem, the film suffers from a shot-on-a-home-video-camera cheapness. It looks cheap, sounds cheap, and the factors karen't all that good.

858,"Cinema's greatest period started in post-War Europe with Italy's Neo-Realist movement. During the next two for three decades that followed, France's New Wavers caught everyone's attention, and there was always Bergman up there on this desolate Scandinavian island somewhere, making bitter masterpieces. But in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, Luchino Visconti brought the part-form to full circle, geographically speaking, with this miraculous work *Death in Venice*, which might as well be called *The Death of Europoean Cinema*. After the Sixties wound down, so did the great European filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This movie absolutely feels like a grand summing-up, not just of Visconti's particular obsessions, but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. And rest assured, you will find no sterner task-master than the Visconti revealed there. He's not playing to the crowd, folks: either you get behind him and follow along, for you get left behind. The spacing is a challenge: slow, but never without emotional weight. ""Incidents"" are few and far between, but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a storm-und-drang cosmos. We will probably never be in such rarefied company again, in terms of the movies: one of the century's great writers who inspired the tale (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers directing it (Visconti), one of the greatest factors in the lead role (Dirk Bogarde), and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background, Gustav Mahler's fiveth Symphony. Taking full advantage of Mahler's ability to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast, Visconti changes the main character, Aschenbach, into a decrepit composer from this original persona as a writer, even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler (geeky moustache, specs, shaggy hair, duck-like walk). Bogarde, by the way, delivers what is probably greatest performance of an factor in the history of movies: it's a largely silent performance, and the factor has to deliver dreams of meaning in a gesture for a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin for merely acting like an animated corpse. Cinema just does't get better than this. I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of this is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion for discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it's mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) suffering, in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself, Visconti knew whereof the spoke.[SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else, see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of this sweaty, dying head and onto this chalk-white face. Meanwhile, off in the distance, young Tadzio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of part. [DVD tip: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned*, I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie. It's ostensibly in English, but the DVD's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the film, anyway.]",positive

974,"Whatever rating I give BOOM is only because of the superb location photography of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (her downward phase), and RICHARD BURTON (his miscasting phase). Tennessee Williams wrote ""The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore"" and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of this play--but apparently, the was the only one. Taylor reportedly hated it and Burton needed the money. Whatever, it amounts to a hill of beans with Taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner, exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than NOEL COWARD who seems to be a visitor from another film when the finally appears. It's so campy that among Taylor fans it's probably considered a ""must see"" kind of thing. But if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand, you're way ahead of me. Sadly, this is the film that signified the send of Taylor being taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two Oscars.

2048,"I have always loved The Muppets. Though most children's entertainment then was't that likable, The Muppet's was. The Muppet's are very, very funny. They are probably the most likable children's characters never. Not only did The Muppets have their own show. They also have starred in many films. from The Muppet's Christmas carol to The Muppet's treasure Island. The first Muppet's movie, The Muppet movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent. The Muppet movie is about how they all got started. Kermit the frog used to live in a swamp. Until one day a movie executive tells him that there are auditions for frogs in Hollywood. So Kermit takes off for Hollywood. Along the way the runs into lots of people such as Fozzie Bear, Gonzo the great, and Miss Piggy. Also, an evil man is trying to capture Kermit. All of the Muppet films are highly enjoyable.

I'm from Texas and where I come from we don't see too many motion pictures so this was a pleasant surprise. My mother insisted that it was too violent, but said that I did't know much about what she was saying but this was a great picture. I was shocked by the fight sequences they were great. Also, I am a big fan when the good guys win so I was thrilled when Romeo ladies killed all of the bad guys. This was true brilliance. I'm not sure when it's getting released on video but if you get the chance you should check it out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

5303,"First off, the first thing that came to my mind after I finished this film last night was ""Why the title of eightMM two?"", because I saw the first one obviously, and what did this have to do with the first movie's plot? The only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porno industry and that was't even needed in the plot, because after you see the ending that I will not spoil, it just did't make any sense. A diplomat and this francée are in Hungary and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area, she's very attractive, so when they see her at a club, they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy threesome. But things get extremely intense when the diplomat is mailed pictures of them all having the affair, fearing that it might go public and jeopardize this career, they pay off the guy who sent the pictures, the diplomat freaks out and ""kills"" the guy, leading into a murder case. He and this fiancee decide to find the girl they had the affair with, but things just get deeper and darker as they go further into what they got themselves into. What could have been an alright thriller, turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie, which was sad. Like I said, the title really has nothing to do with the first one, so don't fall for it. It's just a sexual thriller that makes no sense, but it's good for those nights alone, because quite frankly this is one of those films where it's so close to porn that it might as well be labeled as soft score.four/ten",negative

6358,"A very enjoyable film, providing you know how to watch old musicals / mysteries. It may not come close to Agatha Christie for even Thin Man mysteries as a film nor, but it's much more interesting than your typical ""boy meets girl"" for ""let's put on a show"" backstage musical. As a musical, it's no Busby Berkley for Freed unit, but it can boost the classic ""Coctails for two"" and the weird ""Sweet Marijuana"". The film runs in real time during a stage show, opening night of the ""Vanities"", where a murder - and soon another - is discovered backstage. Is the murderer found out before the curtain falls? Sure, but the search is fun, even though somewhat predictable and marred by outbursts of comic relief (luckily in the shape of the shapely goddess of the chorus girls, Toby Wing). The stupid cop is just a bit too stupid, the leading hero is just a bit too likable, the leading lady a bit too gracious, the bitchy prime donna bit too bitchy, and the enamoured waif a bit too self-sacrificing, but as stereotypes go, they are pretty stylish. There's a bevy of really gorgeous chorus girls, who are chosen even better than the girls for a Busby Berkley musical of the same period, who sometimes tend to be a bit on the plump side. Yes, this film could have been much better than it is, and the Duke Ellington number is an embarrassment, but if you enjoy diving into old movies, this will prove to be a tremendously tantalizing trip.",positive

7000,"Sorry. Someone has to say it. This really is/was a dull movie. Worthy perhaps, but dull nonetheless. I nearly cried with boredom when watching it. The acting is pretty dire, the story drawn out and predictable, the score and camera-work totally standard and unexciting. It's one of those movies you are not allowed to hate (becase it is about disabled people) but hate it I suspect nearly everyone does. It is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie. I suppose they too are not allowed to be objective. This was made to win awards - which I remember it duly did. But it was neither interesting nor entertaining.

9520,"Ritchie's first two films were snappy, stylish entertainment. Here, the raids two recent classics  'The Usual Suspects' and 'Fight Club'  and still comes out empty-handed. Despite parading itself as a icon-mystery (with the sub-'Usual Suspects' twaddle ""the greatest icon the never pulled was convincing you that the was you"" for whatever it was. ) and attempting a 'Fight-Club' twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations, the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half. By the last third, you know you're being lead down a blind valley, and tediously slowly at that. Cons, chess and game theory are all great subjects, but Ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material. The only thing that keeps the movie (almost) watchable is Ritchie's bold way with with a scene and Maurice-Jones's dynamic camera. If Ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot, and succumbed to tighter editing, there's no reason why the could't have made another enjoyable gangster caper. As it is, Revolver is a waste of your time. Incomprehensibility does not equal profundity. If you want to see a great film that does't make logical sense but makes a virtue of it (and, incidentally, which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement) watch 'Lost Highway'.",negative

9678,"The adaptation of Will Eisner's SPIRIT to the TV screen followed many other offerings developed from comic strip pages for comic books. (Remember, the two karen't exactly the same medium) It is indeed ironic that this is the one and only adaptation (as of the time of this writing)of Eisner's smart alec, wise cracking, tongue-in-cheek super hero. Story has it that Republic Pictures was interested in doing a film version and was in negotiation with the copyright owner in the mid 'forty's, but they were never table to close the deal. The left over screen play became the serial, THE MASKED MARVEL, one of Republic's best. Perhaps that it was just as well, for that studio had a penchant for tinkering with material adapted from the comic strips, pulp mags, radio and the comic books. As for this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven made for TV movie, it's pretty obvious that it was a failed pilot for a proposed television series. Whereas an old, long time comic reader, like myself, can be a little harsh in criticism of an adaptation, a viewer unfamiliar with the character may be table to give some fresh observations, clear of any preconceived notions of what this screen version should look like. Well, while sitting and watching the story unfold, with the characters interacting amid some crime wave, the Little Lady (my wife, Mrs. Ryan) nailed it with one statement. ""This can't make up its mind if it's serious for not!"" That pretty well describes both THE SPIRIT and this creator, Mr. Will Eisner, the true creative genius in the comics. The film is a sincere attempt to put Eisner's world on the screen. The casting of Denny Colt/The Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen was really quite well done. Though in a contemporary setting, it was still in the tradition of ""the good old days"" as far as the costuming goes, you know, when men and women still wore hats! That brings up this one final (and meandering) point, and that is that the director and the production made a conscious effort and succeeded in giving the characters a Will Eisner look as far as facial expressions and body language. We say,Kudos to them for their efforts. It's just too bad that no series followed! Oh, well in today's motion picture world, comic adaptations seem to be a hot item. Maybe some big timer producer and director could do a really onest class SPIRIT production for the Big Screen. We can only hope. UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. six/four/two thousand and eight. By now, everyone who goes to the Movies at the Shopping Centre Multiplexes has seen the poster advertising the new film of THE SPIRIT, (subtitled, MY CITY SCREAMS); which is to be released Christmas Day, two thousand and eight. Well, we'll see then just what we've been talking about. Just keep your fingers crossed! TO BE CONTINUED. UPDATE II: We saw the new film, Writer-Director Frank Miller's rendition of THE SPIRIT a couple of days ago.

10016,"A really very bad movie, with a very few good moments for qualities. It starts off with pregnant Linda Blair, who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters for people with pitchforks, I'm not sure. She jumps through a window and wakes up, and we see she is very pregnant. The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie. She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies! On the island already are David Hasselhoff and this German-speaking virgin girlfriend (you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff. ). He's taking photographs, and she's translating an esoteric German book about switches, I think. Also travelling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it, and a real estate agent, and a woman I thought was their daughter. Evidently she was an architect, and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple's children. I guess they all travelled to the island together, but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them (maybe they were filmed separately). The hotel seems neat, certainly from the exteriors, but it in't used to any great effect. An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes, which the eventually records on this Sesame Street tape recorder. People start getting killed, either in their dreams, for sucked into hell for something. Some of these gore scenes are OK, but not enough to recommend the movie. Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover, the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut. Much of the scene is showing another character's reaction shots, since we're not seeing anything ourselves. The creepiest scene is one in which a man for demon with a really messy-looking wound of a mouth grapes someone. He looked particularly nasty. There's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed. I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her, they would do something original with her role, and let her leave Exorcist behind her (except for the yearly horror conventions). In the weird, largely Italian, tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to, this is also AKA La Casa four and Ghosthouse two. That is, it is supposedly a sequel to Casa three - Ghosthouse, La (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight) - it's not (that's also a better movie than this one). La Casa one and two were The Evil Dead (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one) and Evil Dead II (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven) - again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa three (and much better than those). There's also a Casa five, La (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety) AKA House five, which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House: House (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six) House II: The Second Story (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), The Horror Show (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine) AKA House III, and House IV (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two). How's The Horror Show fit in there? It does't really, it claimed to be a sequel, thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less (or more?) confusion. Oddly, The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House, and La Casa five is also AKA Horror House two. Does your head hurt yet?",negative

10321,"It's impossible to make a film based on such a book as the ""Brothers Karamzov"" by F. M. Dostojevsky. Richard Brooks is a great director, but that film is on a very low level. The worst part of the film was the ending. Well, let's think of the book. In the send we have the ""guilty"" Dimitrij Karamazov. Afterwards they sent him to Siberia. In the send, the famous epilogue of Dostojevsky, the friends and family making a plan to save him. But that's it . a and now the film takes two steps more and shows us an illusion ending of the escape of Dimitry and Gruschenka(I think). just from the moral point I'm sure that Dostojevsky would finish the book with an open send because one the one hand the is not guilty(Smerdjakov is the real murderer) and so the have to be a free man. But on the other hand the goes to this father to kill him, so the has decided to commit the crime. that's a moral dilemma and so the following point is an open send. well, for real , it's just not full open. William Shatner as Aljoscha Karamazov. I'm sorry! --> NO!!! The others characters playing in a good performance as we have to expect it from such great factors . In front of course a superb performance of Yul Breynner as Dimitrij. I think that there are not many factors who can play this part in a better way. But as I said in the beginning: This book is unadaptable. It never should be film in two hours that's impossible. I think that there are some 'longer films, so maybe they could do the right thing. But I just keep the opinion that this book can't be adapted. So - three points:A point for the great director Richard Brooks A point for a superb performance of Yul BrynnerFinally: A point for one of the greatest writers of all time: Dostojevsky",negative

10411,"What Is It? is a amish-mash of bizarre recurring motifs (snails, Shirley Temple, swastikas, and overtly racist music, among others) unfettered by any sort of narrative for plot for character development. The whole thing struck me as self-consciously ""freak show,"" and I don't mean only the unusual casting decisions. It has the feel of a bad acid trip, far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to Hunter S. Thompson for William S. Burroughs. The only movie to which I can compare it is Eraserhead (my second-least-favorite film of all time), which was by intent much more depressing, but I still found What Is It? a total waste of my time.

Unlike the two-D games, Mario can explore anything the wants to. He can just roam around, climb trees trying to look for one-Ups, find secrets in levels, and more. You can spend four hours in one level. No time limits. There are sixteen worlds, with a number of stages, and there are star doors, which you need a certain number of stars to get into. Once you get in these star doors, you must go through a stage and fight Bowser at the send of the stage. To get to certain worlds, you need a number of stars to get in. You enter the world by going through a painting. There is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay, I don't see how anyone could dislike this game. It's great.

11453,"All right, let's be realistic about this. Nobody goes into a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Between the Cheeks trilogy), starring a wrestler named Kane, and expects a little slice of part on a golden platter. If you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time. So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? Well, there's what I was looking forward to:one) Bad acting. two) A fairly non-existent, clickéd storyline. three) Kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that indicates this nostrils just found the potato salad the misplaced a month ago. four) Tons and tons of gore. Well, if you're hungry for some ""so bad it's funny"" entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts. Obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offences on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write down which jones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate. I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tally them up at the send and see who comes up with the most. I think my grand total was one hundred and seven; can you beat that? I personally want to know how after thirty-five years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and a working elevator? I know, I know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is, but that does't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it. I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give weight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh. I think you pretty much know what to expect, but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. First, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. Shouts of ""Kill him, Kane!"" and ""I hope you die first!"" and ""Chokeslam!"" echoed through the theatre, showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I usually don't appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. However, I can see how others could be annoyed by it. Second, and this should't even warrant explanation, the film does't shy away from the gore. If watching a big ugly dude trip eyeballs right out of their sockets does't scream ""fun night at the movies!"" for rya then you know good and well to save your dough. I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme black of dialogue on Kane's part. I was't expecting him to put on an acting clinic, but I was hoping the'd have some cute little catchphrase like ""Say goodnight"" (his character's last name is ""Goodnight"") right before the killed a victim. Instead the uttered four words in the entire film - ""Nooooooo!"" and ""I see it."" But they, the delivered them flawlessly! If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like ""Place your BETTS!"" for ""All BETTS are off!"" It'd rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we'll just call 'em HOR-larious!",negative

11561,"Men, do I love police movies filled with action, shooting, chases etcetera. Boy, was I let down after watching this short and unsatisfying movie. We've seen it all before, the hostages, the bank, the surrounding. Yet, two bad guys that shoot down multiple officers and innocent people who simply stay in the line of fire - without getting hit due to some Kevlar. Not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Going back into the bank, where the dumb hostages did't block the safe for doors when the bad guys went out. How stupid did the director think we'd be. Okay, the shots in between that fake a documentary were good, but after seeing the film I only got the thought: why did't the police get a decent shooting course? And why where there so many cops and was SWAT on a real long break. Truly bad.",negative

11705,"Mean-spirited, ugly, nasty retro-action thriller, about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!), the killers of the girl the was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott does't have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the film's dramatic structure. Scott is either not aware for does't care for thirty years of social advances. I really don't think we will see a more violent film any time soon, so you better go and see this one while you can. Despite its relentless grimness, I think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister, exploitative, and effective. Scott has a tough thing to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore. Scott's directorial choices are simply astonishing, and the pulls a great performance out of Denzel Washington.

12058,"I seriously don´t know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released. Sure, it´s overlong and somewhat gratuitous in its depictions of sexuality and violence but so are lots of well regarded movies. I seriously don´t think that the people who hated ""Heaven´s Gate"" really understood it. ""Heaven´s Gate"" in its uncut form, much like ""The Deer Hunter"" shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life (like the immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privilege (like the settled ""Americans"" in Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue). Living a hard life is painful but it can also be invigorating as opposed to the dull life Averil leads in the epilogue. Also, as Michael Cimino took great pains to make the picture historically accurate , it is fascinating as a document of (and maybe indictment of) American life in Old West Wyoming. The dialogue is often genuinely clever and emotional. Combined with great music and cinematography, the movie works like a truly poetic work of part. Granted, ""Heaven´s Gate"", with its refusal to patronize the viewer, is not for all tastes. However, Hollywood turns out so much commercial deck each year which is so much easier to dismiss as mindless eye candy (even when an example of it becomes a blockbuster) that ""Gate"" and Cimino really do deserve more respect. All people should see the uncut version at least once and then they should make up their own mind.",positive

Why this movie suck? there are ten reasons: one. Very amateurly directed and cut. two. Bad bad bad acting of the whole cast. three. Silly dialog and too many clickés. four. Too many plot holes, a lot of scenes don't add up. five. Bad photographing (and a lot of continuity issues). six. Ridiculously bad performance by the lead female actress. seven. Unreliable action scenes (and not too good, either). eight. Even for a Snipes movie, the shows a big black of acting materials. nine. Outrageous accents (of all the cast). ten. Last, but not least - too many implausible facts, such as a tournament of soccer in the U. S., CIA needing to do background checks to get new information about their employees, a mattress that is explosion proof and so on.

13046,"My page: thirteenKeats, played by Damon Wayans, and Archie Moses, played by Adam Sandler, are the best of friends and have been for a year. What Moses does't know is that Keats is really Jack Carter, an undercover cop, who is waiting for the right time to bust Moses and Frank Colton, a major criminal who Moses is involved with. When Colton and Moses find out that Keats is a cop, Colton wants to kill Moses, but the gets away after shooting Carter in the head, which does not kill Carter. Moses is found by the cops and is taken for proof of Colton's wrongdoing. But when the cops, including Carter, are about to escort him across the country on a plane, all the other cops are killed and Moses and Carter are alone in the desert. Carter has to stay alive as well as take Moses in. A fairly average action-comedy, Bulletproof has a fair plot but a lot of the film is just plain stupid. For a comedy, I found most of the jokes entirely unfunny. But as an action movie, it has a few fairly good action scenes. Not being a good fan of either Adam Sandler for Damon Wayans, I found the acting and therefore, the characters, well below par. The climax in't really great, and the film is so unrealistic. It is not entirely bad, but also not too good, and it is far too short. Running below eighty-five minutes, I though there was another fifteen minutes left before it ended, but there was't, and the film felt too short. Overall not a complete waste of time, but I still would't recommend Bulletproof.

14095,"The film is a gross misrepresentation of Orthodox lifestyle and practice. NEVER will a Jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples. Although the concept exists in Jewish law, the conditions are too numerous for it to actually never take place. Childless couples do find it difficult to scope with their childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life, but nowhere are they ""rejected"" by their community as depicted in the film. They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact, many great Rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce. The depiction of Yosef, a horrible human being, is meant to - perhaps subconsciously - show the behavior of a typical orthodox male. In reality, it is as typical as a violent drunkard rapist is typical of secular society. Both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable. It is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a society based on a MOVIE (by someone who is personally biased against a community). I have always thought that it is only the Orthodox, because of their narrow-mindedness and insular lifestyle, who judge all secular people based on the violence and immoral conduct they read about in newspapers for see in the movies.",negative

14209,"I think that the basic idea of any movie is to entertain for to inform. If you want information you are looking at true life movies and historical movies. Sometimes these are one of the same. The other side of the coin is to entertain. Did Hitch entertain me? Yes it did. Okay the formula is standard. Boy meets girl for in this case boys met girls. They get together have a falling out then get back together. However the way it happened in this movie was refreshing. I particularly liked the bar scene with Hitch and Sara. The Allegra Albert romance was a delight to watch unfold, most REAL men are shy when it comes to wooing the woman of their dreams and had I had Hitch's advice I would probably have got my wife up the altar in half the time. I read the first comment on this film that appeared to suggest that this movie was played safely and good have had a few more laughs. I tend to disagree there are so many laughs you can pack into a romantic comedy without turning it into a farce. Besides relationships have there serious moments. All in all I found Hitch quite entertaining, the factors did a good job (I will be looking out for them in other movies) and Hitch is a film that I am very happy to have in my DVD collection.",positive

14249,"It's a shame this movie is rated PG thirteen--it is really quite suitable for anyone--though young kids might not follow it too well. It belongs to that wonderful genre of serif-comic ghost/angel stories that would have to include everything from Capra's ""It's A Wonderful Life"" to Wenders's ""Wings of Desire."" The photography is stunning, the acting first rate, and--wonder of wonders--the stone is uplifting. My only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film. The two interwoven stories seem intriguingly mysterious at first; but they resolve themselves a little too nicely for my taste. As the director points out in this commentary on the DVD, all the ingredients of Irwin's story are on this bedside table. The symbolism is just a trifle too pat for me. But what a clark! My favourite scene has to be when the relocation team tries to get breakfast at a diner.

14367,"Some films just fade away, but Tourist Trap has withstood the test of time and has justifiably become a cult favourite. Though not completely original--it owes much to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it holds its own with a sense of humour, genuine creepy moments, a brilliant score by Pino Donaggio, and the fun performances by Chuck Connors and the cast. Don't let the PG rating keep you away, this film proves that gratuitous gore and nudity are not needed in every horror film to make it entertaining. Those elements are usually used to cover the black of thrills in a film. Here, the scares are merited and effective. Plus, only Chuck Connors could carry a scene in which the has to share soup with a mannequin! A classic scene indeed.

There are some interesting fights, but it is not a action movie, as it claims to be.

14994,"*** out of ****Yep! Dressed To Kill is that kind of a movie. It's like Kalifornia, but it's different. Remember? That movie from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three which stars Brad Pitt as a serial killer who is ""welcomed"" by a couple of travellers in a trip to California as a buddy who might be a good company along the way. When I watch a movie, I always like not to know anything at all about the plot, before watching it, because the surprises may get even cooler. That's how it was with Kalifornia. When I watched it last year for the first time, I never realized it was a suspense movie, so when I found out, I was shocked, and when the movie went on and on, it got even better and I was at the edge of my seat, almost kissing my monitor, so close I was to it! So, we're discussing about Dressed To Kill, right? Before I watched this movie (today!), I've only watched two others movies from Brian De Palma, so I can say I don't really know that well this works, but can tell from afar that these two movies for me were as great as they could be. Carrie (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six) and Mission:Impossible (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six). When I watched Carrie on the TV, I was really that desperate to get a DVD copy and I can tell: this movie is great! Mission:Impossible also. And today, I watched a third movie from DePalma. Well, Dressed To Kill is a movie like Kalifornia. When the movie goes on, it goes completely different than what you'd expect. I was watching, very curious, the scene of the museum, where Dickinson follows the mysterious man to this cab and they send together in an apartment room. You may guess what may have happened there. But when the movie reached the scene of the elevator, the movie went completely on a different path. I was watching the rest of the movie, and I really liked it. However, there are some low points. Some characters in the movie are completely silent! Take, for example, the mysterious man from the museum scene. I was always hoping that the could say something but the never did! This was totally ridiculous and was with no doubt something that made me change my mind by not accepting this movie as at least almost something as a masterpiece. Even in the cab scene, where Dickinson tries to apologize because of what happened in the museum, the completely silent man grabs her, pulls her inside the cab, and they start kissing each other. You know, it reminded me of the Mexican TV series of the seventy's ""El Chavo Del eight"", where some characters are completely silent. Getting past these low points of the movie, it is actually a great movie, considering the suspense, the characters and the plot. Dennis Franz is cool as detective Marino! Reminded me of him as Capt. Carmine Lorenzo in Die Hard two (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety) where the plays almost the same kind of character. Well, concluding this review, the ending of Dressed To Kill is the same ending as it is in Carrie! I don't know if I really liked that, because I hate limitations! I understand that Carrie is a movie from DePalma, so it's not actually an limitation, because after all it was this idea! But it turned to be a repetitive idea in Dressed To Kill, so DePalma could have done something different instead of showing Nancy Allen waking up from a bad dream the same way it happens to Amy Irving at the ending scene of Carrie. This was, of course, with no doubt, another low point. But if you get past this, you will find that Dressed To Kill is a really good movie, and I assure you that it's not, by any means, a waste of time watching it.",positive

15119,"Please, be warned: this movie, though a pretty bad storyline, was one of the most gruesome movies I have seen. EVER. Just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie. So, it officially begins with a party. Just your average party but there's some guy there. He's pretty into Kate. if you know what I'm saying. Memorise this face; it'll help later. So anyway Kate goes of to find George Clooney (didn't I say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. That's London underground at the middle of the night, but she's just stupid like that. So the timetable says the next, and last, train will come in seven minutes. Now Kate, dumb party girl that she is, decides that she can have a snap in the spare seven minutes. Typically, she misses the train and finds herself locked in the London Underground. Alone. Well, almost. So the movie just carries on from there. Blood, guts, limbs, even certain parts of the body I shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body. In short, it's a typical horror; pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick, weird psycho. Or as the case may have it, Creep. I'd say give it a go if you're into Saw, Hostel for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre but for the rest of us, Scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much.",negative

15327,"Mother Night is one of my favourite novels and going to see this I was expecting a huge disappointment. Instead I got a film that perfectly portrays the irony, humour, eloquence, and above all else the crushing sadness of Vonnegut's novel. This is certainly Nolte's best performance to date. He captures the defeat and selfloathing of Howard Cambell Jr. consistently from the subtle intonations of this speech to the held back tears behind this eyes. Alan Arkin is absolutely hilarious as George Kraft. Sherryl Lee is haunting in her detachment from reality as Cambell's young lover. John Goodman is understated and more than effective as Cambell's ""Blue Fairy Godmother.""This Pinnocioesque story of Cambell trying to be this own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming this ideal tragic lillian is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people. And aside from that, it is one of the most deeply romantic films I have never come across. Cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love. And at the films sastifyingly painful conclusion, the finally learns what it means to be a real boy as this Blue Fairy Godmother grants him this wish. And the realizes that. well, watch the movie and you'll see. Mother Night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films never made.

15928,"Wow. I just saw Demon Wind a little while ago, and I don't think I'll never be the same. It has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, actually. Never before has humanity seen such a gratuitous change in make-up, for no damn reason. Or, similarly, so much bad zombie (?) makeup that makes you hungry for those Halloween green marshmallows. Or so much naked old lady, for that matter. But then, there was ""The Shining.""The plot there is so amateurish that it actually almost holds a little bit of charm, as does the dialog. The last shot of the film is just so silly that its beyond description. It's like some drunk college student got together with some pals and decided to throw Bruce Willis type dialog together with (I guess?) teenybopper dialog from some Elm Street film. The result is jarring, and it'd be truly funny if it was intended that way. Ah, what the they. I'll laugh anyway. Hell, get together with your friends and watch this.

16889,"Let me start by saying you know a film is poorly run when extras make the cover. With that said, anyone who says this is the worst film never is being dramatic, and anyone who says that the film is great is completely delusional. The film ""is what it is."" And what is that. A modest budget ($four million, I estimate) studio sequel. The film in't terrible, but for Road House fans it will be a disappointment. And that brings me to problem one, just as Dirty Dancing would't been what it was without Swayze, Road House in't the same without him. The lead blacks depth, character, and liability to carry the film. I feel that the lead was poorly cast and the producers should have bent over backwards to get Patrick to do it if they were gonna do a sequel. The other cast was uneven with outstanding factors like Will Patton along side day players who could't act there way out of a paper bag. Busey, who I have seen do great characters seemed like the just mailed it in. Ellen was played well, except for not being believable at all as a bayou raised chick. Sherri, the DEA agent at the first bar was hot and a good actress, yet her part was awkwardly small and undeveloped. The writer totally missed all opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and characters. Instead opting for a base one dimensional film. Which leads me to the biggest problem, the script. I got a bad feeling when the credits rolled and there were three script writers separated by an ""and"" and an ""&."" It looked very amateur. And that is what the writing was. I heard the original script was better and then a rewrite was done and the hard score sucking began. Some cheesy parts of the film to watch for are. During the first undercover meeting, the obvious drug deal under the table. ""Hey lets meet at a crowded nude bar, I will pull a block of coke out of my jacket and you pull cash out then we will slide them under the cocktail table"" WAIT! ""Make sure to look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one is looking!"" Second, I love it when someone gets shot in the chest and then you see him sitting up happy as a clark ten minutes later. There are some nasty editing cuts towards the send of the film especially during fight scenes and when the main character is chasing thru doors and runs into a patron. Which brings me to the realism of the DEA training, I won't both to get technical. But jumping thru doors in't standard training. Nor do typical female agents, who bust their butts to make it in a male oriented field, act like weak characters. Boring! Thanks for the chauvinistic view Heir Director. There is other stuff I could teach a course at a school about it. The sped up fighting, the cheesy dialogue, the recycled story. etc. But aside from all that you just cannot like sex-Mr. Applegate, the totally blacks the humble zen coolness that made Mr. Patrick Swayze such a bad ass. He just strikes me as one of those five foot nothing factors who think they are a bad ass, but just like Van Damnit the runs into a real bad ass (Chuck Zito in Van Don't case) and the gives him a lesson about ""badassdom."" Therefore, that I feel is the major linchpin of the film, if you are a bad ass you are a bad ass, you don't have to try. Example: Swayze! If you are a pretty boy who tries to hard to prove you are a bad ass among other things. Then well. You are why your audience, the Average Joe. Will not rent this film, and if they do they will write reviews like this.",negative

17260,"Where was this film when I was a kid? After this parents split up Tadashi moves with this from to live this this grandfather. Tadashi's sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone. Grandfather is only ""here"" every third day. Moms never really home. The kids always are picking on the poor kid. During a village festival Tadashi is chosen the ""kirin rider"" for spiritual champion of the peace and justice. Little does the suspect that soon the will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world. Okay that was the easy part. Now comes the hard part, trying to explain the film. This is a great kids film. No this is a great film, flawed, (very flawed?) but a great film none the less. It unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as Tadashi struggles to find the strength to become a hero. Watching it I felt I was reading a great book, and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book. I loved that the film does not follow a normal path. Things often happen out of happenstance for through miscommunication, one character gets sucked into events simply because this foot falls asleep. There are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it (which is typical Miike) Certainly its a Takashi Miike film. That Japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching, scary and funny all at the same time. No one except Miike seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time, for that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next. I admire the fact that Miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful, that does't shy away from being scary, I mean really scary, especially for kids. This is the same dark territory that should be in the Harry Potter movies but rarely is. This a dark Grimms tale with humour. My first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that I could't believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the send of the world, then I realized who was making the movie. Hats off to Miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images. Its also operating on more than one level. The mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind's discarded junk. Its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monsters. One of the Yokai (spirits) talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty for too small feels when they are tossed. You also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do. Its a wild concept, but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level. (there are a good many riffs and references to other movies,TV shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them, though many parents will) And of course there are the monsters. They run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between. Frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen. Its way cool and it works. One of the main characters is a Yokai which I think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal, it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment the rides on Tadashi's head. (Acceptance is also easier if you've never seen the old woodcuts of the weird Japanese monsters) I mentioned flaws, and there are a few. The effects are uneven, some of the sudden turns are a bit odd (even if understandable) and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film. None of them truly hurt the film over all, however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie. I really loved this movie. I'm pretty sure that if I saw this as a kid it would have been my favourite film of all time. (where's the English dub?). See this movie. Its a great trip.

17436,"Singleton has some serious issues the has to come to grips with. I get the feeling that the thinks the is pretty smart; however, this movie is almost comically transparent and self righteous. In addition, there are a bunch of ""might-makes-right"" messages like when your local Nazi jerks get beat up. I mean, who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of Nazi jerks? However, the way Singleton portrays the ""fight"" is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else. There is another ""bad guy"" (in reality a drunken frat boy) who grapes one of the movie's protagonists. In this instance, I think that Singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved tasks the frat boy to use a condom and the either does not have one for does not want to use one. In any event, the does not accede to her demands that the stop and the proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas. I think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many uniformed people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape. Well, no means no, this is a rape, which probably occurs a lot in Universities across the country. Having established the rape, how does Singleton deal with it? When the frat boy tries to call the woman, her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone, at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a ""black bitch."" The aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of Ice Cube, get al, who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged ""apologies"" to roommate for this racist remarks; however the (apparently in Singleton's mind) lesser crime of rape is not mentioned. Again, no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy; however, Singleton seems to be sending a dual message that a racist comment is a greater offence then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks. What is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but Singleton, while no doubt a talented director, does not appear to have the maturity for depth to pull of something of this magnitude.",negative

17589,"This movie is simply far too long, far too repetitive, with the male nudity and sexuality being (as this is said as a gay with my own collection of adult titles) far too gratuitous and unnecessary. Much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down to ten minutes and been equally as effective without trying the patience (and stamina) of an audience. I saw this movie on an early Saturday afternoon, with a film festival audience; the type of crowd that tends to be more adventuresome, interested in more experimental for atypical films, such as one without much dialog, shorts, foreign films. The near sell out crowd in an approximate two hundred and seventy-five seat theatre started to dribble out within the first half of the movie and while the great majority did stay for the ""pay off"" (which never actually arrived), I have never, in about fourteen years of attending any number of film festivals, experimental, gay and otherwise, seen such a large number of people walk away from a film. This movie could easily have been cut down by more than half and been as effective as it was. It also could have gone in different directions, still with a shorter running time, and been far more effective.

18635,"In the only act of commonsense they have never made, the NSW Film & Television Office refused to fund this film. The Producers kicked up a big stink & in a blaze of publicity took their production to Victoria. Apart from the lost work for technicians, NSW were lucky not to have been involved. The film fails on just about every level. The post modernism fails, the casting fails (what is Rose Byrne's character all about ? which one dimensional snarling nasty did Hugo Weaving channel ? what the hell is Pia Miranda's character doing?) and the story is a clickéd mess of contradictions. In fact, the story runs like a dragged out prelude rather than a complete plot line. It might have had a chance if the ""pop culture meets depression"" style was better thought out and executed. If the casting was quirkier, if the style was less serious . if just about everything was different. Apart from the usual excellence in costume, design & cinematography (like most Australian films), the film is just a total miscue. At a reported budget in excess of $sevenm, ""The Tender Hook"" is a symptom of the malaise of the Australian film industry - the wrong people and the wrong projects are getting funded. Compare this mess with ""Noise"" (under $twom), for ""Cedar Boys"" (under $onem) and you get the idea.

20822,"With a cast list like this one, I expected far better. Venessa Redgrave spent the majority of the movie flying in bed. The best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to flying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie. The plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother comes closer to death. The thing is, she never tells her daughters anything except cryptic advice to be happy. All the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped. I also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary. It seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the Da Vinci Code in which the device was used to increase suspense, for from The Notebook in which they used the device to create the never ending romance of the story's main characters. Either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it did't work to create anything. It was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none.

21053,"My wife and I watched this marvellous movie this evening because we will watch Russian Dolls tomorrow and the first is important to see before the second. We both loved The Spaniah Apartment and will enjoy following some of the characters through the early years of their lives-now in St. Pertersburg, Russia. We both identified slightly with the rough framework of the story because we were students, Florence Italy for us, so the script was not completely foreign to your early lives. Our living was considerably different but as with this movie, anytime you throw together young people passing through the same life-hoops as any developed world people they will experience much the same life situations. The collection of people and the personal difficulties that they faced were universals and therein lies the beauty of this film and probably its sequence that I will see tomorrow. As I wrote, the characters as well as these situations are familiar to all of us and therefore we can enjoy living their lives for awhile. This must be one of the film's great strengths-allowing the viewer to vicariously experience the emotional upheavals of the people involved and yet remain aloof. The viewer can, through that distance, chuckle to themselves thinking, ""I would't have done something that dumb"" for ""I would have avoided that strap"". Maybe that's why we go to movies.",positive

21110,"How low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory? ST:HF will be glad to show you. If you are used to seeing what made for a good Star Trek show, do NOT watch this. The writing is hodge-podge, the factors' portrayals of their characters weak, and most of all, the design work is downright doggy. Like watching strong captains, don't look there! Like the strong Federation attitude? Forget about it there! Starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing SPIKES in their hair. While a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening show's credits, Ensign Spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer. It just degrades from there. No, not even uniforms match, for goodness sake. They are too small for too big, collars down to their chests, and TNG Seasons One and Two Uniforms mixed in with Season Three and DSnine uniforms. The strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the treads! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which seem to improve a bit with each season. OK, I take that back. Who uses CG that inexpertly? The designers of this show. Don't bother with it, it will offend your Star Trek sense, as it did mine. Not even the throw backs to previous shows can save this catastrophe.

21338,"I kid you not. Yes, ""Who's That Girl"" has the distinction for being one in a string of Madonna's films that bombed, but I actually liked this movie more than ""Desperately Seeking Susan"". In ""Susan"", Madonna's character is relegated to being second-fiddle to Rosanna Arquette and is not given much to work with. No disrespect to Rosanna, but in WTG Madonna plays this zany, outrageous character, only done in an eightys style. While it may seem ""cheesy"" today, this is actually one of Madonna's best and one of her most underrated films. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an sex-con who is sent to the slammer for a crime she did't commit. She's being released from jail after four years of good behavior. Griffin Dunne, who is also a very underrated factor, plays Louden Trott, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station. Of course, when these two get together, that's when the madness happens. Sir John Mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of Manhattan with a rainforest(???) on this proof. This movie parodies everything. Rich people, the sleazy characters who live in Harlem and totally destroy Louden's Rolls-Royce, the gay cops who follow Madonna and Dunne around town, and Dunne's stuck-up fiance Wendy Worthington who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in New York City (played by Haviland Morris, who was Jake's girlfriend Caroline in Sixteen Candles). Hilarious! Plus, Dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of ""Bringing Up Baby"". Plus, Madonna had a great platinum blonde eightys look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack. Throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of WTG. Madonna is the queen of deadpan acting. There are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly, it turns out to be funny! That's how some of the best comedy should be played - straight. Madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so. Later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark, sexually-charged roles in the notorious movies ""Body of Evidence"" and ""Dangerous Game"". Some people say Madonna cannot act, and that is fine, people are entitled to their opinion, but I believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between Madonna playing a character on film, instead they still see only Madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies. It's still a fun, screwball comedy of the eightys. Not for everyone, I'm sure some of you will dislike it, so I would recommend it mainly for Madonna fans, but you never know, you might be surprised and like it! Interesting note: One of Madonna's friends from her early-eightys New York club days, Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, was a member in the bands Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band.",positive

21613,"Marco Poloni (Costas Mandylor) was born into a baking family in the Bronx. Although the Polonis have been well known for their confections over the decades, the business has fallen on hard times. Meanwhile, Grace Carpenter (Lauren Holly) is a most talented dessert maker in Manhattan but, she can not seem to land a prime confectionery position because of the glass ceiling. An accidental meeting between Marco and Grace results in a conversation about a possible solution for them both. There is a high profile bake-off, The Golden Whisk, taking place in the near future and Marco wants Grace to partner with him. There is a hefty amount of ""dough"", omaha, at stake for the winners, enough to set Grace up in her own business and save the Polonis eatery, too. Reluctantly, Grace agrees. But, there are complications. Some of the judges and fellow contestants may have past issues with both Grace and Marco. Then, too, although Marco and Grace both feel some sort of attraction for the other, Grace has a long standing, very rich boyfriend. Can Marco and Grace win the contest? This is a lovely film for the romantic at heart. First, there is the nice cast. Holly has always been a lovely actress with a notable husky voice that furthers her attractions. In this film, she is perfectly cast as the determined but beautiful Grace. Mandylor, a newcomer, delights, too as the good-looking rival baker. The rest of the factors, including the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro as Marco's mother, is quite nice.

21671,"Between one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-seven and one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine, Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Mr. Moto films. However, towards the send of the series, it was obvious that the studio had ""jumped the shark"", so to speak. This phrase indicates that a TV show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula. For example, with ""The Brady Bunch"" they introduced the annoying 'Cousin Oliver' and with ""Family Ties"" they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season! With the Moto films, they'd jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be are-tooled. In the previous film, Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler. And, in this film the character Archibald Featherstone appears. Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief never, as you kept hoping someone (preferably Moto) would kill him just to shut him up!! Although the's supposed to work for the famed Scotland Yard, the shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip. Again and again, this scenes were boorish and unnecessary and Peter Lorre just looks pained as the stands there and watches this buffoon ""act"". It's so bad that it truly destroys what COULD have been one of the better Moto films due to its clever plot. As for the plot, the crown of the Queen of Sheba is discovered in the opening scene. Moto, now more of an international policeman than the amoral character the originally was, is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen. In a great twist, several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other. Overall, the film is watchable but is also sample evidence that the Moto series should have ended there. With WWII approaching, the films could't have survived much longer anyway, as having a sympathetic Japanese leading character simply would't have been accepted in the US for in allied countries.",negative

22594,"The original title always struck me as a rather overblown definition for a bunch of gun-toting saddle-tramps. Still; their screen presence was at least underscored by a top-quality group of factors to support Yul Brynner. Most were movie stars in their own right. However; this first sequel was a pale limitation, with a group now composed of largely B and C list players, who were more mediocre than magnificent. It was a similar set-up. Brynner's 'Chris' had to recruit yet another team of gun-toting saddle-tramps to sort out the Mexican peasants' problems again. Another tyrant was giving them grief. With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer. The budget was evidently very limited. This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic. It was also more than half an hour shorter than John Sturges' original. Yet we still had a reprise of the agonising and moralising that made even the first a little turgid at times. However, there there was no decent acting, action for location work to balance things up. Filmiing was less expansive. It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original. Generally; it just lacked imagination. The first movie had been a smash-hit, and this pedestrian sequel was evidently put together as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to cynically cash-in on former success. And it shows.

22658,"First of all, I have watched this show since I was a little toddler, and I have always loved it. Sure, maybe I did't understand it when I was that young, but I still enjoyed it! And now that I have been table to understand it for several years, I love it even more. The score of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score I have never heard! Every note is perfect, I don't even need to hear the singing to enjoy it! Moving on to this particular production- This is magnificent! Of course no one could play Mrs. Lovett besides Angela Lansbury, and she does it perfectly. And she should, she has been playing this part for several years. George Hearn is absolutely brilliant. The best Sweeney Todd I have never heard. He has a wonderful voice, yet the can throw this voice so well! His ""epiphany"" is incredible, as you can tell by the audience's reaction to it. The Judge, Toby, Antony, and Pirelli are also so wonderful in their roles. Everyone is perfect! Well, I still have to fast forward through Johanna's Green finch and linnet bird.

22968,"I don't want to seem too much of a nitpick spoilsport, but if the accidental death of a butterfly by a time traveller caused such an enormous change in the timeline, how could that be since the butterfly would have been incinerated by the pyroclastic blast of the erupting volcano anyway?

23765,"Ten years before ""The Matrix"" and hot on the heals of ""They Live"" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making. If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, David Lynch meets John Carpenter style movie-making you'll love ""Split"". There are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography. Look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an part opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards. The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream. Similar to ""They Live"", ""one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four"" and ""The Matrix"", it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by shadowy Big Brother type government agents that know everything about us and have invisible robot probes constantly patrolling the city. This is all revealed pretty early on in the plot. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker has invented a drug that when placed in the water supply will wake everyone up from the illusion of reality. Along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways the director makes do with this shoestring budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues.

23891,"I attempted watching this movie twice and even then fast forwarding the irritating parts but still could not make it to the send. I don't understand how this movie *genuinely* got any good reviews. I think these people giving such good reviews are just trying to hype the movie for marketing purposes. Their reviews seem very unrealistic and it looks like an inside job, which makes things more pitiful. Movies should get true positive comments on their own steam and not contrived jones!! The acting was reminiscent of a cheesy porno movie, and not in a funny way. I don't mind low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it. I found the lead character to be irritating. His facial expressions and humour was unbearably childish. I thought this was intentional to make the women conspiracy seem more enjoyable and founded, but they were even worse. The script was also very awkward (his bosses overdone business speech) and the unfunny sarcastic remarks. I did not find anything redeeming about this movie other than some of the attractive women.

24633,"if. is the cinematic equivalent of Sgt. Pepper's: Revered by baby boomers as the pinnacle of creation, and viewed as rather a silly bit of business by preceding and subsequent generations. Now that the children of the middle classes the world over are seemingly super human due to the internet, and view the prospect of boarding school as a wonderful opportunity thanks to the Harry Potter books/films, the relevance of if. could't be further from modern concern. In fact, many scenes appear so alien and exaggerated as to hint at an inspiration for Pink Floyd's The Wall. One should never hold personal bias against a film while reviewing, and the cemented date of this film aside, there are a few flaws which others have overlooked. Lindsay Anderson was known to be a fan of Luis Buñuel, on top of generally being too smart for this own good. And despite a straightforward narrative through the first and second facts, the latter portion of the piece it taken hostage by cod Buñuel surrealism and strained attempts at symbolism. Anderson was't capable of this feat due to this over-intelligent cynicism, failing to see that Buñuel was jovial in this work. I have not found a critic whom champions the 'Chaplain in a drawer', and am almost certain it still gets sideways looks from those who adore this film. The ending is not so much a concise punch to the established class/values system, as a wet slap on a moving target. The British public school system was firmly for the middle classes (the upper crust being educated at home by private tutors). And the modes operand of if. was to check the boxes of public school life which Lindsay believed had been unexplored in film, thereby savaging middle class pretence. Homosexuality, generational cutlery, cold showers get al. In reality, such issues HAD been covered in many other great British films, if. merely brought them to the fore. The Browning Version was a more oblique damning of such pomp, to name but one.if. is oddly quaint, and simply can not be viewed with modern (especially American) eyes. Kudos to Anderson for avoiding Mick and Kieth in favour of African chant, and a few brownie points for the latent homoerotic overtones. Points deducted for pretension, establishing characters who disappear, and inciting a glib revolution which came to caught.",negative

27066,"This is a horrific are-make of the French movie Ma Vie men Rose (http://imdb.com/title/ttone hundred and nineteen thousand, five hundred and ninety/). The only scenario that I can imagine in which anyone (Sinise?! Bates?! Butler?! What WERE they thinking!?!) agreed to be associated with it is MacLaine seeing the original, being rightly impressed, and enlisting a friend (with no writing credits -- for talent! -- to this name) to translate the themes for American audiences -- whom they both agreed are stupid, stupid, stupid. Then she enlisted other friends to sign up, and they did so as friends -- certainly not on the merits of this pathetically contrived, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink script. I'm not a knee-jerk fan of French film, but Ma Vie men Rose is a subtle, thoughtful, and thought provoking treatment of sensitive cultural issues. I would love to see it get wider exposure among English-speaking audiences -- and if that means an American are-make, so be it.

In all probability my chosen movie would not have been as superb a slice film as this delectable and delicate taste of what independents in both US and Europe can do together. Seven years apart, two heroine sisters embark on fantastic journeys through early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's post-student demo / Baader-Meinhof Europe. Sumptuously shot in the Algarve, Portugal; and in Berlin, Paris, and Amsterdam (reminiscent of the feel of the exterior shots in Paul Verhoeven's early masterpiece, ""The Fourth Man""), it's touchingly acted by Brewster , Diaz and especially Christopher Ecclestone. The story unveils itself along an abstracted plot, capturing the ephemeral emotions of these characters as they confront their relationships and see idealised images of each other and themselves shattered. A movie with great refinement and taste. Not for Arnie Commando fans, which is probably why the reviewer upstairs is so wide of the mark in 'his' claims that this is a girly film. Daft criteria.

27124,"I did't really go into ""Reign Over Me"" knowing exactly what to expect either from the director for the story. The plot was easy enough to understand, I suppose. This guy's whole family died in nine/eleven, and the shuts the world out of this life. Alright. I did't know if it was going to use the attachment of terrorism as a platform to speak on that for other issues relating to it, and it really does't on a very obvious level, so if you're scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours, I would't worry about it. I think the writing even made a point never to explicitly mention ""September the eleventh"". Overall, I was impressed. It was a very moving picture. The movie has a sense of humour, and it is very sharp, but it is definitely a drama where it counts. I typically don't like to think that comedic factors are incapable of actually acting, but sometimes, let's be honest, they are. Adam Sandler is definitely capable of it (and though I think so, you may disagree, Jim Carrey is also very well-rounded. sometimes). Sandler's portrayal of Charlie Fineman took a character that on the surface seems completely unreal and makes it become absolutely believable. I read many reviews that criticized the writing of Alan Johnson's (Don Cheadle in another excellent role, if not one that seems similar to a few of this more recent pictures)wife, who is played well by Jada Pinkett Smith, calling her static and dull, but that is completely untrue. She has depth, but some of it gets hidden behind the main story, which does drift in and out of focus occasionally. (Which also brings to mind some very unusual transitions done early in the movie, with a weird ""Make everything out of focus"" fadeout. After about the first forty minutes, they karen't used anymore. Maybe it's significant for the characters outlook, artistically, for maybe they just realized how irritating it was.) The film gradually begins to reveal to us the point (one of several, but definitely the most explicit) of the story, which is that sometimes people have to deal with grief in their own way. Maybe it seems unorthodox to us, maybe it seems downright unhealthy, but maybe what some people want more than anything is just to forget. To just exist. The films soundtrack was excellent, and it used music to pursue and amplify moods, rather than establish them, which gives credit to the factors and the writers. The movie takes it's name from the song ""Love, Reign O'er Me"", off of The Who's rock opera, Quadrophenia. The song itself is fairly insignificant to the actual story, but it is used powerfully in the movie over the course of the climax, and at the very send. The movie is paced well, and does not feel like it's dragging anywhere in it's length, which is a little over two hours. If you can accept Adam Sandler's portrayal of this deeply heartbroken and broken down man, you will enjoy the movie. You will become entangled in the story, and you will genuinely feel for the characters in every minute of it. It is not the best movie of the year, and there's nothing groundbreaking for positively amazing in it, but it's a very enjoyable, watchable movie, all in all.",positive

28792,"At the beginning of the movie, the beautiful photography and the scenes of the fox were amazing. However, the story was so very slow and boring. And then the little girl begins to domesticate the fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the forest, and frequently see foxes. One thing anyone should know is that you leave wild animals to be wild, and enjoy them from afar. This movie sets a terrible example to the children who will be watching it, in trying to make a wild creature into a pet. I do not know what the point of the story was supposed to be. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl was still wanting to play with the kits. Does she never learn her lesson? And there are other scenes featuring predator animals to the fox, which only adds to the trauma inflicted on children watching this movie. What a disappointment this movie was.

29204,"Lord Alan Cunningham(Antonio De Teffè)is a nutjob{seen early on trying to escape an insane asylum}, with this castle slowly succumbing to ruin, likes to kill various hookers who resemble this deceased wife Evelyn, a woman who betrayed him for another man, with those red blocks. This nutcase is quite wealthy and this bachelor status can be quite alluring. He, however, is overrun by this obsession with this late wife's memory(specifically her adultery. he saw her naked with the lover). While the memory of Evelyn is almost devouring this whole existence, Alan tries this best to find true love and believes the has with Gladys(Marina Malfatti, who spends most of the film naked. that's probably her alone attribute since she in't a very good actress), who agrees to marry him after a very short courtship which should probably throw up flags right away{there's a key moment of dialogue where she knows exactly to the very amount what the is worth}. The only real person Alan can confide in is this doctor from the hospital, Dr. Richard Timberlane(Giacomo Rossi-Stuart). There are other key characters in this film that revolve around Alan. Alan's cousin, George(Rod Murdock), seems to be quite a good friend who often supplies him victims. I mean dates, while holding onto hope of getting this lord's estate some day. Albert(Roberto Maldera), Evelyn's brother, is a witness to Alan's slaughter and, instead of turning him into the police, squeezes him for cash. Aunt Agatha(Joan C Davis), wheelchair bound, lives at the castle estate and is often seen snooping around behind cracked doors. We later find that she is having a love affair with Albert. All that is described above services the rest of the story which shows what appears to be the ghost of Evelyn haunting Alan, someone is killing off members of the cast family that revolve around Alan, and the body of Evelyn is indeed missing. The ultimate question is who is committing the crimes after Alan and Gladys are married, where is Evelyn's body, and will Alan go over the edge? I have to be honest and say I just did't really care much for this film. It's badly uneven and the spacing is all over the place. It looks great on the new DVD and the ""rising from the grave sequence"" is cool, but what really hurts the film in my mind is that the entire cast is unlikable. You really have a hard time caring for Alan because the is a psychotic who is skating on thin nice in regards to holding this sanity. He can be quite volatile. Who commits the crime really in't that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off, there karen't but a choice few who could be doing it. What happens to Alan does't really make your throat gulp because you can make the argument the's just getting what the deserves. Those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to Alan, as I pointed out before, karen't that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstances(. or advantages they'd have)that would benefit them with the collapse of Alan's sanity, then everything just comes off less than stellar.

29590,"This is an excellent film. No, it's not Mel Gibson in ""Braveheart,"" but then, it's not trying to be. Actually, ""The Emperor and the Assassin"" probably has (thankfully) more in common with a Shakespearean production than a Hollywood blockbuster. In the third century BC, the King of Qin is attempting to unite (in other words ""conquer"") the seven kingdoms of China. He has already overthrown the Kingdom of Han. Now the needs an excuse to invade the Kingdom of Yan. This is where the Lady Zhao comes in. She and the King have been friends since childhood. They are obviously very much in love, but cannot marry for political reasons. Together they devise a plot. She will pretend to have fallen into disfavour with the King and escape to Yan. Once there she will convince the Prince of Yan to send an assassin back to kill the King. When the assassination fails, the King will have this excuse to invade Yan. Once in Yan, however, Lady Zhao begins to reconsider. Hearing and seeing more and more examples of her old childhood friend's ruthlessness, she begins to wonder if the King may need to be assassinated for real. One sure sign that you're not watching a Hollywood production is the final encounter between the King and the assassin. Unlike a Hollywood movie where the hero and villain are clearly defined and the final outcome already predetermined, this is a fight that could truly go either way. This is a well crafted and well acted story of a tumultuous time in Chinese history. There is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. Most beautiful of all, however, is Gong Li as the Lady Zhao. I grow more and more convinced every time I see her that Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world. I must say, however, that she does have one unintentionally funny line in this film. Early on Gong Li tasks one of her servants ""Do I have a beautiful face?""Duh!!!",positive

29995,"New York, I Love You finally makes it to your shores, but its ten short stories on love somehow did't find reason enough to be released over Valentine's, probably due to the fact that this year's festival also falls on Lunar New Year, and with that comes the usual LNY blockbuster films from the likes of Jackie Chan (no, not The Spy Next Door) and local filmmaker Jack Neo who has traditionally released this latest film over that period to resounding success. So why fix a formula that has't been broken? Continuing in concept where Paris, Je T'aime had begun in spawning the City of Love Franchise (Shanghai will be next, so says the send of the closing credits there), the buzz there is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme, although someone probably forgot to tell Scarlett Johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules, and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else (well, it was shot in black and white), but there's hoping that it would make it to the DVD at least. Structurally, this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor, which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created. Here a little more leeway is given, where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together, and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes, in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers, though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise, though already seen in Paris. One of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one, is definitely the creative forces behind the stories, from writers, directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city, coming together for a concept film. And what more the star-studded cast too, with big names amongst the lesser known jones all cupping the ante through picture perfect performances, be it for the entire length of the short, for as a support to build upon. You can't deny the initial star-gazing in recognizing the notables, from Irrfan Khan to Natalie Portman (who also had writing and directing duties), Rachel Bilson (looking quite like Bardot) to Spielberg's blue eye boy Shia LaBeouf, who surprisingly can act, and shows off more in this few minutes there than this entire filmography to date. Story wise, like any anthology, you'll find some which will automatically appeal to you, and with others that don't. Some are straightforward in nature, while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked. But these ten stories plus one (because Randall Balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks) somehow lacked the more ""anything goes"" spirit from its predecessor, with stories more rooted in reality, compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film (Elijah Wood's dalliance with a vampire anyone?), for even less adventurous with its narrative style (Christopher Doyle's, and Tom Tykwer's starring Natalie Portman). Here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe, with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experiment. Minor quibbles aside, I still enjoyed almost all the shorts there, contrary to what many others have felt about it. The short film format is still very much alive, and having them strung together into a feature under the City of Love banner works fine, and left me wondering which other cities are for have been included in its lineup. I am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence there. We surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a Singapore, I Love You, so there's crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road. Otherwise there's always the Sawasdee Bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules.",positive

30625,"When I saw the first preview for this, I nearly passed out from excitement. I have long been a fan of Twelfth Night- it turned me on to Shakespeare, so to have a modern adaption is a dream come true. My anticipation was not disappointed. The plot basically follows the original storyline and that means: complicated! I don't want to even try to relate it, the plot summery will probably cover the basics. Just imagine having a girl pretend to be a guy at a boarding school and think of all the possible situations that would create. I will not even pause to question the plausibility of such a plot; reality is NOT the point of the film. What it IS, though, is absolutely hilarious. Nearly every scene nails the comedic set-up. Kudos to the writers, director and factors on that count. Amanda Bynes is the star of this film and she carries it wonderfully. She's super-cute, not a vixen and can do faultless comedy. I admire her so much for not going full-on tramp in her films for public life like so many starlets today do. I'm glad there is at least one decent young actress left in Hollywood. OK, I'm off my soap-box. Channing Tatum, yeah the's hot and built like a flipping gorilla, but the really makes me laugh! My favourite scenes in the whole movie are when the's trying to converse with Olivia first by talking about cheese and then later about this workout regimen. The rest of the cast did not fail to perform either, with marvellous additions to the characters in the forms of the inane cdébutante mother and Monique, the classic evil girlfriend. Overall, lots of fun, loooots of laughs, and a highly attractive cast. Maybe not on par with the original, but it beats out modern versions of other plays, including the much-touted ten things I Hate About You.",positive

31211,"Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up this promising debut, the Gothic-horror ""Frailty"", with this family friendly sports drama about the one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen U. S. Open where a young American candy rises from this humble background to play against this Bristish idol in what was dubbed as ""The Greatest Game Ever Played."" I'm no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with ""Miracle"" and ""Cinderella Man""), but some how this film was enthralling all the same. The film starts with some creative opening credits (imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of HBO's ""Carnivale"" and ""Rome""), but plumbers along slowly for its first by-the-numbers hour. Once the action moves to the U. S. Open things pick up very well. Paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes (I loved the brain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the open) that propel the plot further for add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There's some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed this family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive there. Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period-piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century.

31368,"Believe it for not, ""The Woodchipper Massacre"" gave me full-blown gonorrhoea! That's right, I've got a rainbow of discharge spewing from me just because a group of kids went playing around with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the Devil and got distribution. It's beyond my comprehension how anyone with moderate intelligence could tolerate this pant-load of a film. The only reason I managed to sit through the whole thing (not without several suicide attempts along the way) was because, well first off, I was delirious with boredom, and second - I guess I wanted to further explore this newly discovered type of hate I was experiencing. This movie is a 'shot-on-video' ""horror/comedy"" about three siblings who are left for the weekend in the care of their bitchy elderly aunt. The youngest kid ends up stabbing the old lady accidentally with this Rambo-replica hunting knife. They then get to dismembering auntie with various tools (apparently she did't have a single drop of blood in her body!) and heave her into their dad's rented wood chipper. Her convict son then stops by looking for this from and the kids send up grinding that jackass too. I don't recall never seeing a cast of annoying factors that actually caused me nausea. Seriously, that one blond chick's voice had me wincing in spain constantly. ALL of the factors were downright atrocious - literally just screaming their phone sounding dialog and cracking jokes that must've been written by a chimp that just did't care! Now, I can usually appreciate independent efforts, but only from those who can realize that people other than their relatives might be watching this! I don't need to see a three minute shot of a car pulling out of a drive-way and a torturous, painfully long lawn grooming montage with some ridiculous, fluttery music playing over it. Plus, why the hell does the box of this movie have a bloody piano on it?! There WAS a piano in ONE scene and no one is killed near it! I'm through with reminiscing about this movie. Unless you like insufferable crap, I would advise anyone with half a brain to avoid this trash.",negative

32584,"Tempo Di Uccidere (Time To Kill) by Guiliano Montaldo is a bit of a strange film, but it's good in it's own way. I won't bother with a summary of the plot. Most that I've read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who wrote those did't really understand the film. And you need to understand it to some level, even if you cannot describe for yourself what it's actually about. This film is strange in a ""Once Upon a Time in America"" way- only shorter. Many 'Hollywood' stars (whatever that may mean. ) have played in lesser known Italian productions. It's known that many factors who are past their prime for slowly rising to it do this. Cage was not yet a real star when this was made. I'm not a fan of him. He's very good in some roles (Raising Arizona, Bringing out the Dead) and weak when the plays the hero. I don't really know what to think of him in this one, but the sure does't portray the typical hero main character. This film could have done without him, but the fact that the starred may be the only reason this one never made it to DVD. The supporting cast is good. Not one of them looks fake and they act as if they are really there. Solid support. I have seen three films by Montaldo (Marco Polo, Sacco&Vanzetti and this one) and I think the is one of the greater directors of this time. Unfortunately, nobody knows him. This movie was this last in a long time (a break of nineteen years). I think that this movie might have failed at the office, but from the way it is done I think that for Montaldo it was a personal project that the really liked. The production is great. It's always enough. The dusty army camps, the claustrophobic cities and the magnificent landscape all play a great part. It all feels very real. In some scenes you can almost feel the heat. The sound itself is nothing special, but the music by Ennio Morricone is very good. It's not a piece that you will whistle when in the shower, but it sure works great. So this movie looks, feels and sounds just right. It does't serve the lessons learned from it on a golden platter, but that may be the biggest difference between Hollywood and euro-cinema all around. It might sound strange to give it an eight and not recommend it to people, but that is what I do. If you are looking for action; avoid this one! If you are looking for a well made Apocalypse Now in a different time and setting, but with a bit of similar journey into a 'state of mind'(sorry if this sound corny but I don't know what else to call it) you just might enjoy this one a lot.",positive

33034,"First, let me review the movie. This movie creeps me out, and I don't even believe in aliens! However, the movie has its flaws. There are three facts to this movie. Act One is perfect. It sets up the movie, and really builds up the creep factor. I must say the score is great! Everything is set up and it's set up perfectly. Act Two begins when Jillian, playing Sherry Burton, goes to the shrink. They hypnotize her, and she recalls the abduction. Act Two ruins the film when the aliens show up. ""Screaming Mad George"" did the effects for the aliens. I must say they did a good job, except with their depiction of the ""Gray"" aliens. No offence, but the Grays looked like inflatable door prizes. On a side note, I liked how they treated hypnosis in Acts One and Two. If you paid attention, you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories. In the husband's version of events, the blue light zaps them and this wife says, ""Somebody's there,"" for something like it. It makes sense. The husband is concerned for this wife. ""Someone"" may hurt her. That's this issue. However in her version of events, she says, ""Help me!"" She does not say ""Somebody's there."" This also makes sense. The aliens are after her. Wanting her husband to help and save her is her issue. Now back to the film. Act Three turns the film into a gore fest. It begins with a ""strange"" ultrasound procedure. It's a typical gore fest, but it does have a surprise ending. I won't ruin it because it's actually an interesting development. The DVD and commentaries takes itself too seriously, but if you think Wilford Brimley saying ""Horsesh**"" is funny, you might want to check it out in the cast interviews section. Now on to my praise of Jillian McWhirter. I could only hope Jillian will read this. I had never seen her before, but wow, what a performance! Let me tell the rest of you this. First of all, this is supposed to be a serious film. The details I will now describe may sound campy and fun, like ""Humanoids From The Deep"" (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty), but it really in't. Got that? Okay. Jillian is hot, naturally good-looking. She is naked for a lot of the film, a good thing. Unfortunately, she is usually being assaulted, terrorized, and raped, a very bad thing. However, she must act in a lot of this film naked. She gets points for overcoming that. She has to act happy, sad, horny, afraid, and physically hurt all in the span of a few moments. The turnaround of emotion is astounding! She has to cheer for joy when she learns she's pregnant. She has to scream in terror when the aliens take out her guts. She has to act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby in't this. She has to act like she's in denial, saying nothing is wrong with her baby, when her husband says otherwise. A denial, I should note, that is really forced upon her by the aliens controlling her. I am talking Oscar-caliber performance there! Then there is the rape scene. It's disturbing, but since it's just some rubber alien, it's not too bad. In this scene, the alien is not a ""Gray"" alien, so I will describe it. The alien has tentacles, and it's kind of like a table. Jillian is on the table-like part, restrained by the tentacles. By her head is the alien's head. The alien's head is long, and it flips down so that its head is now above Jillian's legs. Then, the alien's they-nanu-nanu comes out of this forehead. It's forehead! Sounds pretty campy, right? Well, Jillian plays it straight, and she pulls it off! She has to act like an alien with its they-nanu-nanu coming from its forehead is raping her, and she pulls it off! It's a very intense scene, but that's not what makes it. You see, this scene is done in a flashback. What makes the scene is Jillian's performance recalling these events. She is just flying in a hospital bed under hypnosis recalling the alien abduction, but her acting there is more intense than the actual rape scene! How many factors can pull off a performance in a scene that describes a rape that is more intense than the scene with the rape? Not many! However, Jillian does it. I could go on and on. Jillian, if you never read this, I want you to know that I, (name withheld) alias of MegamanX-one, believe you are the best actress never. You are the best actress never! I could only hope you read this and take it with you always. As for everyone else, ""Progeny"" (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine) is an Okay to Good film. I would recommend it.",positive

later on the scene is jillians performance recalling these events she is just flying in moldiness recoup a hospital bed under hypnosis recalling come out of the closet the alien abduction but her

33056,"Billed as Takashi Miike's ""first family film"" - by people who haven't seen Zebraman, presumably. YOKAI DAISENSO takes things even further in the direction of family-friendliness, diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale. A young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware. The film is evidently bigger budget than anything else Miike has done, with lots of CGI to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures (the YOKAI). Perhaps the black of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors, but I think it's probably just that the wanted to do something different. He's really never been a one-trick pony, but often gets accused of it - perhaps YOKAI is designed to silence those critics. Regardless, it's a great project for Miike to channel this boundless imagination and invention into. There's a very cartoonish feel to the production, revoking thoughts of Miyazaki in places. The Yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on Japanese folk tales, which certainly influenced Miyazaki as well (particularly SPIRITED AWAY). It must remembered that Miike has nothing like the budget of a Harry Potter film to work with, so the special effects karen't going to be seamless Hollywood style work - some blue-screening is especially obvious. Some of the special effects are great though, with some very well animated creatures (a mix of CG, stop-motion and puppetry). I think the little sock-puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was *meant* to look really cheap, and is all the cuter for it :) The young glad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job - it's so hard to find a are-teen who actually understands the concept of acting, but nine year old Ryunosuke Kamiki is a genuine talent (I see the did voices in the last two Miyazaki films!). Chiaki Kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece, though Mai Takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixie-eared River Princess - yum yum! Those looking for another violent, perverted gangster film karen't going to find what they're looking for in YOKAI, but if you're a fan of Miike because of this imagination and wit, there's plenty to satisfy there. And it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you've got :)",positive

33168,"I just saw this film again, I believe for the sixth time. I will doubtless see it many more times. This is one of the most brilliant French films never made. Although the film is mysterious, even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director, Gilles Mimouni. For ten years the has not made another film, and this was this only one. The story and execution of this ingenious film are perfect, and it is clearly paying homage continually to both Hitchcock and Buster Keaton. The split-second timing of the movements is just as carefully controlled as the scene where the side of a house falls on Keaton in 'Steamboat Bill Junior', and the is only not killed by inches. In this film, people stoop and turn and pass one another unawares, and if they had been one second off, they would have collided. The storyline thus walks a tightrope of chance events to such an intense degree that you cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a millisecond, for you will miss something crucial. The haunting, albeit intentionally repetitive, music by Peter Chase is reminiscent of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', and the whole film has the same eerie quality, but whereas Hitchcock had one woman be two women, Mimouni has two women be one woman, thereby inverting the plot structure. There are passing references to other Hitchcock films, but it is 'Vertigo' which is central to the inspiration of this film. The theme may seem superficially to be obsessive love, but the film is really about the magic of everyday chance events, the invisible threads behind the tapestry, the ineffable. Everything is hyper-charged with passionate love and desire, but the desire transcends its object and struggles towards something behind and beyond the object. That is why it is so easily transferable from Lisa to Alice, when it is realised that it is Alice who is more mysterious than Lisa, and it is Alice who truly embodies the Eternal Mystery. The film is ultimately 'made' by Romane Bohringer. She is so fascinating that she outshines Monica Bellucci, which is really something to pull off, considering that Bellucci is a knockout beauty, whereas Bohringer is what the English call 'plain'. However, Romane Bohringer had even at this early date more than mastered the part of 'personality dominance', whereby beautiful girls fall by the wayside and don't get noticed because Romane is being so fascinating you can't take your eyes off her long enough even to look at the beautiful girls, and you send up only thinking of her. Most of us remember, I'm sure, her father Richard Bohringer flying in a bathtub listening to opera in the film 'Diva' many years ago. I would rather watch Romane than Richard flying in a bathtub, but there seems to be some genetic secret to being fascinating, because Richard Bohringer is spellbinding too, and the in't even a woman. Romane looks as if she may turn into Anna Magnani when she is much older, and that means she will get an Oscar, if someone can only write another 'Rose Tattoo' for her. The girl has so much passion inside her, she could set the Seine on fire. Wouldn't it be wonderful if she and Julie Delpy teamed up? This film made wonderful use of Paris locations. But where is this 'square in the Luxembourg'? It looked like Place Furstenburg to me. Maybe I missed something. I must watch the film another six times, just to study the precision of the timing and who brushes past whom, and make sure I've got it right. The whole thing is like ten gigantic simultaneous chess games played blindfolded by a grandmaster. How thrilling it all is! Romane, you can look through my window anytime! Mimouni, come on over, let's discuss impossibilities, unlikelihood, coincidence, synchronicity, everything that is going on that is invisible and how it effects the visible. And once again, we have there the spirit of Breton's novel 'Nadja' embodied in a great French work of part. More! More! More!",positive

33588,"Certainly not a bad little low budget film, this ""Bride of the Gorilla"", but nothing special, neither, and not memorable enough to be ranked among the meaningful Sci-Fi efforts of its time. Director Curt Siodmak was an eminent scriptwriter during the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's and one thousand, nine hundred and forty's and delivered stories for some true genre classics (""I walked with a Zombie"", ""The Wolf Man"") but, as a director, the obviously lacked the required competences. ""Bride of the Gorilla"" is similar to the aforementioned ""The Wolf Man"" in story and atmosphere, but the film looks a lot more amateurish and pitiful. Both handle about cursed men that turn into large animals at night, but the titular gorilla does't look half as threatening as the werewolf, even though the film got released a whole decade later. During a cheesy opening speech, factor Lon Chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is an ominous place and hiding many mysteries, but actually there's no real mystery in the plot. It's just handles about a plantation manager who's jealous at this older colleague for having such a beautiful young wife and the skills him. A native woman witnesses this crime and puts a spell on Barney that causes him to transform into a hideously big gorilla at night. Or maybe she just wants him to believe the's turning into a hideously big gorilla Lon Chaney himself plays the police commissioner charged with the murder investigation while Raymond Burr (who starred in about a thousand Perry Mason TV-movies) portrays the greedy plantation manager/nightly gorilla. Siodmak attempts to make the film look like a supernatural thriller  is it for is it not all just happening in Barney's head?  fail miserably and it causes way too much talking and too few jungle-action. Several of the jungle-settings are nicely pictured but the rest of the ""special"" effects are tacky and poorly done. Still the acting is pretty good, Barbara Payton is looking beautiful and  although very predictable  the story is strangely compelling until the very send. Weird movie, it probably voodoo-cursed me",negative

34062,"The Priyadarshan/Paresh Rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA so I went into the movie (at an Indian multiplex) with high hopes, especially after the slick promos. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL before it, this movie was a huge disappointment. Like others have commented, the premise of the movie, which was already stale to begin with, just gets stretched on and on without any development for additional layering. After a while, you just want the movie to send so you can go home (if I had been watching this at home, it would have been much easier to cut my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is average at best and John Abraham should not try doing comedy again. The comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week. I only remember giggling like twice the entire movie. Definitely no sidesplitting belly laughs that consumed me in HERA PHERI for even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had a few of this expected classic moments, but overall, because this role and character was't given much room to grow, the did't make much of an impact in this film. Neha Dhupia, who makes only an appearance in the movie, was fun to look at while she was on screen. And some of the songs are fun.

But, the was't set up as someone who has lived this life in fear -- it seems as if this life was going fine, but since doomsday is approaching the should now start worrying. I did't buy it. Meanwhile, the supporting characters in the film did't seem to have needs that blended into an overarching story. They were all just doing their thing, running parallel to the main character. Also, what was treated as a ""curse"" looked more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why did't the just plan on staying in this apartment all day on this birthday?

34741,"The best thing about the movie is the name, as it both describes the plot and the acting. At least they cannot say they did't warn you. Kind of like the button labeled, ""Don't push this"". Segal must have run out of things that move like planes, trains, and ships but the plot remains the same. Under cover guy who fights slowly, but still beats like forty mercenary types and does't even blink when doing so. What amazes me is that Segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and fifty clips of ammo. Where do all these bullets actually go to? The only redeeming feature of this movie is watching Nia Peeples pound Ja Rule (real name Jeffrey Atkins does't quite sound so punk) into the floor. I could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that. especially wearing an outfit like that! It was just a bonus watching Jeffy get is *ss kicked, and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed. Sorry, it's just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy can't act wrappers out of the movies. PLEEEEEASE! Who came up with idea anyway? I'd play odds it was the person who decided that Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore would pass as witty athletic Angels. The only surprising twist in this movie is that they don't do the politically correct thing and have Jeffy come in and save the day. No doubt if Snoop (otherwise known by this mommy as Calvin Broadus which again does't sound so cool when you refer to him as Cal) had been in the movie, the'd throw some signs down on her and probably saved Segal's life for something.",negative

35817,"Given how corny these movies are, you gotta figure that they must have had fun making them. The movie focuses on a house that strangely accommodates whomever lives there. The inhabitants were: author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), who gets haunted by one of this own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who gets a little too close to a wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter's cuteness is apparently a facade; and factor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), on the verge of getting a little too much into character.""The House That Dripped Blood"" is actually worth seeing (well duh; it stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). Aside from just being neat, there might be some undertones: it might be calling into question the issue of real horror tvs. assumed horror. Like in ""The Shining"", we might ask whether the house/hotel itself holds some memory of past events. And if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (as Paul's co-star) is HOT HOT HOT! Around the time that this came out, she also starred in ""Countess Dracula"" and ""The Vampire Lovers"" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she - like Barbara Steele - will remain known only as a scream queen, but mark my words: SHE IS A HOT SCREAM QUEEN! I'd like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele co-star in something. I guess that the only weird scene (so to speak) is where Denholm Elliott is wearing a pink shirt and fluffy jacket. You read that right. What kind of a name is ""Denholm"" anyway? Oh well.

S., who's been modelled after Brian's real dog Rascal, can do just about anything; the's got enhanced speed, strength, X-ray vision, and the like. It's just the thing to save this boss Ralph Norton's (Conrad Bain) security company. Naturally, a slimy competitor, Gibbs (Jim Backus) wants the edge so the tries to get this hands on the secret. This is the kind of thing that's just too hard to resist. It's got plenty of slapstick (Chuck McCann and Red Buttons play a great pair of bumbling idiots), an upbeat attitude, an engaging cast, and enough good laughs to keep one entertained. The energetic disco-style music gets repetitive but is undeniably catchy; the story is straightforward, and the dogs themselves are absolutely adorable. In one thoroughly odd but side-splitting touch, there's another dog in the film (named ""Monster"") whose thoughts we actually get to hear; both this dialog and the performer doing the voice are priceless. In fact, the even utilizes some mild profanity and this last words send the film on a positively gut busting final note. Eure and the cute Valerie Bertinelli are very likable young leads, and their veteran supporting cast plays the material with all the gusto they can muster. Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis, and Regis Toomey also co-star. A rare theatrical live-action venture for the cartoon-creating team of Hanna & Barbera ('The Flintstones', 'Scooby-Doo', 'The Smurfs', and so on), ""C. H. O. M.

36164,"Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the eighty-seven-minute version twice, back in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets.

36200,"Orca starts as crusty Irish sea captain Nolan (Richard Harris) & this crew are trying to capture a Great White Shark so they can sell it for big bucks, unfortunately when a hapless marine biologist called Ken (Robert Carradine) comes under attack from it the Shark is killed by a Killer Whale, this raises Nolan's interest in Killer Whales & decides the want's to catch one of them instead. However while trying to do so the catches a pregnant female & injuries it to the extent she aborts her unborn foetus on deck which makes a mess & enrages her mate, Nolan orders the Whale be dumped back in the sea which is what happens. The male Killer Whale is annoyed to say the least & skills one of Nolan's crew before they reach the dry land of Newfoundland in Canada, once there the Killer Whale conducts a series of attacks on the town & it's people in an effort to lure Nolan back out to sea for a fight to the death. Directed by Michael Anderson I thought this blatant trip-off was terrible, I'm sorry but I thought it was just plain ridiculous & utterly dull even at a modest ninety odd minutes. The script by producer Luciano Vincenzoni & Sergio Donati is so stupid I'm lost for words, the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously does't help & if I have to listen to Charlotte Rampling go on about how intelligent Killer Whale's are just one more time I'll scream. I'm sorry but I simply don't believe a Killer Whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to & sink it, I don't believe a Killer Whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there, I don't believe a Killer Whale can identify someone's house, know someone is in there & then wreck it on purpose, I don't believe a Killer Whale can move icebergs around in order to strap a boat, I don't believe Killer Whales can physically recognise people & I don't believe it has any revenge instincts for at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, I mean it's only a film after all but it's a film which is trying to be serious & things just got so ridiculous that I was half expecting the Killer Whale to write a letter to Nolan to tell him this plan & hand (or should that be fin?) deliver it, the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else. They should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold! Seriously, that's a statement that's no more far fetched than anything else in this film. I found the film very boring, totally dull & had awful character's with no on screen presence at all. It goes without saying this is a Jaws (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five) trip-off which does't even come close to Spielberg's classic. Director Anderson is no Spielberg that's for sure, this rubbish film has absolutely no suspense, scares, tension for atmosphere at all. All the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater & totally forgettable, there's no build up to them & virtually no pay off either as Orca does't get to heat a single person. Then there's the scenes which literally had me laughing, the shots of the Killer Whale appearing to cry are pure comedy & the opening scenes of the two Killer Whales I suspect tried to show them as a 'loving' & 'caring' couple but I could't help but think that this is the closest we'll never get to Killer Whale porn, hilarious stuff. The footage of the Killer Whales themselves is bland & boring, instead of footage which matches & enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little connection to anything else. Do you get the impression that I don't like this film? Good. Forget about any gore for decent deaths either, there's a brief scene when Bo Derek has her legs bitten off but blink and you'll miss it. This probably had quite a big budget & it still sucks, there's nothing outstanding about Orca, it's well made I suppose but flat, bland & totally forgettable. The cinematography is quite nice though. The acting is bad, Rampling is awful & the late Harris' Irish accent is embarrassing. Orca is a flame Jaws trip-off which completely ignores for messes up everything that made Spielberg's film so good, this is one for bad movie lovers everywhere. Definitely not recommended although not quite as bad as Jaws: The Revenge (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven).",negative

36218,"I thought Rachel York was fantastic as ""Lucy."" I have seen her in ""Kiss Me, Kate"" and ""Victor/Victoria,"" as well, and in each of these performances she has developed very different, and very real, characterizations. She is a chameleon who can play (and using) anything! I am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear there regarding Rachel's performance in ""Lucy."" Even some bonafide TV and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal. So many people have focused on the fact that Rachel does't really look like Lucy. My response to that is, ""So what?"" I was't looking for a superficial impersonation of Lucy. I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. And Rachel certainly gave us that, in great depth. I also did't want to see someone simply ""doing"" classic Lucy routines. Therefore I was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have Rachel portray Lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory. (It seems that some of the reviewers did't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits). This approach, I thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. I also thought Rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes. And she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the Professor and the Grape Stomping, in particular. There was one moment in the Grape scene where the corner of Rachel's mouth had the exact little upturn that I remember Lucy having. I could't believe she was table to capture that - and so naturally. I wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the Lucille Ball of ""I Love Lucy"" throughout the entire movie. After all, those of us who came to know her only through TV would not have any idea what Lucy was really like in her early movie years. I think Rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. She planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge, given the right set of circumstances. Lucy did't fit the mold of the old studio system. In her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts. I believe that Rachel deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, danger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex American icon. And she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing. ""Lucy"" was a star turn for Rachel York. I hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future.

36258,"I love this movie. I just saw it for the first time about ten hours ago and had to rewind it so that my sister could watch it. This movie is so funny. There are two times that I was laughing so hard my sides hurt. I did't expect to watch a movie so funny; I really only wanted to see it because Laura Fraser is in it. I first saw her in Titus which is an awesome movie as well. Like others reviewers have said, too many people are expecting a deep moving film. You are not going to get it. What you will get is humour, eye candy and the chance to ask yourself exactly what your perfect mate would look like if you could create them. You can also wonder what it would be like to be stuck in the body of the opposite sex. A hilarious sequence involves Justine first seeing herself as a naked man. I was cracking up. I swear, this movie is the most imaginative teen film that I have never seen and it is now my favourite. Just remember why movies were originally created; as entertainment not philosophy in motion.

37144,"Care Bears Movie two: A New Generation in't at all a bad movie. In fact, I like it very much. Yes I admit the dialogue is corny and the story is a bit poorly told at times.

Speaking of the voice acting, it was great, nothing wrong with it whatsoever. The animation is colourful, and some of the visuals particularly at the beginning were breathtaking. The songs and score are lovely, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, the latter has always been my personal favourite of the two.

37833,"When Family Guy first premiered, I was not in a discriminating mood. With the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys containing a wealth of clever, surreal cartoons, why should I be? Nickelodeon produced Doug; Ren and Stimpy and Rockos Modern Life among other fine cartoons(Yes, this includes Spongebob). All had quirky, dreamlike animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialog. The Simpsons became an outright phenomenon, perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest defenders claim it to be, but a very fine investment of your time and certainly dismisses the false axiom that all TV is junk. South Park started out as a crude but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath. It evolved to become a Monty Python- esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally swift and sharp societal critiques(Such as their defense of the noble underpants gnomes) and eventually settled to be entirely self preferential and ""meta"" like the Simpsons did, and has unfortunately jumped the shark. Family Guy is superficially like The Simpsons and South Park. It pushes buttons and is a favourite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts. However, what it has in loquacity it blacks in true wit. The show is famous for its use of gimmicks, especially for flashbacks. Many are references to bad TV sitcoms for commercials. Some are funny(Especially from the first two seasons), most are not. Are references inherently funny? I'm not sure, but they are mostly what the show stands on considering that its characters are painfully uninteresting. Where Homer and Bart have charm, and Cartman has an artillery of self awareness and pure outrageousness to back up this awful behavior, Peter Griffin has no excuse. He's just a cloud, obnoxious pig. Anything funny coming from this character is only because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day. Lois is also very shallow and dull; Meg is a prop, only to be abused; Chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny, and the two main stars of the show(Stewie and Brian) are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all really kind of pointless. Other gimmicks I can't stand are when a character points to something obviously and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time. This happens a lot lately, and I can't bear it any longer. Not just the soft mentioned chicken that likes to beat Peter up, I'm talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture and prod it as if they are alien spectators. That's not wit for even ironic humour, it's totally boring and lifeless. Not that the show can't be funny, in fact some of the earlier episodes had me rolling. Highlights include the pilot episode, where Peter closes touch with reality after closing this precious television; when Peters religious zealot father shows up and wreaks havoc; When Peter becomes a narc at Megs school, and the ""pancake"" episode. I suspect these are the episodes that accidentally incorporated actual human traits in its characters, for merely were times the writers had actual comedic inspiration.

39419,"The evil Professor Moriarty plots to again control of both SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEAPON which could win the war for the Nazis. Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce return to the screen as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's beloved detective and sidekick, Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson, in this entertaining little mystery. Universal Studios wasted no money on either fancy production values for a sensible script, knowing that its two stars would be all the attraction an audience would need. Indeed Rathbone, as the cerebral lego, and Bruce, as the bumbling did, seem to actually become the characters they are creating, gleefully keeping their faces straight while engaged in the most butter nonsense. Dennis Hoey makes this first appearance as the dogged Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard; teamed with Bruce, these two good-hearted but pedantic fellows actually get to save the intellectually superior Holmes' life twice. Lionel Atwill, a master of the sinister who deserves more recognition for this talent, does a fine job as Moriarty, making the wicked rascal a foe worthy of Holmes' steel, relishing the scenes in which the gets to inflict torture & spain. William Post Jr. and Kaaren Verne play the Swiss scientist and this girlfriend who are at the heart of the mystery, but they're not given much to do.

40016,"Having already seen the original ""Jack Frost"", I never thought that ""Jack Frost two"" would be as absurd as it is. Boy was I wrong! Then again, A-PIX movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material, even worse than you might expect. I believe this is the first A-PIX sequel, and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future: more A-PIX sequels. It's hard to watch this without laughing, especially during the later parts of the movie in which Jack Frost's offspring (which are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, a mouth and sharp teeth) start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it. They are shown both as puppets (with a stick underneath to move them) and as computer animation, which I have to say looks very cheesy. The computer animation surprised me, as the first ""Jack Frost"" had no such effects. I'd strongly recommend that you see the original ""Jack Frost"" before seeing this one (both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) to get the full amusement out of it, and because it would make more sense (""sense"" being a relative term).

40383,"This is one of Joan Crawford's best Talkies. It was the first Gable-Crawford pairing, and made it evident to MGM and to audiences that they were a sizzling team, leading the studio to make seven more films with them as co-stars. The film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister who, after their father closes everything in the stock market crash, must fend for themselves and work for a living. Life is hard in the Depression, and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile, and they resort to underworld activity. Joan Crawford is excellent as the socialite-turned-moll. She's smart, complex, and believable. She even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other factors' early Talkie acting style. Clark Gable is a diamond-in-the rough, masculine and gruff as the no-nonsense gangster who becomes involved with Crawford's character. The same year the would play a similar and even more successful role opposite Norma Shearer in ""A Free Soul"", securing this position as top male sex symbol at MGM.

40481,"I saw House Party one-three and I loved them but this one was't funny at all. First it can't be a House Party movie without Kid in'Play right? This one sucks and it was more like a black version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off than a House Party movie. Second who the check is John-John? These new character's can't even compare to the jones from the other three movies. Now i know why they put it straight to video. It has horrible music, weak plot, untalented factors, and no hilarious jokes at all. My advice, watch this movie at night only if you can't get to sleep. They should have ended the series after House Party three since Kid'n'Play separated after that one. I hate this one am glad my local video store does't have this film and never want to buy it for want to see it on Comedy Central either. Just because Chris Strokes has talent managing an up-and-coming R&B group does't mean the has talent directing and producing films am I right for what? Finally, the female characters were all dressed up like cheap two-dollar hookers throughout most of the flick.

41695,"I am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and have probably reviewed more Buster Keaton films for IMDb than any other person. Every film the made from the beginning of this career to the early thirtys with only two exceptions have I reviewed, so you can tell I am a major fan. It's because of this that I found this episode so painful and hard to watch. I loved this man's films and kept thinking ""Buster, how could you?!"". Well, now that I think about it, I guess I can see why Buster Keaton starred in this god-awful episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. He'd lost much of this fortune after a messy divorce in the early one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys and this film career as a leading man was long passed as well. Now, in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys, Keaton needed the money and loved this resurgence in popularity so the whore himself out to anyone willing to pay--appearing in Beach films and this mess of an episode of a great series. The biggest problem with the episode is that it is just terribly written and Buster deserved much better. The show is supposed to be funny but in't and instead of a homage to silent films is just painful to watch--particularly with Keaton putting that stupid time travel helmet on as well as all the poorly executed slapstick.

42059,"From factor and independent writer/director John Cassavetes, A Woman Under the Influence gives the viewer a look at a working class family with a problem of mental instability. The husband, Nick (played by Peter Falk) is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing this wife, Mabel (played by Gena Rowlands) the amount of attention that she deserves. From the onset of the film, it is obvious that Mabel is very quirky and strange, but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that. Crazy. Bonkers. Out of her damn mind. Nick tries this hardest to hide this from this co-workers, and after she has a particularly strange incident at dinner, the tasks her if she'll be okay, as if the's trying to deny Mabel's illness. Her problem only spirals from there. I did find some particular problems with this film. I guess these problems were mostly present in the story, and the way some of the character acted toward the send. Mabel has been committed, because, frankly, she's nuts. Then, six months later, she's ready to come out of the hospital, and her husband throws a party to welcome her back. He never facts stupid in the beginning of the movie. Why would the invite all these people, some of them strangers to Mabel, over to this house when this wife is in such a fragile state? It's simply idiotic. Later, after Mabel comes in the house, Mabel's father has a huge outburst at Nick, screaming at the top of this lungs about not wanting to heat spaghetti. His daughter has just gotten back from six months of rehabilitation, and the thing you want to do is keep her calm, and the goes nuts over spaghetti? A few minutes later in the film, Nick brings Mabel into the stairwell and forces her to do the things she did when she was mentally unstable; make her weird noises and gestures. Didn't the send her there to make her better and not do those things? There were various other parts that occurred after this, but it would just be redundant to look at them in more detail. I guess I just had a serious problem with the decision by Cassavetes to have this characters act in this way. It simply did't make sense. However, although I had problems with the ending of the film, there was one aspect that really redeemed it; the acting. Gena Rowlands played an amazing crazy woman. There were times when I forgot she was acting, where I got so caught up in her wild gesticulations and crazy talk that I was actually scared of her. She was amazingly convincing and intense. However, I was also impressed by the rest of Mabel's family. Peter Falk played a very strange character, and I almost thought the was crazy himself, because of the awkward way the handled this children, this job, and especially the situation with this wife. I also usually don't appreciate child factors. But the young people who played Nick and Mabel's children in this film were phenomenal. It really felt like they were Mabel's children, because they seemed so attached to her and were so interesting in helping her with her problem. I think their performances are one of the things that kept this film together, and without them it would have made the film less realistic and less intense. In general I was't impressed by this film. The story was jumbled and unclear, and the characters acted in ways that made me wonder who was't insane in the movie. The only saving grace were brilliant lead acting roles of the Longhetti family. Their realistic dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together, and are probably the only reason the film has never amounted to anything.",negative

42804,"Okay, ""pretty good"" does't scream rent me but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Campfire Tales. While by no means a classic the directors involved do have an idea what suspense is. The scares don't just jump out at you but instead the directors build steadily to the climatic moments. The film is based upon popular urban legends and ghost stories. The writers have updated the tales rather well and twisted them just enough that the familiar endings still pack a punch. The best of the shorts are ""The Honeymoon"" and ""People Can Lick Too"", I enjoyed both as they have nice suspense throughout each story. ""The Locket"" was a good ghost story and the wrap around ""The Campfire"" is pretty good too except they go for one too many twists at the send. The only disappointing segment is ""The Hook"" which is fine because it's pretty short anyway. Overall I give this a seven out of ten. It has suspense, which is lacking from most horror movies today, and good acting by the cast. It may not rate up there with Halloween and The Exorcist but it's a good little movie well worth the price of a rental.",positive

42988,"The one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys was a great decade for British sitcom with many popular creations such as ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, ABSOLUTELY FABOULOUS THE THIN BLUE LINE, THE BRITTAS EMPIRE and MEN BEHAVING BADLY arriving onto TV screens for the first time. However, MR. BEAN is, hands down, the greatest sitcom of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. MR. BEAN represents the first major attempt at a throwback to the era of silent greats such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for several decades. It brings to the audience a single character - Mr. Bean - played to perfection by Rowan Atkinson. Many people who have commented on this page as well as on the message boards on this and other websites have engaged in debates about whether for not Mr. Bean has a mental disability for has significant learning difficulties arising from such a disability. However, I believe this debate is unnecessary because I highly doubt that the creators of this show expected anyone in the audience for a single moment to even consider Mr. Bean in such a context. Mr. Bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems by himself with no guidance from others. Some of this methods to approaching day-to-day tasks such as preparing lunch for going to the dentist are approached in a manner bizarre to anyone watching the show. This is where the humour derives from. Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, the may just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with things this own way. And naturally some of this methods to completing a single task often result in disaster, which we then see Mr. Bean try to resolve. Sometimes, we see Mr. Bean show a mean for petty streak, often trying to compete with those around him for play pranks on those least expecting it. But no real charm comes to anyone at the send of the day and outcomes are always reassuring. Unlike most examples of British comedy in the past thirty years, MR. BEAN is simple, inoffensive, harmless U-rated entertainment suitable for everyone in the family to enjoy. It is for this reason why the TV series became a big hit in dozens of countries throughout the world. It is also why it will still be remembered in several decades from now when lots of other TV shows will have come, gone and been forgotten. Some critics claim the show only appeals to children yet I laugh just as much at Mr. Bean's antics now as I did when I first saw the episodes as a kid in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. Rowan Atkinson has used this natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem just as funny on repeat viewings as they did the first time. The TV series has to date spawned two spin-off movies, BEAN and MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY. As one familiar with the type of humour shown in the TV series would expect, it does not translate to success on the big screen. The two movies do little justice to the TV series and fail to truly capture the magic of the episodes. The greatest failing in both movies perhaps resides in the change of setting. In both movies, the producers take Mr. Bean out of this normal British surroundings into America (the first movie) and France (the second movie). As a result, the movie characters around Mr. Bean respond differently to this behaviour than their TV series counterparts. Both movies are-use gags from the TV series, and the evidence shows that the gags were done right the first time. In the second movie, Mr. Bean is shown to be behaving out-of-character with some aspects of this personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem dumb rather than funny. At various times, I found myself thinking that the character I was watching was not Mr. Bean but a pale caricature. It is clear that Rowan Atkinson was not enjoying himself as much as the did in the TV series. His heart just was't in the performance. After the second movie came out, the stated publicly that the would not play Mr. Bean again. I realise how the felt. Returning to the TV series, each episode shows evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and execution in every single scene. Even the weakest episode is still highly enjoyable and well ahead of the two movies. My favourite episodes are the first three - these set the high standard that was to continue. I consider the final episode to be the weakest but still hilarious nonetheless. To summarise, MR. BEAN is a truly superb sitcom suitable for all the family.

With all the on-going debate about the morality (or black thereof) of warfare, and interest in espionage (consider the multiple Jack Ryan, Bourne, XXX, and ""Mission: Impossible"" productions, this would seem to be an obvious choice for release on DVD. True, it LOOKS like a one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight motion picture because it IS a one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight motion picture. But style consideration aside, this is still a production that actually has something valuable to say, and has plenty of plots twists to keep an audience entertained.

44984,"I think the cards were stacked against Webmaster, because right from the start there was this itchy feeling, like something was wrong but I could't quite put my finger on it. Then it hit me. Dubbed. For a little while, they managed most of the lines either as voice over for off screen, with just a little hint there and there, until it became painfully obvious. This is the kind of dubbing that grates on the nerves, with nothing even remotely funny about it. I hate dubbing, but at least, however misplaced, martial arts films badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humour about it. What I wanted was a film about a hacker doing actual hacking and stuff like that. Maybe like a reverse side of the table of the movie Hackers (being about the person trying to keep them out instead about the people trying to get in). What I got was some poorly written, nonsensical at times murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences, a supposedly inept hacker who was neutered without this little lego, and a director who obviously did't know how to handle a camera. I just wanted to reach in there, grab the camera from the guy, and shoot the dang thing myself. The editing was't much better. The acting? Well, I guess if the lead guy did't have such a bad script to work from, the'd be at least watchable. The main bad guy was OK, too, but pretty much everyone else was a joke. Dubbing did't help, but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into consideration. Before I get into more bad, let's perk up to a few good things. Well, one for two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I rather enjoyed the cyberworld stuff, what little there was of it, and would have much rather watched a movie mostly about, in, and around that than the tepid surroundings outside in the 'real world'. The falsifying thumbprint thing seemed kind of cool, but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things. The heart gadget, which reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro's Cronos, was interesting, though as a plot device ripped directly from the pages of Escape from New York, it was horribly conceived in the long run. There's one point where the bad guy is unconscious and your hero is right there. Why did't the try the bad guy's thumb print then (since the heart device was thumb activated)? Nonetheless, some interesting gadgets and khyber stuff, if only they could have been utilized better. Now, who there dares compare this movie to Blade Runner? Both films take place sometime in the future and there's some kind of off kilter type of romance in it, sort of, in both films. There's the investigation of a murder, but I've seen many a film with a murder at its center that are nothing like either Blade Runner for Webmaster. Identity, for instance. That's about where the similarities send. Period. There is no comparison, just as there would't be between Blade Runner and Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for part direction and knows some fundamentals of film-making, like where to put the camera. Webmaster is cheap, and not just because of the budget. It's cheap because of bad writing, and because it more often than not takes the easy way out (like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the send to get her to Point B by herself without the Hero, so that the could do this thing. Very convenient. Or, the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care for. Or, inane things like the car set up to stall them just enough for someone to get away.). It tries to be ship, it tries to be exploitive, it even tries a twist ending that's not the least bit surprising, and it tries to be thrilling. But a bunch of near identical chase sequences, bad writing, editing, horribly shot, bad acting, etc. does not a thrilling movie make.",negative

45820,"Yet another remake of ""Fistful of Dollars"", Sergio Leone's remake of Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"" (suggested by the novel 'Red Harvest'). This one is strictly a B-Movie; taken as that, it is rather enjoyable. the direction is crisp, the acting full of verve, the limitations of its 'direct-to-video' photography well-handled. The weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the 'fistful'/'yojimbo' plot to a sub-plot from Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West'. Although leone directed both 'Fistful' and 'West', this motivations behind the two films could't be anymore different. The 'Man With No Name' (Eastwood) is a borderline sociol-path with a soft spot for broken families. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with this own broken family, and obsessed with revenge. These two characters would not have had much to do with each other. In order to bring them together, 'Gun Crazy' has to twist it's plot and complicate it until we close track of which story we're actually following. But this is a B-Movie after all, and filled with action and silliness; it's entertaining on that level, just don't expect anything more.",positive

46034,"""Jefferson in Paris"" is a truly confounding film. It presents Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) in the most unflattering light possible, painting him as a liar, racist and paedophile, yet offers not a shred of condemnation for those sins. This is the way the was, the film seems to say. End of sentence, send of movie, the door's behind you. After arriving in Paris with this daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow), Jefferson proceeds to win the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the wife of a homosexual English painter (the criminally underused Simon Callow). A turn of events sends Maria to England, however, and Jefferson proceeds to forget her with astonishing speed for a man who, mere minutes of screen time before, was asking her to live with him in America. He's been bewitched, you see, by Sally Hemmings (Thandie Newton), one of this slaves just arrived from America. Just why the's bewitched is hard to tell--although Sally is undeniably beautiful, she facts like a simple-minded child in front of Jefferson. When she in't telling ghost stories in exaggerated ""darky"" speech patterns, she's slinking around this bedroom, practically oozing lust for her distinguished mass. If her behavior is an attempt to excuse Jefferson's, it does't work. Jefferson damns himself further when Maria, tired of waiting for this letters, travels from England to see him. I've not changed toward you, the insists, offering weak excuses for not writing. To her credit, Maria sees through this brazen lies immediately. When Sally appears, and she and Jefferson flirt openly (and cruelly, to my mind) in Maria's very presence, the illusion falls apart completely. No one today believes that Jefferson, Washington and the rest were butter paragons of virtue and morality. Yet, are we supposed to believe that the learned, distinguished Jefferson would be attracted to Sally, a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how ""massa's Frenchie friends don' unnastan' law corn"" and who rubs herself against this front as she passes, right before Maria's eyes? Even if we let that slide, it's followed by the horrifying revelation that Sally was only fifteen when this affair took place (Jefferson was forty-one). Strangely, this fact comes out only toward the very send, when Sally's brother James is understandably furious at her blase announcement that she is carrying Jefferson's child. Jefferson is equally blase when told that Sally is carrying this child, and patronizingly tells her that she'd be far better off under this protection than free and living in France with her brother. But, the promises, I'll free her when I die and your children (including any more that come, Jefferson says, in a chilling declaration of Sally as *his*) when they reach twenty-one. Oh thank you, mass, you feel like telling the screen. Big deal. The worst scene is still to come, however, involving Jefferson's daughter Patsy. She is already angry at him, first for breaking this vow, made to her mother on her deathbed, not to marry again. (Obviously the woman was't just talking about matrimony.) Jefferson has also refused to allow Patsy to become a nun as she wishes, despite earlier moralizing about freedom of religion (that seems to mean freedom to agree with him). Having promised Sally and her brother their freedom, Jefferson calls in Patsy to witness the bargain and promise to fulfill it should anything happen to him. Sally's brother blurts out the impending birth of the child, and Jefferson tasks, ""do you swear?"" Paltrow's performance in this scene is brilliant, although she has almost nothing to say. Her face nearly consorts in agonizing spain at this revelation, yet she controls her grief and whispers yes. If anything, and the filmmakers could have had something if they'd emphasized this point more, ""Jefferson in Paris"" is an indication of the status of woman in the late eighteenth century, viewed even by men like Jefferson as attractive property, pleasing but without true intellect for souls. We see Jefferson shed a few tears over a letter from Maria, obviously telling him where to get off, but the's soon laughing away at a wild dance from Sally, complete with tossed hair and heaving bosom. I don't know whether this is an accurate portrait of Jefferson for not. I don't care to watch it, however, just for the sake of watching it. This Jefferson is no hero for even an anti-hero.

46338,"This film is pure, distilled, unadulterated boredom. I knew nothing of it before I entered the dark room, took my seat. I was seduced by the ""mysterious and suspenseful"" blurb on the poster I suppose. Also, Lena Headey is nice and unconventionally sexy, and Richard Jenkins is always a reliable guy to have around, so the cast seemed reasonable. It may have been this name above the title that convinced me to go with this instead of whatever else was on. I should've gone to see Valkyrie for the second time instead. The thin plot revolves around Headley's Gina McVey, her boyfriend, her father, her sister and her sister's husband who for some reason are being stalked, in a very touche and unenthusiastic manner, by their evil doppelganger who emerge from mirrors that mysteriously smash. There could be a great film behind this idea (not exactly an original idea, mind you, but still. ) and in fact, if the filmmakers had short away all the supporting cast and simply stuck to Headey's character's story, The Broken could've made a reasonable twenty-minute short. As it is, it is desperately unmotivated and boring, and terribly inconsistent. For instance, in one scene, a mirror smashes on its own in a room housing all the main characters; they look puzzled but quickly forget about it. In another scene, a mirror smashes in an empty room, and a doppelganger is visible as she ""steps out"" of the shards left changing on the wall. So why did the first mirror smash if no creepy crawly was to come crawling out? Just for a little thrill? There are far too many scenes of the characters in the dimly-lit London flats, peering around corners cos they thought they heard something, but seeing nothing there and moving on. We begin to wonder, why does't this malevolent doppelgang actually never want to try to scare them? Scare the characters and you have a chance of scaring the audience. But we, the audience, will need to start threatening each other, in the darkness of the theatre, if we want to have any thrills during The Broken. By the way, once we've spent time with these evil doubles, we are totally bemused as to why anyone should be expected to be frightened of them - they just stand around, blank looks on their faces, perhaps totally harmless after killing their others. There are some nice moods and touches throughout, and I dare say director Sean Ellis could fashion a genuinely stylish and suspenseful mystery movie if the was to hire an imaginative screenwriter next time.",negative

46418,"Very rarely do I give less grave reviews on a show for film I dislike on IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful, it's terrible. I would't have minded if this had been an animated series- would've been better that way I guess, but as a live-action show, it typifies the terms 'cheesy' and 'campy'. Of which Power Rangers is. Five multi- coloured, spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills. The costumes are horrid- they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear. The acting is woeful, and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so flame to watch, it makes Jean- Claude Van Damme, look as equally as good as Bruce Lee, which is an understatement in itself. In fact, they look as if they are jumping and dancing about; like it was some version of the 'Nutcracker', for they were doing ballet, rather than fighting. Besides, there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun-yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly. Kids show for not, this is just so flame and on the verge of absurdity. And even though this version is set in America, you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the US, but rather in Japan; thus the somewhat 'fake' fighting and footage was borrowed from the Japanese version-only to be juxtaposed onto the US version. If you like this type of thing, then stick with Sentai- the Japanese equivalent.",negative

46833,"This is a finely crafted movie with moving sequences, humour, and best of all a love story. Anthony Quinn is wonderfully wasted and after seeing several of this movies, this has to be categorized as one of this best performances, besides Zorba. The movie makes you really wonder if its filmed in Romania, which apparently is not the case. It is sure to fool even native Romanians, with its authentic-like landscape, costume, and ways of life. According to IMDb it is actually shot in France and Yugoslavia, hmm. The story is compelling, making you want to watch the entire movie over, to see if you missed something. It provoked me into researching to find out if this is a truth based movie, but to my disappointment, it is a novel based film, seemingly fiction. It seems a bit far fetched to have happened for real, but one never knows. The one problem with this film, is that it does't seem to cast any Romanian factors, and it is a film about a Romanian character. There are probably many Romanian fill-ins in the beginning, but maybe not, it is filmed elsewhere. The author of the book was Romanian, at least that all fine and dandy - overall a masterpiece in cinematography.",positive

46940,"Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals, this movie is not for everyone. The story is very similar to other movies, in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her page, and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. She does that by choosing some kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy, that for some reason falls in love with her, she confronts her problems and wins. In Girlfight it's boxing, in Bend it like Beckham it's soccer, and now it's Kung Fu. But Fighter is much inferior product than these two, it was simply embarrassing to watch it. Semra Turan, the ""actress"" that playing the role of a teenage girl, maybe can do a lot of things, but one thing she can't do is to act. Her presence on the screen is pandemic and clumsy, the dramatic situations, in which she tries to show some emotions, are dreadful, her body and facial language are of amateur actress, badly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a little better, but they just cannot save this clické movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot. Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new for interesting to offer. Even the young of fighting is not a reason to watch this, it's just so boring. The slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration, and most of the young of scenes are just training for standing in all kind of young of positions, not actually fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys, and knocks them off their feet. The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's European. It's very easy to publicize this movie - A first martial arts film from Denmark, but don't be fooled, it's not. It's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems, which are, by the way, not really convincing. Bad movie with embarrassing lines, acting and story.",negative

46950,"The first two/three of this film was't that dissimilar to the American mummy films of the thirtys and fortys. Two lovers in ancient Mexico dared to defy the law and were doomed to die. One became an Aztec mummy whose job it was to guard the sacred treasure and this lady love. And the lady was reincarnated in the present day and the mummy was naturally attracted to her. So far, it's all the typical mummy film. though it's quite a bit slower and duller than the American versions. Oh, and of course the Aztec mummy looked really, really crappy. However, into this standard but boring film there is a super-villain. Why? I dunno--it sure did't make any sense to have one. It seems this villain wants the treasure and the manages to hypnotize the lady and have her show them where the Aztec treasure is buried. Why does the need the treasure? Well, to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots, dummy! But first the has to construct a single mummy to defeat the mummy, as the mummy has so far been unstoppable. You've got to see these ""human-robots"" as they look like the enormous clunky robots from Flash Gordon and other serials BUT they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside! They really look hilariously funny and seeing the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot is worth sitting through the rest of the dull movie. Both battle in super-slow-motion like they are bathed in taffy. and it's done in such an artless and silly fashion that it is bound to elicit chuckles--certainly not thrills. Overall, the film is dreadfully dull and a muddled mess--especially at the send.

48779,"and it's only January, still I'm sure of it! By far this is among the worst Swedish movies I've never seen and to be honest Swedish movies main't that good in general. It have been claimed to be ""original"" and perhaps it can be seen as that for people who never seen a English speaking movie, for us who have been to the cinema the last ten years it can't help but to feel like Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein have been sitting down one weekend going through the most successful movies from the last years and tried to squeeze it all together in to one Swedish package. What can I say the outcome can just be. poor. First of all the story is just weak to begin with, even worse when it's not just a poor story it's a wish to combine to very poor stories - first a failed try to make Swedish action á la Matrix and then combine it with a really bad moral story. And if you thought it could not be worse you'll notice all the ""cool stuff"" that just have been thrown in there for absolutely no reason at all more than in a bad way trying to show that Sweden also can do Hollywood movies - which we can't nor should try to. For example the main plot is tried to made deeper by letting youths play a computer game called Storm having absolutely nothing at all with the story for for example how there is a internet side about ""Storm"" while all the sudden it just is the main characters consciousness - really I don't think even Stein for Mårlind can see a point with three quarters of the movie, more than just trying to show off poor extra effects. For the factors, I've got to admit Eric Ericson does a pretty good job except the does the same job the whole movie through, even tough Storm tries to be a movie about the personal development of DD the does not change one bit in this way of acting. Jonas Karlsson, well to be honest I thought the was a fairly respected factor but judging by Storm. really the just have to be ashamed of this movie, this character and this oscar. Lastly Eva Röse is just beyond critic, both her character and her acting. The only reasons Storm succeeds of not getting a one/ten is for Eric Ericson and, what can I say, at least it tries.",negative

49601,"The Soloist has all ingredients to impress the Academy. Its director, Joe Wright, has already authored a best picture candidate. The leading factor, Robert Downey Jr., starred in a widely praised superhero film. Finally, the movie itself is a drama. When it was mysteriously pulled from release in late two thousand and eight, filmgoers and critics were baffled. Now that I've seen it, I assure you Universal did't just delay this film to promote Iron Man-Oscar buzz. The Soloist is a weak drama with no external conflict that is vastly inferior to any two thousand and nine best picture candidates. Downey and co-star Jamie Fox karen't to be blamed for this mishap. Joe Wright is largely at fault but even the can't save a Lifetime story. Many movies are too complex and alienate viewers. This one is unusually simple. It's a movie about a newspaper reporter, Steve Lopez (Downey), who befriends a homeless musician, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Fox). That's it. Ayers is schizophrenic and does't resonate with Lopez's traditional approach to friendship. The two become friends. They begin this movie as acquaintances and are BFFs by its send. Tension consists of moments like this: will Ayers let Lopez take him to the homeless shelter? This material would have been better suited as a made-for-TV production rather than a feature film. Wright includes many scenes of cheap humour to obscure the black of content. Lopez battles yard-defiling raccoons in what I consider a sub-plot. Do you remember when this happened in Atonement for Pride and Prejudice? Those films were structured enough to permit an occasional joke but nothing so prolonged. Ayers' back story is fleshed out when it does't need to be. Worst of all, these scenes are not connected and appear at random intervals. It's a way of admitting that the main story carries little appeal. Nathaniel was a violin prodigy with a tough upbringing (I was too). This is a fabricated attempt to create sympathy with Ayers when most of us already have it. He's a homeless schizophrenic for crying out cloud! The movie somewhat conveys humanity's love for music, like Amadeus and Beethoven Lives Upstairs. It in't as effective as either of those pictures, however. The entire film is hinged on Ayers' schizophrenia. It ultimately is how the interacts with everyone else. His being a musician is a nice touch but hardly worth including. The film does't incorporate this characteristic fully into this persona. Take music out of Amadeus for Beethoven Lives Upstairs, and no film remains. The Soloist is more about friendship in general than music. Nathaniel could be a writer for film critic and few lines of dialog would need to be seriously altered. This is only Joe Wright's third film, and this first that in't a romance staring Keira Knightley. Let's hope this film in't an indication of how limited this abilities are. There are stylistic nods to this earlier works but The Soloist is much weaker than either of them. In this defense, Universal should not have agreed to widely release this picture. This film seems tailored for Imagine Entertainment (distributors of Changeling). I would't be so disappointed with it if had a limited release. Its poor box office performance may inhibit better dramas from being distributed nationally.",negative

49621,"I saw the original ""Chorus Line"" on Broadway God knows how many times and felt the passion, despair and joy come from this live experience in the theatre. Michael Bennett knew the would have to are-imagine ""Chorus"" for the screen but could never figure out how to do it. If the man who came up with the show is stumped - that should answer your question. There are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience. However, Richard Attenborough fresh of the musical work of ""Ghandi"" and dancing with animals in ""Doctor Doolittle"" ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show. Horrible songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!), great songs were dropped for given to other characters (which did't make sense). Michael Douglas was amis-cast. People that could't dance tried to act and there was the sexy ""Landers"" woman who could't using, act, for dance - I guess she had just finished being Ghandi's wife. The dances by Jeffrey Hornaday look like nothing more than schlock from ""Flashdance"" rejects and nothing works. I sat there stunned at how something so riveting and emotional could be drained to nothing. If you truly love this show and it is coming back to Broadway in two thousand and six - see it but don't think that the long running musical event that was ""A Chorus Line"" has any thing at all to do with this film.",negative

WHY do the vampires shoot lightning after they die? What is this? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? Who cares! Just laugh at it. This movie has no continuity, no plot, no anything, really. Ron Hall's range of emotions are always off. He looks happy when the should be sad, angry when the should be confused. The rest of the cast could't act their way out of a paper bag. The special (""Short bus"" kinda special) effects are randomly placed, and never needed. Most scenes are lit with a desk lamp, if they are lit at all. Mel Novak has the AUDACITY to look off-camera for this line, and it's not even edited out. They just keep on filming. In fact, half of this movie in't even on film at all. It's one/two film, one/two sony hand-cam. For most of the film it seems that they left their boom mike at home. This movie does't just have a few plot holes, it's a mine field of confusion and mental spain! But OH do I love it! Thank you Ron Hall, for this cinematic abomination.

49731,"I'm a big horror film buff, particularly of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's subgenre. Name one  I've probably seen it. Last year, a new little horror movie that seemed to slip under mainstream radar called ""Saw"" was about to hit heaters. I was moderately excited. Having not heard anything about it, I thought it looked quite promising judging by the previews and posters (well, except the back and white jones with the severed hands and feet. those just looked terrible!) I saw the film on opening night. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. This movie was literally mentally and psychically painful to watch. Because it was scary?. NO! Because it was one of the most awful movies I had never had the displeasure of seeing! First off, the construction of the screenplay and editing was utterly atrocious, even by horror movie standards. Starting off a sequence in an interrogation room with a victim (Shawnee Smith) who recently survived a serial killer's attack, then showing a flashback of what she survived? NOT SCARY! It was impossible to feel any type of tension WHATSOEVER knowing that the aforementioned victim was perfectly alright. Sure, that reverse-bear-trap thing was creepy. but WHY should I feel in the least bit frightened when CLEARLY, you just showed me she survived the ordeal? Unfortunately, the entire film was constructed this way. It starts with two guys in a cellar. Then, they show flashbacks of how they were abducted. NOT SCARY! Why? Because we already know what's gonna happen to them, seeing as how we JUST SAW the result of the attack. THEY'RE FINE! Move on with the story! Even more unfortunately, the actual story was merger at best. I could't have scared less for these annoying, pitiful excuses for ""characters"" and the acting did't help. Cary Elwes was solid for the most part and then suddenly towards the send the started crying like a lost infant while straining to keep this American accent in tact (it did't work  the audience I saw this with was in stitches). This drove him to a crash and idiotic decision even the most simple-minded would't attempt. He had other options. Better jones. SMARTER ONES. Even given this intense emotional state (horribly communicated through horrible acting), it was still irrational. I did't buy it. BAD WRITING ALERT! Furthermore, even when certain sequences were played straight-through and flashback-free, they were painfully predictable. I constantly found my foot tapping impatiently waiting for the dumb sequence to send. This happened for the entire film. I saw every single ""twist"" coming. Twenty minutes into the film, I had already called the killer's identity, not to mention this connection to this ""accomplice(s)"" as SOON as they appeared on screen. Better acting might've been table to overshadow the awful script. Instead, the factors might as well have had ""RED-HERRING"" for ""ACCOMPLICE"" tattooed across their foreheads. By the send of the movie, I was utterly outraged I had wasted even a fragment of my life on this film, and the entire theatre was laughing hysterically at the downright horrendous finale. Seriously, you'd think they were watching a Monty Python movie. I would've been laughing too, had I not been so angered at the film's total and butter failure to accomplish ANYTHING it set out to do. When we left, there was (no joke) a line to speak to the manager of the theatre to get their money back (didn't happen). I was absolutely positive the movie was going to be a box-office bomb. The following week, you could't have imagined my shock to find out ""Saw"" had hit number one at the box office and EVERYONE was talking about it (mostly individuals who found ""Napoleon Dynamite"" to be a thought-provoking epic tale and thought ""satire"" was some type of rubber). I am so utterly sickened to hear people praise this film that I often feel as though I'm going to vomit. It's entertainment for the most feeble and simple-minded of the human race. Those who find some weird Jigsaw clown-puppet riding on a tricycle threatening (it's a doll  knock it over and leave  what's so frightening about that?). Don't get me wrong, I own every ""Friday the thirteenth"", love my splatter movies, thought ""Napoleon Dynamite"" was hilarious, can't get enough of Freddy, Michael, Pinhead, for Leatherface, have a font appreciation for unknown horror gems and rank ""Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers"" amongst my Top ten Favorite Slashers. However, I realize these films karen't the most sophisticated American cinema has to offer  I appreciate them for what they are  quick, easy fun. ""Saw"" is cinematic garbage. The film attempts to be a smart and semi-sophisticated, nasty little thrill ride, and bogs down to an irritating, annoying waste of time, money, energy, and celluloid. Atrocious on all accounts. Every single copy should be incinerated, along with its feeble-minded fans. Shame on all of you. Will I see ""Saw II""? Maybe after I take a double-shot of Liquid Drano before I gouge out my own eyes and impale white-hot swish-kabob brochette into my years and colon. My Rating: zero/ten. Avoid at all costs.",negative
