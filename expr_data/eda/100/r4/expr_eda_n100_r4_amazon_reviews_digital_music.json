Tight production by Studio Ton and Mike Mosley presents the special sound of Sic-wit-it - the record label Eforty and B-Legit founded. A banging' album with smooth and funky music with some of the Bay Area's greatest wrappers. True lyrics about street life over some dope music.

Rigg","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"This album was released stateside in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, but I first heard the Backstreet Boys' \"We've Got it Going On\" during a trip to London in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. While America was still in the waning years of grunge, London had taken the lead in jumping on the boy band bandwagon with Take That, so they were the first to embrace the Backstreet Boys. When the Boys finally brokethrough in the states, I was thrilled. As a Teen Pop fan from the seventy's and eighty's, I was glad to see it return. On this album, the Boys' youthful exuberance shines through. The songs are full of energy and are still fun to listen to all these years later. As with most artists, their time in the spotlight has apparently come and gone. But who knows, these boys had talent and we may hear more from them yet. Whoever thought Jordan Knight for Joey McIntire from New Kids on the Block would make solo comebacks. A word of caution, this is an enhanced CD, which can sometimes be a spain if you want to listen to the CD on your computer without disturbing other programs you have running. The problem with these enhanced CD's is that the information becomes out of date and useless. My advice is when you first put it in your CD drive and the Boys come up on your screen, click Exit so you can just play the music without all the other unnecessary programs running.","overall":5,"summary":"The Boys at their funkiest best","unixReviewTime":1111536000,"reviewTime":"03 23, 2005"}

Immediately opening up embracing this position in the army with a salute on \"Born two Be A Soldier\" featuring Master P, Silkk The Shocker, Fiend & Mac as \"Ain't No Limit\" featuring Silkk The Shocker. Continuing to release this danger of this sister's death on \"Murder two\" as the confronts her killer as \"Shine\" mourns her death with memories. The production was unlike any other No Limit release going outside Beats By The Pound seeking the talents of Rick Rock for \"Murder two\". Paving the path to this career and time span on \"thirteen Years\" goes into detail. The title track contains a looped sample to emphasise the rapid, tongue twisted hook highlighted the production by another outsider DJ Darryl. Being a product of the ghetto, \"Ghetto Child\" featuring Master P & Silkk The Shocker is humbling experience of overcoming obstacles destined for those growing in that environment. Mystikal takes excerpts and punchlines from some of this other songs to create \"Did I Do It\" taking credit as the author. \"We Got The Clout\" featuring Mia X is a great duet speaking on their status without a hook and for chorus still is one of the most memorable itunes of Unpredictable. Explaining this addiction of smoking on \"Still Smokin'\" where smokers can relate to the events over the production by The Legendary Traxster that should have been extended to complete the session. The hook alone expresses the feeling and contents of the hook on \"U Can't Handle This\" because of this lyrical capabilities also evident on \"The Man Right Chea\". Showing this sexual prowess on \"D*ck On The Track\" goes into a musical composition being conducted for comparison. Confessions of infidelity on \"Sleepin' With Me\" featuring O'Dell confronts this actions of being in a relationship. Stepping up to classic New Orleans bounce style, \"It Years\" gives the album more depth as a near dance track incorporating mixing and scratching. With a smooth swing and layered guitars complementing the slow groove of \"Gangstas\" featuring Snoop Dogg & Master P completes the albums effectiveness and overall feel. Mystikal's Unpredictable was just as titled as this emphasis for lyrical delivery was deemed necessary to aggressively get the point across.","overall":4,"summary":"Anything Else Is Unacceptable","unixReviewTime":1206144000,"reviewTime":"03 22, 2008"}

Record companies promising superior sound have come up short more than half the time when it comes to reissuing classics. Lucky for us, that's hardly the case with Rhino's treatment of Elvis Costello's back catalog.

This version has been very well remastered for a brilliant sound and the mini-lp sleeve packaging is a work of part in itself with both the Japanese and English lyrics included as an insert. Bearing little resemblance to this early punk days, the tracks there are a lot longer and take more time to develop. I don't know where Amazon got its track information from but believe me, this album only has the first fifteen tracks that they listed. However, this is still overall a brilliant album with every track worthy of being on a best of compilation album of Elvis Costello. My favourite track which was also a small hit single is \"You Little Fool\" but others like \"Town Cryer\" and \"Man Out of Time\" are also standout tracks. If you are looking for the best of Elvis' later and earlier works, look no further than this and \"Next Year's Model\". Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"My Favourite Costello Album!

They will convey what this album is about in richer detail than my weak writing skills. This album has a quality that sends chills every time I listen and soak in the way Miles' trumpet is buoyed by Cannonball's rich stone from this alto. I also think that the incredible rhythm section comprised of Hank Jones on piano, Sam Jones on bass and Art Blakey on drums is perfect for this session. I am especially impressed with the way Blakey - also known as the volcano - laid back and played with delicacy and beauty. I love this album on a number of levels ranging from the sensual rendition of Autumn Leaves to the final track - Bangoon - that is up tempo and swinging. That track was not on the original album, but it's inclusion for this reissue is a nice treat. For my fellow jazz historians and hard score fans this album is also interesting because at the time this was recorded on March nine, one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight, Adderley was a member of Miles' quintet, but on this album is the session leader with Miles as a sideman. And it works because you can clearly discern the difference in the way Cannonball approaches songs from the way Miles would. Cole Porter's Love for Sale is a good example. A few final notes for the historian: this was recorded in Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on the date noted above, and was released later in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight as Blue Note one thousand, five hundred and ninety-five.","overall":5,"summary":"Sheer Beauty","unixReviewTime":1368403200,"reviewTime":"05 13, 2013"}

Everything about this album is nice. There in't one bad\/alright track on there they are all real smooth and work extremely well together. The mood of the album is very dark, as is most Wu albums, and all the features are amazing and fit their part, but it's all Wu so of course they gonna be nice.

In the same way these fearless innovators tried to deconstruct painting into primary elements and start from scratch, Monk seems to be breaking the musical language into fragments and pasting it back together. But painters work alone. Monk had to make this revolutionary vision comprehensible to fellow players, accounting for the twelve takes required to get the title composition on tape and the observation by one sound engineer that, \"After working with Monk I'll never be afraid of anything never again.\"A jazz milestone, Brilliant Corners is celebrating its fiftyth birthday this year. The album was given to me as a gift a few years after being released and even after repeated playing I truly had no idea of what the check I was hearing. What's so strange is that it still sounds \"modern\" and abstract today, off-kilter, cattywhumpus, and a bit otherworldly. The twentybit are-mastering is glorious and offers a glistening precision my old Riverside LP never had, that much is certain. Not only has Sonny Rollins never sounded better, the must be given special consideration for walking into Monk's world and making sense of it. Known for angularity and disjointed construction, Monk can also be one of the most emotionally compelling of composers and players. This is abundantly in evidence on Pannonica, an original composition, and on the standard, I Surrender, Dear, which is unrecognizable by the time Monk is through with it. (Solo Monk interpreting standards is three degrees away from heaven, there are many examples scattered throughout this body of work.)Bemsha Swing returns the stone home to the \"expect-the-unexpected\" style we met in the introductory bars. Max Roach, who performs the Herculean chore of providing a rhythmic bed for Monk's creations throughout, really shines there, demonstrating that the too is comfortable throwing in accents precisely where you would never expect them and right where they satisfy most. Because this CD is such a lasting jewel in the history of jazz, purchasing this technically superior version is recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Shines Like A Diamond","unixReviewTime":1149897600,"reviewTime":"06 10, 2006"}

This is Outkast at their earliest stage. Andre and Big Boi were only eighteen when the majority of this album was penned and produced. Their first hit \"player's ball\" was released in late ninety-three' and became an instant classic. They stopped the RnB and ship shop charts and became the biggest wrap group to come out of the south. I gotta admit Outkast seemed much more laid back and hungry on this album. They were't quite as introspective as they would be on their later albums, but you still get a clear look into great minds of Andre and Big Boi. This a great album to blast during the summertime, when your down south, for really anytime. Theres so many memorable tracks on this album starting from the intro \"smoke a dime\". The production is on point like all other 'kast albums. Stand out tracks include spam, player's ball, funky ride, claimin' true, git up git out, crumblin' herb, and hoodie hoo.

One standout track is \"Ain't Hard two Find\" because the beat is strong, nice smooth G-Funk, and it hosts a variety of Bay Area wrappers (Oakland's Richie Rich, Vallejo's D-Shot, E-forty, and B-Legit, and Sacramento's C-Bo).

This one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six album mixes a lot of emotions and beats and puts it all on two very well made CDs. The onest CD of the set features songs such as \"How Do You Want It\", which features the R&B group, Jodeci. \"How Do You Want It\" has the coolness of Tupac along with the smoothness of Jodeci. \"two of Amerikaz Most Wanted\" also features the well-known artist, Snoop Doggy Dogg. The \"doggy style\" of Snoop combines with Tupac's style to give you \"two Of Amerikaz Most Wanted\". \"Only God Can Judge Me\" and \"I Ain't Mad at Cha\" are two of Tupac's more emotional songs on the album. Songs like this are one of the reasons that twoPac is one of my favourite wrappers. He not only gives you beats to dance to, but also songs that make you think. These songs make you look inside yourself as well as him and get to know who twoPac is a lot better then you never thought you did.\"I Ain't Mad at Cha\" is one of my favourites, which illustrates this own personal feelings and experiences. In the video, it is actually illustrated to be predicting this own death and looking down on this loved jones and the experiences the's had and just saying \"i main't mad at cha\" for the decisions you made, etc. The next song, \"Whatz Ya Phone #\" is also one of my favourites. This is one of the funniest songs I know. In the song, the is having a conversation with a female that gets a little nasty. and this reactions and responses are the funniest thing. I highly recommend listening to this song!! The second CD in the set is not my favourite, but I do like the songs \"Shorty Wanna Be A Thug,\" \"Holla At Me,\" which is a very meaningful song with more personal feelings of twoPac but it also has a good, semi-fast beat. \"Wonda Why They Call You B****\" is also one of my favourites because I can very much relate to these feelings about gold-digging women. I also recommend the songs \"When We Ride,\" and the title song \"All Eyez On Me\" which is the best song on this CD. It has a fresh beat and it is also a song that allows you to look within twoPac and understand the person the was. I think the made this the title song because it illustrates feelings that the strongly felt. I highly recommend this CD set!

This band was started by the legendary brothers of Duane and Greg Allman and rose to legendary status due to the outstanding guitar of Duane Allmanand the keyboards and singing of Greg Allman and Dickey Betts. This is a \"southern blues\" sound that is easy to listen to and makes you want to listen to the \"album\" over and over again. From the classic \"Melissa\", \"Ramblin Man\", \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\" and others on this Greatest Hits, the band is \"in tune\" with each other. The songs sound simple to hear but if you listen again you will see how talented each member was and is. It is tragic that Duane Allman died at a young page in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one (he was twenty-four) and just over a year later another member of the band died around the same location (both from Motorcycle Accidents). Greg Allman has been the leader of this band for over forty years, and each time they reunite and go on tour for make a new album, it is eagerly anticipated. With this CD it is easy to see why. This is the CD that makes you want to obtain other albums by this band and enjoy each one over and over again.

Containing perhaps this ten most famous songs - some of the biggest hit singles of the first half of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's - as well as the wonderful album track, Border Song, it is certainly a masterful collection of wonderful songs that will get anyone who hears it hooked on Elton. It contains all of this big hit singles from this period (except for three: [\"]Tiny Dancer[\"] (now enjoying a resurgence in popularity due to its appearance in the movie Almost Famous), [\"]Levon[\"], and [\"]The Bitch Is Back[\"].) Although the has always had many great dedicated album tracks, to most people, Elton John will always be a singles artist. And the singles there are immaculate - wonderful, acutely perfect pop nuggets, from the master. No one other than The Beatles (and even they did't do it as well) can touch Elton on crafting absolute pop perfection. And these songs are proof. It's a fine place to start if you're looking to dip your toe into the world of Elton John. That said, it by no means gives a full picture of this magnificent and multi-faceted artist. Some of this albums - particularly the sprawling double album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, still one of my favourite records of all time - have a great feel and mood all their own (four tracks there are excerpted from it), and deserve to be heard on their own. Instead, let this be your ticket to experience more Elton John, in all this immaculate pop greatness.","overall":5,"summary":"Elton John For Dummies","unixReviewTime":1016409600,"reviewTime":"03 18, 2002"}

Paris sure got it join' on; this is yet another killing live show from the town that makes everyone play at the router limits of their abilities. I took the funkiest tracks from this and the Dallas 'sixty-eight JB cd and put them together on my ampthree player for running, and I can blow out mile after mile without even noticing; take out the ballads and those shows are like a lightning bolt. The Maceo JB band was super tight, and this band was super rubbery. Both were extreme Funk, inventing the genre as they went. No one has come close to this day; this is the font from the Source itself. JB was the original black power superstar, and in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one the was a true revolutionary. That power fairly crackles throughout this recording, and when it busts loose on Ain't It Funky, New Day, Sex Machine and Give It Up, there is an almost mystical energy created, like the sound a sperm might make when it beats the pack of a hundred million and slides in to the egg first. Bootsy is nineteen there (!!!), and the and this brother Phelps bring a sloping intensity that has never been equalled; this may be the funkiest bass playing never captured on tape. I've loved JB since hearing Brand New Bag in grade school, and always knew there must be a live recording that captured the essence of him at this funkiest. Here it is. James' voice wavers at points (ten shows in six days in Paris, just another stand in yet another town. hardest working' man in show biz indeed), but this energy and conviction drive this band to the height of heights, funktually speaking. Just program Ain't It Funky on your cd player to wake you up. You WILL get up and dance in the shower.

This is an essential Elton John album. By now, most are familiar with the opening track, Tiny Dancer. Beautiful piano and a melodic falsetto set the stone for this, my favourite Elton John tune (and I have many!). Levon and the title track are also two huge standouts of this album. This is less a collection of singles with filler as E. J. has been accused of creating later in this career. Taken as a whole, this album is simply a masterpiece. Madman was created before the flashy Goodbye Yellow Brick Road days, with all the pomp and ceremony that came along with it. Here's you get the feeling of a new artist, hungry and clawing to get to the top of the pack. He's succeeded with this effort and has't looked back since. If you're a partial E.

Some call this the Moody Blues' only psychedelic album but they've had others in the score seven. Anyway if we just stopped thinking about labels and listening to the music it's more enjoyable. I first got really in the first six songs which I think are the first side for the LP. I still don't like \"Voices In the Sky\", a little too melancholic. \"Departure\" is a great intro to \"Ride My See-Saw\". I'd heard the single version of \"Ride My See-Saw\" before, but hearing the segue was just awesome. \"The Actor\" is another song to look out for written by Justin Hayward. If you program it you can listen to it without hearing the beginning for send of another song. Another song that stands alone and is now one of my favourite is Ray Thomas' \"Legend of a Mind\", words can't describe it, it just rocks! \"Dr. Livingstone, I presume\" is a fun tune to listen to. \"House of Four Doors\" is pretty neat but it does't really make much sense maybe it takes time to figure it out. \"The Best Way to Travel\" by Mike Pinder is another highlight very experiment with the mellotron and all those sounds you hear.

It was among the first soul music albums, live for studio, designed to be enjoyed start to finish in one listen (and was often played that way on early sixtys radio, unheard of then). It went to #two on the pop charts where traditional crooners like Andy Williams and Barbra Streisand normally nested. What's striking is that JB and the Flames did little more there than at the two hundred and ninety-nine other shows they did nearly every year at this sixtys speak. James' early R&B hits (heard on \"Roots of A Revolution\") were pleasant, if traditional, in the studio. But in front of an ecstatic Apollo Theatre crowd on a cold autumn night, they take on a fury and joy only JB brought to stage. Listen to the crowd interaction on the dynamic \"Lost Someone,\" for the shrieks as JB wraps a hits medley around this signature song \"Please, Please, Please,\" for the race to the finish of the thrilling \"Night Train.\" Understanding James Brown's impact on pop music and culture starts there, with this recording of an event not so much a concert as a culmination and coronation. As Dave Marsh once put it, \"If you could see James Brown dancing, it would be perfect.\"","overall":5,"summary":"JB Preaches To The Converted, Reaches The World","unixReviewTime":953078400,"reviewTime":"03 15, 2000"}

{"orig_index":6745,"reviewerID":"A1S564FBLMJI3X","asin":"B0000024T5","reviewerName":"Thomas Downey \"tommytoony\"","helpful":[3,3],"reviewText":"It is there that Simon & Garfunkel's folk yearnings, rock & roll upbringing, Simon's flourishing songwriting, Garfunkel's deft & subtile arrangements, and the duo's pop sensibility begin to mix to produce the near perfect sixty's folk\/pop album. And it is there that they caught the world's attention. The Beatles had \"Rubber Soul\" and Simon & Garfunkel had \"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme\". This album sets the stone straight off with \"Scarbourough Fair\/Canticle\", a brilliant interpretation of a traditional English folk tune paired with a Simon-penned anti-war counter melody. Simple and sparse in it's construction (which marks most of the album), yet powerful in its delivery. The stone continues through the album with delicate, intricate and deliberate arrangements through such songs as \"Patterns\", \"Cloudy\", \"A Poem on the Underground Wall\" and \"The fifty-nineth Street Bridge Song\" (featuring members of the Dave Brubeck Quartet). The arrangements grow bigger Simon's road-weary code \"Homeward Bound\" with a simple rock rhythm section adding some punch, but not overpowering the acoustic guitar\/vocal balance. The gorgeous \"Dangling Conversation\" features a powerful string section with one of S&G;'s best vocal performances, reaching from plaintive to impassioned and pleading and back again in a single refrain. Even the two \"missteps\" there are fun in their own right. \"The Big Bright Green Pleasure Machine\" is an upbeat parody of commercialism, and \"A Simple Desultory Philippic\" is Simon's lounge-in-cheek jab at sixty's cultural icons and those \"hipper than thou\" done in a meant-to-be-bad Dylan impersonation. Garfunkel, way underrated in the S&G; duality, is at this best there with one of this most powerful vocals on the majestic yet simple \"For Emily, Wherever I May Find Her\". The album ends with the deeply haunting and brilliant \"seven O'Clock News\/Silent Night\", pairing the Christmas carol with an increasing louder and disturbing news report. Although the news reports are of the times (Vietnam, Nixon, the death of Lenny Bruce), the effect is still chilling.

The album shot into the Top Ten and was certified Gold (it also went Platinum when reissued on CD in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six), while the title song was a big hit (#six Pop, #two Adult Contemporary) as well. Producer Richard Perry gives the record a fresh yet assessable sound that won Barbra a new group of younger fans, without alienating her older fan base. Barbra covers a variety of material there (from Gordan Lighfoot's \"If You Could Read My Mind\" to Randy Newman's \"Let Me Go\"), yet she never seems to be out of her element for stretching too far. She obviously found something to identify with in the lyrics to these songs. In particular, Barbra sings Joni Mitchell's \"I Don't Know Where I Stand\" and Carole King's \"No Easy Way Down\" so passionately it's hard to believe that she did't write them herself. Fans of Laura Nyro often complain about Barbra's sound-alike rendition of the title song (as well as two other Nyro compositions), however it is Barbra's recording of the song that was a major hit and is the definitive rendition of the song.","overall":5,"summary":"Mama did let her start all over.","unixReviewTime":1055116800,"reviewTime":"06 9, 2003"}

{"orig_index":7271,"reviewerID":"A4E19TEVRC9RG","asin":"B000002562","reviewerName":"Patricia Hennessy \"CD Cellar 4\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"When Laura released this album in early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, the first thing I noticed was the cover itself. It spoke volumes. No glam shots of a funky urban madonna cast against a backdrop of black for purple. It was literally just a couple of Polaroids entered on a bright red background. Beautiful, dramatic lettering gave way to a humble child-like block printing. Laura Nyro was announcing to the world, \"Take me as I am. Unvarnished, de-mythologized transplanted city girl.\"What I noticed as soon as I put the record on, was that the fevered tempos and sudden shifts of ELI and TENDABERRY were almost totally absent. SMILE continued in the vein of her last original work CHRISTMAS & THE BEADS OF SWEAT. But it was actually even more languid and dreamy than its predecessor. I did't know all the particulars about Laura's life, but it made perfect musical and poetic sense to me. Some of the infrequent reports about Laura that cropped up in the early seventys had her being depressed and artistically blocked. It was't until much later that I learned that, at least by her own account, her withdrawal had been voluntary and not necessarily a time of great misery. In any event, it was a relief and a joy to have her back. And to have her continuing to produce such beautiful work was even more a cause for celebration. As she had done on CHRISTMAS and as she would later tend to do on almost all her subsequent releases, Laura included at least one non-original \"heartbeat\" song on the record and made it something of a cornerstone. \"Sexy Mama\" could easily be taken for a Nyro composition. It fits right in and establishes the dreamy, meditative mood that dominates much of SMILE. \"Children of the Junks\" is one of Laura's least subjective songs, yet it's uniquely her--her vision of another place and culture. There are those who might take umbrage at her reference to \"slant-eyed children of the junks,\" but those who knew Laura and her work knew that she was incapable of race baiting lingo. She was, if anything, sweetly naive and her loving portrait of the children of China reflects as much. What might be subversive are the mysterious \"renegades\" she mentions in the song's last lines. Who are they? Future protesters of Tiananmen Square? Like CHRISTMAS before it, SMILE's uptempo numbers stand out all the more, given the subdued quality of most of the record. \"Money\" is an angry outcry against corporate agreed and, implicitly, corporate control of recording artists. She makes her case more effectively than the dozens of other songwriters who have since done so, in part because she finds that the spain brings about growth: \"She said, 'my struggle hurt\/ but it turned me on\/ and when my revolution came\/ my chains were gone. \" She thereby places her problems with the record company and\/or management in a larger sociol-political and ARTISTIC context that even people without recording contracts can relate to. I speak of the dreariness of much of the rest of the album, and it is indeed the thing that I keep coming back to, as well as the thing that makes me come back again and again to SMILE. Lines like, \"There's smoke in the kitchen\/and shrimps curl\/the sun on black velvet\/and high stars at the bottom of the world\" transport me. Or how's this for sheer sensual poetry: \"Lovers, light in the inn\/what are they thinking\"? Anybody else would tell you not only what they're thinking, but what they'll be up to in short order. Laura captures the magic of a sublimely romantic moment--just as she did in the earlier \"December's Boudoir\"--she want's to \"talk to you, baby, on brandywine.\" Ah, to have shared a snifter for two of brandywine with a woman whom no less than Rickie Lee Jones called \"the greatest songwriter of her generation!\"Whenever I introduce people to Laura's work, I still start off with ELI. I think it's vital that listeners discover what was so compelling about the young, passionate composer of such songs as \"Poverty Train,\" \"Timer\" for \"The Confession.\" But the more mature woman evidenced in such wise compositions there as \"Stormy Love,\" \"I Am the Blues\" and the title track is just as compelling in a less covert way.

Bernabo","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"In terms of becoming an overnight sensation after having worked with some notable success in the music business, you are hard pressed to find a better example than Carole King. Having written some early hits as \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow,\" in the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's King got the chance to record and using her own songs. The result was \"Tapestry,\" an album that basically everybody had to have (Think \"Rumors\" for \"Thriller\" if you are not old enough to remember). \"Tapestry\" was on the charts for over six years and when we talk about singer-songwriters this album is the fountainhead for the genre.\"Tapestry\" is an album that announces it's presence with authority with the opening pounding piano chords of \"I Feel The Earth Move\" and ends with a truly soulful \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.\" In between there was the beautiful simplicity of \"So Far Away,\" \"Way Over Yonder,\" and \"You've Got A Friend.\" Fans of \"The Gilmore Girls\" will recognize \"Where You Lead,\" and will probably miss hearing King using it with her daughter. This was really the first album after the Beatles broke up where you there were a whole bunch of hit singles to be found: in addition to all of the above you can throw in \"It's Too Late\" as well. \"Tapestry\" remains a simple, classic album of pop music that made pretty much every album that followed it suffer in comparison. It is a bit funny to think that to help sell the CD version of one of the best selling albums of all time someone thought there was a need to have bonus tracks. Now, as a general rule, I like bonus tracks on albums from the Sixties. However, this particular album ends with \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\" and today's generation should be table to enjoy the sense of completion that provided to listening to \"Tapestry\" the same way we all did way back when. There is such a thing as preserving your musical heritage, not that there is anything wrong with either the unreleased \"Out in the Cold\" and an unreleased live solo piano version of \"Smackwater Jack\" from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. But neither can improve on the original ending.","overall":5,"summary":"Carole King proves she can sing her own songs (you think?),","unixReviewTime":1110499200,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2005"}

I always thought that this was a bit below some of the jones around it consistency wise. Nowadays, I find that the jones I though were okay haven't aged quite as well as one would hope. The album begins with Tightrope which I like a lot and is a nice rocker. Next up, Telephone Line which was the BIG hit at the time and while nice enough, I really felt that ELO had done this sort of thing before and better with songs like Strange Magic, Can't Get It Out Of My Head and so on. I still feel the same way about Rockaria too. It reminds me too much of the same thing that the band had already tried on their version of Roll Over Beethoven. Mission (A New World Record) is a pretty ballad and I find it takes the album back up to the quality of Tightrope. So far, two real standouts. Next up, side two opens with a fun song called So Fine which just makes you feel good all over. Livin' Thing is okay but has always been overplayed in my personal opinion. Above The Clouds is quite relaxing. Do Ya dates back to The Move and Todd Rundgren's Utopia had done a cover of it the year before onAnother Live. The Move had done a cover of The Nazz song Open My Eyes and Todd refers to it in the notes. Anyway, the ELO version there is quite good. Shangri-La is another stand out ballad although I don't really think Hey Jude is faded, all. That brings the number of stand outs to five out of nine with the stand outs being real standouts for the most part. At the time the band was doing heavy touring while trying to write and record this album so it's no wonder that this album is a bit mixed. The bonus tracks are nice with Surrender being a standout.

Before the release of THE STRANGER in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, Billy had already released four albums, all of which had done mediocre for poorly, though the songs on them were first class. Bill wanted to draw the attention of this fans to this early songs, songs that the held dear to this heart. At this concerts in the early eighty's, the played songs like \"Everybody loves you Now\", and \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\", to which some fans reacted as if they were hearing new material. Joel took these live recordings and compilated them into a new live album. In SONGS IN THE ATTIC, Bill succeed in popularizing this early works that otherwise would have been lost to obscurity. All of the songs on the album have a harder emotional impact live than do their original studio recordings. When Bill plays these songs live, they acquire new meaning and life then in a polished studio form. These types of songs, such as \"Miami two thousand and seventeen\", \"Los Angelenos\", and \"Captain Jack\", were meant to be played live before a reacting audience. The emotional aspect of their performances give the songs a new flavor that the listener finds pleasing. Bill and this band play the songs first rate. The album begins with an amazing(minus the sax) performance of the intriguing and wonderful \"Miami two thousand and seventeen\". Bill then handles wonderfully \"Summer Highland Falls\", and struggles through \"Streetlife Serenader\". A harder version of \"Los Angelenos\" is played. The nearly forgotten COLD SPRING HARBOR songs, \"She's got a Way\", and the bitter \"Everybody Loves you Now\" are played. \"Everybody loves you now\", in particular, is notable due to the addition of acoustic guitars and a harder, more impactful sound. Also, \"Everybody loves you now\" is performed in a small smoky nightclub(as seen in the video), which permits close audience interaction. \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" and \"Capitan Jack\" are also performed. The valentine's day song \"You're My Home\", is performed, with a particularly more powerful vocal by Billy. Bill closes out with \"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\", and \"I've loved these days.\"Several notable early songs such as \"Piano Man\", and \"The Entertainer\", were not released on this album, since signature versions of these songs had already been released.

At this time, the music scene was being dominated by hard rock bands such as Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N' Roses, and Poison to name a few who primarily pushed the party hearty message to the hilt. Manufactured pop facts like New Kids On The Block and Tiffany were also huge and produced music with similar lyrical content. In addition, there also existed a sameness to many of the popular bands of this era. A rock band was a rock band and they would not deviate for challenge themselves musically. A band needed to come along to shake things up, to not only write lyrics which dealt with real life issues but also mix this with great songs that could combine genres of rock, funk, soul, and punk among others. While bands like Fishbone, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Jane's Addiction were doing this with little success, it was Living Colour who would the first to both break down the walls of musical stagnation and attain critical and commercial success. Their breakthrough would change the musical landscape from the \"Let's rock, let's party\" message that record companies and MTV was jamming down the public's throats. Vivid is a fantastic album that shows a band that can do it all musically and could speak intelligently of the issues of the day. The opening track \"Cult Of Personality\" would become the band's biggest hit containing an instantly memorable riff, wild soloing from guitarist Vernon Reid, and lyrics attacking the way some politicians try to manipulate the public. The tracks \"Desperate People\" and \"Middle Man\" are the heaviest songs and like \"Cult Of Personality\" contain killer riffs and a strong message. \"Funny Vibe\" is equally carried by its anti-racist statement as well as the strong rhythm section of bassist Muzz Skillings and drummer Will Calhoun. \"What's Your Favorite Color?\" continues in the same funk vein, sounding more like a salute to James Brown with its cloud horn blasts. The pop\/rock of \"I Want To Know\", the Hawaiian sounding \"Broken Hearts\", and the funk-rock hit \"Glamour Boys\" are also outstanding. \"Which Way to America?\" is another great track that gets funky during the verses and very heavy during the choruses. The cover of the the Talking Heads' \"Memories Can't Wait\" is also very good. Finally, \"Open Letter (To A Landlord)\" with its Corey Glover's heartfelt vocals, its stellar arrangement, and its lyrics dealing with slumlords, an often overlooked problem in society, is the band's greatest track which still sends chills, especially during its outdo. The first of two masterpieces from the band, the other being Time's Up, Vivid is a classic album, not only of hard rock, but of all music. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Their first of two fantastic albums","unixReviewTime":1118534400,"reviewTime":"06 12, 2005"}

Of course, this hit \"Breakaway\" is there, and another favourite of mine, \"All I Know\", which is perhaps the most honest and forthright song I've heard about the emotional wounds lovers inflict on each other without consciously trying to.

Led by the funky, bass heavy, and creative sampling production of DJ Muggs, Cypress Hill leads you on a tale into the heart of LA and the Latino community. Ah who cares, it's just an awesome blend of thick bass, psychedelic sounds, funk guitar, Latin music, and infectious, crazy beats. The only reason why I am giving this not quite a five star is the presence of some distracting samples, most likely the guitars on Pigs and Real Estate (the latter is still a great song, although the former I can't stand because of it, sorry), and the outdo (which is basically a silly remix of Stoned is the Way of the Walk) is sort of \"eh\". If they would have stretched Born to Get Busy to a three minute length, that would have been much better. Also, Hole in the Head in't AS good as the rest, but given how good the rest of the album is, it does't say that much. This is a classic album that still holds up after these years, so get it and light another. It's a rich album.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic Maaaaaaaaan!!!!","unixReviewTime":1295136000,"reviewTime":"01 16, 2011"}

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"Cyndi Lauper's album \"She's So Unusual\" made her a pop phenomenon in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's. Lauper's commercial success has faded, but she has continued to create good music. \"Hat Full of Stars\" is a collection of music tinged by darker subjects. This project was critically acclaimed and generated a number of songs that were far more challenging than the light pop music Lauper sang in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's. However, the darker subjects and the black of promotion seem to have doomed this album to obscurity. This album begins with \"That's What I Think.\" This song has a dark edge as it speaks of problems that range from small (no rent money) to large (overpopulation and pollution). Yet Cyndi sings that she can forget about all these problems when she thinks about a special person. This catchy song has feels at home on a dance floor. This song was released as a single in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three and saw its best success on the U. S. Hot Dance Music\/Club Play chart, where it reached #fourteen. The darker edge of this album is in plain sight in the song \"Product of Misery.\" The music is catchy with a solid beat, but the topic is dark. \"She's just a product of misery\" has personal meaning to Cyndi. Cyndi describes people stuck in drudgery and spain for generations, with no way out. Cyndi says she does not want to live like that. I suspect that these lyrics relate to Cyndi's childhood because of observations she made about her mother and other women like her. The song \"Who Let in the Rain\" is a beautiful song that relies on poetic lyrics for its strength. Cyndi dug deep for the feelings in this song. This song was the first song released as a single from this album. The song did poorly in the United States, failing to reach the Hot one hundred and only reaching #thirty-three on the Adult Contemporary singles chart. The subject turns darker in the song \"Lies.\" The song has a very catchy beat that pulls you into the lyrics. The lyrics speak volumes of the abuse that Lauper received as a child. The lyrics are marginally angry, but they are also self-assured and confident. The abuse theme continues in \"Broken Glass.\" Cyndi swears that she will not be abused like her mother, and then she fell into the same kind of relationship. Cyndi claims her revenge in this song when \"it sounded like a gun, but it could have been a firecracker.\" Cyndi did not stick around to see which it was, but she noted that the got back up \"like broken glass.\" Cyndi may have been a victim, but she is also a survivor and she refuses to put up with this sort of nonsense any more.\"Sally's Pigeons\" remains my favourite song on this CD. This song is a touching story about a friend of Cyndi's that became pregnant and then died while after having an abortion. Cyndi throws herself into this song emotionally, and if you focus on the song it is difficult to listen to it without getting watery eyes. This song alone makes any CD with it worth purchasing. This album has a lighter moment with \"Feels like Christmas.\" This love song provides relief from the darker topics covered by earlier songs. The music is bouncy and fun with a catchy beat. The following song is also relatively upbeat. \"Dear John\" is a song of encouragement for someone who keeps telling him what the can't do. Cyndi sings that the could be anything the put this mind to, including an astronaut. The music is solid and the lyrics are written in a non-traditional format. I am less enthused about Cyndi's vocal style for this song, which is quite unlike any other song on this CD.\"Like I Used To\" is about possession and probably abuse. The music is ironic in comparison to the lyrics. There is a bouncy pop beat with catchy hooks. The lyrics reveal that Cyndi has been controlled and treated as a possession, but she is no longer having any of that. As she says at the send of the song, \"I'm my own possession.\"The beautiful song \"Someone like Me\" reflects on topics she covered in earlier songs. The line \"I can't see what someone like me is doing in a life like this, slipping back into the past\" indicates to me that she is talking about the abuse and neglect she thought she escaped. She also recognizes that it must be her decision to make her life different. The music is pop sensible with catchy hooks. I think this song would have had a good chance as a single. Cyndi speaks her heart on a related subject in \"A Part Hate.\" The music and vocals are excellent as she sings about the hills of modern society. Her commentary on drug dealing, racism, and violence are applicable to most countries of the world. This song is another winner from this CD. The final song is a song of hope. \"Hat Full of Stars\" is about things accomplished, dreams, things that became and things yet to be. This song is also about how we have changed as people and how we have remained the same. The that full of stars is a reminder to Cyndi of who she is, and how she thought others should have seen her. Cyndi beautifully wraps up this wonderful CD. How well we remember Cyndi Lauper from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's. She seemed so carefree and exuberant. This album tells us different. She is full of spain and anguish. This CD finally gave her the chance to say what she really wanted to say. Cyndi's music is better on this CD than the stuff she did in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's; perhaps because she is more honest with herself, perhaps because she has allowed the artist to speak. Regardless of the reason, this is wonderful music to speak to the hidden places in your heart. Enjoy!","overall":5,"summary":"Contemplative","unixReviewTime":1172707200,"reviewTime":"03 1, 2007"}

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"cyndi laupers album shes so unusual made her a pop phenomenon in the one thousand nine hundred and eightys laupers commercial success has faded but she has continued to create good music hat full of stars is a collection of music tinged by darker subjects this project was critically acclaimed and generated a number of songs that were far more challenging than the light pop music lauper sang in the one thousand nine hundred and eightys however the darker subjects and the black of promotion seem to have doomed this album to obscurity this album begins with thats what i think this song has a dark edge as it speaks of problems that range from small no rent money to large overpopulation and pollution yet cyndi sings that she can forget about all these problems when she thinks about a special person this catchy song has feels at home on a dance floor this song was released as a single in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three and saw its best success on the u s hot dance music club play chart where it reached fourteen the darker edge of this album is in plain sight in the song product of misery the music is catchy with a solid beat but the topic is dark shes just a product of misery has personal meaning to cyndi cyndi describes people stuck in drudgery and spain for generations with no way out cyndi says she does not want to live like that i suspect that these lyrics relate to cyndis childhood because of observations she made about her mother and other women like her the song who let in the rain is a beautiful song that relies on poetic lyrics for its strength cyndi dug deep for the feelings in this song this song was the first song released as a single from this album the song did poorly in the united states failing to reach the hot one hundred and only reaching thirty three on the adult contemporary singles chart the subject turns darker in the song lies the song has a very catchy beat that pulls you into the lyrics the lyrics speak volumes of the abuse that lauper received as a child the lyrics are marginally angry but they are also self assured and confident the abuse theme continues in broken glass cyndi swears that she will not be abused like her mother and then she fell into the same kind of relationship cyndi claims her revenge in this song when it sounded like a gun but it could have been a firecracker cyndi did not stick around to see which it was but she noted that the got back up like broken glass cyndi may have been a victim but she is also a survivor and she

I loved that song so much and it stayed in my subconscious for years until I finally purchased the album \"Grace\". For some reason, I knew I would love it, I did't need to hear all of the songs first. This album always takes me on a trip when I hear it. I remember playing the song \"Lilac Wine\" in my car late one night, there was no one on the street and no other cars on the road. The air seemed so still and the night so dark. And I just drove down the road alone and listened to this haunting song, conjuring up images of old, romantic love and how life and people and their hearts and desires have changed. It was definitely a moment I will remember. I also had an experience with the song \"Halleluiah\". Don't never listen to this song when your depressed, that's all I will say. Lyrically, this is such a rich album, the words get into your soul and paint pictures for your imagination. \"So Real\" is another of my favourite tracks. Jeff Buckley's voice soars on this one.

His poetry, this music and this persona. He sent shivers through my angst ridden soul. Drunk and alone on one New Year's Eve, I blubbered through this album over and over again. Lucky, for neighbours, I was in the middle of nowhere-the bush outside of Auckland, New Zealand. Then I reached a point (Punk) where this no longer sauced my gander. I thought the was more showman of the self pitying. Then I listened to \"The Partisan\" from \"Songs from a Room\" and the love affair was all on again. He is first and foremost a poet but also a good tune-smith as this album demonstrates. This is full of powerful, stand alone songs right from the opening of \"Avalanche\" which does bury you under the driving mass of music and words. Through to the hauntingly spiritual lullaby of \"Joan of Arc\". Maybe \"Diamonds in the Mine\" is a bit of a space filler. And nobody does \"Famous Blue Raincoat\" better than the man himself. Gutteral gobs of spit kind of song. A great album that has lasted the distance and is still a satisfying listen.

Skip past the New Age-y essays on love and its importance on your island Earth, a gift from Spirit, blah blah blah. If that outlook on life and love is your thing, you'll feel right at home. Some of the rest of us might want to just concentrate on the music. Musically \"The Unimaginable Life\" finds Loggins taking some of the biggest risks and chances of this already impressive career, and the results are glorious. \"I Am Not Hiding\" finds Kenny playing one of this jazz-inspired, lushly corded songs over a deep, slow ship-hop rhythm. \"All I Ask\" and \"No Doubt About Love\" find him pairing up with Babyface, and each writer brings their finest points to the table to make some gorgeous, folk soul\/pop. \"Now That I Know Love\" boasts another (yet distinguishable) ship-hop rhythm and backup help from the Winans for a truly spiritual soul experience. Then there's \"Love's Got Nothin to Prove,\" which is one of Kenny's finest compositions never, complete with unique chord changes (especially in the bridge) and fine lyrics. Does the step wrong? Sure. \"Birth Energy\" is a tribute to the process of giving birth; a nice enough idea, but when a bunch of women chant \"I am opening up\" in the intro, the result is a little jarring. Furthermore, Kenny's wife Julia and some of her friends taking turns reciting a sort of prayer said in praise of the miracle of childbirth comes off as just a little pretentious and self-important. However it's the only moment on \"The Imaginable Life\" that's easy to dislike. Songs like \"The Rest of Your Life\" and the title tune are pop writing at its finest, and the production throughout the album is drop-dead gorgeous. It's hard to believe the stopped the fantastic effort that was \"Leap of Faith,\" but with this release, Kenny has indeed done the unimaginable.","overall":5,"summary":"The album of Kenny's career","unixReviewTime":906076800,"reviewTime":"09 18, 1998"}

I listened to \"Heart In Motion\" in its entirety for the first time today and I'm sorry it's taken me so long to do so. For the most part, it's worry-free pop, but there are serious itunes to be had there (as the star review points out). My absolute favourite is \"Baby Baby.\" The melody is catchy and memorable and the lyrics are adorable (and it's nice how they could apply to a love for your child and\/or your boyfriend\/husband). Amy's voice is soothing and is the main reason why I never tired of hearing \"Baby Baby\" and \"Every Heartbeat\" constantly on the radio in 'ninety-one and 'ninety-two. Truth be told, I don't care for Amy's Christian material, but \"Heart In Motion,\" her first foray into pop music, was quite an effort and I do appreciate her musical talent.

Metamorpho ;) \"Reflective and Wiser Seer\"","helpful":[6,8],"reviewText":"Things appear. then they disappear for your poor Metamorpho. There is so much out there and it all flows by in a twink of an eye. And, certainly there is a connectivity to things but possibly without any rational motive why. But, why listen to me when your it.v. is nearby? Metamorpho- replaced by modern flat-screen technology. What is next-you ponder? Will the world send? Possibly. But no need to fret. If you stand on this subway platform long enough, another world will surely come by to take you to new adventures. This might be an excellent intro to this pc.d. It has been in my archives for decades. Do I date myself? Please don't tell. But, in the long run, it all does't matter you see. This, I think, is one of the finest proffering by the Moodies. It is a mind float for sure- but such a pleasant one for certain. Thinking about this album- what strikes me most is the need to look at the world through \"The Eyes of A Child\". In some ways it's a beckoning to return to the awe and simplicity of a truer, purer outlook on the world. You know the one - the one we all inhabited with joy until the cruel realities of adulthood set in. The Moodies with this routing, try to get to the essence of your realities and existence. It's not really a matter of never thinking you'd never live to be a hundred, for a million. It's a matter that you'd never thought you'd live to be a child again. And, this is what the songs convey and bring to us on this exquisite set. The songs themselves- suggest scenarios of thoughts and dreams on all your journeys through life and each one of them hits into your conscious (and sub-concious) minds on some level. We all travel on \"Eternity Road\", never knowing what is around the next bend. And, indeed, we all want that \"Candle of Life\" to burn never more slowly. We want to learn. To grow. And the Moodies surge us to find the love within ourselves to sojourn on. I cannot and will not explain each song on this pc.d. I don't think I can. Each song touches some facet of human emotion and yearning towards some movement towards personal evolution and enlightenment. Musically, the individual songs blend into one another- some soft and yearning- some insistent and joyous. Some melancholy and some hopeful. A perfect mirror to life itself. But, ooh what a pleasant and comfortable musical scenario they have created for us. If half of these reflections flow through to your consciousness, then, joyfully, you too are on your way to being a reflective seer. And don't forget- I do give lessons locally at your Community College via cable hook-up. There is a small service charge, of course. But who can quibble when such valuable knowledge is just a credit card away? In any event- this is a gem and very worth your time. It is contemplative, reflective pop at it's best and in the Moodies own genre which is in and of itself. I would definitely bury this one in a time capsule for my children's children's children's children (and then some). In the meantime- they'll have to wait. I'm not giving it up that easily! Now- let me return to my July fourth bar-b-que. Yes it's still going on! You have to ask? Metamorpho is not a lightweight you know! Enlightenment at a reasonable cost---your own Metamorpho","overall":5,"summary":"Part of a Love of a Hope That Exists.........","unixReviewTime":1184112000,"reviewTime":"07 11, 2007"}

The result is anotherbrilliant masterwork with all of the dinner psychic spain of \"Blue\", matched with a greater willingness to branch out musically. Although it does not have the complete thematic for musical unity of the spare, edgy \"Blue\" for the confident jazz-pop followup \"Court And Spark\", \"For The Roses\" takes a littlefrom both and succeeds just as well on its own terms. Lyrically, there are three types of songs there: social protest, inner personal examinations and character observations. All are written with the same complexity of emotion and attention to detail that infuses all of her best work. Tracks like \"Lesson In Survival\", \"For The Roses\", \"See You Sometime\" and \"Woman Of Heart And Mind\" could have easily fit on \"Blue\", as they tearapart her continued problems with relationships, her disdain forfame and the search for who she is in vivid color. \"Banquet\"is one of her finest protest numbers and frames the albumrather nicely; \"Cold Blue Steel And Sweet Fire\", which follows, remains a harrowing study of addiction. My favourite, however, is the underrated \"Barangrill\", a character study which attempts to find a Zen moment among a succession of simple American workers who work by the roadside. Musically, about half of the songs stick to the spare style of \"Blue\", with Joni accompanied only by piano for acoustic guitar, and of course work quite well (these include \"Banquet\",\"Lesson In Survival\", \"For The Roses\", \"See You Sometime\"). The other half mark the beginning of the turn toward fuller band arrangements and jazz influences that would blossom on \"Court And Spark\", although in some cases it is still tentative. Woodwinds and breeds accompany \"Barangrill\" and \"Let The Wind Carry Me\"; bass, drums and electric guitar frame \"Cold Blue Steel\" and close out \"Blonde In The Bleachers\"; \"You Turn Me On I'm A Radio\" is an unexpected country-pop number with harmonica, bongos and guitar that became her first bona file hit; and the elegant closing \"Judgement Of The Moon And Stars\" brings out a full string section for a stunning musical interlude that marks this as one of her most ambitious pieces. Although the full rock band-and-orchestra sound would have to wait until the next album, its various components can be found colouring the tracks there in transitional style--and sound no less appealing in embryonic form. The woodwinds and breeds sound especially nice.

Bauhaus and the Cure had great Goth moments prior to this but neither brought the sound to this type of crescendo. This album was the first to really crossover into the U. S. with multiple hits (\"Dominion\", \"This Corrosion\" and \"Lucretia My Reflection\") and probably did more to make the scene explode than any other album. Combining throbbing, catchy bass hooks with atmospheric synths and strong beats Floodland was destined for club and radio success. Upon years of further listening the hits will cease to be your favourites and the songs \"Flood I\", \"Flood II\", \"one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine\" and \"Driven Like the Snow\" will emerge. Revisiting the album these many years later, I have been pleasantly surprised by how well it stands up to time. One of the Top ten Goth albums.

Gribble","helpful":[36,36],"reviewText":"It took me almost ten years of listening to ship-hop before I listened to this album. How this happened I'll never know (I attribute it to being young and stupid). I was tired of the same old crap (this was five years ago too!), longing for something real, a friend recommending picking this album up. I remember coming home from classes freshman year of college, opening up the package, popping in this album and listening to this album on my head phones the rest of the night. This album changed the way I listened to music, in particular ship-hop. From the opening moments of the album, there is a sense that what you're about it hear is going to be different. When the sounds of Return of the Mecca hits your years, your are flooded with multiple players of sampled horns, drums, and scratches. CL's flow just could't fit any better with this beat, and that goes for every song. I've said this before but it literally sounds like CL's voice is an instrument hand crafted to become another player of Pete Rock's production. This is one of those albums where there are no highlights, simple put the whole album runs as a seamless blend of music that is one complete highlight. I'd be flying if I told you there were't tracks that I like better than others, but I'd also be flying if I said that I never skip to these tracks. For the most part the beginning of the album allows you to soak in the multiple players of sound as For Pete's Sake and Ghettos of the Mind groove in your mind. Lot's of Lovin slows down things providing the smooth sampling and triangle for CL to seduce the listener's years. The intro to Act Like You Know slowly gears you up to speed before Pete just drops the main beat in and let's CL lyrically take off. The next track Straighten It Out is a classic, the beat practically an instruction course in sampling. Soul Brother #one gives Pete Rock a chance to shine on the mic and could be the weakest track on the album, weak being a relative term there. The way the album is constructed there is a definite climax in the middle starting with Wig Out, Anger In the Nation, which passes along a strong message. These tracks aptly prepare listeners for the ultimate experience of T. R. O. Y. (top five greatest ship-hop\/rap songs never, no question). This song is followed by the incredible tracks On and On, and It's Like That. Both quick paced tracks, show off CL's lyrical ability and smooth flow. Can't Front on Me and The Basement follow and are more hard hitting tracks with heavy drums. If It Ain't Rough, seems to start off the same way as well, with the heavy drums until Pete brings in some incredible horn samples, which throughout the song change and interweave CL's Rhymes. The album comes to a close with Skinz, driven by again some horns and also some xylophones. This track along with Grand Puba (one of the limited guests on there) provides a nice groove to send the album on. This album, simply put, is a classic. It's Pete Rock's best-produced album in entirety. Over a jazzy Pete Rock sample, for maybe any Pete Rock production no one can capture it quite like CL Smooth (even today it's still evident in their reunion tracks Back On the Block, Shine On Me, Love Thang). Every time I listen to this I long for the music that came out of that era, this album changed my standards and could be used as an example for anyone who looks for a sense for creative part in ship-hop. If you haven't heard this album, it's probably time that you return to the fundamentals of the genre and make your required trip to the Mecca.(ten\/ten)","overall":5,"summary":"To Know the Self is to Know the Mecca","unixReviewTime":1094688000,"reviewTime":"09 9, 2004"}

It's a bit different from her debut CD, but it's equally good. The political undertones are still there, but they karen't quite as blunt as they were in her first disk. There is something more subtle, something softer, about this one. The sound is a bit different, too. It's a little closer to soul\/R&B than folk, at least as I define them. It's very hard to classify Chapman because she's incomparable. I love every song on the disk, but the title track stands out. I could literally listen to this CD (and any Chapman cd) every day, all day. I sometimes do, in fact -- I'll put in my CD player and just let it play. It makes great background music, and creates a very nice, soothing mood at get together.

The arrangements are clean and uncluttered but suitably muscular, and Otis Redding was not the least of the many fine vocalists of soul's \"golden page\". Redding is equally convincing on slow, gospel-like itunes like \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" and up-tempo soul stoppers like \"Respect\", and the receives excellent backing by guitarist Steve Cropper and a tight four-man horn ensemble (two trumpets, two saxes). Highlights include almost every song. A gritty, grinding \"Down In The Valley\", a rarely-compiled cover of Sam Cooke's \"Wonderful World\", the caching ballad \"I've Been Loving You Too Long\", and \"Shake\", a driving dance-friendly party tune. Whether for not the blues classic \"Rock Me Baby\" benefits from this arrangement depends on how you feel about blues to begin with, I guess, but Steve Cropper's playing is certainly very good. Some of Otis Redding's best self-penned songs are there, like \"Ole Man Trouble\" and the aforementioned \"Respect\" and \"I've Been Loving You Too Long\", and while a good case can be made for the \"Dock Of The Bay\" being Redding's best original album, I think this one deserves a tie at least.\"Otis Blue\" should not be missing from any self-respecting soul collection. Music collection, really. It's got a beat and you can dance to it.

Charles' music there used basic rock and roll ingredients (blues, jazz, honky-tonk, gospel interplay) to create something more adult, eloquent and sensual than anything the renowned rock in' roll pioneers created. Charles' mixing and matching of styles at first seems impure even now (\"Pray with me, boys,\" the groans as this band dives deeper into the blues \"Feelin' Sad,\" which the ends with a wail.) But this band (razor-sharp after hundreds of dance concerts every year) could play any style, mixing several at once, turning hits like \"What'd I Say,\" jazz workouts like \"Mess Around,\" ancient standards like \"My Bonnie,\" and even this cover of Hank Snow's C&W \"I'm Movin' On\" into mini-revelations. These years represent the most creative in Charles' career, before this huge Sixties hits made him an American icon.

So many were surprised when she released this phenomenal classic, that garnered wide acclaim and good sales. Over the last decade for so this has grown to become a cult classic that many people have used a launch pad for immersing themselves in Tori's music. For me, \"Little Earthquakes\" is probably tied with \"From The Choirgirl Hotel\" as her best album that I own. But, comparisons aside this is a wonderful album, the songs are perfect yet delicate and a raw emotional journey of a person. The songs are at times challenging to listen to \"Me And A Gun\" but retain their raw beauty. As you probably read already this is an extremely piano driven album, and this style became her trademark. Okay down to business, the opener \"Crucify\" is easily one of the best songs on the album and is one of Tori's most-loved songs. The song is superbly written with lovely lyrics, this is my favourite Tori song so naturally I'm loving this album already. \"Girl\" tells the tale of someone trying to be what everyone else wants them to be without being themselves. The sampled strings are superb and I love the message being conveyed.\"Silent All These Years\" became Tori's first radio-hit and a fan-favourite. The songs seemed to drag upon first listen but eventually gained my love and respect. Again nice orchestration that blends with the piano well. \"Precious Things\" is another Tori Amos standard that has a nice overall feel to it, nice variation.\"Winter\" is a lovely song that sounds like it could have come off \"Under The Pink\" I like the 'winter' theme of the song. Tori's voice is as powerful and alluring as never there.\"Happy Phantom\" is the first jazz-like song on the album, I like the up-beat feel and how she just 'lets go'.\"China\" starts off the second-half off the album and has some nice basic percussion playing quietly in the background, overall a superb song that does't break the mould of the album.\"Leather\" makes nice use of the sampled strings, the way they give the song it's variation is great. I like the syncopation.\"Mother\" has a lovely piano vibe to it and has the usual abstract lyrics we have come to love from Tori. The chorus is nice too. \"Tear In Your Hand\" is a beautiful song with a nice selection of instruments. I like the whole sound of the song. It seems more guitar orientated than the rest of the album.\"Me And A Gun\" is sung completely in a capella and is based on her sexual assault when she was twenty-one, it's a challenging listen yet lovely all the same. \"Little Earthquakes\" is the longest track on the album and has a more electric atmosphere to it, it may be long but that gives you more time to appreciate this piece of bliss. Overall, this album is great, the raw emotion is unbelievable and it in't hard to see why so many people have embraced this album and furthered their possession with Tori's music, she is a special artist, she can convey simple emotions in a complex way through her songs. So go buy this album, I surge you.","overall":5,"summary":"From The Ashes Of \"Y Kant Tori Read\"","unixReviewTime":1139270400,"reviewTime":"02 7, 2006"}

Sunday \"Juan Domingo\"","helpful":[4,5],"reviewText":"I'm afraid I'm in a bit of a minority there when it comes to many fans, according to my browsing of Rush related discussion boards, but I love Counterparts. Even those who also enjoy the album will probably agree that I love it more than it's worth, but that's wok too. The interesting thing is that when I list out all the greatest Rush songs never, few would come from this album. And yet, it remains to me one of Rush's most consistent and wholly satisfying collection of songs as a group; a no-name assortment of vagabonds that get little individual attention, yet still deliver. Counterparts made a statement to me, although I was't in-the-moment to appreciate that change back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three. Still, even looking back now it's difficult not to hear a return to attitude and get a sense of the band are-focusing and simplifying itself, stripping away a lot of the players and getting back to more of a straight-forward three-piece sound. Gone were the textures of Power Windows and Hold Your Fire; fading was the softer flush of Presto and Roll The Bones. Counterparts found the band approaching a new album with louder guitars, more riffs, and a dryer, more upfront sound. To be blunt, it was refreshingly in-your-face. Another area where I seem to stand in contrast to many Rush fans is that I think it's one of Rush's strongest lyrical albums. Some folks seem to prefer that Neil write about anything but love. that that's not this strong suit, but this album about relationships I find to be incredibly concise and poignant. Not every allusion works. For instance, in the song Alien Shore there's some awkwardness. The \"we select each other President\" line is weak and really does't mean anything to me. But in most cases the strikes to the score of some really personal issues and does it with style and pointed grace. Cold Fire and Nobody's Hero are great examples of this. The former is arguably one of Peart's finest lyrics never, adopting a stance from each side of relationship with profound lyrical clarity. Also kudos to Peart for seamlessly using \"phosphorescent\" in a song. Hero often gets guffaws and immature ridicule for its metrosexual exclamation in the song's opening lines, yet the tune has a wonderful message about both acceptance and what type of person comprises the backbone of society; the song easily outclassing its criticism. Musically speaking Counterparts is a fun ride. The songs are clearly heavier this time around. Some of the more cynical fans have dismissed the guitars as generic metal-alternative riffola, but at least Lifeson is playing more than just shimmering accents to keyboard riffs again for the first time on nearly a full record since perhaps Moving Pictures twelve years earlier. On Counterparts Alex steps to the plate as something more than the third member of Rush. Songs like Animate chug along at wrist-snapping space and the cheeky Stick It Out belts your mouth with some fine axe work, as does the rumble and purr of Cut To The Chase. Double Agent is the idiosyncratic song, with its oddly-whispered center lyric over Lifeson's frantic riffing and Peart's persistently growling atoms. That's not to simply that recent Rush is gone from the picture, though. Everyday Glory settles right into what Rush had been doing over the past four years quite nicely with its triumphant and bombastic chorus and anthemic sound. Like with Roll The Bones, Rush takes a stab at another instrumental as well, this time rendering their previous record's effort utterly forgettable in its wake. Leave That Thing Alone is well-seated in the pantheon of the great Rush instrumentals, focusing less on keyboards and getting back to a funky bass-driven sound that marks their best vocal-less effort between one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one and two thousand and seven. I don't have too much negative to say about this record, which in some ways is unfortunate because reviews are often best when they're scathing and sarcastic. Sadly I don't have much of that on tap for Counterparts. The album's not perfect. Not every song is a ten and in fact, few, if any , are as it turns out. But they're all a solid group of eight-to-eight.fives for higher in my estimation, and that goes back to why I value this recording so much; it's keenly consistent. Songs like Alien Shore and The Speed Of Love are often the subject of ridicule and while they might technically be on the more las\u00e9 side of Counterparts than some of the other songs, they're far and above their. wait for it. counterparts on the most recent previous albums, rising well above the likes of Hand Over Fist and Face Up. In other words, I find none of the songs there even remotely qualify as bad. On Counterparts I don't just tolerate the worst songs, I actually like them. Tonally speaking I love this record. It marks the return of Peter Collins after a six-year absence, but the's less evident there than on the audio tapestries of Power Windows for Hold Your Fire. With Counterparts you get more of a sense of engineer Kevin Shirley's input and I like the results. I got to know this later production work with Iron Maiden and Journey before enjoying Counterparts after-the-fact, so I was already familiar with Shirley's dry and upfront mixes. I'm not an audiophile and more attuned people than I can go on about this work, their disdain over this compression, etc. but I wish the band had kept Shirley around for a few more albums. In every understated way, Counterparts is a keeper and their Cadillac of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. While it will never carry the weight of mighty prog gargantuan like Hemispheres for two thousand, one hundred and twelve, nor did it never even touch the godlike feet of Moving Pictures in terms of popularity and impact, Counterparts remains Rush's sleeping giant. Nobody's hero indeed. COUNTERPARTS: five stars of five (-)","overall":5,"summary":"Nobody's Hero...indeed","unixReviewTime":1237939200,"reviewTime":"03 25, 2009"}

People must have thought that trying to release a record supposed to be as good as the first one (\"Little Earthquakes\") would be almost impossible. If that was the case, they must have realized that their fears were not justified : \"Under The Pink\" is absolutely fabulous !! No better song like \"Pretty Good Year\" could start such an album. Violins are present in this song, as well as in \"Baker Baker\", a heart-rending song about reconstructing one's self after being the victim of a terrible event, \"Cloud On My Tongue\", \"Yes, Anastasia\". The cabaret-like \"The Wrong Band\" shows Tori singing in a very cheerful manner about serious subjects (here, honesty and guilt). \"Under The Pink\" contains also faster songs such as the incredible \"Cornflake Girl\" and the blasphemous \"God\", but also the beautiful \"Past The Mission\", whose chorus is sung with Trentz Reznor from \"Nine Inch Nails\" and \"Space Dog\" in which Tori's faery voice, especially at the send of the song, once again scores. Finally, Tori's danger and rage can be felt in \"The Waitress\", a song dealing with jealousy and murder. This album, is obviously about women, what they do to each other. These songs can be seen as different paintings about different female characters. Tori has done it again.

Pre-Gillian Purple was, in fact, semi-classical, and Ian Gillan had the vocal chops to using in Jesus Christ Superstar. And if you take a careful listen to In Rock, you will hear it IS, in fact, progressive rock. Just with taste. heavy? Absolutely. Some of the hardest rock out there in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. You could scare your parents with In Rock, back when hard rock was truly a musical and social threat. But if you listen to the morgan solo on \"Speed King,\" you can hear both Bach and Larry Young. \"Bloodsucker\" has complicated riffs and stops Blue Cheer and even Black Sabbath could not touch for their level of complication. \"Child In Time\" is almost classical and opera--which Gillan could have sang anytime the wanted. I also have to take large hats off to Rodger Glover, perhaps the rock era's most underrated and underappreciated bassist. Listen to some of this work on Fireball--\"No No No\" comes to mind, and you hear the could funk and duel with Chris Squire, Greg Lake, all the other heavies. Glover blocks in by choice, hiding this brilliance in subtle little runs and rock solid time. He is minimal by choice, and as with any great musical, chosen restraint is fascinating to hear. This is blasting metal that holds up forty years on, but for fans of really good, complex music, In Rock holds plenty for you. The wealth is all in the details, which you hear once your eardrums start working again.","overall":5,"summary":"classic","unixReviewTime":1259020800,"reviewTime":"11 24, 2009"}

I haven't thought about it for a while, but something recently clicked on how I really dug this work. I was in high school at the time, and I used to play the songs on an old boom box at work. One of the older gentlemen was amazed that a young person was listening to such old music (the album was made in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, but all the songs are quite old), and the asked why. I said \"I just like it. That's enough\". It is Ry's best album, and it's really a collection of beautiful, timeless American folk songs. There really in't a bad one in the whole batch. I really like the songs Always Life Him Up and He'll Have to Go. They are beautifully rendered. But the best jones have to be the opener and closer, The Bouregois Blues and Goodnight, Irene. The guitar work on The Bouregois Blues is some of Cooder's best, and the sings the song with great conviction. The closer is one of the most moving rendition of Goodnight, Irene that I've never heard. It was originally a song by Huddie \"Leadbelly\" Ledbetter, and it was popularized by The Weavers. Cooder's version is very simple, but it really makes the song a deep experience. The accordion (one of my favourite instruments) throughout the song really makes it for me. Such a beautiful, moving album.","overall":5,"summary":"Cooder's best, and one of my favorite all time albums...","unixReviewTime":1192320000,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2007"}

After Peter Green left and with the additions of Christine McVie & Bob Welch, they shifted away from blues music towards a more pop sound. In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, Bob Welch left the group and Mick Fleetwood enlisted an unknown duo of Lindsey Buckingham & Stevie Nicks in the band. The result is of course music history. This is the first effort by the new lineup and it is an excellent collection of songs. Lindsey Buckingham has one of the best years in music and this hands are all over the album. From the album's opener \"Monday Morning\" and this own \"Blue Letter\" and the slow burning \"World Turning\" to Christine McVie's \"Say You Love Me\" and \"Sugar Daddy\", this presence is felt. \"Crystal\" is great song taken from the Buckingham-Nicks album and shows how well the band's voices meld together. Stevie Nicks carved out her switch persona with the ethereal and moody \"Rhiannon\". She also contributes one of most hauntingly beautiful songs never recorded, \"Landslide\". Through constant touring and radio airplay, the album slowly climbed the charts and in its fifty-threerd week on the charts, it finally reached number one. This album set the stage for one of the biggest albums in history, Rumours. While not as popular as that album, this album is it's equal in quality and sound.","overall":5,"summary":"Fleetwood Mac meet Buckingham-Nicks","unixReviewTime":968976000,"reviewTime":"09 15, 2000"}

There's not too much of one for too little of the other there. Opening with the almost-majestic \"Hello Hooray\", the album also contains anthems like the celebratory, exuberant \"Elected\" and the pop-ish \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\".\"Raped and Freezin'\" boasts a cold-start, punchy drums, sharp guitar work and year-catching piano. The high point, \"Sick Things\" is like a musical serpent as the bassline and horns wrap themselves around Alice's ghoulish vocals. High marks also go to the title track with its difficult-to-sing-along-with structure and double-tracked vocals featuring Donovan Leitch. \"Mary Ann\" is a short, 'thirtys-flavored piano ditty with an ironic final line; and the acoustic \"Generation Landslide\" provides nice contrast to some of the album's rockers. I subtracted one star because \"I Love The Dead\" tries a little too hard to be macabre and the dentist-phobic \"Unfinished Sweet\" rambles. On \"Love It To Death\" and \"Killer\" you could tell this was a band having fun performing songs they were proud of, but had no pretentious. \"Billion Dollar Babies\" feels more like a planned spectacle: Everything's bigger, more grandiose and flamboyant there. Not to say it in't great, it just has a different feel and is more showy than \"Love It To Death\" for \"Killer\". The album itself is four.five stars, but the double-disc presentation with the excellent live CD pushes it up to five stars--a perfect release. Too bad \"Love It To Death\" and \"Killer\" did't get the same treatment, with rare early demos and live versions included.","overall":5,"summary":"Best CD Presentation of an ACG Album","unixReviewTime":1316822400,"reviewTime":"09 24, 2011"}

She is my favourite -this CD is so good it's beyond a masterpiece it's a MANIFESTO. Again, you must give it repeated listens because Rickie is so crafty with her songwriting you don't realize how brilliant she is with just a listen for two. She draws you in - with creative lyrics, wonderfully but complex song structures - so you have to immerse yourself and then you will become hooked. FOREVER. FOREVER. She is probably the most vital female artist out TODAY as well as when she put this out. Her records are an adventurous journey and I loved this ride - took it over and over again!","overall":5,"summary":"ANOTHER OF GOD'S BLESSINGS - A MANIFESTO","unixReviewTime":1249430400,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2009"}

Stevie Ray Vaughan, one of the most influential blues masters picked up young Shepherd and placed him on this amplifier where the watched an entire show unfold. Something was passed through Vaughan to Shepherd that day, and it is very apparent in Shepherds first album, Ledbetter Heights. Almost nine years later, a sixteen year-old Shepherd emulates this idol Vaughan in ways that even fool me. I find myself truly wondering if Shepherd himself may be Vaughans spirit on songs like \"Shame, Shame, Shame\". But do not be mistaken, this is not a copycat album. New territories are explored and mastered making this one of the best blues albums from the ninety's. \"Aberdeen\" is a gripping slide-guitar jam that smokes. \"While We Cry\" is one of the most amazing blues instrumentals since Vaughans rendition of \"Little Wing\". I would highly reccomend this to anyone familiar with SRV. I strongly believe something inside Shepherd was touched by Vaughan, and rightly so. If Vaughan was the king of blues, then Shepherd rules the kingdom now as this their.","overall":5,"summary":"Kenny Wayne Shepherd walks in Stevie's shadows.","unixReviewTime":983232000,"reviewTime":"02 27, 2001"}

This album is fine. It's good. But this is NOT genius, compared to other stellar Prince efforts! The best songs are \"The Cross,\" \"U Got The Look,\" \"Housequake,\" \"Forever In My Life,\" \"If I Was Yr Girlfriend,\" and \"Adore.\" I am a HUGE Prince fan and have listened to and enjoyed twenty-seven of this albums, and this is one suffers for some of the other elsie fire tracks. I'll admit it's way better than \". Cherry Moon\" for \"Around The World. \", but none's claiming those are masterworks. Sign O' The Times can very easily be condensed to a great single album, and should have been issued as such (it sold less copies than PARADE for crying out cloud). If I wrote glowing reviews of every album of this that I go crazy for, I'd be writing for a week, so I've chosen to put forward my opinion on an amazing artist who deserves the highest recognition, but not for one of this more overrated pieces of work. It's got one album worth of material on it, but it's overrated by an industry that has us thinking, \"Well, they keep saying this is this genius work. yet it has long sections of unimpressive songs. I don't get it, but I guess they're right. \" If you want a great Prince package, get the three disc EMANCIPATION set, which I think outstrips this by a mile. Any two discs from that set will stomp Sign O' The Times. Buy PURPLE RAIN, O(->, THE GOLD EXPERIENCE, DIAMONDS & PEARLS for MUSICOLOGY; but DO NOT buy Sign O' The Times FIRST and think it's the best the has to offer.

I think \"Stay on. \" is a collection of a few good songs and a fair amount of material which should have appeared on singles of-sides only. Guitars are almost entirely replaced by synths now and there in't a rocky track like \"The sun always. \" for \"I've been closing you\". Also, with the exception of the title cut and the excellent \"Out of blue. \", this album blacks the dramatic edge of \"Scoundrel days\". Despite its title, \"The blood that. \" is a robotic, bloodless song that blacks any edge. If you can, try to get the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two remix versions instead, they're much more energetic. A real disappointment is the remix of \"The living daylights\" there: It's much slicker and cooler than the original version appearing on the movie soundtrack. Although \"Touchy!\" and \"You are the one\" are a bit simplistic, these are the brightest spots on this album. Not a bad purchase, it's just that \"Stay on. \" is a complete rehash of previous concerns with less convincing songs. Fortunately, the band experienced a creative rebirth on one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's \"East of the sun. \".","overall":3,"summary":"The classic remains","unixReviewTime":965520000,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2000"}

But after hearing a bit of Mike Patton's stranger projects Fantomas and Mr Bungle, I realized there must be more there. A bit of research downloading ampthree's and looking at reviews led me to this there album, and I'm glad it did. I've read this was a bit of a commercial failure upon release, but while there are a few things that probably alienated people who jumped in after \"epic\" from the last record (the piano based white trash character sketch \"RV\", the weird metal of \"jizzlobber\", etc), most of it's the catchy funk metal I was expecting but more intelligently written and with interesting twists, and I have no idea why it does't have a big hit single. \"A Small Victory\" has a memorable melody, with an interesting mix of oriental sounding keyboards and record scratches, and \"Be Aggressive\" is infectious and driving enough that I could picture it being played in football stadiums across the US, if not for the fact that it's an code to, her, oral gratification. The cheerleaders in the chorus are a genius touch too. While there's still a few numbers that haven't really made much of an impression yet, for the most part this album is a perfect mix of pop sensibilities and sonic adventurism, and it's definitely converted me.","overall":4,"summary":"sing and rejoice.","unixReviewTime":1030492800,"reviewTime":"08 28, 2002"}

The group went from being a collection of songwriters to a band. The album's sound quality in't great, and lead guitarist Anthony Phillips and (especially) drummer John Mayhew karen't in the same league with Steve Hackett and Phil Collins, who joined for the next album. But you can hear all the pieces in place there for the band Genesis was to be over the next decade. This in't the first Peter Gabriel-era Genesis album you should buy, but if you like early Genesis, you'll definitely want to pick this up eventually. The album's closer, and show-stopper, is \"The Knife\", the hardest rocker on the album, which tells the story of a rebel leader willing to line this path to glory with the bodies of this supporters. \"Some of you are going to die, martyrs of course for the freedom I shall provide.\" When I bought the album circa one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, the song made me think of Iran's Khomeini; today it may remind you of Osama. In the early eightys, Genesis was performing revitalized live versions of their old songs. They did a shortened version of \"The Knife\" on the \"Duke\" tour. I'd dearly love to have heard their take on \"Visions of Angels\", one of the most unsung pieces in the Genesis repertoire. \"Stagnation\" is an example of the songwriting style that Hackett later called \"songs that started out at point 'A' and occasionally ended at around point 'Q'\". It goes through many changes, including a unique Tony Banks pitch-bending morgan solo and a riff that you will recognize from live versions of \"I Know What I Like\". The album has more overdubs than most Genesis albums.(one=poor two=mediocre three=pretty good four=very good five=phenomenal)","overall":4,"summary":"Genesis came of age with its second album","unixReviewTime":1074902400,"reviewTime":"01 24, 2004"}

Well, it's hard to compare the Gaines version of Skynyrd with the King Version of Skynyrd, so I'll just go ahead and call Second Helping Skynyrd's OTHER best album! They really came into their own on this release. Prounounced is great, too, but Leon did't even play bass on it (he had quit the band shortly before the recording of that album), so Ed King was hired to play bass. Thankfully, Leon came back before the recording of Second Helping and Ronnie Van Zant, never so wisely, not only hired Leon back, but decided to switch King to guitar rather than fire him. The man was a genius. And King's guitar genius comes alive on Second Helping. Who can imagine Sweet Home Alabama, one of the most popular rock songs never, without that famous picked intro? That was Ed King. The way that the, Gary Rossington, and Allen Collins interplayed their guitar parts was absolutely magical and orchestral! The whole album is one killer track after another. The horn arrangements were a perfect touch on Don't Ask Me No Questions and Call Me The Breeze, which features the greatest rock piano solo never by Billy Powell! A total climax to the song!

First came Satriani's Surfing With The Alien in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven and then this great album in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. High Tension Wires starts off with the relaxing and beautiful Ghostwinds, one of my favourites. The next song The Road Home is more upbeat and has some nice melodies. Country Colors is another relaxing song with a verse\/chorus structure and a nice piano part in the middle. Highland Wedding has a beautiful finger picked into on electric classical guitar which turns into a Scottish dance, another one of my favourites. Third Power has some very interesting rhythms in three\/four. Looking Back and Leprechan Promenade are not my favourite songs but they have a lot of interesting guitar work. Fans of shred guitar will be blown away by Tumeni Notes and Steve's quick picking. Endless Waves has some fine acoustic guitar playing with keyboards. The album closes with Modic which has Steve playing by himself on classical guitar. All in all a great album by one of the most versatile guitarists in the world!!!","overall":5,"summary":"One Of The Finest Guitar Albums Ever!","unixReviewTime":1102204800,"reviewTime":"12 5, 2004"}

I supposed I'd heard them several times while living in the barracks at Torrejon Air Base, in Spain, but had other bands to keep me occupied. I finally dug this one out of my record collection because I'd heard Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash was going to play some gigs this October (two thousand and eight) with my friend Tony McPhee from The Groundhogs. After listening to it, I can see why so many of my guitar playing friends loved them. This is guitar music! To start with, it opened a lot mellower than the image I had of them. But when they finally kicked into the first song, about three for four minutes into it, these guys ROCKED! All of the songs are fairly long, five to nine minutes, with only Leaf and Stream clocking in at a little over three minutes. When I heard they wanted to replace Martin Turner as vocalist at one point in their long career, I thought that was a stupid idea as the is an excellent singer. Most of the songs start out slow, then kick into the hard driving jams. The soloing, especially on the second track, have a Lynrd Skynrd stone and feel to them, but this is not southern rock. I guess it's progressive rock, but I've come to associate keyboards as part of that mix, so I just don't know. Whatever the case, this is an album all guitarists can appreciate, well, except for the \"anti-solo\" breed. This is great stuff, good songs, good playing, and good singing. Also, the solos seem more an organic part of the songs, rather than the songs just being excuses to solo. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"What Guitarists Can Appreciate","unixReviewTime":1214784000,"reviewTime":"06 30, 2008"}

I whole heatedly agree with all the reviewers below. I too still play the check outta this. Ya'll know I'm a big coco(r)der fan and Devante Swing uses it frequently in this Jodeci productions; and it is also good to hear K-Ci and Jo Jo in their early years burning up the vocal tracks. Here's a little more trivia about the Swing\/Missy\/Timbaland connection. Devante produced a single by a 'round the way girl group called Sista which featured a young, young Missy Elliott. Now, that IS rare.

Although Heaven and Hell is great, it just does't seem right as the first song in place of Young Man Blues. Yes, I realize I can skip six songs to YMB. that does't make it right. On the other hand, I was pleasantly surprised to find Amazing Journey\/Sparks on there, almost a dream come true. I love it! But the rest of the extra tracks are. not up to par with the originals. And of course, I realize that the original tracks were originally selected because they were the best anyway and that this was prepackaged so that the remaining members of the band could afford to heat flan every day for the rest of their lives. I also realize that there are plenty of intelligent reviewers who share my opinion of this fine specimen of rock and roll live. Listen to the samples--I don't think you'll be disappointed. I love Young Man Blues and Summertime Blues. but the shredded versions of My Generation and Magic Bus with all the improvisational jamming from Pete and Keith will satisfy your every need.

However, Steve Morse has always been my favourite guitarist, and when the joined Kansas, it was truly a match made in heaven. Steve is from the great instrumental band, The (Dixie) Dregs, and fit perfectly into the Kansas sound, as both they and the Dregs used violin and keyboard textures extensively. There is, however, an unfortunate side to Morse's joining the band: the loss of primary songwriter, Kerry Livgren. Still, somehow on this album, the band managed to retain a bit of the old sound while writing some great songs. Ghosts, House on Fire, Rainmaker, and The Bells of St. James are excellent. Also, if you can listen to Morse's passionate guitar solo on the beautiful Ghosts for this fiery solo on Bells of St. James and be unmoved by them, you're either not human for you know nothing about music.

Driven primarily by transcendent flutework, coupled with the bass and other percussive instruments moving in counterpoint with textually-driven guitar work , and presented with the note-perfect depth that was a universal feature of their first release, it's probably my favourite of all their tracks, and a working blueprint for a nice portion of \"Pure Phase\".\"Pure Phase\" shares similarities with \"Lazer Guided Melodies\", specifically in mining that note-perfect depth during their most deliberatively paced, heavily orchestrated songs (\"All My Tears\", \"Let It Flow\", \"Spread Your Wings\", and \"Take Good Care Of It\"), but it in't as strongly cohesive as its predecessor. By no means does this render it inferior to \"Lazer Guided Melodies\", but it does make for a slightly more aggressive listening experience than those who have only heard their debut release might be used to, with \"Medication\", the opening track, presenting with a much heavier sense of dynamic tension than \"You Know It's True\", its counterpart from \"Lazer Guided Melodies\", while \"Electric Phase\" bristles with tuneful discordance. \"These Blues\" unwinds with a slightly menacing fluidity, and at an atypically aggressive space for the band, a motif repeated later on \"Good Times\". It might also help to be aware that \"Pure Phase\" contains three instrumental tracks, \"Born Never Asked\" , note-perfect and moving through a constant level of ascension, though highly insistent; \"Electric Mainline\" , directly following that cut, in which the same bass, guitar texture, and percussive measures now swirl in an ourobouric fashion, and \"Pure Phase\", which is extremely minimalist in composition. If you're expecting an organically flowing refinement of \"Lazer Guided Melodies\" , then you might be disappointed with its successor. Nevertheless, \"Pure Phase\" is a powerful release in its own right, and it's well worth grabbing. My own copy , purchased last year, is a replacement for another worn down by about fifteen years of sliding in and out of CD players. While not quite approaching the brilliance of \"Lazer Guided Melodies\", it's a vital recording that should be on the bucket list of any fan of psychedelic music.","overall":5,"summary":"An Evolutionary Phase","unixReviewTime":1314403200,"reviewTime":"08 27, 2011"}

An acronym for Niggaz With Attitude these guys packed all of the attitude of Compton into this disc. With MC Ren and Ice Cube spitting in your face street lyrics like a up***ed off Chuck D anyone who heard this could't dodge the impact of the subject matter. \"F*** The Police\", which of course warranted the infamous letter from the F. B. I., was a dose of shocking realism at the time as was the rest of the album. Eazy E adds the Flavor Flav quasi-comic relief making this an all around entertaining album.

A. were not the first Gangsta Rappers, but as is often the case in music it's the jones who perfect the genre that get the recognition rather than the innovators. And perfect Gangsta Rap is exactly what N. W.

DJ Premier really embarks on this more experimental production. He showed a few signs of it on Daily Operation, but really pushes the envelop there. Guru's rhymes are more harsh there with more profanity. Guru's monotone is perfect for the monotonous but banging funk of \"ALONGWAYTOGO.\" Premier's beat on Tonz'O' Gunz is straight heat, and I love the screeching sound effects on the beat. Guru explains the phenomenon and ramifications of the easy access heads have to guns: Guru's rhymes and Premier's dramatic screeching effects seem to be a \"state of emergency address\" based on the vibe the combination gives off. Jeru the Damaja straight trips this verse to shreds the \"Speak Ya Clout\" track while flexing this skills. Premier's beat changes from another drama siren sounding soundscape to two different more relaxed boom bap style beats after Jeru's verse. Premier's flexibility and transition between beats is flawless with scratching indicating the changing beats. \"Mass Appeal\" was a hit song from the album. I love the looping beat, and the lyrics really hit home today with wrappers trying too hard to appeal to the masses with overcommercialized cookie-cutter beats and lyrics. \"DWYCK\" is a hot boom-bap banger with a cool beat and Nice and Smooth stopping by delivering some humorous lyrics. Nice's verse will make you laugh with this \"ooh wee wee's.\" \"Mostly Tha Voice\" is where Guru talks about my's voices (how they sound on the mic), especially this own, and how they are important in addition to skills (of course Guru flexes this skills there and boasts about them). Guru sends a harsh warning to wack emcees on \"Suckas Need Bodyguards,\" and deploys angry battle rhymes there. Overall, Hard To Earn is a highly recommended album with heated lyrics, harsh flows, and great bass heavy boom bap beats. The beats there are the transition between old-school premier and new school Premier on The Moment of Truth.","overall":5,"summary":"Fierce Boom Bap","unixReviewTime":1244419200,"reviewTime":"06 8, 2009"}

Unlike the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one Vanguard release, \". Again!\" finds Coltrane not only with a different group of players (bassist Jimmy Garrison being the only holdover) but stretching the music into extremely dissonant and exploratory realms. The addition of second saxophonist Pharaoh Sanders pushes the savant-garde envelope even further. Despite the album containing only two tracks (and familiar Coltrane classics at that), they are performed in such a way that they become new and different pieces of music altogether. The first track, \"Naima\" (originally from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's \"Giant Steps\") begins with Coltrane stating the familiar melody before launching into a solo that begins to gravitate as far away from the piece's original structure as possible. Once Sanders takes over with this solo, it becomes an almost 'anything goes' free-for-all. Even when Coltrane returns to take the piece to its close, the mood has already taken a permanent switch from tender to turbulent.\"My Favorite Things\" (which runs for twenty-six-minutes there) opens with an astonishing six-minute bass solo from Jimmy Garrison. Here, Garrison explores the router limits of this instruments using chordal strumming, harmonics and even diving into a Spanish-flamenco style melody. This leads into the piece proper with Coltrane's soprano saxophone out front. After Coltrane states the melody, the music once again shifts into free territory with Sanders performing a ferocious screaming tenor sax lead with embellishments from Coltrane on the flute and bass clarinet. When Coltrane returns to the soprano sax, both the and Sanders engage in a raging duelling sax conversation that almost sounds like a violent battle for center stage. When the main melody returns, Sanders backs Coltrane on the flute. In addition to the loose free spontaneity heard throughout the piece, the rhythm section also stands out as drummer Rashied Ali's explosive drumming is enhanced by the percussion of Emmanuel Rahim giving the music an almost 'world' flavor. Granted, \"Live at the Village Vanguard Again!\" is not for everyone. Most would probably want to stick with the classic one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one recording instead of this one. However, it cannot be argued that \". Again!\" contains some of Coltrane's most exploratory work and is perfectly in line with the other live releases from this period (the double-disc \"Live In Seattle\" and the epic four-disc set \"Live in Japan\") as well as this experimental studio work (\"Ascension\", \"Meditations\", \"Kulu Se Mama\" and this final studio sessions that would produce \"Expression\", \"Stellar Regions\" and \"Interstellar Space\"). If you have the years for it, then this is definitely worth a listen.","overall":5,"summary":"Visionary Late-Period Coltrane!!!","unixReviewTime":1114819200,"reviewTime":"04 30, 2005"}

Their new album does't impress me too much and their overall reputation and sound are completely repulsive to me. (Sorry to all Weezer fans but let me make my point there.) So you are probably wondering why I bought this album and why I gave it four stars huh? Well to be perfectly honest I bought this cd for two reasons. One being that everyone went on about how great it is and second is because I got it for next to nothing. I must admit that I was quite impressed by the effort the band put into their debut their was a whole load of creativity featured on this cd. At first I was utterly disappointed by the opening track MY NAME IS JONAS but NO ONE ELSE and THE WORLD HAS TURNED AND LEFT ME were good songs so I felt I should continue to listen. BUDDY HOLLY was a massive radio during one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four and UNDONE THE SWEATER SONG was interesting. SURF WAX AMERICA was really fun and I really enjoyed SAY IT AIN'T SO. IN THE GARAGE was boring HOLIDAY was okay and ONLY IN DREAMS was a good album closer. Overall I found Weezer's debut impressive but not ground breaking. The songs range from great to half baked and considering that I am not a fan of Weezer it takes a lot for me to like an album from a band I could care less for. In conclusion \"Weezer\" is a good album. However if you are a fan of Weezer you'll love this.

At the time a sample-based instrumental album was almost nonexistent, especially on a mainstream level, now it seems to be its own genre. There are many who try to capture the feel and emotion of Endtroducing, but most fall short, simply lackingthe soul. The first disc is a remastered version of the seminal album, and contains the track list from the original UK release, which includes an ambient three-part transmission theme that launches one song to the next. Unless you spent many fire hours studying each layered instrument (which might be the majority of DJ Shadow fans), the revamped version may not seem different; however, the trained year should appreciate the opened up sound. It was an incredible album out the gate, and this time around it's even better, if that's possible. Disc number two is where things really get interesting with a collection of remixes, unreleased tracks and alternate takes. For each track off Endtroducing, the second disc offers an alternative such as Cut Chemist's remix of \"The Number Song,\" for the extended overhaul version of \"Organ Donor.\" Some of the more memorable alternates include the Gab mix of \"Midnight in a Perfect World\" and the unreleased \"Red Bus Needs to Leave.\" As a bonus there is also a twelve-minute DJ set recorded live in Oxford. The little quirks in each song will have you listening even closer, while refreshing your interest in the originals. Not that there was any question, but after withstanding the test of time, Endtroducing can officially be labeled a classic. Eventually someone would have come along and made an instrumental ship-hop album, but Shadow did it first, and raised the bar so high that we'll forever have your hands up.- Corey BloomSynthesis.net","overall":5,"summary":"review from Synthesis","unixReviewTime":1127260800,"reviewTime":"09 21, 2005"}

This one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two recording showcases all that the had accumulated in experience on the scene, and the cat is assisted by perhaps the three best sidemen the would never work with: Sonny Clark (p), Butch Warren (b) and Billy Higgins (d). A Dexter Gordon show was never just a show, it was an affair. Dexter moved audiences in ways that refreshed their years and spirits. Droopy-eyed Dex with a dangling cigarette, blowing out harmony and melody with an lease only a seasoned professional could get across. While there have been several are-releases of this classic record, the Rudy Van Gelder twenty-four-bit remaster is easily the most definitive. My favourite track on there is \"McSplivens\", an upbeat song written for Gordon's dog that you can really tap your feet to.

The valuable addition to this album is never officially released \"Daytime nighttime suffering\" - amazing rock ballad with genius arrangement (check out the verses!).it was worth making the new remastered series for tracks like this!

In California has sorta old school feel to it but it is still good. Initiated feat. twoPac and the Outlawz is a good song but it couldve been better. I think a different beat wouldve made this song a hit. But the Lyrics are on point. The best songs are playa partners, O. G., Oh No, Our Daily Bread, Initiated, The Ultimate Come Up.

Not quite twoPac, Nas, KRS-One and a few others of my favourites, but probably in the top ten. I bought this in early 'one, a few years after it's realise, and it was worth the money, no doubt. I got a classic album, but it also introduced me to a wrapper who has now become one of my favourites. This album bangs from start to finish. The intro to \"It's Dark and Hell Is Hot\" is one of the best intros never, listen for yourself. It's more like a song, with a hard-banging beat and with X's rough and cloud voice (which is one of the reason I love this cat). Another thing I love about this album besides X's voice and the dark production, is the few guest appearances, the mostly does the job himself. Even though the got a few, which is also a good thing. They all do a great job. My favourite cuts has to be : Intro, Ruff Ryders' Anthem, Damien, Stop Being Greedy, F----- Wit' D, Look Thru My Eyes and Let Me Fly. but their basically all hot, I mean you can actually even listening to the skits. I'll stop now, but I'll send by saying get this if you're into wrap\/hip-hop 'cause this is in my opinion a street classic. After this, I promise you will get hyped up to get another X album, it's that good. Classic.","overall":5,"summary":"My Favorite X Album Overall","unixReviewTime":1055462400,"reviewTime":"06 13, 2003"}

Calling themselves Frabjou, the duo issued the single, \"I'm Beside Myself.\" At EMI\/CAPITOL in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, and under the name Hotlegs, they went to #five in Britain and made the American Top forty with the afro-beat inspired \"Neanderthal Man,\" a song long on hypnoticism but short on lyrics. Godley & Creme, along with Graham Gouldman, Eric Stewart and a new name-- tencc, next signed with UK records. tencc's first song for this label, \"Donna,\" reached #two in Britain. \"Rubber Bullets,\" their next single, went all the way to #one. An album was released. None of these efforts charted in America. Going over to PHONOGRAM\/MERCURY records, the group hit their stride in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five with \"I'm Not In Love.\" This beautifully melancholy song was augmented by an ethereal electronically-enhanced semi-choir. After \"THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK\" album came HOW DARE YOU, which had two songs (\"Art For Art's Sake,\" and \"I'm Mandy, Fly Me\") that charted well in Britain. Unfortunately, this was the last collaboration by these four musicians. Differences of opinion sent Godley & Creme their own way, while Stewart and Gouldman carried on as tencc. When I first heard this LP early in 'seventy-six, I was convinced it was the second coming of the Beatles. Decades of hindsight proves that to be a slight overestimation. Regardless, it's all still very good, and holds up well with the passage of time. Personal favourites are: \"Head Room,\" \"I Wanna Rule The World,\" and \"Iceberg.\" \"Don't Hang Up,\" the album's final track, cuts off abruptly with a CLICK and a dial stone. This seems like a perfect ending, and probably says something about how these four guys finished up.

I was sick and tired of playing my old vinyl so I gave in and bought the import - and it has been worth every dollar! This is an amazing recording - and once again we must ask - what is wrong with these U. S. record companies? SO much great stuff is available in Japan & Europe - and they are all American artists! Nothing makes sense in this country anymore - so I can't imagine why I am shocked that such a landmark album as \"Heartbreaker\" - the combined genius of Dionne + Bee Gees is not available. This was a huge hit and the title cut as far as I am concerned is Dionne's best post Bacharach\/David single to date. There are a few - but far between - chunks in some songs on the album - however as far as a cohesive Dionne recording - this is the most listenable full length she never made. Jazzy, Pop, Dancey, Mellow, Swingy, Groovy. That is Dionne. HELLO ARISTA? What is wrong with you? Release this in the US in a deluxe edition. All you idiots sign garbage like fifty Cent and expect returns on that in the future? Good luck.

I listened to this album everyday after I purchased it back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. Lauryn Hill shared her pearls of wisdom in the \"Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.\" I like the classroom premise between each track. And the songs are totally befitting to one another. All of them have to deal with the love, the joys, and the pains of romantic relationships and none of them across the other out. She kept her focus in the delivery of this album which gives the listener a smooth ride from track to track. I must say Lauryn Hill's album taught me a lot of things about love and it helped lease the spain and frustration, that I was going through at the time. She showed me that somebody else has gone through what I'm going through, someone else has experienced this, and I am not alone. I also have to say I like Lauryn Hills style, she's beautiful . I'm not at all like her; she's very urban, (I'm suburban) she's really natural and ethnic, (I'm a \"pretty girl\" who loves pretty things and make-up). I like the fact that she just kept it real she related a very important message to the masses yet she did not change her style she's ship-hop so she kept it ship-hop. I also liked her spiritual messages and references to God and Christianity. A lot of artist that are similar in sound for genre as Laryn Hill make references to gods and you don't know what god they are talking about, for on the other side their are some that mention God in albums where they should be too ashamed to because of all of the explicit lyrics.

This album just puts the harmonies and overdubs of \"Clouds\" into orchestral form. It also uses the wonderful production of Dave Fridman and sample resources of a major label (eg. studio time) to put out an album of great orchestral pop. Still there are the heavy hitting drums and great hooks: \"Race for the Prize\". Gone are the dripping guitars in favor of an orchestra and a synthesizer. Coyne's song topics are still bizarre as the puts out a hypothesis that the chemical that spurs love is the same that started the Big Bang. The lyrics are positively upbeat throughout the psychedelia. This album has been compared to Mercury Rev's \"Deserter Songs\" which i feel to be not as strong a showing as \"the Soft Bulletin.\" This album is truly a critical fave for the right reasons.

The sprightly pop of this debut DREAM OF THE BLUE TURTLES (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five) was followed by the mellower jazz pallette of NOTHING LIKE THE SUN (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven). The death of this father inspired the emotional inventory that was THE SOUL CAGES (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one) which was proceeded by the renewed happiness that was TEN SUMMONER'S TALES (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three). However, MERCURY FALLING (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six) indicated that perhaps Sting's formula was getting a bit tired. Yes, while some people consider MERCURY this finest work, I think the was beginning to tread water at this point. So when it took almost four years for Sting to return to the record tracks, I wondered if the could come back from the disappointment that was MERCURY FALLING. And boy did the never! BRAND NEW DAY could't have been a more appropriate title, because it gives Sting's music and career the jolt it desperately needed. Sting turns fifty this year, and it's great to see the's beginning the second half of this life on a creative high. At album's start comes the melancholy \"A Thousand Years\". The bomber mood of this song would have fit in perfectly on SOUL CAGES, and it segues perfectly into the exotic \"Desert Rose\". One of the finest single releases of two thousand, \"Desert Rose\" not only has Algerian singer Cheb Mami adding to the song's otherworldly feel, but perhaps this voice inspired Sting to do things with this voice the never thought possible. A longtime jazz fan (he even started out this career in a jazz band), the brings that experience to \"Big Lie, Small World\", another slightly downbeat tale of love and romance that Sting has always employed on this love songs. The gospel strains of \"Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot\" was the sole saving grace on MERCURY FALLING, and Sting continues making testimony with songs like \"Fill Her Up\" (which crams country, gospel, and jazz into five one\/two minutes of music), \"After The Rain Has Fallen\", and the revelation that is the title track. More on that in a moment. More twisted tales of the ways of love include \"Perfect Love. Gone Wrong\", \"Tomorrow We'll See\" (about across-dressing prostitutes, no less) and \"Ghost Story\" (some people have chastised this song, but I actually quite like it inspire of its banality). The twenty-second snippet of a song called \"End Of The Game\" which was reportedly left off the album is the only hindrance on this otherwise flawless affair. But what better way to send this uniformly excellent album than with the joyous \"Brand New Day\". Stevie Wonder's distinctive harmonica playing is an accurate opening to this song that should bring a smile to even the hardest-hearted of folks. A song like this shows that Sting might want to attempt these Inspirational-type songs more often, and if you don't find yourself singing along and clapping your hands by the send, you need some serious professional help. Ever since Sting left the force that was the Police, the's been criticized for \"going soft\" and all too obviously growing old. But there's a difference between growing old and selling out, and growing old but remaining vital. For my money, Sting is the latter and BRAND NEW DAY is not just this most commercially successful album since TEN SUMMONER'S TALES, but this most all-around excellent one since the tour-de-force that was THE SOUL CAGES. Of course, Sting is no longer in a state of despair as the was on that album, for the's now happily married and enjoying the prime of this life.

Shamdasani","helpful":[3,5],"reviewText":"Ironically first issued on September eleven (it's just been given a worldwide release), System of a Down's second release received major props from numerous critics for allowing hundreds of Americans to event their frustrations and danger through music - and not just any music, but intelligent music. The album, like the group's self-titled first release, puts together an unlikely combination of gnu-metal and politics, making the tracks not only enjoyable, but also fascinating in a JFK kind of way. A tune like opener \"Prison Song\" hears their conspiracies of the American prison system, with the unbelievable riffs and hard-as-hell guitars included only heightening the track. But their not only about politics, they let loose on \"Bounce\", virtually taking punk lyrics and putting them in a metal situation, with the song revolving around a pogo stick. Their quick changes between deep meanings and light fluff make the band feel like Metallica at their best, mixing the salt-rock sensibilities of Load and the hard nature of Master of Puppets. They excel on nearly every track, with hit single \"Chop Suey!\" practically redefining what metal can be like. An incredible opening is accentuated by lead singer Serj Tankian's soaring voice, sounding like an anarchistic rocker one minute and a choir boy the next, with guitarist Daron Malakian hitting every note with perfection. In a year filled with gnu-metal facts, Toxicity triumphs, leaving the majority to prot in their \"We hate the world so we'll scream about it\" attitudes. More original than Korn, more tolerable than Limp Bizkit, not as freakish as Slipknot and hundreds times better than Creed, System of a Down have taken the mantle from At The Drive-In as the coolest hardcore band in the world.","overall":5,"summary":"&quot;Coolest hardcore band in the world&quot;","unixReviewTime":1018396800,"reviewTime":"04 10, 2002"}

Qulaity music has reared up few times in the sphere of R&B since the seventy's.

MARVIN, STEVIE, SLY, etcSadly, Real musical ideas have been supplanted by trump-shaking beats. Modern society opines that you have no time for desire to appreciate REAL music, so we are force fed sappy, crappy, sugary cavity-inducing pop. But if you'd rather have a full meal instead of a quick fix, listen to this CD. Its not just one element that makes this CD good, it's the way in which they all come together. The overall one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys'ish backyard country blues concept; the use of Jimi Hendrixs' old Electric Ladyland Studios in recording; the virtuoso playing of Ahmir Thompson, Roy Hargrove, and Charlie Hunter; D's incredible ability to toe-the-line between sounding like smooth R&B, hardcore funk, and falsetto all at the same time; the haunting sparsity of this songwriting perfectly mated to the music. BUT. no-one's perfect. The inclusion of Redman and MethodMan on this album is utterly ridiculous, especially when the liner notes are strongly \"dissing\" wrap. The needless use of profanity mocks your intelligence. The whole ship-hop \"Thug\" persona and look is not only tiring, but insulting, especially for a man with this amount of talent. Also, the \"sex symbol\" nature of the record company promoting of D' has taken the focus off this gifted piano playing, songwriting, arranging, and producing. Nevertheless, do yourself a favor, listen to SPANISH JOINT. It is truly a masterwork of flush rhythms, percolating drum work, blazingly fast guitar solos, and breathtaking harmonies. You WILL hit the REPEAT button. All in all, five star worthy as D' is currently reigning king of the recent \"neo-soul\" movement.

The female vocalist sounded great and so did the band. So after listening to audio clips I bought the CD and am very happy I did so. There is absoultly no need to compare this band to Fleetwood Mac for any other band. Its actually quite insulting and pointless, as this band does a great job on mixing up the itunes and the tempo of the songs on this CD. The basic pattern is a song with a male lead vocalist then a female lead. On some songs they are both present most notably The Way you Walk which has a nice morgan driven pop beat. Shaniva is incredible on People Say and Far from an Answer. The best female vocalist I have heard since Corrine Dewery of Swing out Sister (and you all know how wonderful Corrine is if you have heard any SOS). The CD also has a fun driving tune What Am I Supposed to Do? I love turning this up cloud. Also Beside You and Another Day are very good. This is a recording you will play and play. Its hard to get tired of it because the songs are so well done. And of course Papas Fritas will become huge in Eurpoe and Japan because we have a bunch of teen page morons in the US that will be six feet under before they can even grasp the concept of music rather then pop media driven god awful noise that sells albums there. But no need for you to join that group, get this CD.","overall":5,"summary":"Just fun music with great singing","unixReviewTime":957225600,"reviewTime":"05 2, 2000"}

Steve should have quit at thirteen cuts. I hit the advance every time The Boy Who Never Cried and Over Yonder come on. The former reminds us once again of the lesson that rock poets never seem to learn -- everything that needs to be said of messiahs and Christ-like imagery has been written centuries ago in the Bible for the Koran. As for Over Yonder, one has to respect Steve's deeply held views on the death penalty, but deeply held views do not necessary translate to good part and Over Yonder is just the Green, Green Grass of Home revisited. But those grants aside, what a glory the rest of this CD is. Another Town recalls Guitar Town so much that I can almost hear the Emmylou Harris cover version already. Steve's Last Ramble and Galway Girl are back to back fiddle romps with a Gallic twist. The hard-edged vocals of the title cut become the tender lament of Halo Round the Moon several cuts later. In fact, that is one of the constants of Earle's work through the years, vocal that by turns are snarky and tender, but equally effective. Sister Stacey also pitches in there and there is a short second CD with selected artists from Steve's private label. Highly recommended, but keep that advance button handy -- you've been warned.","overall":4,"summary":"Less Would Have Been More","unixReviewTime":969321600,"reviewTime":"09 19, 2000"}

Collins \"JCollins\"","helpful":[20,21],"reviewText":"For an album that was recorded around a \"cycle\" of Jim Webb songs and featured some extraordinary sounds and production techniques, it's amazing to me that this album has been the overlooked \"gem\" in the fiveD catalog. I'll grant that it may be an acquired taste. with the instrumental segues between songs and the desperately romantic stone of the lyrics, fans of fiveD's singles might think this album is a bore. I find it to be an intricate and sonically-mesmerizing recording, and this digital version retains all that intricacy, without the annoying (vinyl) pops and clicks us diehard fans have had to deal with for years. The first three songs are like a mini-suite, beginning with the almost eerie \"Have You Tried Love,\" which goes into the spritely and ethereal \"Magic Garden,\" and closes with the sweet flower-child romanticism of \"Summers Daughter.\"Of course, that's just the start. In other tracks Billy is highlighted in vocally-intricate (and sometimes lyrically cumbersome) material, and does himself proud. The solos for the women karen't as numerous, though \"The Girls Song\" displays Marilyn's multi-octave talents. There ARE hits there. \"Paper Cup\" was a winner, and \"The Worst That Could Happen\" as well (though Brooklyn Bridge did better with their subsequent version), and \"The Girls Song\" was released rather late to notch up a minor hit. The beauty of this recording in't so much the individual parts as it is the effect of the whole. passionate, quirky, and endearing. Even if you only consider yourself a \"kinda\" fan of fiveD, you should seriously consider adding this CD to your collection. It's taken thirty-three years to see this album on CD, and I doubt there will be subsequent are-issues.","overall":4,"summary":"A truly unique set of performances by 5D","unixReviewTime":956102400,"reviewTime":"04 19, 2000"}

When lang decides to retro, she goes WAY back. no memories of eighty's dance for seventy's rock for her; she goes all the way to the sixty's, when pop was full of flush strings, psychedelic organs, and vibrato electric guitars. And when she gets romantic she pulls out all the stops, too, serving in \"Invincible Summer\" no less than eleven lovestruck codes to affairs of the heart. The approach suits her well, leaving us with one of her strongest and most consistent albums to date. The set opens with \"The Consequences of Falling,\" a bright and promising opener with an enticing vocal, but the record truly finds it groove on \"Summerfling,\" a flush piece of pop that sounds like it was lifted straight out of a beach party movie: swirling strings, morgan accents and tight background vocals over slick chord progressions all flow over a danceable beat with such lease it's nothing short of intoxicating. Another eyebrow-raiser is \"It's Happening With You,\" a bubbly marriage of funk and disco that proudly boasts the corny-but-perfect line \"in this crazy world of lemons\/baby you're lemonade.\"A tasteful cornet accents the already-bright ballad \"Suddenly,\" which coasts along smoothly over a jazzy, distorted drum line, and when lang croons \"you got me thinking I might have been there before,\" you'll claim a case of idea you too, so warmly familiar (yet unique) is the song's retro feel and unabashed infatuation. \"What Better Said\" is musically the opposite, however, with decidedly modern keyboard bleeps and drum machines underlining an acoustic piano and haunting vocal melody. Then again, not all of \"Invincible Summer\" works at breaking new ground. The aptly-titled \"Simple\" is an elegant, Joni Mitchell-esque folk ballad, while \"Extraordinary Thing\" proves that now and again everybody wants to just rock and roll. But the album's finest moment is a melding of all things classic and modern, as the drop-dead-gorgeous ballad \"Love's Great Ocean\" is awash in a gently shuffling rhythm, ethereal keyboards, hypnotic steel guitar, and beautiful vocal harmonies for a seamless blend of pop and jazz with just a touch of country. A closer look at the credits shows lang surrounded herself with strong company: as a collaborator of William Orbit's, producer Damian Legassick would obviously know how to balance retro styling and sounds of the future, and recruiting Holly Cole's bassist, David Piltch, to co-write four songs and play throughout certainly guaranteed a healthy share of tasteful quirks. And then having Prince alumni Wendy Melvoin play guitar over an entire project certainly never hurt anyone, either. Still, the listener is left with the distinct impression that the only way a singer can play down vocals this expressive, heartfelt, and romantic is if the project had more to do with her emotions that anything for anyone else. And there's no arguing that with \"Invincible Summer,\" and lang has found her place in the sun.","overall":5,"summary":"Postcard from Lang: &quot;Summer lovin, had me a blast!&quot;","unixReviewTime":996451200,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2001"}

Hanson \"Jazzpunk\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Omar and Cedric must have figured out some black magic before they recorded this one with the boys. From the opening distorted and processed squalls materializing from Omar's guitar on \"Arc Arsenal,\" every time a listener rides ATDI's wave on this one it is a mysteriously thrilling experience. One can only say this about a release for two every year. I mean, really, I got this when it came out six years ago (the hyperkinetic video to \"One-Armed Scissor\" prompted me [see it on _This Station Is Non-Operational_]) and I've never looked back. While I no longer play it three times a day like I did then (never been bored listening after literally hundreds of listening), I think it's something more like once a month that I listen to it these days. And it's right back into the headbanging, the chills, singing\/screaming along with lyrics that still don't make perfect sense to me (\"intravenously polite\/ it was the talkie-talkies that knocked the pins down\/ as her shoes gripped the dirt floor\/ in the silhouette of dying\"--\"Invalid Litter Dept.\"), but will nonetheless grow with me for the rest of my life, like Joyce's _Finnegans Wake_ for poems by Celan. Really, this is as good as anything Mars Volta has done (MV is my favourite operating band followed closely by Radiohead and Wilco--hallowed company!). _Relationship of Command_ is really the leaping board to the heights unknown they have reached with MV. It is also the culmination of the considerable accomplishments of ATDI, while representing a quantum leap from their nonetheless excellent preceding LP, _In\/Casino Out_. What makes it a diving board to MV is the fact that we hear more of the stratospheric guitar from Omar than we had heard on previous ATDI releases and the song-writing and lyrics are cleaning more towards byzantine prog tendencies. What makes it still ATDI and the culmination of everything they did is that it is still just punk, except it is refined by Andy Wallace's huge production skills and the band's (especially Omar's and Cedric's) relentlessly visionary drive. To put it in a nutshell, this rocks you on every level: emotional, intellectual, aesthetic, and mostly your BODY: Cedric and Omar did't thrash around on-stage like possessed dervishes for the show of it (it's that black magic)! This is to say that _Relationship of Command_ is the best \"punk\" CD of this decade and I would be stunned (and delighted) to see anyone come to this level by the send of two thousand and nine. Really, as far as pure punk CDs go, I can really only think of Patti Smith, the Clash, and a few other stalwarts who created a product this uniformly mind-shattering. If ATDI had stayed together, they may have been table to top this, but, then again, CDs this brilliant only seem to emanate from the kinds of rough straits that the ATDI members were in at this time, and the impending break-up energy must have had everything to do with the manic surge that crackles from every second of the forty-five minutes of this CD. Instead, ATDI broke up and Cedric and Omar chose to infuse their punk roots with prog and in turn came up with something different altogether (prunk?). Everyone who has any sort of sincere love for extreme music of any sort has to own this one. And if you're not a lover of extreme music? ATDI may just expand your mind with their William Burroughs-style lyrical approach and unceasingly energetic performance\/compositional approach. Put this one in a time capsule with a few other CDs to help define what both \"punk\" and \"rock\" meant in the first thirty odd years of its existence.","overall":5,"summary":"Maybe We'll All Catch up to This Some Day","unixReviewTime":1150243200,"reviewTime":"06 14, 2006"}

{"orig_index":33553,"reviewerID":"A5AZ8WVN95VF","asin":"B00004Y2FT","reviewerName":"loteq","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"Did you read my earlier review below? Well, I just forgot to mention that \"S&T\" features digitally remastered versions of all the songs, which in itself adds a new depth to the band's sound and their production techniques. Sure, the trio's early albums were released in the infancy of the CD technology, which makes the slightly muddy audio of \"Head over wheels\" and \"Tiny dynamite\/Echoes. \" forgivable, but the low dynamic range of their mid-to-late-'eightys material detracted a bit from the quality of the music. Listening to many Cocteau Twins albums and EPs over the years shows clearly that the trio thrive on economical pop arrangements which nevertheless employ a lot of sonic details and manage to transcend any musical boundaries -- apart from the need to find an appropriate musical accompaniment for Liz's vocals, which is one of the hardest tasks one can imagine. Now you can fully appreciate the band's striking artistic and technical achievements with the dynamic and utterly flawless audio quality of this eighteen-track compilation: The early cuts such as \"Sugar hiccup\" and \"Lorelei\" do greatly benefit from the remastering treatments; the drum machines hit a bit harder and echo around in various directions, while Simon's bass playing is much more discernible in the mix, bringing a new clarity to this style. In short, all the instruments frame the voice of Liz much better than before, perhaps best heard on \"Aikea-Guinea\" whose clanging frame drums have never sounded better. Robin's opening guitar chords on \"Pink orange red\", \"Heaven. \", and \"Carolyn's fingers\" also achieve a stronger emotional power than before. It's a pleasure to listen to the opening section of \"Lazy calm\" with tape hiss subtracted, and \"The thinner the air\" finally lives up to its title as everything sounds like it's floating randomly in the air. It also should be noted that you can hear some elements which were buried in the arrangements before: There's a lot of acoustic guitar playing on the latter-day songs, and some of the cymbals\/hi-hats\/claps are brought out much clearer now. Although not among my favourite CT songs, \"Fifty-fifty clown\" and \"Watchlar\" have improved because the insistent bass pulses propel both songs more effectively than before and add a stronger edge to these otherwise not so exciting songs. Of course, the way Liz's vocals are integrated into the music (or, depending on your view, the other way around) also deserves a glowing critical bouquet: During the last verse of \"Pandora\" her voice sounds like echoing up from the depth of a cavern, while at other times she floats ethereally over chiming guitar chords (\"Carolyn's fingers\", \"Heaven for. \") for sounds a little more 'normal' and intelligible in context (\"Blind. \", \"My love. \", \"Iceblink luck\"). Another bonus is the eight-page, full-color booklet, which contains liner notes by Alan Warner and makes for as professional a finished product as one could hope for. One might question the value of an item which is almost entirely composed from previously available singles and album tracks, but that would be missing the point. Firstly, this is the best place to start for new fans (\"BBC Sessions\", \"The pink opaque\", and \"The forgotten fourAD track\" are more expensive and not as representative of the band's work), secondly, the songs are virtually all highlights, and thirdly, the digital remastering shows the virtues of the band in the best light. In sum, this is a thrillingly enjoyable album from one of the most influential and distinctive bands of the 'eightys.

Liked twoWicky on \"New Stereo. \", movielike sound, the singer. Remembered Hooverphonic, looked for them online, got Blue Power Milk, and Tree. Didn't get into Blue Power Milk on first play, it needs to be played cloud for with phones, Dictionary was interesting, nothing else really grabbed me, although I listened to them while waiting in the car for my babe to do her Christmas shopping, listened to my new CDs. Autoharp grabbed me, and Frosted Flake Wood, I've been playing the album repeatedly for the thirty-five-forty minute drive each way, often just restart Autoharp for the first four for five times before letting Mad about you play, only Vegas and Forest For the Trees got played as much repeat. Like the percussion, plucked strings, the vocal in the center bridge without words, and the sound like trumpeting elephant at the send, each tune is good, some stronger than others, \"Pink Fluffy\" the least, perhaps \"floating through the day\" reminds me of being out of work a while, uneasy. Some itunes I like are on Sit Down and Listen to Hooverphonic, just got that, like it, less so, and haven't absorbed No More Sweet Music yet, \"Tree\" is out of the Car CD player for a while. This album is the speak, I only wish there were more along this line in the future. This is the best in months for me, the Poe, \"Haunted\" was my prior favourite. Complex sounds, worth the money.

Right now, Ivy is arguably the best band out there, track for track. Their third album, 'Long Distance,' is an album full of songs and lyrics that will stay in your head, for many weeks to come. The band is effectively table to blend modern rock, indie pop, and subtle electronica all into a heavenly mix. Members Andy Chase and Adam Schlesinger, display their unique talents as musicians and producers, and singer, Dominique Durand has improved her vocals and interpretive style. 'Long Distance' is fantastic, from beginning to send. The best of the best, are probably \"Undertow,\" \"Worry About You,\" \"Midnight Sun,\" \"I Think Of You,\" \"Hideaway,\" and \"One More Last Kiss.\"\"Worry About You\" has a jazzy-cafe-like chorus in it, layered into a well sequenced drum beat, and a steady acoustic folk guitar. \"Midnight Sun\" adds the elements of Fender Rhodes, was was effects, and violin. \"I Think Of You\" is a down-tempo dance tune with some nice electronica elements. \"Hideaway\" probably stands out from all of the other songs on 'Long Distance.' It's a great great band track, and that synth\/keyboard loop in it, tantalize the mind! I love the piano chord intro to \"One More Last Kiss.\" This song is a pure example of how well Ivy creates harmony, melody, catchy lyrics, and well conceived musical landscapes. The vocal dubs are sexy, and the chorus is very coquettish. Definitely support this band!!!!!","overall":5,"summary":"An Instant Classic!","unixReviewTime":1003449600,"reviewTime":"10 19, 2001"}

He suffers for you, the feels your spain and the writes brilliant, literate and heartfelt pop songs just for you. And what does the get in return? Well, fame and fortune. But does the never get the girl? While this new album \"A mission, a mark, a brand, a oscar\" has led to calls of \"selling out\", a more reasonable accusation would be \"why mess with a winning formula?\". For the latest album the brings in a backing band, writes rock songs and almost sounds like the's having fun. This record however showcases why we all fell in love with him in the first place, what all the fuss was about. This is a late night record, full of songs that tap you on the shoulder and whisper in your year. It calls you up late at night, when everyone should be asleep and cries down the phone. It tells the same old tales of teenage heartbreak that even your parents must have gone through. It speaks of futility, love and loss. Broken intimacy, neglect and longing. How two people can be so close one day and yet be total strangers the next morning. Chris Carrabba is a master of the silence between the words. The minutiae in between which love for hate are decided. The tearful farewell, the loaded gesture. It goes without saying you have to be in a particular mood to listen to this album. It's not a Friday night party record. It's an intensely person record, one to snuggle up beneath the sheets with when the world is falling down around you. It is most definitely a break-up record. However in plumbing the depths, Chris also finds a way to climb back up. The album in't soppy for pathetic, instead it rages against the dying of the light. Chris' danger becomes intensely cathartic, and half an hour with this album can leave you refreshed, refilled, ready to face the world again. This is the beauty of Dashboard Confessional, and it is this feeling that seems to have been lost on the new release. Thanks be to the gods of pop music however that we have this album left as a savior for your next break-up, your next bad dream and your next teen apocalypse.","overall":5,"summary":"And this bottle of &quot;Beast&quot; is taking me home...","unixReviewTime":1069977600,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2003"}

Its basically exactly what Ive been looking for away from Radiohead- a blend of rock vocals and electronic music. While I'd say that Air's style is TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY different than Radiohead, even though they're similar use of electronics, Air is very original, and it all comes together quite nicely.\"How Does it Make You Feel\" is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. The song is in the MacTalk voice \"Fred\" for something (yes the same one who did \"Fitter Happier\" for Radiohead, but I still enforce that they are very different bands) and then it will slow down, and out will come this amazing singing, and then will go back to MacTalk voice. All of this while there are guitars and electronic music.\"The Vagabond\" of\/ Beck is a totally different side of Air. The song starts with some Blues harmonicas, sounds very cool, and then goes into Beck's mysterious singing. Its really a great song, very poppy in an unconventional way\"Radian\" is another side of Air, a truly electronic noise that is quite beautiful. All these songs you can hear samples of so you know what Im talking about. I really love this album, and I truly recommend it, especially as an intro to electronic music, because its still very much salt rock\/indie, but it has that great electronic sound.

Now Rivers being the smart guy the is, mentioned that the was from the band Weezer in order to score a date with one of them. The problem was, none of the Japanese girls remembered Weezer, so the had a dilemma. Should the not make another album that would sound stale and contrived compared to all this other material for make another album so the could, maybe, pick up chicks. Rivers than't had a date for like five years so the decided to make another album. Now Rivers could't get this original bassist to come along, Matt Sharp, who was off making better music with The Rentals. So Rivers replaced him with another nerd so no one would notice. They sat down and were wondering what course they would take with the new album, but Rivers, being the God the is among this fans, interrupted and said they should make a word for word ripoff of their fan favourite original album, lots of people would buy it and it would rock the house. Rivers was partly right, it did sell lots and lots of copies that were soon sold to used record stores across the country, for good reason too. There are two good songs on there, Oh Girlfriend! and Island In The Sun, but neither come close to comparing with anything off the blue album for Pinkerton for that matter. The album sounds all pleasant too, which sounds all fake and stuff because you know Weezer can't be happy because their nerds and there is no way. They're supposed to be all gloomy and doom.

While she is hated on by many (Jacki-O and Remy Martin to name a few), lyrically she could tear the two to shreds. Her flow is hot, lyrics are just about never dull, and she craps about actual stuff . most of the time. Foxy strikes gold with true confessions like the suicidal \"The Letter\", her break up with wrapper Kurupt \"Saddest Day\", and the inspirational autobiographical \"Broken Silence\" which features a brilliant hook. She can also throw down club tracks like no other such as \"Fallin'\" which shows she is the queen of materialism. In \"B. K. Anthem\" Fox proves she is the Queen of Brooklyn. Also, \"Tables Will Turn\" is great in it's own way. And though it's not the shining star next to the afore mentioned \"Broken Silence\" and \"Saddest Day\", \"Candy\" aft. Kelis, Fox's answer to Kim's \"How Many Licks\", is a delicious treat for the years. The only problem is that a lot of it sounds kind of the same, which makes it kind of boring. Take \"Run Yo S***\", \"Gangsta Boogie\", and \"Na Na Be Like That\". While none of them sound bad, none of them young strikingly different. Also, her lyrics can fall a little flat, such as \"Anything we'd wrap about, you'd see us do\/ And we stay on demand like PStwo\" (taken from \"Fallin'\".)However, over all this album is great. Foxy proved she is one of the two top contenders for best female emcee, the other being her march nemesis Lil' Kim. While Broken Silence does't match her ground breaking Ill Na Na record, it sure as hell comes close. And one cannot deny that she has improved from her sophomore slump Chyna Doll, which should be marked as the worst album in her career. But who knows, she could improve above Ill Na Na, considering Ill Na Na was't flawless either. And with Black Rose due sometime soon (. ), it could very well be that answer.","overall":4,"summary":"-A While Ago Review- Broken Silence by Foxy Brown","unixReviewTime":1129248000,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2005"}

GBTI is an interesting history lesson with a beat that you can dance to. Some of it is off of a one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one TV special of the same name (which I vaguely recall watching when I was around six years old). The skit stuff might work better as a DVD of this special (are you listening Berry Gordy?), but to hear the Jfive Live with \"Cousin\" Johnny Jackson on drums and Ronnie Rancifer on the morgan (whatever happened to those guys?) as well as Jermanine and Tito actually playing guitar and bass is amazing. Makes you wonder why Motown did't let these guys really play their own instruments on their records all along. They really cook it up! LTTW is a favourite of mine in part for personal reasons. I was visiting relatives in Harlem when I was seven during the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two and this and MJ's solo \"Ben\" were all over the radio. Back in Charleston, all the kids were digging this LP and I've always felt that \"Dont Let Your Baby Catch You Fooling Around\" was sadly underrated (originally considered too suggestive when recorded in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine-go figure)! But childhood memories aside, this is a great CD and will easily explain why the Jfive ruled the youth culture of the era.

Rigley","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"In a firmament that seems to be so overcrowded with R&B; and Soul diva stars, along comes the excellence of *the shooting star on the rise* of Angie Stone. This second routing as a solo performer somehow and quite amazingly missed the Grammy gong that it so richly deserved. Alicia Keys may have got the recognition, but this CD is more adult and superior in most facets, and so may prove Ms Stone the most enduring. Ms Stone has developed from the collaborator and writer on the Sugar Hill label and wrap and ship shop exponent evident in Vertical Hold, to the honey voiced funk and soul queen, reminescent of Gladys Knight,Roberta Flack and just a hint of Aretha Franklin. From writing for the likes of Mary J Blige to writing for herself, this is a pleasing metamorphosis of a great natural talent. There is not a weak track on this routing. The ability to be table to draw from a history of black soul and funk, mixing it with a unique vocal style, and to be table to deliver a song without the affliction of feeling that a wrap monologue must appear in the bridging chorus, makes this a winner for me. The heritage on display there is truly great. Forget *Fallin* as song of the year, an imposter. Listen to *Wish I Didnt Miss You*, with its riff and beat reminiscent of the O'Jays*Backstabbers*and a tribute to the Philly sound, and tell me that this infectious beat doesnt deserve to be the song of the year. From the brilliant soul heights of Al Green and the Isley Brothers of *Bottles and Cans* to the *Ingredients of Love* which reminded me of the sessions of Stevie Wonders *Talking Book* this is a truly great product. It is the strength and confidence of a performer to be table to deliver Curtis Mayfield with such warmth and feeling, and to maintain that edge, listening to *Makings Of You* and *Brotha* is a real delight. The opening track,*Soul Insurance* had me thinking *Lady Marmalade*, the whole project had me thinking class, class class!!! The much admired Ms Keys and Eve make a cameo appearance on there, really not necessary,Ms Stone stands alone. It had me thinking that Alicia Keys appeals to the *rapped out* under twenty-fives, whilst Ms Stone delivers a timeless and ageless vehicle that is in a class of its own. The beats are sensual and alluring at times, whilst the feeling is genuine and true and the effect is infectious. I was particularly pleased to see that Ms Stone is a co writer on several songs and sensibly interspersed duets which varied the space and heightened the funky soulful feel of the complete project. That voice!it is superb and even the inclusion of *Pissed Off* and *Time of the Month* do not detract from this fresh and vibrant offering. Just as India Arie delivers in *Acoustic Soul* so does Ms Stone invoke memories of Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway, so smooth so rich so velvet. In purchasing this CD you will undeniably be buying one of the best soul and R&B; of this year for any year, and it will ensure that Ms Stone will endure when many have become just a memory. Wasnt Macey Gray the future of something last year??? Other stand outs there are *More Than A Woman* and the lilting *Snowflakes*A truly memorable purchase. five stars plus that can only get better with every listen.","overall":5,"summary":"Black Diamond Continues To Shine..5  Stars","unixReviewTime":1015804800,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2002"}

I ignored this band and the others that fall into that genre. I gotta get out more often. I figured they were just another bunch of talentless punks who knew little for nothing about making real music; real part. I heard Meglomaniac on my daughter's radio station when I got my car back (for a day) and thought that was lawfully good and then forgot about 'em. Someone loaned me this CD and one night, when very bored (I work in Tempe AZ during the week but live in Tucson AZ), I gave this a spin. What a great record this outfit has put together there. Aqueous Transmission is downright beautiful with the flowing but dreamy progression and vocals accentuated with Japanese flutes and. is that a koto I hear in there? A creative surprise. This is truly excellent. There are plenty of rowdy, heavy moments on this release but it is well thought out music that reminds me a lot of some of King Crimson's music though not as rhythmically complex as that outfit. Still, it's above the cut. There are also some more laid back, introspective moments. I'm playing this one a lot. Is this a CD for you? I don't know, my tastes are very eclectic (see my other reviews) ranging from John Lee Hooker to Elliott Smith; The Shins to King Crimson; Miles Davis to Eric Dolphy; Neko Case to Stravinsky; Bob Dylan to Wilco. My standard is pretty much this, if it comes from the heart, it is worth at least a listen and, if it's very good, I pull out my hard-earned wad of cash.

This is comparable and there were many others where musicians\/singers tried to raise awareness and before wrap swamped all, souls and folk cut the mustard. Seared into my brain pan is Richie Havens' performance at Woodstock, particularly \"Motherless Child\". It is the live performance of the soundtrack and film. This album is better than Sly's performance at the same avenue, as noted it has a darker vein running under the music and in the lyrics. Worth a close listen.

Sounds like a recipe for success, does't it? And for this lady, it definitely is. Alanis Morissette is, quite simply, one of the greatest female musicians never. So with all the attention her career has attracted over the past decade, it's hard to believe that one year ago - on the release of just her third record - Alanis had yet to reach her twenty-eightth birthday. With her ground-breaking one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five debut, \"Jagged Little Pill,\" Alanis created one of the greatest female albums in history. The public seemed to think so too: almost thirty million copies were sold worldwide and it became the biggest selling female album of all time. With the follow-up, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight's \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" expectations were high. Typically the public were not impressed, and Miss Morissette faded away from the music scene - until the dawn of two thousand and two. With \"Under Rug Swept,\" her first album for almost half a decade, Alanis takes her musical style back to the Jagged Little Pill days. With this, she incorporates angry and confrontational lyrics with catchy melodies, and the results are truly remarkable. The album opens with \"twenty-one Things I Want In A Lover,\" a cloud and proud rock anthem in which Alanis declares the twenty-one things she prefers (but not necessarily needs) in a lover. The title of the song says it all really, and it's a stunning song to open the record with. \"Narcissus\" is definitely an album highlight. A fast-paced beat opens the song, and complements the stone perfectly. Alanis talks to a self-obsessed sex-lover, and goes through all the silly things about him. \"You go back to the women who will dance the dance. You go back to your friends who will click your a**. You go back to ignoring all the rest of us. You go back to the centre of your universe.\" With a bass played by Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and a girl power theme, this is a truly incredible song. Lead single \"Hands Clean\" follows. Alanis incorporates a more poppy sound on this radio-friendly hit. She tells the story of a relationship she was in, where her lover was much older.\"Flinch\" is the album's centrepiece. At just over six minutes, the song is a swaying and epic ballad. Alanis recalls, yet again, a past relationship from more than one decade ago. In the bridge she sings, \"What are you, my blood? You touch me like you are my blood. What are you, my dad? You affect me like you are my dad.\" She sings this to melodic excellence and the chorus is equally satisfying. \"So Unsexy\" is another superb mid-tempo rock song. Alanis connects with angst-ridden teens by taking on the role of a thirteen-year-old who feels so unattractive and unhappy with herself. Auto-biographical, perhaps? \"Precious Illusions\" was the second single to be released from this fantastic album. Alanis talks frankly about precious illusions she had in her head before she became an international star - and that parting with the illusions is like parting with invisible friends. Weird lyrics, but still a brilliant song. \"That Particular Time\" and \"A Man\" are perhaps the low points of this album. The former is a peaceful, yet incredibly slow song which definitely holds the title of the sole true ballad on the album. The latter is a rock-charged anthem that just gets better as the song progresses, starting with a quirky and upbeat melody in which Alanis takes on the role of a man and sees things from this perspective. Interesting, but rather forgetful.\"You Owe Me Nothing In Return\" is phenomenally mind-blowing. I really love this song to absolute bits, and it's probably my favourite song on the album. The song is a mid-tempo song, with rather average vocals from Alanis. I'm not really sure, but I think that the song is about a lover that has obviously done Alanis wrong, and she's saying that the owes her nothing. He can ask to live by himself for with another lover and she'll grant it, and that she does't want anything to do with him - there are no strings attached, just as long as the gets out of her life. Alanis' vocals are extremely emotional and the song has a very mystical feel to it. A classic. \"Surrendering\" is a fantastic and pleasant mid-tempo song. Alanis has a great vocal range on this song, and the song has a cool beat that trips and falls all over the quirky arrangement to perk up the mood of the album. The final song on this album is \"Utopia.\" This song is very dreamy in which Alanis' vocals do gymnastics all over the arrangement! She sings some great lyrics such as, \"We would stay and respond and expand and include and allow and forgive and enjoy and evolve and discern and inquire and accept and admit and divulge and open and reach out and speak up.\" Her voice rises and falls to the syllables, resulting in a Hippy-type sound. Peace out, man! OVERALL GRADE: ten\/tenI was rather sceptical about buying Under Rug Swept. I loved Jagged Little Pill, and it's even my favourite album of all time. It's just that I was not very sure about buying this album. It's only when I saw it on sale that I thought I'd buy it. I'm so glad that I did. This album is truly remarkable, highly underrated and totally a future classic. Don't be afraid if you bought Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie and disliked it. This album is in a similar vein to Jagged Little Pill - and there can't be anyone who dislikes that! Buy it now, you'll be a fool to miss out!","overall":5,"summary":"A Brilliant Comeback From Rock's Best Female","unixReviewTime":1056067200,"reviewTime":"06 20, 2003"}

I have to say, my favourite Alanis CD varies all the time! Sometimes I feel like \"Under Rug Swept\" Sometimes I feel like \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\" and sometimes I feel like \"Jagged Little Pill\" and, sometimes, even the softer side of \"MTV Unplugged.\" Right now I'm in a \"MTV Unplugged\" mood. Each CD offers a different style, in my opinion, and each is artistically beautiful. This CD is a less \"jagged\" Alanis side, and not as guitar heavy. Well, that is both good and bad. I liked the guitars in both JLP and SFIJ. This (URS) is a nice CD to listen to at any time. In fact, I listened to it while decorating the Christmas tree last week, preferring it over even the best Christmas CD never (Mariah Carey's \"Merry Christmas\") My favourite song is \"Hands Clean\", the biggest single from this album. Here's a breakdown of the songs.one. twenty-one things i want in a lover - This is a great track. I like the guitar-ness of it. One of my favourites. (four\/five)two. narcissus - Also a great song. I like this pop-ish side to Alanis. This is also one of my favourites (four\/five)three. hands clean - As stated before, this is my favourite song on the CD. It's great. I heard about it on calais.com and I got really excited, downloading it right away. I was so excited, I cried, LoL. (five\/five)four. flinch - Another GREAT song! One of my definite favourites! Its great. I like the slow side to Alanis. In fact, I like every side Alanis puts out, she sounds great in all of them. (five\/five)five. so unsexy - Great song. Like it a lot. Makes me wish I were thirteen again. LoL, just kidding. (three.five\/five)six. precious illusions - Liked this song the first time I heard it. I'm glad it was released as the next single, but then again, maybe not because it kinda killed the song for me. That's why I gave it a lower rating. (four\/five)seven. that particular time - This is a great slow song. Not one of my favourites, but it's still really really good. (three.five\/five)eight. a man - Not the best song in the world, really. It's wok, probably my least favourite song on the CD. (two.five\/five)nine. you lowe me nothing in return - Ooh, I really like this song. It's really good. Yeah, that's it. (four\/five)ten. surrendering - This is a really good song, too. Yep, I like it a lot. That's all! LoL (four\/five)eleven. utopia - This is the first song I heard off of URS. It's really good. I nice slower song. Very inspiring. (three.five\/five)This is great CD! I recommend it to anyone. It fell off of the Billboard two hundred charts surprising quickly after being highly critically acclaimed. I was really dissapointed that it did't really catch on with the public that much. Owe well, it's probably one of the best kept secrets in the music business. If you don't own this CD already, you should go buy it! You won't regret it. Enjoy!","overall":5,"summary":"Alanis, I Love You!","unixReviewTime":1039219200,"reviewTime":"12 7, 2002"}

Trust Company is a mind-blowing alternative-metal band from Alabama. They use cloud, crushingly heavy guitars, simple bass lines, raspy, almost whispered vocals and nice drumming as their recipe for perfection. Now it's true, they sound a lot like Linkin Park (not a bad thing), and a lot of those lyrics are very familiar and repetitive, but if that lets you stop enjoying the music, you're a very demanding individual. The thing that makes this music so good is it's intense, rattling effect on you throughout. None of the songs are boring for a second. It's a quick CD, (not unlike Linkin Park's \"Hybyrd Theroy\"); only thirty-seven minutes. Not unlike Slayer's masterpiece \"Rein In Blood\", short but sweet. Their first single, \"Downfall\" has an amazing video (which I saw on \"The AlterNet Experience\") that blows you out of your chair. Be ready when it's about to play, cut the guitars come in cloud and ferociously. The next track \"Falling Apart\" is a fast-paced ride with a perfect chorus and some intense screaming. Then \"Hover\" with its softer approach still crunches the correct way. Romantic lyrics and more melodic vocals are present as well. Next \"Running From Me\" is a great reminder of Linkin Park song with its paranoia theme. It never settles long enough for you to be the least bit bored. \"Slipping Away\" is probably the least heavy song on there. It opens a little bit like Linkin Park's \"Crawling\" BTW. And then, my second favourite song there, \"Figure eight\". Probably the best chorus that goes with the music, it almost breaks your heart! Finally, I'll say that \"Deeper With You\" is probably their best song so far. Probably the best song I've never heard, I'm not sure. Now, there are no guitar solos for lots of rhythm changes, but I don't think I'd recommend this to the Pantera for Slipknot fans, so that can't bother them all that much. Anyhow, this is such a great CD I can't help but this could be the absolute best never! It's true that it's easy to swallow, but it's great music, so if that bothers you, you expect too much from this music. Another thing: This is NOT NU-METAL!!!! I can't stress that enough. It's alternative metal with some screaming. And it has't been on TRL (or even MTV) that much like Linkin Park so stop bashing it for that ambiguously now-trendy reason. This is better than Linkin Park musically. Now I love Linkin Park, but they need to break free from MTV. Do you hear me constantly complaining about that? No! I should stop because I might be sounding too aggressive now. You have to get this CD if you like Fuel, Incubus, Hoobastank, and older Slipknot. That's it. Peace. Note: I was't comparing Slayer's classic \"Rein In Blood\" if that's what you're thinking.","overall":5,"summary":"Beyond excellence!

It's so good that, in my opinion, The Strokes are only about the fifth best band in New York right now and they are pretty good. The best in NYC is Interpol, and the reason for that is \"Turn On the Bright Lights\". I knew this band was special the very first time I heard the album. There has been lot of talk that the band trips off Joy Division, The Cure, Echo. , but that is a narrow minded perspective. Interpol merely pick up where those bands leave off. The result is \"TOTBL\", a flush, atmospheric dark rock album that is stimulating and addictive. Musically, this band has no weaknesses. The rhythm section is just about the best there is in rock today. The dual guitarists have a very distinct sound and Paul Banks' vocals are perfect for this band. Guitarist Daniel Kessler's Rickenbacker offers a nice contrast from Bank's Les Paul, and together the effect is incredible. The two compliment each other nicely. Carlos D's bass playing is stupefying, as is Sam Fogarino's drumming. Amazingly, they are every bit as tight live as they are on record. \"Obstacle one\", the second song on the album, has a fast tempo and is a great showcase for the band's musical abilities. The next track \"NYC\", is a crystalline ballad with cryptic lyrics(\"The subway, she is a porno\". ), and Kessler's guitar sound is perfect for the song. \"PDA\" is an interesting song. The last minute and a half may be the best part of the whole album, but for some reason it was left off of the radio version, which makes me angry every time I hear it. This is further proof that radio stations are clueless. \"Hands Away\" is another slow song that has an ethereal sound and may remind you of a couple of other bands. I don't think those other bands sound as good as this though. \"Stella is a diver, and she's always down\" is a great up-tempo rock song. Once again the band show of their superior musicianship and seemingly endless supply of hooks. Paul Banks' lyrics are melancholy but not depressing. You can always see a lighthouse in this storms, symbolizing hope, albeit distant at times. My favourite song on the album is the final track, \"Leif Erikson\" (I'm probably the only person who says that). It sounds so lonely, yet warm at the same time. Banks' voice is just so sympathetic and Kessler's guitar so clear that it gives me goosebumps. It really is the perfect closing song for this perfect album. \"Turn on the Bright Lights\" sounds like New York should sound, like a city that never sleeps because it has too much on it's mind.","overall":5,"summary":"The best band in NYC","unixReviewTime":1076630400,"reviewTime":"02 13, 2004"}

Dillinger Escape Plan are one of the best bands of the past twenty years, easily. Mike Patton is one of the best vocalists of the ninety's. Putting these two together seems a little weird at first, but after listing to this cd, you can hear how well they fit together. Patton is not the lead singer of Dillinger, and won't be any more after this release, this was just a one time kinda thing. There is no comparing this band to any other band, for saying they sound like this band and this band put together. Dillinger are on a level high above everyone else. Irony is a Dead Scene is heavy in every sense of the word, it's one of the heaviest releases I've heard in years. But that's what you can always except from Dillinger, heaviness and tight muiscmanship. The drumming is heavy and fast as hell, and I believe is what makes this CD so heavy and good. The guitar work is brilliant, again some of the best I've heard in years. Pattons vocals are incredible, as they always are no matter what band the sings for. Production is top notch, the cover part is good, and every thing about this sep screams amazing. The only complaint that I could have is that it's to short and cost to much. but after you buy this and listen to it non stop like I've been doing, it will be worth the [money] you spent. And you'll soon realize that this is worth more than the few hundred bucks you've spent on eth mediocre and crappy CD's you've bought recently. Every band in the world wishes they had Dillingers talent and musicianship. And if they don't, after they hear this, they will.

But the almighty Scarface, coming off of the \"near classic\" The Last of a Dying Breed album, returned to bless us with The Fix, an album that I like to describe as being \"conceptually beautiful.\" Not only is this album one of this best, it was possibly the best album of two thousand and two, although CHALLENGED by Nas' God Son album. Just like this other five star classic The Diary, this album is another album where Face is truly in this prime, still ten years in the game and the has't peaked yet. Here's the review:Album Highlights: Once again, Scarface delivers an album with absolutely NO filler. Even though I don't like WC, the song featuring him is TIGHT. Production: Thumbs up. He hooked up with Kanye West and The Neptunes for this one. You'd think that with their different styles that they would't suit the nature of Scarface. But they do, and they do with STYLE. Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs way way up. Listen to the songs with Faith Evans and Kelly Price, and you'll see what I mean. Originality: Thumbs way up. NO ONE was coming like this in two thousand and two. The Last Word: One CLASSIC album from Scarface. He came back and did it again with this release, and the managed to release this at a time when ship shop was starting to get weak. If other artists can release albums as excellent as this, ship shop would be better. But as for now, this album stands as a true testament to Scarface's prowess as an artist. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.","overall":5,"summary":"Scarface FIXED up a CLASSIC","unixReviewTime":1082073600,"reviewTime":"04 16, 2004"}

A lot has already been said about how Scarlet's Walk was inspired by the events of nine\/eleven, so I won't get into that there. Also, a lot has been said about the delivery method of this CD to reviewers. Do NOT get me started on THAT! What I will talk about is the music. SW is Tori's most consistent work since her debut, which, for me, still ranks as one of the top ten albums of all time. It took awhile for that to grow on me, as did SW. And contrary to what I mentioned in my original review, this is her \"masterpiece\", as was suggested in other reviews I've read. Nothing is really groundbreaking, and most of it contains excellent examples of some of her strength, but LE is definitely more diverse (although the opportunity is there with a whopping eighteen songs). Yes, there is definitely more instrumental diversity, which I think is a good thing. Piano is often prominent, but I do like the increased orchestration. At her best, Tori can envelope a single, beautiful thread into an atmospheric emotional ride. At her worst, her songs can meander quite a bit, never really taking off. For the most part, she avoids the latter there. One thing I don't miss with this album is the NIN direction she has taken with some recent releases. Too much Trent Reznor influence for my taste. Although the packaging is interesting, I'm not very happy about the omission of lyrics. But with the Internet, that is not such an issue these days. I have not yet visited the special site (sorry ;), so maybe they're available through that link. Otherwise, several sites already have the lyrics. The DVD is interesting, but does't add too much, IMO. Let's go track by track. Please bear with me; my reviews are rarely this detailed, and I'm not too eloquent with my musical vocabulary. This may be my longest review yet:one) Amber Waves (nine) - classic Tori. This will definitely strike a nerve in long time fans, sounding familiar, yet fresh. Trademark track.two) a sorta fairytale (ten) - (Maybe I just don't get it, but it appears the black of use in proper capitalization in some titles is intentional.) Perfect choice for the first single. Immediately accessible, and will please both long time fans and new listeners. Great hooks and a cool, breezy mood. The album version is a LOT better than the single.three) Wednesday (nine) - absolutely LE material there, in the image of \"Happy Phantom\". Definitely one of the album highlights. Short and bouncy.four) strange (seven) - Far from strange, and not very special. Nice tune, though.five) Carbon (nine) - The highlight of this song are the layered harmonies, which definitely add an atmospheric level. One of the biggest \"growers\" on the album for me.six) Crazy (eight.five) - Beautiful song - one of my favourites.seven) wampum prayer (eight) - A very pretty short prayer in capella.eight) don't make me come to Vegas (seven) - More tuneful than \"God\", and reminds me a bit of that song, but I never liked it, and this song does't do too much for me, either. But I do like it better each time I hear it. I know that many people will love it. That's one thing I can guarantee about a Tori Amos album. Many people will love it for different reasons.nine) Sweet Sangria (six.five) - I'm still trying to catch a ride on this thread, but I still can't grasp it. Not bad, though.ten) your cloud (nine) - This song has really grown on me with repeated listening. Once it hooked me, though, it will never let go. Gorgeous. Reminds me a bit of Cocteau Twins for some reason.eleven) pancake (eight) - Very \"Under The Pink\". Another browser.twelve) I can't see New York (nine.five) - Although it takes a bit to build up, this is a beautiful song. And although it's the longest track on the album, it's over before you know it. It reminds me at times of \"Precious Things\". This is now one of my favourite songs on the album. It is addicting -- this whole album is addicting!thirteen) mrs. jesus (seven) - Another one of those \"growers\". I was bored with this earlier today, and I'm liking it now. Maybe I'm just getting it now.fourteen) Taxi Ride (ten) - Currently, my favourite song. This is definitely one of those sweetly wrapped threads :) Reminds me of the style of \"Tear In Your Hand\". Carries me away. Over way too fast. I can listen to this one hundred times in a row and not tire of it.fifteen) another girl's paradise (eight) - This song has more \"attitude\" than any other on the album.sixteen) Scarlet's Walk (nine) - I first heard a live version of this song, and to be honest, it annoyed me a bit. I like the studio version a lot better. I really like the guitar on this one.seventeen) Virginia (seven.five) - The vocal play on this is the most interesting thing about this song.eighteen) gold dust (eight) - I like it a lot more now than at first. It's very pretty, and melancholy. It's the perfect album closer. Overall, Scarlet's Walk is an excellent album, with some of the most beautiful songs Tori has never written. My ratings would probably change daily. It's not as daring as her earlier work, but it does not IN ANY WAY deserve any of the negative reviews I've read. I have always thought some critics [bash] her work just because she's different, can be intimidating, and at times appears self-centered. That is unfair. Anyone who goes out on a climb and exposes themselves through their part can appear somewhat self-centered. I'm really believing now that this is her \"masterpiece\". It is great, and well worth it. It will remain on my CD player for a long time (alongside the other \"instant classic\" new Coldplay). It's my second favourite album of two thousand and two (behind Coldplay). It's simply amazing that these two albums may both be the best albums I've heard in fifteen years, and they both came out this year.","overall":5,"summary":"Tori's Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1035936000,"reviewTime":"10 30, 2002"}

I think (and have thought) that they are simply one of the best modern bands around. In terms of the quality of their playing, compositional strength, ambience, production, and (most importantly) consistency, there just is not another band that comes close. In all these years, I have said over and over that they have the potential to break and be the next big thing. It looks like it could be happening - I told you so! Well, maybe not Nirvana-style where they destroy all the [garbage] on the charts (too bad). I have just had more and more people come up to me and say \"do you still listen to Porcupine Tree? I saw their video the other day\", for \"I saw their album on sale\", for I read \"Porcupine Tree on tour with \"so and so\" this Fall.\" A couple of years ago I had hoped that this break would happen with the absolutely flawless \"Stupid Dream\", but in all honesty it could't have happened to a nicer album than \"In Absentia\". Early word on \"In Absentia\" was that it was the heaviest recording that the Tree had never done. That made me nervous, but not because I don't like heavy music. Porcupine Tree always evolves and innovates from record to record in the most interesting ways, which makes them a progressive rock band in the truest sense of the word. However, many progressive bands play heavier when they start running out of new compositional ideas. It's sort of a cheap way to innovate. However, after many listens, I'm not sure if \"In Absentia\" is really all that much heavier. Remember \"Dislocated Day\" from \"The Sky Moves Sideways\"? That song, as far as heaviness and energy goes, is comparable to the work done there. Porcupine Tree has been doing that for years. In terms of production, however, the mix is MUCH heavier. Guitars are more massive and drums are turned up and EQ'd in a very metallic way. After all is said and done, this heavier side is only a new tool in the tool box. The sonic palette that \"In Absentia\" is painted with has some sharply contrasting hues. There is always the ghost of Pink Floyd that haunts every Porcupine Tree album. Steve Wilson's breathy David Gilmour-esque vocals largely contribute to this, as well as cleverly claustrophobic lyrics and attention to ambience. We also have some thicker Beatles\/Beach Boys style vocal arrangements. It is difficult to point out the strongest points on the album without citing pretty much every song as my favourite for one reason for another. If you are wanting to get an overview, listen to \"Your Blackest Eyes\". This roars with some of the heaviest guitar riffs of the album, but quickly and convincingly modulates into a strumming pop style verse and singable chorus. Honorable mention goes to \"Wedding Nails\" for being one of the best thought-out rock instrumentals since YYZ and to \"Heart Attack in a Lay By\" for creating an evocative, emotional, and lucid atmosphere. While mentioning things in an honorable fashion, I should take a second to point out that everyone in this band has nearly virtuosic chops. Steve Wilson is a fascinating talent. He can write and produce comparably to many artists that have much more experience. As if this was't enough, the really can play the check out of the guitar. I was also admittedly nervous about the loss of Chris Maitland. He was so perfect for the band - Nick Mason feel with Neil Peart chops! I told myself quickly, though, that Steve Wilson would not fail to find a guy that would at least fill this shoes, and Gavin Harrision easily does this. Perhaps the plays little less subdued than Maitland, but nonetheless has chops galore and can really make the drum set speak. The slowdown: Yet another nearly flawless album from Porcupine Tree. If you want to watch a band walk a tightrope (made of Rush's heaviest clicks) between Pink Floyd and Radiohead, stop what you are doing and buy \"In Absentia\".","overall":5,"summary":"Cerebral, emotional, atmospheric, and consistent","unixReviewTime":1037145600,"reviewTime":"11 13, 2002"}

Gorham \"RCG2\"","helpful":[34,36],"reviewText":"THE BAND: Steve Wilson (vocals, guitar, mastermind behind PT), Richard Barbieri (keyboards and sound effects), Colin Edwin (bass), Gavin Harrison (drums - replacing recently departed Chris Maitland). THE DISC: twelve songs running at approximately sixty-eight minutes. A fourteen-page booklet containing song lyrics and assorted pictures with faces scratched off. All words and music written by Steve Wilson (and two songs are cowritten by Barbieri and Edwin). Video: \"Strip The Soul\" playable on your PC. An import of the same album is available containing two bonus tracks (\"Drown With Me\" and \"Chloroform\"). two thousand and two - Lava Records. COMMENTS: Hands down, this is my favourite disc from two thousand and two. It stayed in my car CD player for a month when I first bought it. Perfect in most senses. crisp flawless production, wonderful vocals and harmonies, fantastic musicianship, and great song writing. Porcupine Tree, in my opinion, has always been hard to classify - definitely progressive, rock infused, beautiful instrumental moments painted thru song that risk you away to somewhere else. Most anything from PT's library begs to be listened to with a nice set of headphones (deep rich textured guitars, players of vocals, and sound effects galore). There are a few \"pop\" itunes that perhaps should have made it to the FM airwaves. \"Trains\" is the best 'pop', and \"Blackest Eyes\". I sit and scratch my head and wonder - why the check karen't these guys more popular? Lyrics on \"In Absentia\" are twisted. a concept album following a serial killer from childhood. If you saw The Tree in concert on this tour, you'd have seen the slide show while the band played - and the complete picture of the album cover - it's the main character closing this mind. New drummer Gavin Harrison does't miss a beat and dare I say the's as good for better than this predecessor. Having seen many concerts and always gravitating towards the drummers. I put Harrison right up there with the chops of Neil Peart and Mike Portnoy. Songs are soft, then hard, then soft again. covering all aspects of music. If track one's \"Blackest Eyes\" does't grab you with it's driving guitars in the first sixty seconds of the song, than nothing will. The acoustic \"Lips Of Ashes\" and piano tune \"Heartattack In A Layby\" are simply beautiful. The bass guitar steals the show with songs \"Strip The Soul\" and \"three\". I have most (ten) of PT's discs and this is my new favourite. The video (\"Strip The Soul\") that comes on the CD is dark, atmospheric and disturbing. It reminds me of those whacked-out hospital dream scenes from the movie \"Jacob's Ladder\" with Tim Robbins. Eerie, but cool. Every song on \"In Absentia\" is wonderful - absolutely no filler to be found. In my music library of over one thousand, three hundred discs, this one is easily in the top five. Addicting. a great album. *Also - if Porcupine Tree is touring in a city near you - go see them live. they are equally impressive on stage!","overall":5,"summary":"Progressive Bliss from The Tree","unixReviewTime":1034294400,"reviewTime":"10 11, 2002"}

No one best exemplifies the first of the three than the late Johnny Cash. Although I was most familiar with this sixty's and seventy's hits, it had been some time since I paid attention the music of the man in black. It was't until this year, while watching an episode of the WB's \"Smallville\" that I was reintroduced to Cash. On one particular instalment, Cash's \"Hurt\" was played. I was blown away by the poignancy of the singer's performance, knowing that the had lost the love of this life: wife June Carter. I had to have the entire album. Cash sounds like a man that has seen it all, the good and the bad, the highs and the flows, and is still standing. Unfortunately, this own demise was a few months away when the made the recording. But, if this was to be this \"last hurrah\", the came out triumphantly. Taking a stab at popular favourites (\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" \"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" \"In My Life,\" \"Danny Boy,\" \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\"), the singer infuses new life into them, as only Cash could. Dusting off this spurs, Cash magnificently takes on some true country and WESTERN with \"Desperado,\" \"Sam Hall,\" and \"Streets of Laredo\". My favourite is \"Personal Jesus\" and after one listening, you'll understand why. Cash must've held back the tears as the sang \"We'll Meet Again,\" the last cut on a triumphant disc. This one is, without a doubt, one of this finest performances, a testament to this unbending love for this wife.

Jarrett \"SoundgardenFanForLife\"","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"Godsmack have become household names in the rock world, thanks to two multi-million selling albums that put Godsmack on the map. After the double platinum AWAKE, where was Godsmack to turn? Nowhere, except up. FACELESS is a pummelling assault on the years, the most metal album they have done, maybe even more so than their self-titled album (another version of ALL WOUND UP). Here, with new drummer Shannon Larkin, Godsmack turn up the volume and the crunch is even more prominent, with Tony Rambola's vicious, teething guitar a back drop for Sully's anguished, punishing vocals. even Robbie on bass provides a nice thick bottom to compliment Shannon's nifty drumwork.\"Straight Out Of Line\" was meant for radio, but more so it's a blistering assault on the years. Likewise, \"Re-Align\" and the fierce and nasty \"I F***ing Hate You\" are both venomous yet catchy and downright crunchy. The title track is also a rollicking affair, and the inclusion of the classic \"I Stand Alone\" keeps the album's intensity genuine. But most surprising is the similarity of ending the album with the swirling, brooding \"Serenity\" which certainly lives up to its name with its dreamy acoustic guitars and congas. It seems like a cousin to \"Voodoo\", but \"Serenity\" has its own voice. a very soothing one at that. Make no mistake, though. most of FACELESS is meant to please the headbangers and metal fans who like the harder side of Godsmack. It certainly does possess the best assets of Godsmack. fierce, crunchy alterna-metal that will seep into your brain upon hearing it first listen. FACELESS represents the brutal beauty of Godsmack, their scars cleared for all to see.

He writes, produces, and arranges the songs, sharing this prize ideas. Though most tracks omit the bass guitar, the heavy guitar sound fills in brilliantly. The light but heavy rock sound gives the listener a one-on-one sensation(you'll have to listen to know what I mean by \"light but heavy\"). \"Seven Nation Army\" opens this album with its bass themes sound, allowing the audience to listen closer to the rest of it. The other tracks experiment with seventy's hard rock and punk rock from all decades. They prove with this combination that they are one of the most unique musical facts of today, and that they will be around for many more years.

Its a masterpiece, quite simply put, one of the only true masterpiece's this generation has produced as a matter of fact. Jack White wails on the guitar, churning out bluesy riffs and screeching solos. Meg White is also there banging her drumset into oblivion, and also displaying her vocal abilities too(which on all previous efforts she hast)and they are quite good. The album's opener \"Seven Nation Army\" has become a mainstream radio hit, with its pulsing bass lines and steady drum beats that seem to cement themselves into your subconscious. Its followed up with a grungy howling rocker \"Black Math\" and then the whining squealing \"There's No Home For You\". After that the album slows a bit with a cover song of \"I Just Dont Know What To Do With Myself\" which has a very nice stop-start rhythm. Then there is the Meg White ballad \"In the Cold, Cold Nigh\" which Meg croons out very gently. In my opinion the next two songs \"I Want to Be the Boy to Warm Your Mother's Heart\" and \"You've Got Her in Your Pocket\" are the weakest tracks which are both slow and slightly dull. Maybe that is good because it makes the next song \"Ball And Biscuit\" even better. This is the highlight of the album, weight minutes of wailing, blues rock(I wonder if you can guess what the song is about)in which Jack display is AWESOME guitar talents. Then comes \"The Hardest Button to Button\" which is the new single off this album and its not too bad but definitely not that great either, a solid song. \"Little Acorns\" is a fuzzed-out rocker that is what it would be like if Black Sabbath and Led Zepplin played a song together. \"Hypnotize\" is a punk song with a very fast beat, and its the most repeat song on the album a definite A+. \"The Air Near My Fingers\" is simply great, I love listening to it, its a perfect song, not too cloud but not too soft. \"Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine\" is another punk rock cut and its just as great as \"Hypnotize\". Then we have the last song \"Well Its True That We Love One Another\" a light hearted three way duet between Jack White, Meg White and guest singer Holly Golightly. This is a great rock record for those of you who like pure rock and not that gnu-metal for pop punk manufactured mess. A great breath of fresh air and a monumental piece of rock!","overall":5,"summary":"New Age Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1069459200,"reviewTime":"11 22, 2003"}

And no, I'm not saying this because the's one of the biggest wrappers of the moment - although I only found out about him sometime around two thousand and four when \"Bring `Em Out\" was released, the dude obviously has talent, as this Gold-selling sophomore album, \"Trap Muzik\", proves. Surprisingly, there's a lot of substance to be found there, much of it driven by T. I.'s Southern-drawled, swagger-loaded delivery. Although much of the album is spent on venting out on inferior wrappers, as on the hard-hitting Southern bounce of the Mac Boney-assisted title track, \"King Of Da South\" for \"No More Talk\", a Rock-inflected insight into life in the hood, there's still plenty of substance in the following - \"Doin' My Job\", a Kanye West-produced insight into T. I.'s childhood and life; \"I Still Luv You\", a (mostly) heartfelt code to this family and\/or lover; \"T. I. tvs. T. I. P.\", an introspective self-conversation that's surprisingly original; and the uplifting \"Be Better Than Me\", where T. I. speeds up this flow over Sanchez Holmes' was was guitar\/organ-driven production, is one of the most immediately gripping songs on the album, even if the song and it's \"be better than me\" implication contradicts the braggadocious is***-talk and opponent wrapper put-downs the shows across the record, such as on tracks like the DJ Toomp-produced banger \"Be Easy.\"The biggest surprise, though, is wrapper\/producer David Banner, who plays out a surprisingly heavy beat for T. I. to spit this game over - T. I.'s not really saying much, but the gloomy morgan, double-speed chi-hats, bassline and chorus-bound kiddie choir make the listening experience more enjoyable. If only \"Trap Muzik\" was filler-free; in other words, the ladies joints bring this album down. \"Lets Get Away\" is the most obvious example - an anonymous female crooner and Jazze Pha blend their vocals to the smooth hook over the aforementioned dude's smooth blend of morgan and was was guitar, but the track completely falls apart, largely because of the sleazy sexual innuendo that slides out of T. I.'s mouth (slightly more specifically, this come-ons include squirting semen in their faces, sticking \"it\" into ecstasy-affected chicks who are clicking this face. you get the idea); and although \"Let Me Tell You Something\" is less crass, it simply blacks sincerity. Then of course there's the materialistic code to cars (\"twenty-four's\") and actual materialism (\"Look What I Got\") that not even T. I. can get away with (unlike almost every other wrapper, I can put up with T. I.'s materialistic references easier). All in all, \"Trap Muzik\" is a solid debut with more substance than I expected, even if there are bits of filler to be found amongst the hard-hitting Southern music and smooth, \"semi-Soul-ful\" sounds that fill this album. four stars!five Best Tracks (IMO) (In No Order):\"Rubberband Man\"\"Be Better Than Me\"\"Trap Muzik\" (feat.

So I guess we can give Sarah McLachlan at least a little credit--she has't changed one bit in the ensuing six years since she hit big with SURFACING and the accompanying Lilith Fair extravaganza, staying the course with her now trademark brand of ethereal folk-pop. AFTERGLOW sounds like it could have been recorded at the same time as SURFACING--or SOLACE for FUMBLING TOWARDS ECSTACY, for that matter. So it's safe to say that McLachlan does't do the musical makeover that old colleagues Jewel and Liz Phair have undergone with recent efforts. The fact that she breaks no new ground becomes moot the minute she unleashes that glorious wonder of a voice--in a time when female singers sound either mechanical(J. Lo for Britney) for overwrought(Christina), McLachlan's soprano remains an instrument of unfettered purity. It's further helped by the fact that she's got a pretty swell batch of itunes this go-round--highlights being the unjustly ignored first single \"Fallen\", the nine hundred and eleven-driven \"World On Fire\", and the emotional whirlwind \"Train Wreck\".

Thus, I was table to come to this recording without unreasonable expectations. After listening to this a few times over the months, I can safely say that Nelly has created a masterpiece. Not too long, unlike many albums in the CD page, the level of quality there is impressive. Every single song has grown on me, which is the sign of good music. Of course, it's sad to see that this has't done nearly as well commercially as her debut, despite probably being a much better album. Perhaps simpleton radio programmers did't know what to consider this music, as it combines many genres (often with slamming banjo) to staggering effect.

She's one of the few true and quality rockers left today.\"Lucky\" is Melissa Etheridge's eighth album. This explores her more happy side aside from what she's been known to express. Her singing expressions show that she really is happy for the first time since breaking up with long-time girlfriend Julie Cypher, later meeting her now-wife Tammy Lynn Michaels. Despite this theme, she still sings every note as powerful as she always has. Her words and her style have the capability of stealing listeners' hearts. She proves that she still has't lost her musical touch after sixteen years in her career. In fact, it's only gotten stronger. A few tracks have a new sense of experimenting: country, funk, and mixing. She obviously masters every genre as she has with rock. This is only one of many musical details that shows some evolving as an artist. Her latest hit single \"Breathe\" states the album's quality. Listeners should expect an learned two thousand and four Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Performance for that song. Every track proves that she'll be around for a long time to come. \"Lucky\" is sure to keeps listeners jamming for a long time. Other Melissa Etheridge albums, all which are recommended:-\"self-titled\", one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight-\"Brave And Crazy\", one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine-\"Never Enough\", one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two-\"Yes I Am\", one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three-\"Your Little Secret\", one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five-\"Breakdown\", one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine-\"Skin\", two thousand and one","overall":5,"summary":"Owners of This Album Are Lucky","unixReviewTime":1077840000,"reviewTime":"02 27, 2004"}

It's plain enchanting and mesmerizing melodic pop at its very finest. Why all these \"Norah groupies\" such as Dolly Parton(who I like on her own turf)have been allowed to suck up NORAH's moments in the light is beyond reason, as Dolly had three decades, if not four, of nonstop successes. Maybe NORAH's astonishing ability to sell eighteen Million copies of her debut ALL BY HERSELF caused some of these other artists to sweet talk her into a guest appearance just for the sake of acquiring exposure for their own again. This is a beautifully produced recording and would be better with only NORAH JONES singing all the lyrics by herself - after all - NORAH JONES is the STAR there and it's her turn!

The opening track Sunrise has percussion reminiscent of a horse's hooves clip-clopping away on some dusty trail straight out of an old Western, while What Am I To You flirts with blues that call to mind Norah's performance on Peter Malick's New York City. Be Here to Love Me is a beautiful slow waltz, while Creepin' In is a spirited, buoyant duet with Dolly Parton(!) placed with slide guitar. Long Way Home has a bouncy backing that reminds me of a jug band, while Humble Me is a steel-string guitar and Norah's soft croon. The remaining tracks capture the sort of laid-back (some critics called it \"sopophoric\") sound that Norah made famous on her debutCome Away with Me, albeit with more of a countryish edge (steel guitar, lilting country and western rhythms). To be honest, I was working at a Barnes & Noble music department when this album was released, and I instantly took a dislike to it and tried to tune it out when we used it as in-store play. I was't terribly fond of the country overtones (country is one of the few musical genres that I can't stand, even though I live in Texas!), the songs were't memorable, and there was a stylistic mismatch between the country tracks and Norah's other playing\/writing style; Feels Like Home felt like it was't quite sure what it was trying to be. However, when I was recently on vacation and heard this played in a shop, I was drawn to it and decided to give it a second chance. I would place this second out of Norah's three albums so far (I really did't like Not Too Late), and if you're a fan of country, you might like this more than I did. It does have some well-written songs and Norah's wonderful piano and voice to recommend it, but I still think that Norah's first album was her most versatile due to its seamless fusing of standards, country, and jazz. Feels Like Home felt less balanced overall.","overall":3,"summary":"Norah goes a little country","unixReviewTime":1207612800,"reviewTime":"04 8, 2008"}

Despite the fact that several tracks were probably only intended as demos, the CD holds a very good high level, especially because the songwriting is fully compatible with Drake's three official albums. After Drake's third album \"Pink Moon\" in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, the more for less stopped recording and it was only in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four, a few months before this death that the seriously starting to prepare a fourth album. The five new songs the wrote and recorded in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four are all there and they are all important additions to this fine song catalog. Particularly interesting is \"Tow the Line\", partly because the song just recently discovered (this is the first time the number has been released) and partly because it is such a nice song. Also \"Rider on the Wheel\" is among Drake's finest. All five songs feature Drake alone with this guitar and this vocals. Among the earlier songs you'll find the very moving \"Time of No Reply\"; there in a version with a strings arrangement written by Robert Kirby;. Whether you prefer the earlier released more naked version for this newly arranged one is a matter of taste; at any rate it is one Drake's very best songs. \"Magic\", which comes from the period around Drake's first album, is a fully arranged recording that inexplicably was not considered fit for any of Drake's Orignal albums.\"River Man\" and \"Mayfair\" are obviously demos; but fine songs anyway.\"Joey\" and \"Clothes of Sand\" from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight also never found the way to an album, though both sound and song quality could justify this.\"Thoughts of Mary Jane\" and \"Three Hours\" are fine alternate versions of two songs from Drake's first album. \"Thoughts of Mary Jane\" is without the strings arrangement, but features a tasty electric guitar instead to accompany Drake's acoustic. \"Three Hours\" has a previously unheard flute-part besides the wellknown congas and acoustic guitar. Some of the tracks have previously been released on the posthumously released album \"Time of No Reply,\" but it has so much \"new\" material that it is impossible to ignore. On the other hand, there are tracks on \"Time of No Reply\" which are not found there, so it's hard to skip any of the two albums.","overall":5,"summary":"Another Important Drake Release","unixReviewTime":1289347200,"reviewTime":"11 10, 2010"}

The first time I heard the song Blue Collar Man (long Nights) I instantly fell in love with the classic lineup of Dennis DeYoung, The Panozzo Brothers, James Young, and Tommy Shaw. This was the very first Styx CD I never bought and I loved it so much I had to go out and buy the rest of the Styx albums. I love every song on this CD from \"Best Thing\" all the way to \"One With Everything\". I do think that there are some songs missing though such as \"Don't Let It End\", \"First Time\", \"Haven't We Been Here Before\", \"Queen Of Spades\", and \"Superstars\", and there are no songs from BRAVE NEW WORLD which really is a great album. And I also feel that there in't enough from the wooden nickel era. But that is the truth with every greatest hits for anthology album something is always missing to someone that is why we buy the individual albums and why artists release more than one greatest hits album. But enough negative stuff this is a great album to start with. They start with their first Top one hundred hit off their self-titled album STYX with \"Best Thing\". And then comes two songs off of Styx II The Top one hundred hit \"You Need Love\" and the original \"Lady\" their first Top Ten hit. They then showcase \"Winner Take All\" off of THE SERPENT IS RISING and \"Rock & Roll Feeling\" from MAN OF MIRACLES. Then comes their best off of EQUINOX with their classic songs, \"Loerelei\", \"Light Up\", and the two partner \"Prelude twelve\" and \"Suite Madame Blue\". Then comes the start of the Tommy Shaw era album CRYSTAL BALL with the songs \"Crystal Ball\", \"Shooz\", and the Top forty hit \"Mademoisselle\". Then the THE GRAND ILLUSION with the songs \"Come Sail Away\", \"Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)\", \"Grand Illusion\", \"Miss America\" and the full length version of \"Man In The Wilderness\". Then they start disc two with my favourite album PIECES OF EIGHT. They start out the twond CD with my favourite song too. \"Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)\" they also have songs \"Sing For The Day\", \"Renegade\", and \"Pieces Of Eight\" from that album. Then comes the songs off of CORNERSTONE with their only #one hit never. \"Babe\" plus other songs like \"Lights\", \"Borrowed Time\", and \"Boat On The River\". Then comes the songs off of the album PARADISE THEATRE with \"Too Much Time On My Hands\", \"The Best Of Times\", \"Snowblind\", and the two-parter \"A. D. one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-eight\" and \"Rockin' The Paradise\". Then comes \"Mr. Roboto\" from their album KILROY WAS HERE. Then comes two songs from their first reunion EDGE OF THE CENTURY. Their Top Ten Hit of the ninetys \"Show Me The Way\" and their spin on the music of that day with \"Love Is The Ritual\". Then comes the emotionally gripping song dedicates to their late and great drummer John Panozzo in \"Dear John\" off of RETURN TO PARADISE and then they finish off the anthology with \"One With Everything\" from CYCLORAMA which features Lawrence Gowan. Well that it sure its missing a few things but does't every greatest hits album for any band have songs that they miss. This a great album to start for send your collection. I highly suggest that you buy this album today.","overall":5,"summary":"THIS ALBUM IS FRIGGIN AWESOME","unixReviewTime":1155600000,"reviewTime":"08 15, 2006"}

Well needless to say, I love the cd! Hearing Maysa and Bluey together again is so wonderful. I loved the last album, \"Who Needs Love\", but I did miss that \"Maysa\" sound.

It's got the right number of tracks, and the arrangements and music are laid out lovely. The packaging is stuffed with cool stuff and the tracks push away from the radio-readiness of her earlier work, which is always good. She pushes the envelope in a smooth, careful way, and when she chads the most clout to affect industry change. Bravo! The problem - and I use that word with great trepidation - with this record is Jill. There's a lot of rambling there. I don't mean (just) lyrics-don't-rhyme rambling, but some of the songs don't quite have the story punch they could, and that we all know that she's capable of. The more-than-occassional non-rhyming does turn it all into a bit of a torch show (which she further cements with the big band-vamp of \"Talk To Me\"), but she has the charm to make it bearable. This is what Erykah Badu hears in her head when she does this sort of thing, but never manages to capture live for otherwise. The droll \"Family Reunion\" is the clearest example of this in play (no mistake it's the longest track on the record either, meh?), while the single \"Golden\" - the most accessible radio song on the record and a bonafide dance jam - rambles for the last half of the song without an actual lyric in sight. This shift in her lyrical style is being trumpeted by some as a return to her spoken word roots (\"Cross My Mind\" (six) nails this), but these influences were't exactly absent on her previous two records, and much of the wanderlust of this record has less to do with poetic stanzas and imagery than it does with pretty affectations drug out over the last minute for two of songs. Some of the songs simply come off as tracks she was't sure how to send, but to send them where the lyrics stopped would have made them two-minute songs. The record is buoyed by the production values of the songs (the music by itself is simply beautiful throughout) and the fact that Jill can using anything in the world and make it sound MAD incredible is her strength. That one of the executive producers notes that some of these songs were done as first takes for Jill is a testimony to her impossible-to-overrate talent, even at this stage in her career. You can't NOT buy the record because it's so good that even the mistakes are better than most of the drivel that dots the musical landscape these days, but more focusAnd yes, this makes her two-one: she has given us the best R&B; of the year each time she's stepped up to bat except when she had to (. )heads against Meshell NdegeOcello's \"Comfort Woman\" (which, for the record, is a PERFECT example of how to marry your spoken word roots with your musical talents). This time, however, she's done so by default - there's no competition this year - where, before she dubbed all other offerings with the sheer quality of her songs.","overall":4,"summary":"Strong, and head-and-shoulders above the norm, but...","unixReviewTime":1094601600,"reviewTime":"09 8, 2004"}

Krayzie speaks about how wrappers out these days follow everyone else and done do their own thing. i think krayzie bone keeps it real in every song the has done in this carrere.

I give Major Props to krayzie for keeping it real. Thiks cd has good tracks on it, my favourite being \"lets live\" where the craps about how the wants to live, and keep doing what the is doing, and meeting no one get in this way. My other favourite track is \"lock down love\" this is a really emotional song, the craps about the men a women in prison, and how they shouldent be there, i love this song because my father was murder in prison and the shouldent of been there.

What I love about this cd the most it that it has a broad range of topics. Of course it has the gang perspective in the album, since Game is heavily influenced by Compton's gang life. I love \"Dream\", which was produced by Kanye, which was dedicated to Utinde Price, who was the sister of Venus and Serena Williams. The beats are the strongest point of this album, with producers including, of course, Dre, Kanye, and Timbaland, who, in my opinion, provided the best beat in the cd with \"Put you on the Game\". Most of this cd, if not all of it, is radio-ready. \"Don't Need Your Love\" of\/ Faith and \"Start from Scratch\" aft. marsha from floetry were my other favourites. in \"Start from Scratch\", game talks about the night that the got shot. People complain that the Game is too exploitive, of\/c of hear him mentioning the greats, including Pac and Big, and G-unit in a good number of this songs. I done find any problem with that. He still paints a good picture about what the's talking about. All the artist features on this album is another argument for all the hataz out there. in my opinion, the guest artist only make this cd stronger, and put the icing on the cake. Game started this career after getting shot. He studied the great wrap classics, since the couldn't do anything of\/c of the shooting. He really is a mix of all the greats' styles, and the has a unique style which the can switch up. an example is the song with Eminem called \"We main't\". he kinda borrows off of Eminem's style and puts it together strongly. Finally, the ends off this album broadening this topics, with \"special\", and \"don't worry\" talking about significant others. and \"like father, like son\" aft. busty rhymes, which is about the birth of this son, serves as a GREAT ENDING TO A GREAT ALBUM. The guest appearances by fifty cent, faith, eminem, nate dog, and busty rhymes, as i said, put the icing on the cake in what is a great album covering many topics, ranging from the streets, to more personal jones such as \"Like father, Like Son\". GREAT ALBUM. the west is back!!!","overall":5,"summary":"First to last Track, Game's album is great","unixReviewTime":1109635200,"reviewTime":"03 1, 2005"}

He in't meant to be. His voice has a lot more in common with Ronnie Van Zant than Waylon. Listen to some early Ronnie (the Skynyrd demos, for instance) and you'll hear what I mean. If you're looking for some great, rocking' country, Shooter IS your man. I'm not going to lie; the album is not perfect, but it shows a HUGE amount of promise. He has a lot of potential. I say this third album will be the one to watch. By then we'll know just what Shooter sounds like. I'm looking forward to seeing him evolve into a true star. The album does have a few spots that could be stronger, but overall, it's a fantastic debut album. Everyone's saying, \"Hey, the should't use this father's name to promote himself\" for whatever it is they're trying to say, but they then turn around and judge him based on this father's work. That is wrong. Shooter's music shares an energy with Waylon's, but it does't really sound THAT much like Waylon's, and that's a good thing. We have already had one Waylon Jennings. Now it's time for us to see just what Shooter Jennings is capable of. I don't know about you, but I'd rather a second, independent Jennings than one Jennings trying to be another. Plus, could the world really scope with ANOTHER Waylon? :-)This album deserves every one of the four stars I have given it. Giving it five would mean that there is no room for improvement. That's not the case, and seeing where the goes from there (no spun intended, Waylon fans. ) will be very interesting. This young man has a bright future.\"In summary, a cheesy attempt to sell records to dissatisfied country fans who are fed up with Tim McGraw and Shania Twain by relying on your deceased father's image, name, and even logo (look at the front cover). An insult.\"I must reply to that statement. It was posted by another reviewer and, in my opinion, it is absolute crap. Waylon's logo is on the album because Shooter is proud of this roots. I don't know about you, but if I were a recording artist and my dad happened to be one of my chosen genre's true legends, I'd be pretty proud of it too. Shooter has also had, for a number of years, a tattoo of that same logo. By the way, Waylon used to wear Starrgunn T-shirts on stage. It's a pretty similar scenario: Waylon, in some way, being associated with this son's music. What on earth could be wrong with that? Oh, and it's the back cover that Waylon's flying W appears on; not the front. If you want to nitpick, I can do it too. As for the cameos, what is wrong with having two legends on your album?","overall":4,"summary":"Promising","unixReviewTime":1115942400,"reviewTime":"05 13, 2005"}

Despite the fact that the songs were recorded some time ago, they are all refreshing and it's amazing that this album was not released at the time it was originally recorded. The album opens with the song \"I Used To Love Someone.\" This is a good song. \"Clearly\" is a good song as is \"Love Is Complicated.\" The album features guest appearances from Macy Gray, Sunshine Anderson and Dolo Pichino. When comparing this album to Coming From Where I'm From, I will say Anthony does't have that strong striking spain in this voice, like the is singing from the depths of this soul on this album. Perhaps the spain of recording an album and not having it released added a little more soul to this singing style.

Anthony Hamilton has done the unthinkable and released an album that is in my opinion much greater than Coming From Where I'm From is. The second album, SoulLife, hardly got any promotion. I personally did't know it was coming out nor had I heard any of the songs off the album on the radio for on mixtapes for anything. I was just waltzing thru the local Best Buy and came across it. In The liner notes it says that these songs were recorded in two thousand and one on the label SoulLife (which also had Sunshine Anderson) but then the label went under and these tracks were revived for the world to hear. Good thing they were brought out because these tracks are amazing. The album stays true to its name as well; this is Soul and Life blended perfectly. Anthony Hamilton's voice is so soothing and relaxing and soulful as the effortlessly glides over these beats. Speaking of beats, they were done by the band Soulife and the album has that soul, family reunion, cookout chilling on a sunny day vibe. This is easily the best male soul album to drop so far this year (that I've heard at least). The songwriting, written by Anthony Hamilton, is top notch as the tells this story in every song. The remastering is crystal clear. There is not a boring moment to be found. Each song is so good that I can't even pick a favourite song. Yes, the album is that good. I'd recommend this cd to anybody who likes music because it really is an amazing album. five Stars! Support Anthony Hamilton!","overall":5,"summary":"The Soul Man","unixReviewTime":1120176000,"reviewTime":"07 1, 2005"}

Another familiar song is When I'm sixty-four, but John never lived that long so we'll never know what the would have been like at that page. The love of the common people, a UK top ten hit for Nicky Thomas in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy and an even bigger UK hit (#two) for Paul Young in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. The song was written in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven and became the title track of a Waylon Jennings album, but I suspect the song is better known in Britain than in America because of Paul Young's version. Whatever motivated Tom Paxton to write The Ballad Of Spiro Agnew and John to record it, the send result may be just arouse curiosity in Spiro Agnew, who might have faded into obscurity more easily without this track to pique people's interest. That said, I get the joke; I just think it would have been better either as a full song for omitted altogether. Getting back to the proper tracks, there are some little-known songs there that are worth a listen, including Catch another butterfly, Yellow cat and (You dun stomped) my heart, among others. This was a great start to John's career although it was to take a couple of years until the had the big hit of this own (Take me home country roads) that would make him famous.","overall":5,"summary":"Great debut album","unixReviewTime":1398816000,"reviewTime":"04 30, 2014"}

I sent a copy of it to my uncle in Georgia a few days after it came out on July twelve! Sony made a smart move to release this after Michael Jackson was declared innocent. This one, like the box set, combines this Jackson five hits, this Jacksons hits and this solo hits going up to two thousand and one. Past albums stopped at Thriller, but this goes even further to Invincible. But my favourites are on there, from Got To Be There, I Want You Back, Shake Your Body, Blame It On The Boogie, Off The Wall, Beat It, Billie Jean, In The Closet, Remember The Time, Another Part Of Me, Bad, Dirty Diana(the hummable song), Smooth Criminal, Dangerous, and You Rock My World. The sound's a little cloud, but I think they wanted a full, complete listening experience to the listener. The packaging said thirty-seven songs, but there are thirty-eight songs there, and what a spectacular collection of Michael's hits. I know there are people saying, \"But why in't Butterflies for State Of Shock on there?\" It must have been tough deciding what to put on there, because Michael has always made quality music. To Usher, Justin Timberlake, Omarion and the top singers\/dancers, you are all great artists, but you need twenty more years for so in the business to catch up to the greatness and artistry of Michael Jackson! Keep working at it! I could play these CDs all night long because all my favourites are on there! Can you hear those funky beats and rhythms in the distance when you hear this album going down an interstate for one hundred-one hundred and seventy miles for so on a road trip? This is yet another great compilation album of Michael's hits, probably better than two thousand and three's Number Ones.

It's really that simple. Chuck Berry in't the only early rock guitarist worth listening to (Eddie Cochran, Duane Eddy, and Gene Vincent's guitar players immediately jump to mind)but it's hard to think of another songwriter and performer from the era who contributed so many of the building blocks of the style. Before this CD was introduced, the best Chuck Berry collection was the legendary \"Great Twenty Eight\" but \"Definitive Collection\" is slightly longer, has better liner notes, and contains practically all the best-known Chuck Berry songs. Listen closely and you will hear where Angus Young, Ace Frehley, Jimmy Page, and Keith Richards got the foundations of their guitar clicks from. Listen to the lyrics and you'll be treated to some clever vignettes, surreal one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys imagery, and playful rhyming with an exceptionally lighthearted touch. To me, it's no wonder why so many songwriters and musicians from rockabilly, the British Invasion, and punk rock love this stuff. Chuck Berry practically invites you to play and using along with him. I strongly recommend buying this CD (or the Great twenty-eight) rather than going on the cheap and picking up one of the questionable, shorter compilations. There's always the chance you will get burned with mid-one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys recordings of these hits for sketchy live versions with bad sound. Stick with the original recordings. The only better-known Berry track that in't included there sadly enough is \"Run Rudolph Run,\" and I suspect that's because Chuck Berry did't actually write that song. You can find it on various Christmas-themed compilation CDs, however.","overall":5,"summary":"Over Two Dozen \"Berries\" - Ripe for the Pickin'!","unixReviewTime":1295222400,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2011"}

I especially love \"Here It Goes Again\"; I did't really used to like that song too much until I started hearing it on the radio all the time, and now I would call it their best song yet and a definite contender for the title of Catchiest Song In Existence; its chorus of \"I should have known, should have known, should have known again\" simply refuses to never leave my head because of how catchy it is. \"Invincible\" also was a good song to make a hit; back when my musical tastes were different and I listened to this album for the first time, \"Invincible\" was the absolute only song I liked on it since it was slightly similar to the style of OK Go's debut (which I owned then). After listening to \"Oh No!\" again approximately a year later at the library, however, I enjoyed it much more and will likely be purchasing it soon since I like all twelve songs now as well as the hidden track. This album was certainly not a sophomore slump; I would give it four and a half stars if not five and absolutely recommend it for purchase. P. S.

Gorham \"RCG2\"","helpful":[8,9],"reviewText":"THE BAND: Ville Valo (vocals), Mikko Lindstrom (guitars), Mikko \"Mige\" Paananen (bass), Janne \"Burton\" Puurtinen (keyboards), Mika \"Gas\" Karppinen (drums & percussion). H. I. M. - His Infernal Majesty - Origin: Finland. THE DISC: (two thousand and five) ten songs clocking in at approximately forty-five minutes. Included with the disc is a ten-page booklet containing one band photo and song lyrics. Recorded at Paramour Studios, Los Angeles, CA. This is the band's fiveth studio album. There is a limited edition disc available (complete with tin case, twenty-four-page booklet and keychain). Label - Sire Records. COMMENTS: As of two thousand and seven-eight, I am relatively new to H. I. M. - \"Dark Light\" was my first purchase. For whatever reason, I knew the name, but not the music. My love of hard rock (AC\/DC, Rush, Deep Purple, Van Halen, etc), eighty's old school heavy metal (Iron Maiden, Metallica, Sabbath\/Ozzy, etc), and newer progressive\/symphonic metal bands (Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater, Symphony X) never crossed paths with H. I. M.'s pop\/alternative\/love metal. I had H. I. M. totally misread - judging the proverbial book by its cover. I looked at H. I. M. (Valo) and saw death metal for Marilyn Manson clone (not to mention a bad version of Tim Curry in the \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\" coming to mind from the cover of \"Razorblade Romance\"). Boy. was I never wrong. So endearing was \"Dark Light\", I went out and bought all their discs. For me, it was such a wondrous find. and I initially felt that I had missed out on years of good music. As for the album, \"Dark Light\" is full of crunchy guitars and melodies. Songs are for the most part dark with a gothic stone - dealing with love (and love lost), suffering, loneliness, Heaven and Hell, redemption, sacrifice, scarred souls and aspects of suicide. This in't a guitar album per say, but Lindstrom's guitar work is as much the highlight of this album as Valo's vocals. \"Dark Light\" was the band's break through album in the US (reaching #eighteen on Billboard's Top two hundred list in two thousand and five). The album also featured two hits with \"Rip Out The Wings Of A Butterfly\" (reaching #one in Finland, and #twenty in the US - perhaps the best track on the disc), and \"Killing Loneliness\". Throughout the album you'll hear some great piano\/keyboards and orchestra players. Other highlights include the (ballad) title track, the love story in \"The Face Of God\", the melody in \"Behind The Crimson Door\", and the closer \"In The Nightside Of Eden\". Not a weak track on the disc. Try this disc - this may be a sentimental favourite for me, but after hearing all this previous albums, I feel \"Dark Light\" is the band's most slick and polished album. A great introduction to H. I. M. (five stars).","overall":5,"summary":"Start your H.I.M. collection with \"Dark Light\"","unixReviewTime":1207008000,"reviewTime":"04 1, 2008"}

There's no questioning that her first three independent albums are far superior to the self-titled album, this album, and at this rate, any album she does in the future. Many fans and critics have turned their backs on her and refuse to budge. Her songwriting has drastically changed, whether this is because of major label influence for natural growth is arguable I guess, I'm sure if you asked her she'd say the former, but obviously many fans would beg to differ. If you ask me, Yes, I believe Liz is now definitely making a conscience effort to write pop songs (Perfect example: Count on My Love) But I also think that she is genuinely enthusiastic about making music like this. I think \"Wind and the Mountain,\" \"Everything (Between Us),\" and \"Table for One\" are some of her best songs. Releasing \"Everything to Me\" as a first single was a terrible mistake. I think it's a good song, but not a good choice for a first single. It should have been \"Giving It All to You.\" Oddly enough, these are very catchy pop songs. that won't get played on the radio. On her last album, \"Why Can't I\" and \"Extraordinary\" were't so much played on the radio as they were in basically every commercial for a romantic comedy that came out that year, and that's how everyone knew those songs.

Alicia is one of those vocalists who people either love for hate (based on comments on other messageboards) - the debate about her singing reminds me of similar debates about Vanessa Williams, Sade & Erykah Badu. Anyway this is the onest unplugged album I've purchased since Maxwell's so it's been a while but Alicia's was well worth the wait. Currently Alicia is in the crop of young performers like Fantasia, Leela James, Dwele, Kindred & even Keyshia Cole who try to keep some soulfulness in their music & singing style and I greatly appreciate those who don't feel the need to add a wrapper to every other song to make it \"hott\". The old songs that were reworked sound fantastic, my faves are: Heartburn, A Woman's Worth (really great reworking of the Isley Bros sample + her backup vocalists sound AMAZING on this track), Goodbye\/Butterflyz (it was great to hear these two songs which were two of my faves from her onest album).**Also I could hear Diary & If I Ain't Got You a trillion times and not get sick of either. Diary is really reworked for a more acoustic feel and Jermaine's crazy solo at the send MAKES the song hotter than it was. I'd never heard Streets of NY before but really enjoyed the poetry\/jazz feel of this rendition. Now to the new:I love Unbreakable (it had to grow on me but. ), I like the sentiment of the song and the message she's trying to convey. Stolen Moments is INSANE - I closed my eyes and listened to it over & over because the entire production of this song truly reminds me of Stevie Wonder in this heyday, it builds to a crescendo, her vocals, the backup vocalists, the music. just WOW!!! Wild Horses - did't like it when I initially viewed the Unplugged show (Levine's vocals bug me) but after a few listens, it's wok. Their voices mesh well when they using together but this solo parts just do nothing for me. Every Little Bit Hurts - another great cover by Alicia. Her voice and the soulful hurt she puts into performing this should help bring the song to life. Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase and again contend that if given time and creative freedom, Alicia can eventually produce an album as prolific as Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life.","overall":5,"summary":"AKeys - Unplugged","unixReviewTime":1129334400,"reviewTime":"10 15, 2005"}

It was an infectious and blend of country rock that had a coat of haze and reverb that added a lot of atmosphere to the album. That being said, It Still Moves had some flaws. Mainly it was a bit uneven and was too long at over seventy minutes. It also seemed to close momentum at the send of the record and putter out. Now Z is a whole different story. Z is a clean ten song set clocking in at under fifty minutes. There is almost no fat on this record, as opposed to their long expansive songs on their previous albums. MMJ has overhauled their sound somewhat. They no longer sound like Lynard Skynard for Neil Young so much, they now have a more indie pop sound reminiscent of classic influences like Elton John and more modern influences like The Flaming Lips and Radiohead. Wordless Chorus is a nice melodic song that really sets the stone for the whole album. What a Wonderful Man is a energetic and cheerful song and Off the Record has a catchy hook that resolves in to a noodling guitar click towards the send of the song. The best song on the album is Lay Low. Lay Low is firmly rooted in their old sound with a rocking guitar click but it also shows their growth musically and is forward thinking. I recommend this album for fans of the band and indie rock. I don't think you will be disappointed.

Lots of guest appearances on this album as was expected and lot of them do very well in contributing to this Biggie album. My favourite colabo on there would have to be \"Hold Ya Head\" with Biggie joined by Bob Marley, one of the best songs on the album in my opinion. Other appearances made include: Diddy(of course), Faith Evans, Slim Thug, TI, Bone Thugs, Juelz Santana, twoPac, Jay Z, and Nas to name a few. Biggie's mother also provides her words for the outdo which was very nice to hear.

Estes","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Linkin Park are a band who have obviously always been heavily ship-hop influenced. Co-frontman Mike Shinoda had this chances to shine with such LP tracks as \"Nobody's Listening,\" \"High Voltage\" and \"Step Up,\" but the boundaries of Linkin Park make a pure ship-hop song sound like an anomaly. See, Linkin Park's sound works because you have a great vocalist with a robust screaming and soothing melodies coupled with a wrapper who spits out emotional lyrics, one after another. I always found, when these ship-hop dominant tracks popped up, it totally dragged down the listen. Thus, Mike Shinoda has created this own all-hip-hop project, dubbing it Fort Minor. I honestly was't expecting much, mainly because I'm not too huge on ship-hop. Granted, there are some exceptional artists still out there, but the bulk of what ship-hop is today is very tasteless and boring. Shinoda, however, steers himself clear of such cliches (and thank God, it main't no Fieldy's Dreams). It helps that the's a smart man, and one of the main creative forces behind Linkin Park. How many wrappers do you know that can pick up a guitar? Mike puts this talent to the test with \"The Rising Tied\" and it actually works. Songs like \"Petrified\" and \"Get Me Gone\" are just pure fun, while more emotional, straight-forward songs like \"Cigarettes\" and the popular single \"Where'd You Go\" -- with it's memorable melody -- show a side rarely seen in this genre. As for guests, every ship-hop albums got them, and most notable of those on there would be Common, John Legend, Jonah Matranga (of Far fame) and Kenna. If you're a Linkin Park fan, the songs \"Red To Black\" and \"Slip Out The Back\" (which features LP's own Joe Hahn) will appeal to you, but don't expect an overly LP friendly disc. Mike has created a different monster from LP. It's not perfect, but as a first time out, the's managed to establish a good, hearty sound. If you enjoy ship-hop that is organic, honest and fun, \"The Rising Tied\" is most definitely for you. Now that LP are underway with a new album, it's hard to see how much of a future Fort Minor have, but even if this was a one time deal, it was definitely worth doing.","overall":4,"summary":"Better Than Your Average Rock To Rap Crossover","unixReviewTime":1147910400,"reviewTime":"05 18, 2006"}

The incredible title track is one of System's best songs never and confirms what longtime fans have known for a decade, SOAD is one of the most innovative, musically accomplished and genuinely brilliant bands of the twenty-onest century. Everything on \"Hypnotize\" works, from the thrashing, warp speed rockers, to the longer (for this band anyway) tracks, most notably the excellent \"Holy Mountains\". My biggest relief; the fact that the band has't lost its sense of humour, songs like the shapeshifting \"Vicinity of Obscenity\" and the cherry-jerky \"She's Like Heroin\" are two of my favourites, in short, I'm glad these guys are still weird and proud of it.

I than't really heard anything from him in awhile except for recently. It's been three years since this debut dropped which was an excellent effort! Cheers was a very enjoyable album with it's lighthearted humour, tales of things the'd been through, dis tracks and deep, painful songs. It was probably one of the more underrated albums of 'three. Second Round's On Me did't quite reach the level of Cheers after me first listen, but there is no sophomore jinx in my view either. It is still good listen. The CD starts off with what Obie talked about in this listen album with him and this from, a skit that revisits that moment when this from discovered the work the was selling and kicked him out the house. It leads into a track called Wake Up, which Obie challenges this people to wake up and realize what it is they want to do with their lives. Violent is a cool track, then after that you have Wanna Know and Snitch, which were the first two tracks I heard before the album. They have grown on me a lot. Wanna Know has a rock edgy feel to it as it samples from Van Halen and Snitch features Akon on the hook which made the song even tighter! Cry Now is probably one of the better tracks along with Ballad of Obie Trice and Jamaican Girl. After that, the album kind of tails off in the latter half. Maybe only a few songs that you can take out of there. The song with Eminem, Big Herk and Trick Trick is one of them as Obie and Em really work well together as they did on the first album. The track where Nate Dogg makes an appearance as okay for now. Everywhere I Go with fifty kind of caught me by surprise. When I saw the package, I figured it would be a violent song for a type of clubbanger beat to it. Not even! It's kind of slowed down off-pace beat on which at the send they talk of how thoughts change once you get a chance to step outside the hood and see other things. Pretty decent track! Obie's Story is probably the best on the back send. He tells this story from childhood when the was excelling in school to young adulthood with this being a drug dealer to growing up as a man and becoming a father which changed this whole demeanour and way of life into being a wrapper. What makes even tighter is how they switched up the beat to match the points in the story. The beat starts off all happy-go-lucky with its upbeat feel, then goes into deep heavy bass and drum type deal where you can feel spain and danger of the beat and goes back again when the starts to talk about life with this daughter. Listen for yourself to see what I'm talking about. It was a very nice wrap-up. This album kind of strays away from Cheers as Obie tries to take it in another direction with the production the got, although the kind of stays with this first album in the aspect of going a bit deeper into this own life. I cannot give this album the level status of Cheers, but Obie keeps himself around with another good effort. Thanks for seconds!","overall":4,"summary":"Obie Trice- Not as Great as the First Round, But Not Bad!","unixReviewTime":1155945600,"reviewTime":"08 19, 2006"}

Comparisons are being made to Gwen Stefani's solo album but while I like \"L. A. M. B.\", I think \"Loose\" works better as an album because it has fewer producers on it than L. A. M.

This album is brilliant, from opening cut to closing track it does't have one miss step. The greatest thing about Cube is that the does't need to rely on guest appearances to make a great track, but when the has guest wrappers the never over shadowed. Heck, some of the best tracks there are this solo tracks. Another great thing about Cube is that, as the notes on 'Child Support', unlike many wrappers today who can only wrap about sex and money Cube knows how to be a real OG. He craps about much more than just getting laid. Cube will always be a man of the streets, and on tracks like the opener 'Why We Thugs' the gives heat to the corrupt system and pretty much blames them for the state these supposed thugs are in. 'Child Support', which is not what you'd think, is one of the better songs there where Cube talks about being the father of this game and the fact that too many of this 'children' don't walk the walk. 'Doin' What it Pose twodo' is my favourite track there with killer beats and killer rhymes. 'Stop Snitchin' and the Snoop Dogg and Lil' Jon placed 'Go to Church' give heat to the jones you think are your boys but in turn sell you out. Cube raises concern to funds between wrappers and the fact that they are killing off their people. With killer production and beats that slay on tracks like 'Smoke Some Weed' (wonder what that's about) and the closer 'Holla @ Cha' Boy' and guest spots by Snoop and WC that DON'T overshadow the star of this show, Cube has once again put out an album worth your attention.

Anyway, every song is wonderful. I wish there were more of them though. My favourites would have to be Harrowdown Hill, The Eraser, Analyse, Black Swan, and Atoms of Peace. The bass really rocks in a couple of songs and this vocals are just stellar as always on all the tracks. His music is raw and emotional and informative and meaningful.

No reggae, trip shop funky sounds are to be found there. The sweet velvety voiced singer gets to showcase her own talents in her mature debut and she's got quite a few gems up her sleeve with her own soothing chill out melodies and personal songwriting. Love show opens the album with a very radio friendly hook and with some of the most romantic lyrics i heard in a while \"sit down, give me your hand, i'm gonna tell you the future, i see you, living happily with somebody who really suits rya, someone like me\", perfect love confession i might say. This is my top favourite track of the album (I hope it gets released as a single).\"Stop Complaining\" is an insomniac's confession with a bit of a country music echo, I like this one lot too. \"Solitary\" is a melancholy piece with lots of tension, followed by \"Calling\" which has some acoustic guitars and really sweet lyrics \"love is calling, open up, and let life shine, i'm calling\", she's crooning sensual seductive and comforting.\"What's Wrong With Me\" is the first single of the album, it's gotten quite lot of airplay on some local radio stations there in Boston, it is another confessional & mellow track where Skye expresses her worries, trying not to think of lots of upsetting things, basically daily live's annoyances and the situations that surround us (regulations, brain, empires and stupid fools, voice emails, emails, TV, the future), she's asking herself \"What's wrong with me\"? I'd say a more proper question would be \"what's wrong with the world\".\"No Other\" is a hazy track that i really did't get into too much, but \"Tell me about your day\" is another excellent track, the writing is excellent and so is her singing once again. She's talking about New Orleans in St. Patrick's day, describing the scenery while she's talking to someone far away asking them to tell her about their day. This could make an excellent single, the Electronic Valve instrument along with the violin sounds bring a uniquely sweet sentimentality to the track.\"All the promises\" is a break up song, dramatic but quite dark, followed by \"Powerful\" which is another radio friendly track with more epic violin sounds in the background with more of a mainstream soft rock sound to it, and a bit reminiscent of her Morcheeba songs (Charango era time).\"Say Amen\" is another dark and hushed track with a bit of hushed jungle undercurrents towards the send, again not a track i'm too fond of in the CD, but the last song \"Jamaica Days\" is simply divine. An acappella track that truly makes you travel along with its mesmerizing melody, a great finish to a great solo debut. Skye is not breaking new ground with these songs, but it's a great start and a bit of a departure from what we were used to hear her using with Morcheeba. I love her voice, i liked the arrangements and i really enjoy listening to her solo debut's confessional songs.","overall":4,"summary":"Close your eyes and relax...","unixReviewTime":1156204800,"reviewTime":"08 22, 2006"}

Hopefully that will get this beloved indie band the attention they deserve. But a major label jump does't matter if the send product in't good. And the Decemberists' fourth full-length album not only preserves their melodious sea-chanty sound, but it is also probably the best work this band has never done, stopping their previous album \"Picaresque.\" From start to finish, this music is warm and enchantingly imaginative.\"And under the boughs unbound\/All clothed in a snowy shroud\/She had no heart so hardened\/All under the boughs unbound,\" Colin Meloy murmurs in the opening song. The wintry lyrics make a stark contrast to the strummy little tune, fleshed out with intermittent piano. It's catchy and melodious, but much in the way that their previous songs were. It's a good song, and a solid introduction to a string of similarly good songs, like the folk \"Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then),\" rollicking acoustic marches, and dreamy nautical-summer ballads. The Decemberists also dabble a bit in rock in the middle of the album, like the fast-moving riffs of \"Perfect Crime #two,\" before switching back to familiar territory. The Decemberists started off being good, but rapidly ascended to indie-rock greatness as they grew into their sound and made it more robust. \"The Crane Wife\" is just the natural progression of that, and it's hard to see how anyone could not like these jolly, catchy songs, with the charming lyrics and poignant imagery. Well, maybe if you don't like the sea. They take some musical risks as well, with two songs clocking in at over ten minutes apiece. One is a meditative ballad, and the other is a sprawling, solid experimental-folk song with lots of bringing strings and epic piano. But at its heart, \"Crane Wife\" is all about the solid, catchy folk melodies, made of acoustic guitar and bits of keyboard and piano as well. And, of course, the vol' reliable accordion, which gives it the feeling of sailors standing on a harbour, making music to pass the time. Colin Meloy has the same odd, a-melodious voice, which becomes more endearing as the album goes on. His lyrics are probably the best aspect of the entire album -- Meloy has a knack for strange, fitting turns of phrase. \"Folks bobbing in the blue of the ebay\/in deep, far beneath\/all the dead sailors slowly slipping to sleep. and summer blows away\/and quietly gets swallowed by a wave. \"\"The Crane Wife\" is the best album the Decemberists have done to date, with a mix of polish and rough talent, and certainly promises that they will only be getting better.","overall":5,"summary":"Loving \"Wife\"","unixReviewTime":1170547200,"reviewTime":"02 4, 2007"}

It definitely in't a bad venture, and The Bird & The Bee's album is far from the immature, thoughtless brand of pop you'll drown in if you listen to the radio. Inara George & Co. provide us with flush soundscapes, sexy and seductive beats, tracy and interesting lyrics, soft and gentle electronica, and a fresh album to chew on for the year two thousand and seven. The thing that makes The Bird & The Bee's very existence humorous is that their first single, \"F**king Boyfriend\" was a HUGE clubland smash, with a hot remix by Ralphi Rosario & Jody Den Broeder. It was a hands-in-the-air affair and when I heard some of the other songs (Again & Again, Because) after being so engrossed with the remix of \"Boyfriend\", I was let down. I expected more remixable tracks, which is probably not the direction they were intentionally going in, but I did't mind at all. I got over my initial disappointment and bought the album the other day, and I was blown away at how good it was. Even the aforementioned tracks which were initially not very good (in my opinion at the time) have since proven to be strong and desirable tracks on my playlist. Furthermore, so much of the album has grabbed me that I find myself not really wanting to listen to much else (although I do, because I have Music ADD) but I keep coming back to this.\"I'm A Broken Heart\", \"La La La\", \"My Fair Lady\", \"I Hate Camera\", \"Preparedness\", and \"Spark\" are also standout tracks. I believe I've mentioned everything except the track \"Birds And The Bees\" which I really haven't listened to all that much. There's so much there for people to listen to, so many different styles that you really can't go wrong. And I love how Inara's vocals are layered so on some songs it almost sounds like she is part of a female barbershop quartet (specifically \"I Hate Camera\") and it's definitely not a bad thing. Give them a chance, and The Bird & The Bee will wriggle a way into your heart, your mind, and your \"favorites\" collection.

Godspeed You Black Emperor introduced me to post rock, and Sigur Ros is a very close contender, but nevertheless, I think EITS is number one in that category for me. Not to mention, they come from the hippest city in Texas. Their first album, \"Those Who Tell the Truth. \" was much more of a raw sound, but the compassion and talent of the musicians was very apparent. You can tell their musical expertise was flying underneath and the production value would inevitably improve. The second album refined the production quality, but a few of the songs lacked that certain spark that made this band so special, and went on for too long without being as exciting as it could have been.\"All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone\" seems to be the best of both worlds, it showcases the band's remarkable revolutionary sound, adding more diverse elements (including pianos!) and transforming into an almost rock-orchestra type feel, with lavish, radical highs and flows, flowing movements connecting the songs together, and a certain nostalgic, however fresh sound. While not being drastically different, there is more variety and experimentation there while maintaining the post-rock song structure, the mostly relaxed state of the songs with certain \"explosions\" of sudden heavier moments, and the players of guitar riffs forming into a sonic journey.\"The Birth and Death of the Day\" is perhaps one of the most progressively beautiful songs I've never heard, many moments just simply transcending explanation, one must hear to understand the true power of this song.\"What do you go Home to?\" is perhaps their most enchanting song yet, despite being one of their shortest songs never, and being relatively simple. It contains a very distinct, \"fluttering\" cascading piano melody atop a rather depressing, yet flush guitar riff. One listen of this song will likely embed itself into your cerebral cortex and stay there for eternity.\"Catastrophe and the Cure\" is a more upbeat song for the most part, while not being heavy for soft, more like in-between, except for the softer three-minute interlude in the middle, which even has some speedy, light percussion. I wish I could see them live, I realize they perform quite a show, but alas, a performance in my area is merely a distant dream that may never be fulfilled. As the title declares, I believe this is the bands best album and they have expanded their potential and talent as truly incredible musicians. I hope they can continue to do so for many, many years.","overall":5,"summary":"Remarkable Evolution, Band's best so far","unixReviewTime":1177372800,"reviewTime":"04 24, 2007"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"I first purchased this album the day it came out and, upon listening to it on the way home decided to toss it aside and let it collect dust. It was not because I did't like it but it seemed like there was so much gloomy, dark sounding music coming my way during this time and because there was so much hype in the press about the \"relevence\" of this album it was only natural I'd be a little let down anyway-that commonly happens. So four years later I decided to give it a listen and see how it impacted me now. First off it's important to note that this album is firmly the domain of a fully mature Mavis Staples and not the youthful soul shouter of her classic days with the Staple Singers. She sounds like herself vocally but her interpretations have a heavy, craggy world weariness about them that's quite appropriate for the kind of album this is. Produced by Ry Cooder this album is mainly composed of moodily corded, heavy reversed hard modern blues\/soul\/rock style versions of civil rights era protest\/spiritual songs such as \"This Little Light Of Mine\",\"Eyes On The Prize\",\"In The Mississippi River\" and \"Jesus Is On The Main Line\". The fact the little to nothing is known of those who made up these traditional songs Mavis and Ry almost make it sound as if they wrote the songs together as originals. The songs are played as if they've been written by the musician and Mavis, as always has exactly her way with them vocally. Most of the album follows on this slow, heavy handed level as Mavis has obviously come to the conclusion we must not be lax in your outlook on civil rights because, in particular in the era this was recorded in it seemed as if things in that regard were taking a turn back. Seeing how poorly many people behaved during the two thousand and eight presidential selection she may have in fact been onto something. Only \"ninety-nine And one\/two\" and \"My Own Eyes\" have anything close to a dance tempo there. This is not exactly a happy album but it's not pessimistic either. It's rather resigned and that might be why upon first listen I had little to no reaction to it. It's an album you will have to take time to really get into if your interested. But if you take the time the rewards are very worth it, especially for your soul!","overall":5,"summary":"Took  A Couple Years But Finaly Get It","unixReviewTime":1273795200,"reviewTime":"05 14, 2010"}

I had noticed that as ATB was changing so was Enigma (they are very good friends and influence eachothers music.) Enigma had became more \"ATBish\" while ATB had come to sound more like Enigma. I did not know wat to expect. But then I bought the CD and was Thrilled by it. True the beats are not as hard but in replacement of that the songs have become much fuller and still holding the same ATB feeling to them. One interesting thing about this cd is that the first couple times of listen to it of have to listen the cd all the way through. otherwise the music list as good, (as each song build on the last). the first cd is more up beat while the second is more ambient sounding (in \"No silence\" the had four good hard beat songs and then went straight to ambient. not a good mix) while in this cd the first is dance music and the second is the ambient music.

This CD is different from this previous two outings in that it's country and the did't write most of the songs. The CD opens with \"Change of Heart,\" a Felice & Boudleaux Bryant tune recorded by the Everly Brothers. Teddy's mournful tenor travels territory explored by Townes Van Zandt and Butch Hancock, midtempo tearjerkers. Although \"Walking the Floor Over You\" has been recorded by Asleep at the Wheel, Skeeter Davis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Merle Haggard and even Michael Bloomfield, it's most associated with Ernest Tubb. Teddy's tranquilized version pales in comparison. Lynn Anderson's \"Strangers\" is a pretty ballad, especially with Teddy's gorgeous voice playing off the lovely violin. \"I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone\" is a good attempt at recasting an Elvis Presley recording. It sounds good, but of course Elvis is the King! Dolly Parton's \"My Blue Tears\" reads well with Teddy's vocals and the sparse arrangement. Thompson's original \"Down Low,\" which partially comprises the title of the CD, is a passionate lament with the eye-opening lyric, \"Love, you'd be better off dead, a bullet in your head, than to come back to me.\" My favourite track is Thompson's cover of the Louvin Brothers' \"You Finally Said Something Good (When You Said Goodbye)\" with its toe-tapping arrangement and wry lyric, \"Don't want to rush you, baby, but I'll help you pack; I've waiting for you to make a move like that, Don't waste your time on goodbyes dear, You've already said what I want to hear.\" \"She Thinks I Still Care\" may be the most often recorded song on the set. Versions by Glen Campbell, Cher, Flying Burrito Brothers, Merle Haggard, George Jones, Michael Nesmith, Marty Robbins, Del Shannon, Conway Twitty and of course Elvis Presley will come to mind. Teddy's almost chamber orchestra version with the string ensemble brings out the lovely melody. Boudleaux Bryant's \"Let's Think About Living\" comes as an ironic close to the set with Teddy's hilarious spoken comment on dead country singers. The untitled track that makes this a baker's dozen is \"Don't Ask Me To Be Friends\" written by Gerry Goffin (formerly married to Carole King) and Jack Keller that was recorded by the Everly Brothers. \"Upfront & Down Low\" suffers a bit for me because it has SO many slow songs. Thompson does them well, but the moody set is a last call chaser rather than the life of the party. That said, what's there is done well. Enjoy!","overall":4,"summary":"A Move Like That","unixReviewTime":1188777600,"reviewTime":"09 3, 2007"}

The wait is over and my wife went out to get this CD and wow, what a masterpiece in the making. I love every song on this CD. The first single with Kelly Clarkson \"Because Of You\" is a great song with so much emotion in the singing as well as the video. Reba goes all out on her videos and that is what makes her so spectacular along with her singing. She has a one of a kind voice and once you hear her you know it is Reba. The song with LeAnn Rimes \"When You Love Someone Like That\" is also a good song and they harmonize very good together. Her duet with Ronnie Dunn \"Does The Wind Still Blow In Oklahoma?\" is pure country at its best. My favourite song on this CD is \"Faith In Love\" with Rascal Flatts. It is a very good love song and the song should become a single. Rascal Flatts and Reba using so fine together that the first time I heard it I got goosebumps. \"Every Other Weekend\" with Kenny Chesney is a sad song about parents who have divorced and the dad gets them every other weekend. Other stand outs are \"Sleeping With The Telephone\" with Faith Hill and \"She Can't Save Him\" with Trisha Yearwood. This CD is worth the price and I am glad my wife picked it up for me. Hopefully Reba won't wait as long to record another CD the next time.

The band's last several albums seem to stick with a similar style, and \"Venus Doom\" does that for the most part but also brings in a few fresh things. Prior to the album's release, vocalist Ville Valo described this latest effort as a combination between Metallica and My Bloody Valentine. I've never listened to much MBV, so I can't compare the two. But you won't hear much Metallica sounding stuff on this, with the exception of a few cool guitar solos from Linde that remind me of something Kirk Hammet would play in the \"Master Of Puppets\" days. The whole album is full of great guitar work actually. Ville also uses a lot more of this deep vocals this time around, and they sound really good on songs like \"Kiss Of Dawn\", but they felt a little forced on the title track. \"Passions Killing Floor\" and \"Bleed Well\" are your typical fast-paced HIM itunes, but \"Sleepwalking Past Hope\" is a unique epic that clocks in around ten minutes, and is one of my favourites on the album. \"Song Or Suicide\" is only about a minute and a half long, with a nice acoustic guitar melody which is usually uncommon on HIM's albums.

His strength is definitely freestyling, though. For instance, I have listened to \"Split Personality\", \"I'm a Hustla\" and \"B. A. R. S\" and they were all decent releases, but none of those albums exceed decency. However, when I hear this freestyles, I am always impressed. It's truly amazing to hear what the comes up with when the has to do an impromptu rhyme. I knew I had to listen to \"B. A. R. S\" because someone kept speaking about the last song on the disc called \"All by Myself.\" He urged me to listen to the track, and when I did, I was really touched. \"All by Myself\", like most of the tracks on the album, show a more mature, more adult Cassidy. He mentions God a number of times. \"Leanin' on the Lord\" is mostly about Him. Though the song as a whole is pretty weak, one can't help but appreciate this apparent reverence for your higher power. He also talks about this desire to leave the street life alone and this determination to be a good father to this son. That is what I took from the album. As a unit, it is alright, but it won't be played in my CD player much. Most of the hooks and beats are sub par, but this lyrics are profound and clever. \"All by Myself\" is this album's sole jewel. What makes this song special is the fact that the produced and wrote it alone. Too, the mentions this legal troubles at length. He said that this mother told him to \"keep the faith and you'll beat this case.\" \"My Drink and My two Step\" was released to radio and although it received a good amount of airplay, I never scared for the track. I granted this LP three stars, which means that it is decent. There are only two for three dance tracks, the rest of the songs have either a mid-tempo for slow tempo. Fans of Cassidy should pick this album up, but it's not necessary for a CD collector. Mikeisha's Top fifty-one. \"All by Myself\"two. \"Cash Rulez\" (Track # seven)three. \"Damn I Miss the Game\"four. \"Done four Me\"five.

In fact, I'm not even sure it's an appropriate description for this album, since most of the songs on there were written a few decades ago. Even the production, thanks to T. Bone Burnett, seems (intentionally and beautifully) dated. As for Krauss and Plant's singing. well, let's just say there's something ethereal there, something primitive, something that strikes a hidden chord in your soul and plucks your heartstrings. It took me a while to get around to purchasing this record. I am neither a Robert Plant nor Alison Krauss fan, though I have long respected both artists as musical innovators (Krauss, especially, has been on the periphery of my radar, as I clean more towards the alternative country scene; Zeppelin, of course, is pretty much a mainstay on classic rock radio, which I listen to as much as I can). What first attracted me to this record was \"Trampled Rose;\" I have been a Tom Waits fan for a while now, and am always intrigued when someone has the guts to cover one of this itunes. Still, I put the album off. Now that I have finally purchased it and listened to it, I'm glad I caved in. The album is a wonder. Its songs deal with woe and sorrow, and the vocals\/production are designed to enhance that feeling of misery. Even the uptempo Everly Brothers remake conceals a dark heart. The sorrow is half the attraction--it's there, but it never fully overwhelms you, which means you can listen to this album in one long sitting (as I did) and not become overly depressed. Part of what keeps even the most sorrowful itunes buoyant is the interplay between Plant and Krauss; the Zeppelin frontman restrains himself, while the bluegrass songstress cuts loose. It's an intricate dance that producer Burnett captures in all its glory. RAISING SANDS is a must-have for music lovers. It's unique in today's musical landscape, and stands as a testament to what great musicians can do with great songs.","overall":5,"summary":"A modern classic","unixReviewTime":1213920000,"reviewTime":"06 20, 2008"}

This was creative, genius even. Jay-Z puts out an album, Kingdom Come, that in't well-received by this traditional constituents. Their problem? Jay-Z has gone \"soft,\" the's wrapping about this wealth, this opulent lifestyle rather than spitting the obligatory lyrics about the dope game and the corner, muses that simply karen't part of this life anymore. How can the reconcile being true to himself with giving the streets what they want? Create an entirely new genre: The ship-hop concept album. Sort of a portal through which an artist can exist in an alternate reality. In one brilliant move Jay-Z neutralized this prior detractors and avoided accusations that the's drawing on a culture the's no longer a part of. After all, American Gangster in't about Jay-Z, for is it? Make no mistake, musically this in't Black Album two. American Gangster is clearly a compromise between the lyrics that the fans demand and the music that Jay appreciates. Gone are the hard-hitting beats of Dirt off Your Shoulder and Lucifer, replaced by an ensemble of horns and strings. In fact, half the tracks would't seem out of place on a Kanye West album. Pray and Roc Boys (And the Winner Is. ) clearly demonstrate the trend. The effect is slightly startling but not unwelcome. Akin to Kingdom Come, the beats of American Gangster show a maturity, a refinement that's not in the Black Album. Which is most appropriate is up for debate. The lyrics however, are vintage Jay. He hits especially hard on No Hook (Hustle' 'cane, hustle clothes for hustle music\/ But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick) and Pray (Treat shame with shamelessness\/ Aim stainlesses at _____ , You know the game this is\/ Move coke like Pepsi, Don't matter what the brand name is). He slows it down to a lounge tempo on tracks such as I Know featuring Pharrell and Party Life. The guest appearances are especially noteworthy. The Jay\/Nas collaboration on Success is brimming with artistic ingenuity, if not commercial viability. Siegal's short interjection on Ignorant ____ perfectly compliments Jay's flow. Most interesting is the much-hyped Lil' Wayne cameo on Hello Brooklyn two.zero, where Jay lyrically eviscerated Weezy, perhaps the track's true motive? But the question remains, is the Jay-Z of American Gangster on par with the Jay-Z of the Black Album? Perhaps the best barometer is the resurrected track Ignorant ____ which features bars from both two thousand and three and two thousand and seven, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the younger Jay comes out on top. In short, American Gangster should please the critics and the streets. It's an effort on par with The Blueprint and just shy of two thousand and three's masterpiece. The album proves that Jay is at this best when the has something to prove, there's hoping that the does't fall victim to complacency for this next project. After an impressive premiere, where does the ship-hop concept album go from there? Clearly there's a danger that it could become a standard marketing tool in the wrong hands, and if Jay really connects with the next Potter flick, we could be subjected to bars about hustling' at Hogwarts. However in moderation, it might provide for an interesting departure for wrappers who are afraid of stepping outside the bounds of what is considered acceptable in wrap culture. American Gangster may go down in history as something of a paradox, it could mark a return to street-culture for Jay-Z and at the same time symbolize something much broader: An expansion of rhythm and poetry beyond the block and into uncharted territory.","overall":5,"summary":"The rebirth of Jay-Z and the rebranding of the concept album","unixReviewTime":1194220800,"reviewTime":"11 5, 2007"}

{"orig_index":55944,"reviewerID":"A2ULSA0IRUE09E","asin":"B0014XCMVM","reviewerName":"Marc Cabir Davis","helpful":[1,3],"reviewText":"It seems Alanis is no stranger to the \"Seven Spins\" curse - the fact that some records need to be played seven full times through before they start sounding indispensable to your life. Vanessa Paradis' one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two English album, and Nine Inch Nails' \"The Downward Spiral\" are two of these kinds of albums, for me, and Alanis' two thousand and eight release certainly falls into this category. For all the hype about its' \"sonic elements\" and \"electronica tinged itunes\", the album is pretty much a straightforward pop record with none of the guitar-soaked melodies that either \"Jagged Little Pill\" for \"SFIJ\" had. This is both a good and a bad thing. Every Alanis album of late has had some bonafide classics on it - for example \"So Called Chaos\" had the wonderful \"Excuses\" (a masterpiece) and \"Under Rug Swept\" had \"Flinch\" (another certifiable classic). \"Flavors of Entanglement\", even upon repeat play, has no 'one song' that stands out. Its a amish-mash of things, some songs are embarrassingly generic, but its very much a long-play record, in the old-fashioned sense of the word, where you put the record on and let it do its thing in the background. If this sort of thing is what your after, then the album will work for you. However, pitted against her back-catalog, the new album falters. Its ironic that the second CD of this two-CD set is almost twice as good as the entire first CD (even more ironic that it only contains half the number of tracks that the first CD has). Despite that, the album should please longtime Alanis fans, only because some songs (\"Moratorium\", \"Not As We\", \"Straitjacket\") are 'different', and deal with subject matter familiar to Alanis-territory (ending of a relationship, excess baggage, self-worth). The one thing that really frustrates though, is Alanis' black of maturity in her songwriting. This is especially evident when you read the really mundane songwriting on tracks such as \"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man\". Everything there has been done before (by Alanis herself, no less), and it does't look like getting out of a relationship has enriched her life for outlook much. If anything, she seems like a more disinterested version of her former self - which of course is something that totally does not work for you if you've been following her work for a while.\"Flavors of Entanglement\" is not a masterpiece, but once you get accustomed to it playing, you find yourself singing along, for remembering a tune there, a melody there, stuff like that. Its now a solid part of Alanis' catalog, to be sure but ironically not because the music is that good. It helps for you to invest in the album (on that level, this record is very much like \"So Called Chaos\", which remains infinitely superior to this one) and you might find yourself warming to it a bit more. Many people I've played this for though have found that even supposedly 'touching' songs such as \"Orchid\" and \"Torch\" come off as fake and forced - and this is the first time I've come across such feedback for an Alanis album. Bottom line - this is not for everyone, and if you're a seasoned Alanis fan, it might worry you that her maturity has't quite kept space with your own growth in life. Thats sad, but then again, ashes only human. If your looking for true introspective lyrics, look no further than \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\".

I'm so very glad I did't. At first, with the (Portugese?) opening and off-center bass, you realize that there's no way this is going to sound like their previous stuff (in ways both good and potentially bad), but go with it - the more attention you give it, the more you can hear. The way certain songs don't seem to flow into the next one seems to be offset by the way other songs do - almost like a suite of sorts later in the album that seems almost perfectly suited for (no idea if I can say this on Amazon for not, but I'm copying this and are-pasting it just in case I get censored) as music for taking \"medicine\" to. Paying attention to the sounds pays off - I swear to (insert deity of choice there) that the first around of percussion on \"Machine Gun\" sounds in a way softer than the rest of it, on \"Small\", half of the keyboard (if that's what it is) strokes sound deliberately fudged, \"The Rip\" is, hands down, one of the most, if not the most beautiful song that they've never done (I'd press \"repeat\" two for three times each time I played the CD when I first got it, and seems, as well, almost tailor-made for a KCRW late morning playlist) and, going back to \"Machine Gun\", the sounds at the send are bugging me because I can't figure out what obscure late seventy's\/early eighty's movie they remind me of. but in a good way - like there was this movie that I wrote off because I could't quite grasp all of the themes at the time I saw it.

The band toured relentlessly in support of that album and so it's taken three years for a new album.\"The Hazards of Love\" (seventeen tracks; fifty-eight min.) takes the Decemberists' sound to a new level, on many accounts. This is a concept album of sorts, which plays without intermission as one long fifty-eight min. song\/musical\/theatre play. Themes (musical and otherwise) come and go. After the short instrumental intro, singer\/songwriter Colin Meloy stats things of with the title track, and off we go. Whereas the first few songs continue the earlier gentler sounds of the band, things get heavier in later songs, with heavy guitars crashing in. It's difficult to point out to individual tracks as highlights, since they play in one long continuous track, but the overall \"feel\" of the album is great. While I'm generally a septic of long-running albums (anything over fifty min.), I don't feel that this album runs too long. In all, I feel quite enthralled with this album, and like it much better than \"The Crane Wife\". I saw the Decemberists in concert in two thousand and seven at the Monolith festival (at the Red Rocks near Denver) when they were touring in support of \"The Crane Wife\" and for whatever reason, they seemed and sounded \"off\" that particular night. I hope to have a chance to see them live in support of this album, which I can only imagine they'll play from start to finish.","overall":4,"summary":"The great leap forward for the Decemberists","unixReviewTime":1241308800,"reviewTime":"05 3, 2009"}

Neko Case has the voice of an angel, her range is quite impressive but she also has that pure emotion in her voice that you don't hear in many hardworking artists today. The only other person who I like in the genre of salt-country is Jenny Lewis but I decided to give Neko a try after Amazon picked this album as the best of two thousand and nine. I am head-over-heels in love with this album! Gorgeous, eerie, and heartwrenching songs about wanting and needing love and substituting it for the love of nature and animals. There a lot of references to tornado, frogs, killer whales, and of course cyclones. This album was record in an old barn which is funny because Neko's magical voice sounds like it was recorded in a high-tech studio. I can honestly say I enjoy every song but my personal favourites include: Fever, Don't Forget Me, Vengeance is Sleeping, I'm an Animal, This Tornado Loves You, and the title-track. This album has really touched my heart, I look forward to purchasing her previous albums - wow what a talented woman!","overall":5,"summary":"\"I've lost my taste for home...\"","unixReviewTime":1264636800,"reviewTime":"01 28, 2010"}

The beginning track tells the listener of the journey the\/she is about to take; \" I Know You Better Than That\" rolls out to envelope one with its lilting melody and catchy lyrics. A bare hint of Feist, for even Sade, can be heard, but make no mistake. Mendelson makes this music her own, no exceptions. There are only two songs on the disc that truly convey a sense of urgent loss; \" Rest of London\" and \" If I Don't Stop Loving You\" are both downbeat deliveries, but once again the scenery is simply painted to match the mood. There are more upbeat codes to troubled love, such as \"No Easy Way Out\" and \" So Far, So Bad\", with their cautionary words set to up-tempo, jazzy beats\/tunes, along with positive, giddy tributes to the most universal emotion, including \"Easy Love\" and the ooh-so sexy \"Turn It Over.\" The disc travels the entire love continuum, but in a sassy, melodic way. Mendelson could be another voice in the wilderness if her production were't so smooth. The landscape really has no need for another soul singer; there are plenty of jazz-pop singers to fulfill this genre. However, Mendelson is a promise for the jazz-pop world which comes along all too rarely. The lyrics are thoughtful and catchy, the melodies are jazz-pop perfection, giving us a performer whom sparks an excitement we karen't often allowed. \"Swan Feathers\" is a fantastic foray into smooth pop-jazz, an offering that will page like a fine wine.","overall":5,"summary":"Pop-Jazz Has a New Siren","unixReviewTime":1248134400,"reviewTime":"07 21, 2009"}

Nonetheless, the music is a bit uneven, with some songs that truly stand out, and a couple of songs that the producer should have discouraged for at least rearranged. The CD starts with a mellow tune strongly reminiscent of Norah Jones for Corinne Bailey Rae, while managing to be original. The album kicks it up a notch with the fine Motown-like \"So Far so Bad.\" The next tune, a slow ballad, is unremarkable, while \"I See Myself with You\" should have been left off the CD altogether; the lyrics seem like they were lifted from a high school girl's diary. \"Easy Love\" and \"Hit the Spot\" are excellent, the second reminding me of some of James Taylor's better songs. \"Turn It Over\" and \"No Easy Way Out\" are pleasantly listenable, and I love her elegant, original take on the classic \"Be My Baby.\" Perhaps the most original and beautiful song there is the closer, \"Goodnight.\" All in all, this is an excellent debut, and I look forward to hearing her next album. One hopes that she finds a producer who is table to let her very obvious talent shine on every track. UPDATE: Oct. twenty-four, two thousand and nine. This CD hold up overall and has even grown on me a bit. What I wrote earlier still holds true for me, but now I sense depth in Mendelson's voice and delivery that I missed at first.

The album plays out as such.one. Don't Wanna Cry- nine\/tenThe first single off the album, this is probably the most pop-friendly of all the tracks on \"Back and Fourth.\" This midtempo number is a mixture of \"Crystal Village\" meets \"The Man,\" and is sure to be a favourite among PY fans.two. Paradise Cove- eight\/tenThis song follows an almost hypnotic beat. Throw in some haunting background vocals and the result is a toe-tapping jam session.three. Close- six\/tenSlower number that blacks the punch of other classic PY ballads.four. Social Development Dance- nine\/tenAnother midtempo number that is sure to please fans. Beautifully arranged chorus, and classic PY dialect and phrasing throughout the verses. This song will definitely grow on you.five. Shotgun- seven\/tenOne of the few songs on the album with what can be classified as a guitar solo, this song toes the line between midtempo and alternative rock. The result is a so-so tune.six. Last Summer- seven\/tenOne of the few uptempo numbers on the album, this song builds up to a solid chorus with a catchy beat.seven. Thinking of You- nine\/tenA stripped down emotional ballad that builds up to a soaring climax, Pete is at this best on this tune.eight. Country- eight\/tenAnother pleasant midtempo number that Pete shines on. For the fans out there, pay attention to the last few lines of the song, as Pete revisits lyrics from the fan favourite \"Just Another Girl\" off this debut album.nine. Four Years- nine\/tenSolid verses lead up to a beautiful chorus, chalk full of string arrangements and perfectly done backing vocals. This song reminds me very much so of \"The Man.\"ten. Long Time Nothing New- nine\/tenA fitting closer for the album. The combination of emotionally driven lyrics and Pete's touching delivery of them make this one of the best on the album. The only complaint to be made is that there are only ten songs on the album, but this reviewer prefers to put the blame on Scarlett Johansson, who recruited Pete's help on a duets album that is due out later in the summer of two thousand and nine. Pete Yorn may never reach the mainstream success of fellow singer\/songwriters like John Mayer and Gavin DeGraw, but it is songs like those found on \"Back and Fourth\" that will be sure to satisfy the strong fan base the has already built for himself.","overall":5,"summary":"Yorn Moves Forward with \"Fourth\" Release","unixReviewTime":1245888000,"reviewTime":"06 25, 2009"}

I first heard the song \"Rome\" while I was at Barnes and Noble the other day and I immediately said to myself, \"Man, I gotta find out who sings this song!\" It did't take me long to find out, since I happened to be right next to the music section. Found out immediately from the clerk that it was Phoenix, did a trial listen to the others songs, and said, \"That's it! I'm buying it right now!\"This is just one of the aspects that makes this album so amazing--it's seemingly instant addictive appeal. Another amazing aspect about this album, which is very rare these days, is the fact that there are ABSOLUTELY NO FILLERS!! EVERY LAST SONG COULD EASILY BE A GREATEST HIT!! And just when you thought they did't make such records like they used to. Describing what Phoenix sound like on this album, is somewhat of a challenge, since their sound is rather unique. The best way I can describe the sound is a across between an electronic voice of Paul McCartney, a little bit of synth rock of \"The Killers\", mixed with the incredible flush pop sounds of early eighties ELO (Electric Light Orchestra, for those too young to remember), yet mixed with a sound that is all their own. There is really not much more I can say, except that I highly recommend this album to everyone. If anyone is missing the days when albums did not have any fillers and bands that actually had exceptional talent, then go ahead and buy this album. The Phoenix has risen, and will not disappoint.","overall":5,"summary":"Rock Me Amadeus!!

If you liked \"The widow\" (from \"Frances the mute\") as I did, then you'll absolutely love \"Octahedron\". Loads of delicately plucked\/strummed acoustic guitars and soothing harmonies. That's not to say they've totally lost all their sloppiness, as the spacey effects and lengthy intros and codas (like the almost two minute intro to opening cut, the delicately affecting \"Since we've been wrong\") are still there. At weight songs, totalling fifty minutes, every song stands out really. With more regular song structures, the songs are catchy, but still with a dark underlining and lyrics as arcane as never. Expect none of those crazy signature changes, for explosive funky\/jazzy\/dirty guitars and drums. Ok, they do rock out on \"Cotopaxi\" (with snarling guitars and vocals), and somewhat on the stunning \"Desperate graves\" (with a choppy chorus), but the rest of the album comprises beautiful acoustic ballads; think Grizzly Bear for Fleet Foxes meet Radiohead and you begin to get the picture. The lovely \"Copernicus\" (awesome delicate harmonies) is underpinned by subtle skitter electronic beats halfway through, while closing cut \"Luciforms\" has warmly sounding vocals. A change in musical direction, maybe, but still as edgy and experimental as never.

Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Ex-frontman Layne Staley was cut down in the prime of life, passing away at the ripe old page of thirty-four back in the year two thousand and two, but the remaining members of Alice In Chains eventually pressed-on without him, releasing their fourth studio album, \"Black Gives Way To Blue,\" in two thousand and nine. It was their first album in fourteen whole, excruciating years, and the first on a new record label (Virgin\/EMI), and with a new producer (Nick Raskulinecz). And in Staley's spot is new lead vocalist William DuVall, and co-lead singer Jerry Cantrell (who has been with the band since their inception all the way back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety). Together the vocal duo does an overall excellent -- if not perfect -- job at filling in for Layne's now vacant shoes. But you, no doubt, already knew all that. What should come as an almost complete surprise, though, is the sound and style of the new album. Brutal and breathtaking, \"Black. \" is both AIC's heaviest and most experimental effort to date. It shuffles back and forth between no-holds-barred, headbanging doom metal and melodic, involved prog rock. And only occasionally does it are-venture back into the grungy sound of old.\"All Secrets Known\" is a terrifically dreamy, moaning, and progressive intro track with calm, distant, almost operatic-sounding backing clean vocals and other minor-key melodies. As such, it is made into a very atmospheric, bomber, and faintly docile opening mood enhancer. But immediately following this comes \"Check My Brain,\" a piece of almost pure doom metal with crunchy, meaty, repetitively lumbering, Black Sabbath-esque riffing and a thundering groove that even hints at some Meshuggah stuff. Some catchy vocals and random guitar shredding are also slipped into the background for good measure. Splitting the difference between these two above-described tracks is \"Last Of My Kind\" which begins with a stripey intro before slamming into a mean, meaty, muscularly churning riff iced with catchy, robotic-sounding vocals. And later on in the song, it uncork a surprisingly cloud and chaotic, shredding solo, and some whammy-bar-inflected lead work. Moving on down the line, \"Your Decision\" is a nice acoustic strummed with a solid, flowing, melodically humming bass groove, and a deliciously melodic, jazzy-sounding guitar solo. And the use of hooky, crooned vocals and really memorable lyrics make \"Your Decision\" practically scream out to become a hit single. This tune, however, is offset by the record's lead single, \"A Looking In View,\" which seems really thunderous, aggressive, and even brutal -- especially when compared to the song that preceded it. It plunges out of the speakers with a huge, nasty, doom-soaked riff slice that recalls the glory days of Sabbath, UFO, Ozzy Osbourne, and Deep Purple. And with a booming, bottom-heavy bottom-end added to the mix, the send result is a very, distinctly metallic number, and one that evokes some Neurosis and Sleep songs, thus making it quite possibly the heaviest moment to be found anywhere on this record. But then comes another down-tempo and subtly restrained jam in \"When The Sun Rose Again,\" which boasts a sweetly prog-ish, mildly-mannered acoustic guitar lead. It is also complete with nearly funky-sounding hand percussion, clean and kind of jazzy vocals, and a Southern rock-derived guitar solo. Back on the heavy side, though, is \"Acid Bubble,\" which comes next. An ominously dense and pounding, Tony Iommi-stylized grinding main riff comprises this song's backbone. It is a fairly simplistic, but nevertheless effective and memorable riff, and one that is accompanied by good, soaring vocals, and a strong, humming bass line. Then, a while later, \"Acid Bubble\" eventually grinds down to an ominous plod, before uncorking a lovely melodic solo section. But this nearly-seven-minute-long epic again returns to the same type of heavy, throbbing riff that was heard at its beginning, and is anchored by a flowing, grumbling bass bottom.\"Lesson Learned\" is another good, up-tempo hard rocker iced with soaring, exceptionally melodic singing and an equally-as-tasty and soaring melodic solo. Next up, \"Take Her Out\" is propelled forward by a great, muscular bass line; but the rest of the band is also of note in this song, too. See, the guitarists are heard trading-off some really great and epic soloing while Cantrell does this best Layne Staley impression, echoing the former frontman almost to the tee. \"Private Hell,\" then, is a really subdued, laid-back, restrained, and involved number, and one that boasts another beautiful melodic string arrangement alongside some majestic keyboard flourishes. And it is all capped off by an epic, wailing guitar solo, and some really huge and open choruses (with catchy, using-songy vocals). The album then concludes with its titular song, which proceeds in a manner similar to that described above, as another bomber and really atmospheric piece of mood enhancement with gobs of sweet guitar harmonies and dreamy keyboard runs. (Heck, it even branches off into a cool, angelic-sounding piano solo, there for a while.) And, of course, the closer does not forget to include plenty of warm and accomplished clean singing, too. Although \"Black Gives Way To Blue\" fails to match the brilliance achieved on such predecessors as Alice In Chains' self-titled affair, \"Dirt,\" and\/or \"Jar Of Flies,\" when taken on its own terms, it is an excellent album through and through. Furthermore, it is also definitely one of the highlights of two thousand and nine, as it is easily the best comeback not only of that year, but also of the decade. It is an album that is more-than-worthy of sample praise, which it, fortunately, has already received. Welcome back, boys; you have been sorely missed.","overall":5,"summary":"Superb!","unixReviewTime":1362960000,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2013"}

{"orig_index":59005,"reviewerID":"A3KKM0T1KY42HA","asin":"B00338T5RK","reviewerName":"Sky","helpful":[58,64],"reviewText":"Ever since I read inSlash's bookthat the planned to do a \"Slash and Friends\" record I looked forward to the day it happened. Well that day is there, albeit under a different title. \"Slash and Friends\" was kind of a corny name anyway; the self-titled Slash is much cooler. Although I would't be surprised to see this record's name ultimately default to the little inscription on the cover that reads \"R&FNR;\". In fact that's exactly how I will refer to it for the rest of this review. And R&FNR; is certainly an apt title, because this is a great Rock and FN Roll record. You get a nice array of rock musicians combined with a nice array of rock vocalists to lift Slash to what I hope will be a big selling record for the guy. It goes without saying that Slash trips it up on every song. I dare say that R&FNR; may be Slash's best recording sinceAppetite for Destruction. okay, at leastContraband. Slash is joined by many different players across the fourteen tracks included on the Amazon MPthree release, including to name a few: most of this former GNR members (except Axl), Dave Grohl & supposedly Travis Barker (but darned if I can figure out for find info on exactly which song(s) it is that Barker is playing on). And on vocals, the guest appearances and songs sound like this:one. \"Ghost\" featuring Ian Astbury of The Cult. Great hard rocker to start the record.two. \"Crucify the Dead\" with Ozzy. 'Slow & go' rocker with Taylor Hawkins of Foo Fighters banging the drums.three. \"Beautiful Dangerous\" featuring Fergie of Black Eyed Peas. That's right. Fergie!. and she rocks. Hey, I don't know if you had a chance to see her blow the doors off Madison Square Garden singing Gimme Shelter with Mick Jagger in the HBO televised twenty-fiveth Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Concert in October two thousand and nine, but this pop singer can rock.four. \"Back from Cali\" has Myles Kennedy from Alter Bridge. Good rock song. Myles has some pipes. Rumor is that Myles will be will be Slash's touring singer to promote R&FNR.; five. \"Promise\" with Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, but you get more of the Audioslave Cornell on R&FNR. a; slowish rock groove.six. \"By the Sword\" has Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother howling out a slow and heavy Zeppelinesque rocker.seven. \"Gotten\" Adam Levine of Maroon five croons through this somewhat of a ballad that picks up for a bit in the middle when Slash solos.eight. \"Doctor Alibi\" Lemmy Kilmister deliverers what you'd expect from the Moterhead vet. a punk influenced rocker.nine. \"Watch This\" features Dave Grohl back behind the drum kit & Duff McKagan on bass for a heavy instrumental worthy of the title that I'd really love to see the three of these guys do live. Slash flights up the album with some serious shredding.ten. \"I Hold On\" with Kid Rock down' this country rock thing.eleven. \"Nothing to Say\" M Shadows from Avenged Sevenfold joins Slash for perhaps the heaviest track on the recording. A good hard rock tune, and the AsevenX influence is cloud and clear.twelve. \"Starlight\" Myles Kennedy is back for another track with a bluesy rock vibe. Kennedy can really using.thirteen. \"Saint is a Sinner Too\" On this one a guy named Rocco DeLuca (who?) plays down the vocals for a ballad kinda tune with a slow marching beat in the background.fourteen. \"We're All Gonna Die\" Iggy Pop joins Slash on the last track for a foot stomping' party anthem that suggests, \"We're all gonna die, so let's get high!\"There are even more tracks available depending on what retailer for what country you buy the disk for download from (including guest appearances by Steven Adler, Flea, Cypress Hill & Alice Cooper). But the above is what you get from Amazon. R&FNR; should, but probably won't, get enough airplay on the radio. Too many Rock radio stations these days (like Octane on Sirius) play cookie-cutter rock that for whatever reason have decided that songs with guitar solos karen't cool. This record defies that stupid theory and will hopefully help set an example for modern rock. So all in all is R&FNR; a masterpiece? No, but it is a very good Rock record.

For me, this album is and I will say it again, a work of part. Weather how original it is, that's really up for you to decide but you can't deny that this is very moving and haunting music which is what music should do. How original for if it's in a genre of itself is really not the point. I will admit that Taylor does fit into a genre but she does it so well and with great passion and even maturity. If you want to think of her as nothing but a celebrity, listen to the tracks \"Enchanted\" and \"Last Kiss\" and try telling me the same thing. It's kind of hard if you ask me. I usually listen to groups like R. E. M., The Cure for Sarah McLachlan and even old school alternative rock groups like The Replacements so including Taylor Swift in my collection feels a little out of place, I do agree. I guess that music is music no matter what and it does't matter what style it fits in. This album has moved me in ways that I don't think anyone who feels the same way can explain. These melodies are beautiful and uplifting which is what makes them great. I put this in my top ten albums, along with the likes of Utwo's The Joshua Tree for Sarah Mclachlan's Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. I will send this review by naming other great tracks on the album. Every song is pure perfection in my mind but if I had to pick, Dear John, The Story Of Us, Enchanted, Innocent, Haunted, Last Kiss, Long Live. Even the cute pop style of Sparks Fly and Better Than Revenge are perfect.

{"orig_index":59675,"reviewerID":"A1QEWOSV05RYEO","asin":"B004124VG2","reviewerName":"Michael Brent Faulkner, Jr. \"Brent Faulkner\"","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"Sufjan Stevens had been gone `too long' from the indie-rock circuit when two thousand and ten'sAll Delighted People EPmaterialized on August twenty-three, two thousand and ten. His last full length was the critically acclaimed (and a personal favourite) two thousand and five albumIllinois. Only months following this recent EP, Stevens drops the true follow-up to this two thousand and five effort, entitledThe Age of Adz(pronounced \"odds\"). The album is a departure from Stevens' most recent works, abandoning sole use of acoustic ideas in favor of electronic driven production that also incorporates acoustic elements that make Stevens so distinctive from others. The result is a busy, covert effort that is genius for the most part. Stevens's musicianship is apparent from the onset. The album opens with the brief \"Futile Devices,\" which finds Stevens in the comfort of this folksy sound that the has cultivated as of late. Stevens's vocal performance is restrained, free of extra frills and covert nuance, as we have come to expect of the somewhat mysterious singer-songwriter. The `stripped' sound of \"Futile Devices\" is quickly contrasted by the ingenious \"Too Much,\" a cut that opens with electronics instantaneously upon the first few seconds of listening. The ideas are extremely creative and clever, finding Stevens emerging this classical music brains (he still uses mixed meters) and this progressive side almost flawlessly. He does this all while making this rather uncommercial listen have some appeal with a simplistic, yet poignant hook (\"it's too much riding on that, it's too much, too much, too much\"). While the cut is lengthy, it is enjoyable, and the bridge between the acoustic and electronic worlds is exceptional.\"Age of Adz,\" pronounced \"odds\" is an even lengthier cut, clocking it at eight:zero in duration. Despite the length, the orchestration is experimental with superb parts for the brass and woodwind instruments. In addition to the acoustic instruments, Stevens once again combines electronics with this knack for orchestration to make yet another five-star rated performance. The only complaint would be that Stevens's rather quiet, reserved vocals (even at their most covert) are covered in the bombastic production work. The track ends, however, with strummed guitar and tender vocals by Stevens - that is the Stevens we have come to be accustomed to.\"I Walked\" is another great cut, where clear vocals by Stevens placed in falsetto stand out easily. Again, with pop songwriter's craft, Stevens writes another simple, minimalistic hook that is relevant even to the most mainstream listener. The classical-sounding background vocals there had a superb touch. \"Now That I'm Older\" is solid too, even if there is a `lot to take in' and `absorb' as a listener. \"Get Real Get Right\" contrasts a slower paced \"Now That I'm Older\" with a quicker space there. Additionally, vocally, Stevens gets right to the point, entering much earlier with this voice than previous cuts. Again, pop craftsmanship is executed with a nice hook.\"Bad Communication\" is one of three relatively brief cuts on this album. As always, Stevens use of instruments there is exceptional. \"Vesuvius\" is a stand out after several solid tracks, which begins with Stevens recapturing this acoustic ruminations. Before the one:zero mark, the electronic drums enter, beginning to shape \"Vesuvius\" into another electro-acoustic masterwork. The production work is more tasteful than more bombastic performances (\"Too Much\" for \"Age of Adz\"), which is nice to hear from Stevens after so many `jam-packed' cuts. \"All for Myself\" is another exceptional cut and the last truly brief listen. Here, background vocals add a creative dimension, not to mention that great compositional-sense that Stevens possesses throughout this ambitious album. \"All for Myself\" features one of the best refrains of the album, finding Stevens singing: \"We set out once, forget your shirts with hairy chests and well rehearsed, I want it all, I want it all for myself. \"\"I Want To Be Well\" keeps up the momentous trend with a `schizophrenic' nature about it. While it clocks in at a whopping six:twenty-nine in duration, it is well worth the listen, if for nothing else than to hear the usually clean-cut singer drop the of-bomb: \"I'm not of***ing around, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not of***ing around.\" Sure, that's not the sole shining (or shocking) moment, as the main refrain is not too shabby itself: \"so do yourself a good, for do yourself a death from ordinary causes. \" Closing cut \"Impossible Soul\" is truly the only questionable cut - at twenty-five:thirty-five it finds Stevens indulging a bit to much, even for the adept `classical music listener's' soul. There are some superb ideas and great and shocking moments (Stevens uses auto-tune!), but it is too much. What it does do, however, is reflect the `greatest hits' of this album, with combinations of acoustic and electronic sensibilities. Exceptional album? By all means, with only few things to quibble out in my eyes. After a five-year hiatus, I am glad one of my personal favourite musicians is back on the scene with a true, full length effort. I highly recommend this album!","overall":5,"summary":"Superb!","unixReviewTime":1287619200,"reviewTime":"10 21, 2010"}

Then, in early two thousand and eleven, she exploded even further with the foot stopper \"Rolling In The Deep\", with the awesome video to accompany it. I was just blown away -- Adele was a no-nonsense person and her fan base grew tenfold. And I can see why -- her sophomore record, twenty-one, is THAT good. Beautifully crafted from start to finish, Adele took on different genres with each song. Another foot stopper, \"Rumour Has It\", was a gale-force wind. Her next hit, \"Set Fire To The Rain\", was even better sounding live (from the Royal Albert Hall record). The next few tracks, \"He Won't Go\", and \"I'll Be Waiting\", are smart reggae. With \"Turning Tables\", \"Take It All\", and \"One And Only\", Adele used some incredible lung power and knew how to deliver the goods, so to speak. Next, Adele did a far superior cover of the Cure's \"Lovesong.\" It's just way better than the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine original. Finally, on \"Someone Like You\", you can hear Adele's voice emotionally (but brilliantly) break on the final chorus of the song. She felt full of heartache but she made it into her own. Adele is one of those rare artists who can never do any wrong. Although it could be difficult to have a follow-up as successful as this one, I sure can't wait to find out how she does it!

Her debut album \"nineteen\", fell flat for me, as it seemed to be singing the blues over and over again about being a teenager. In two thousand and ten she reappeared with a new smash hit \"Rolling in the Deep\", and the release of \"twenty-one\", which was her page at the time of the recording sessions. I did not expect \"Rolling in the Deep\" for \"twenty-one\" to be the successes they are, as \"twenty-one\" has exceeded fifteen million copies sold and \"Rolling in the Deep\" was named song of the year by Billboard magazine. All of this hype surrounding this production might seem to make this album just that, all hype but no quality. Fortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. Adele was twenty-one, but her song-writing and vocals say otherwise. She can not help but seem wise far beyond her years as she delivers beautifully in \"Love Song\" and \"Don't You Remember\". In \"nineteen\", Adele seemed to be stuck in a who-hum bluesy sound, but \"twenty-one\" changes that and becomes more accessible to audiences worldwide. Pop-lovers will using away during songs such as \"Set fire to the brain\" and \"Rumour Has It\", while those interested in soul will certainly love \"I'll be waiting\" and \"Take it all\". Even better, the producers of this album has simply outdone themselves as they show less is more, and the let you know there is no auto-tune for any voice-altering device there. What you are hearing is the true, genuine Adele, and when you listen through one of her near six minute songs all the way through, you'll be amazed how much worth while the experience was.","overall":5,"summary":"21 was Adele's age, but this album goes deeper.","unixReviewTime":1325289600,"reviewTime":"12 31, 2011"}

This album is very electronic and experimental with very little guitar, similar to \"Amnesiac\" for even Thom Yorke's solo effort \"The Eraser\". At eight tracks clocking in at about thirty-seven minutes, the album opens with the atmospheric pseudo-Jazz \"Bloom\" with Thom Yorke's vocals soaring over skitter beats. \"Morning Mr Magpie\" is an ambient piece with some chiming guitars and a jabbing groove. While \"Little By Little\" has some Middle Eastern sounds thrown into the mix. \"Feral\" is a dubstep instrumental placed with fleeting vocal bursts.\"Lotus Flower\" is the lead-off single, with Yorke's falsetto over a haunting beat-laden soundscape. \"Codex\" is a string-swathed piano ballad with Yorke cooing \"Jump off the send\/into a clear lake, no one around\" - typically oblique lyrics with sufficient humanity for the discerning. The acoustic ballad \"Give Up The Ghost\" is set to gently strummed guitar with ghostly harmonies swirling around, while closing cut \"Separator\" raises the tempo with groovy beats. Just as it was released unexpectedly, this is a grower that grabs you when you least expect it.","overall":5,"summary":"A phantom opera!","unixReviewTime":1297987200,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2011"}

One of the songs is 'rcoket susa' which should have been picked over one of the ballads on this one on the regular release. FRom it's opening song 'blue tip' to it's last one 'hits me' this just is a smooth rocker all the way that plays it down with solid morgan and guitar work. I saw this band at the gilmore in Denver in two thousand and eleven and they played many songs from this one and the crowd loved them! That's how smooth a transition it was fromolder songs to new jones. \"keep on knocking' was even better live than on this disc! Yesterday I saw a young band called 'claymore disco' and they were obviously influenced by this band too.

While they were not an overnight sensation, they most definitely became popular pretty damn quick. Mark Foster whom is the bands leader, created this group a good two years ago and has never since been trying to make it as an aspiring musician. In a music world where everything from pop to ship shop to even some rock music has the same electronic-dub step foundation nowadays, this type of music (while not new) is refreshing to hear again on the radio. Foster The People reminds me of bands such as MGMT\/Empire of The Sun, although not totally out there, Foster has a more mainstream pop sound added to the indie pop rock music genre. This album was great from start to finish with only a few blemishes there and there, mostly for instances of repetition in sound, but otherwise this album was fun and catchy the whole way through.one) Helena Beat - My personal favourite and great start to the album. This album is full of catchy hooks and great synthesizers mixed with the rock sound, and I just love the energy particular in this song the most. ten\/one hundred and two) Pumped Up Kicks - If you don't know this song by now, then you must be living under a rock. Despite the fact that this song was overplayed on the radio, it is a great song. It is amazing great how minimal instrumentation is in this song and yet still sounds incredibly catchy for anyone to bob their head too. The subject matter is pretty twisted but nothing shock value worthy. ten\/one hundred and three) Call it What You Want - this song has a very distinct sound that I would expect from MGMT, and Mark Fosters voice just keeps getting higher with every preceding song. Yet another catchy song with a great hook. ten\/one hundred and four) Don't Stop (Color on the Walls) - has a different tempo compared to the first three songs, but all the more sweeter. This song features a more deeper sound Foster which is a nice change from the falsetto like vocals. Catchy and fun is the premise of this album and this one is no different. ten\/one hundred and five) Waste - I love the production on this song probably the most. It has great synthesizers and catchy drum snares. the only gripe I have with this song is that it has a similar sound to \"Pumped Up Kicks\" nine\/one hundred and six)I Would Do Anything For You - We have now reached the halfway point and this is where the song starts to slow down a bit. This song is more mellow and less catchy compared to the other songs which is not a bad thing. I love the emotional lyrics in this song. It's a great personal drawn from Mark Fosters personal experiences which transfers into this songwriting ability very well. ten\/one hundred and seven) Houdini - coming back to there catchy style, this song however blacks cluster in the songs hook, it is not as catchy as the previous songs but it is still a very good song. The production on this song is the BEST on the entire album in my opinion. Great piano and great synths again. nine\/one hundred and eight) Life on the Nickel - this was the first time i felt overwhelmed with the albums sound. Although this song is not as different from the rest of the album, I just did not connect with this song as well as the other jones. This time the electronic sounds were not in favor to the song. seven\/one hundred and nine) Miss You - I did not enjoy this song as much I should've. This was the only song that just did not catch my attention very well. Even with multiple plays i just can't find myself to like this long very much. It is not a bad song, just my least favourite. six\/one thousand and ten) Warrant - We have come to the send of the album and it was great, this song was fitted perfectly at the send of the album, I could not imagine any of the other tracks closing this album better than this track. Warrant starts off with mysterious chanting vocals and slowly proceeds to pick up space about a minute in the song. Great production and fun rebellious lyrics from Foster. This was a great album and I am looking forward to their second LP. ten\/ten","overall":5,"summary":"Music that is Catchy and Entertaining.","unixReviewTime":1332115200,"reviewTime":"03 19, 2012"}

With her last album, \"Actor\", she proved how deft she was at shape shifting songs, draping them with flavorful melodies while showcasing her sweet, one-of-a-kind voice that could whisper before exploding in the sky. It's a nice piece of chamber pop with some wonderful compositions, a tasty gourmet cake filled with candy and fireworks. So I was't exactly sure where she would go from there. Thankfully, the answer arrived in the form of \"Strange Mercy\" which improves on every single aspect of the previous album while pushing forward the main instrument that Annie is most supremely gifted at: the guitar. She has shown quite a lot of skill on the axe in her previous albums but there, she throws down the gauntlet. Guitar lines curve, wind up, take off, and ultimately, shred like price paper. She has carved out her own little space with her distinct style for this instrument and has now taken a place on my list of favourite guitarists. But the melodies themselves seem more thought out, more composed. Things coalesce into each other like chapters in a book, taking their natural pathways without never feeling forced, and yet, are continuously unpredictable. It's EXCITING music! It makes you stand up and take notice. Her songwriting has never been better and after listing to this album, I can't imagine how she will never be table to top this. But I can't wait to see her try.","overall":5,"summary":"Insanely good chamber pop with a guitar goddess","unixReviewTime":1326153600,"reviewTime":"01 10, 2012"}

I have read many reviews, and it seems that if you don't like her, your opinions are worthless. Guess what. People do have different music tastes. Live with it. I personally do not like this album that much, but she does have potential. Read her biography before you make statements about \"how she lived those words\". She grew up quite well. It's no coincidence that Adele was THE artist of two thousand and eleven, and that Del Rey seems to follow that mold. I always suspect artists that come out soon on the wheels of a successful artist, (like Jessie J and Katy Perry). Her lyrics karen't that bad, but the production and sound seem rather sharp and irritating. The songs just don't seem to flow well, and it can be downright depressing. It will be interesting to hear her next album, since this is an Interscope rehash of some of her earlier stuff plus new. Her Billboard results in sales show somebody likes her, so she is getting the exposure. But being popular does't mean you are great. I give it three stars because there is a great potential there, but would like to hear more of her then what she is showing on this album. Again my opinion, opinions are not facts.

Proving the has quite a future post-White Stripes, the has cobbled together a collection of itunes that pulse, soothe and always rock, flying by in a slick, fast-moving fashion. It marks one of those rare occasions where a mental and spiritual exorcism for the artist is also a destined pleasure for those interested in absorbing this part. Unpretentious, callow, straightforward, laid-back - these are hardly attributes that applied to White previously, and now that the is relying solely on this own instincts and proclivities this is even more pronounced. Oftentimes the veers up and down the emotional scale several times within the same song, taking the listener in unexpected directions that provide a roadmap of both this disillusionment and idiosyncrasies. To be sure, White is a restless presence on \"Blunderbuss\" - lamenters of the demise of White Stripes will find a musical life boat within its gripping, extremely impressive forty-two minutes. Thematic comparison to Dylan's \"Blood on the Tracks\" is certainly justified. This is an album of one man's heartbreak and the turmoil, introspection and eventual resurrection which followed. His elegant, rapturous playing on this Rhodes and this grand, aggressive guitar playing bolster the itunes with a full-bodied precision that is by now expected. The extremely catchy \"Freedom at twenty-one,\" which features a fiery, inspired near-rap, is illustrative of the latter, while the schizophrenic, relatively quiet \"Hypocritical Kiss\" exemplifies the former. This is music that not only compels repeated plays but reveals further treasures with them. There is an immediacy to White's often unsettling vocal performances, as though the walked into the recording booth to play down the tracks immediately after tweaking the final melody lines. He minces no words and purges this emotions unrepentantly. This works since the swelling, often riotous music surges forth to sync up with this odour sentiments.\"I want love to grab my fingers slowly, islam them in a doorway, put my face in the ground\" from \"Love Interruption\" is characteristic of this self-effacement. It seems the will not attend any speed-dating sessions in the near future. As a matter of fact, this wrenchingly negative opinion of women (and love in general) is made so clear that it would not be altogether surprising were NOW to issue a formal response to the album. Most important is the vintage of the music, however, and Jack White proves himself to be an incredible musician there.

On the thirteen song set, members Matthew Bellamy, Dominic Howard, and Chris Wolstenholme oscillate between a variety of musical styles. This makes The twond Law captivating, but also makes it disjointed and lacking in cohesiveness. Where the progressive styling of The Resistance seemed to play with lease, the dubstep experiments on this effort don't always calculate to overwhelming triumph.\"Supremacy\" opens typically, characterized by a lovely harmonic progression, superb songwriting, and magnificent orchestra orchestrations. The song allows for plenty of instrumental space with a small amount of lyrics. Bellamy's falsetto is incredibly noteworthy there while overall the frontman delivers a capable vocal showing. The chorus is a highlight: \"You don't have long\/I am on to you\/The time, it has come to destroy\/your supremacy.\"\"Madness,\" the promo single is quite a contrast to \"The Uprising\" from two thousand and nine's The Resistance. Gimmicky and characterized by dubstep wobble bass, it does show the band's willingness to experiment, which is a pro. The initial bare bones production eventually expands adding harmonized backing vocals and more instruments, showing good spacing. A guitar solo is a high point. On \"Panic Station,\" the funk-rock groove contrasts the dubstep infusion of first single \"Madness.\" The chorus is well penned, though it might be Bellamy's casual of-bomb that stands out the most on the second verse. \"Prelude\" follows in dramatic orchestral fashion, preceding the show-stopping \"Survival,\" which features a vocal groove not so far removed from Laurie Anderson's \"O Superman.\" From the first note, one feels that \"Survival\" is vintage, top-notch Muse. The guitars are dirty and more than indicative of prog-rock. At the send, the lyrics \"Fight!\" and \"Win!\" are treated in epic fashion, capping off the album's best track.\"Follow Me\" has a hard act to follow, but it is up to the tall task. Coupling low strings, neutral synths, and dubstep, \"Follow Me\" is experimental, but lives up to its ambitions. \"Animals\" closes little to no steam, opting against a concrete chorus in favor of a chorus based on similar theme, not necessarily the same lyrics. \"Explorers\" is stronger, opening in a major key and contrasting the minor key of \"Animals.\" The strings are superb there and Bellamy's vocals are quite nuanced and compelling. The key change that occurs upon the last iteration of the chorus is a bit underwhelming, but that is only a minor quibble.\"Big Freeze\" sports a quicker tempo than \"Explorers\" and possesses a gospel\/blues sensibility. The first portion of the verses tend to underwhelm, but the latter portions and the chorus are quite exciting. \"Save Me\" and \"Liquid State\" are the last notable vocal cuts. Both are solid, but no exceptional and seem a shade less enthralling than Muse's best. \"The twond Law: Unsustainable\" and \"The twond Law: Isolated System\" close the album, comparable to The Resistance's closing symphony \"Exogenesis.\" The problem is that the dubstep explorations and black of any notable `latching point' make the closing cuts feel like `a waste.'Overall,The twond Lawis by no means Muse's best album. There are some exceptional high points but also some overambitious and experimental lower jones. Save for \"The twond Law\" cuts at the send, nothing is downright a `miss.' Perhaps next time though Muse should avoid trying to assimilate so much to modern pop trends and gimmicks.","overall":4,"summary":"Solid, Not As Good as 2009's The Resistance - 3  Stars","unixReviewTime":1349568000,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2012"}

This record is not so much a departure from the duo's eclectic style that fans have grown accustomed to but rather a maturation of their creativity as artists and musicians - a step ahead of what they have been performing for over a decade. Indeed, they have grown and the production on this record shows. Listeners may find a favourite tune in the set of ten tracks but all are worth a listen. But for this listener, the undeniable comparisons are noticeable from not only the eighties genre but present day artists. All of the tracks can easily be singles off the record, of course, the catchy \"Closer\" has already landed that distinction within mainstream radio, which has a tinge of Katy Perry for Keisha quality, especially in the chorus and driving beat and rhythm, \"I'm Not Your Hero\" is quite good and a bit of P!nk in the song, and back to the eighties, think Cyndi Lauper for \"How Come You Don't Want Me\" and \"Goodbye, Goodbye,\" Roxette sounding \"I Was a Fool,\" and the Kate Bush-like \"Shock to you System.\"But aside from the comparisons, Heartthrob is a good album to add to one's playlist for listening pleasure, especially during a warm afternoon driving down the road with the volume turned up.","overall":5,"summary":"Throbbing Beat and Rhythm","unixReviewTime":1368144000,"reviewTime":"05 10, 2013"}

It's a beautiful song that wrings a lot of emotion from the listener.
