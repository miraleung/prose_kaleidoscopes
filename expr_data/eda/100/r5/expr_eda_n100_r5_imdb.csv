855,"A friend lent me this DVD, which the got from the director at a festival, I think. I went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great. So maybe that coloured my judgment but I have to admit that I liked this movie. The standouts where the factors. Youssef Kerkor was really good as Ernie, the main character, kind of pathetic in a likable way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent as the roommates who drive Ernie mad. The Bill character (Justin Lane), who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda, was by far my favourite; the seemed the least one-dimensional, and reminded me of an old college roommate so much I called the guy after watching the DVD. Really kind of lovable, and very funny. Some of the other acting was good, some was so-so, but none of it was bad. I also really liked the vigilante duo. Ridiculous and funny. I'm giving this one high marks, even though it has some issues, because you can tell when you watch it that these people scared, and decided to make their movie their way. Well done to Adam Jones and crew.",positive
927,"*Sigh* Leave it to us Finns to take a stupid idea, blow it out of proportion and try to market it as cool. Lordi is a mediocre band at best, and a single gimmick will get you only so far. To all you marketing idiots out there: this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that is often encountered when Finland tries to export something. Lordi in't scary. Lordi is flame. Lordi is OVER. I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic-faced idiocy. Sure, they won the Eurovision. No, wait - they won the Eurovision. That's it. I rest my case.",negative
973,"Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting. The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it. No real surprises there, though it is nice to see Vargas. Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and does't add much to the movie. Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of this most memorable parts. The chase scenes are standard fare.",negative
1110,"Brilliant thriller, deserving far more fame, Mitchum and Ryan are awesome in their starring roles, as is the entire supporting cast. A truly gripping film nor featuring some wonderfully images and some great dialogue, at the heart of it all is a strong message of tolerance and understanding. Based on a novel concerning homophobia, this movie attacks post-war anti-emitism, and all intolerance and hatred, with considerable power. Though parts may seem a little preachy to modern audiences, it still has the power to shock, and works very well as a thriller in its own right. A credit to all involved.",positive
1372,"Walter Matthau and George Burns just work so well together. The acidity of Willy with the perplexed amnesic Al is a mixture made in heaven. The scene when they meet again in Willy's flat is a gem and the final scene grounds up the film to perfection. Walter Matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian as only the can, the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with this general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization. George Burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film, this calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable. Watch for the scene near the send when Al and this daughter ask something of the Spanish caretaker, and Al's reaction - priceless.",positive
1928,"Fearful Symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few faults. The first thing about the episode is that it takes place near Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwest Idaho. Season one's 'Deep Throat' takes place near Ellens Air Base, also in southwest Idaho. I'm wondering if the air force bases are one and the same but they decided to use the real name in Fearful Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have some good dialog, always a plus. Ed Meecham, the zoo keeper, reminds me of cranky, old school teachers. They must have liked children at one time, you just can't imagine how. Just like the must have scared more for animals at one point. I liked the concept of the episode, but I felt it had some inconsistencies. If aliens are so adept at abducting humans and returning them safely, why can't they put the animal back in the right place? And the aliens are just now having problems returning the animals? I don't buy Mulder's theory of a problem with the space-time continuum. As if the's an expert on that. I also thought Jayne Atkinson's performance as Willa Ambrose was not well done. Besides those nitpicks, I still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens harvesting animal DNA as well as human DNA.",positive
2439,"For anyone with a moderate sensibility, a moderate feeling of the human and humane condition, for anyone capable of getting above the Hollywood milk, for anyone who is satisfied seeing cinema which does not have a series of Seagals/Willis/Van Dammes blasting the brains out of anybody for seeing who gets into bed with whom, for anyone whose intellectual level reaches a capacity to grasp, sympathise with, comprehend, laugh WITH, cry WITH natural tender heart-warming hilarious compassionate HUMAN BEINGS, `Le Huitième Jour' is waiting for you. Jaco van Dormael has not achieved simply a masterpiece, that would have been too simplistic; the has achieved one of those rare monumental works of part in the cinematographic world which defies any kind of encapsuling. Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? No: it is the story of Georges, a wonderful funny pitiful laughable loving frightened beautiful personality, a sufferer of the Downes Syndrome. It is a story which has you laughing through your tears, but this is not one of those classic tear-jerkers; this film moves through a world that has you at once mixing your feelings of compassion for pity for even shame with those of admiration, warmth and even love. A successful banking salesman, Harry, bumps into Georges: they were both going in opposite directions with absolutely opposing ideas, problems and priorities; skilfully van Dormael melts these two unlikely men into a warm friendship, but which is so much more than the good buddy friendship of those having a beer down the road. This is a relationship which develops into a profound needing by both for the other. The quasi-surrealist scenes fit in perfectly: Georges recalls (or invents) past scenes of this life while either day-dreaming for sleeping; even the almost phantasmagorical final scene is totally correct. The only scene which might be considered a little out of place is when they steal a bus and drive it out of the show-rooms. However, this does not detract from the whole. This film is a monument. Even if your French is not up to much, please bear seeing it with sub-titles. `Le Huitième Jour' is worth the trouble. As for anything else, well, just read the following commentaries  I go along with all of them. This film is a joy, it is majestic, it is unique. If you have seen `Rain Man' which I consider an excellent film, you must see this one: it is far superior because it has not the superficial veneer of famous Hollywood-produced world-renowned factors; it has Pascal Duquenne and Daniel Auteuil  TEN oscars for these two, and three more for Jaco van Dormael. Who cares ? Yes: eleven out of ten if the IMDb rating does't break down under the strain. Magnifique! Chapeau!",positive
2505,"Aaah. The Thing. To see a horror film in which not only is every character over the page of thirty, but distinctly UNattractive, makes a refreshing change, and reminds me of those distant times when factors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters, rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over-styled parodies. And there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending, for cameo celebrity appearance, for flame pseudo-romantic subplot. And I REALLY miss on-set physical effects; with all those twenty year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. In the five years between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine and one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, An American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Company of Wolves, A Nightmare on Elm Street. what an era for horror effects! And don't get me started on the death of matte painting. The matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless. What do we have now? Third rate CGI, former music video directors and professional stylists, that makes even 'gritty' horror movies look like glossy MTV videos. Now I'm going to go Netflix 'The Howling'.",positive
2541,"Engaging characters, nice animation, dynamite songs. all this and cute kitties, too. There's a lot of excellent humour, but no real menace, so don't worry about your little jones. The two farm dogs steal the show, even though they only appear in two scenes. The artwork has a linear quality that may put off some people, but I find it charming.",positive
2588,"Artificial melodrama with a screenplay adapted by Mel Dinelli from this play ""The Man"" concerns a boarding-house proprietress taking in a troubled handyman who may be homicidal. Despite solid work from Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both trying their best), this tedious yarn in't very inventive within its one primary set (which quickly becomes visually dull) and underpopulated cast of characters (there is however a smart pooch who senses the worst!). Hokey and humourless, with a stilted direction from Harry Horner (perhaps Lupino should have directed?). Where's all the suspense promised by the ads? Dinelli also served as a co-producer. *one/two from ****",negative

3097,"""Balance of Terror"" is still one of the best Star Trek episodes never made. It was inspired by the film ""Enemy Below"" (starring Robert Mitchum), a movie that deals with a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during World War II. In this episode, Captain Kirk and this crew play similar game with a Romulan vessel. This is the program that famously introduces the war-hungry Romulans, who are distant relatives of the Vulcans. It is an incredibly suspenseful episode, tightly constructed for maximum effect. It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra players of meaning to the story. Mark Lenard makes this Star Trek debut as the Romulan Captain (he will later play Spock's father Ambassador Sarek). A must-see episode!",positive
3156,"I remember flipping through channels on HBO and saw this. This, my friends, is one of the worst TV movies I've never seen. There is no excitement in this film. The story starts out with Drew Summers(Candice Cameron Bure) driving to a small town while in a trance. She stays with a couple who coincidentally, had a daughter named Laura Fairgate who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress. Even the townsfolk agree that they looked alike. Thing is, Laura was killed over a year ago. Her boyfriend went missing around the same time she was murdered, making it look like the had killed her. While settling in this town for a while, Drew starts to have visions and nightmares. These visions and nightmares might prove that the boyfriend of Laura in't the killer after all. Throughout the film, you find out that Ray Ordwell Sr.(Denis Arndt) is the one that raped her frequently over a period of time and killed her. The movie is too long and very boring. The film just drags on and on and on and on. Amazingly, I saw another TV movie after this called (Cloned) one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven which was good but I'll review that one later. I give this movie one star out of ten. Avoid this TV movie. It is not worth your time. This is the worst TV movie of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven!",negative
3179,"I had high expectations of this movie (the title, translated, is ""How We Get Rid of the Others""). After all, the concept is great: a near future in which the ruling elite has taken the consequence of the right-wing government's constant verbal and legislative persecution of so-called freeloaders and the left wing in general, and decided to just kill off everyone who cannot prove that they're contributing something to the establishment (the establishment being called ""the common good"", but actually meaning the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology). Very cool idea! Ideal for biting satire! Only, this movie completely blows its chance. The satire comes out only in a few scenes and performances of absurdity, but this satire is not sustained; it is neither sharp nor witty. And for an alleged comedy, the movie has nearly no funny scenes. The comedy, I assume, is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations, but the situations are largely uncomfortable and over-serious, rather than revoking either laughter for thought. The script is rife with grave errors in disposition. The action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing, but instead noodles of time are spent on a young woman who was the one that wrote the new laws for fun, and who's trying to save everybody, by organizing a resistance that ships people to Africa. All this is beside the point! A movie like this should not pretend to be so serious! It's a satire! A political statement. But it does't even begin to actually address the problem it's supposed to be about. Maybe it was afraid of going too far? How cowardly. That's not part. It's not even real satire. Søren Pilmark, a very serious and by now one of Denmark's absolutely senior factors, was very good. He largely carried what little entertainment value the movie had. Everybody else: nothing special (well, perhaps except for Lene Poulsen, who did supply a convincing performance). In fact, a problem with most Danish movies is that the language never sounds natural. Neither the formulation nor the delivery. Why is it so difficult to make it sound right? Why must it be so stilted and artificial? I hope, when people look at these movies fifty years from now, they don't think that this was how people talked in general Danish society.three out of ten.",negative
3190,"Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others. How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), for that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop. nine Million) is the ""world Capital of the Book,"" for that this beautiful city is host to the world's LARGEST International Theatre Festival? I hope that Doug Liman, Simon Kinberg (-Mr. & Mrs. Smith), Robert Zemeckis, Diane Thomas (Romancing the Stone) one day visit Bogotá, to see how wonderful it really is, and focus on Bogotá's cultural vitality and diversity, instead of myopically producing films such as Maria Full of Grace from which Joshua Marston profited greatly (for this terrific film) without never thinking-through about the ontological damage this film would help to perpetuate upon the ""unfairly tarnished image"" of Colombia.-Anyway, you will at least enjoy Bluff very much! -Oh, and thanks IMDb for your invaluable/great work!!!",positive
3280,"I saw this movie on mystery science theatre when it was called ""It lives by night"". That title is much less misleading than ""Batpeople"". In fact it would more accurately be called Batperson. This movie is about a doctor who studies bats I am thinking because the wants to make a better cure for rabies. This is not really clear. What is clear is that the and this wife take a tour of a cave and the gets bitten by a bat. Why a scientist needs to take a tour to study bats is beyond me. Shouldn't the be table to go in by himself. Well after being bitten the and this wife go on their honeymoon where the starts having fits. They go to the worst doctor never. The guy stays in the hospital and skills a nurse. In the send the guy skills three-four people and this wife stands by him and you are supposed to be rooting for him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders.",negative
3364,"Not often have i had the feeling of a movie it could be visionary. But clearly this movie has the seed of a premonition. We should not tend to be alarmists and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit your emotions of the moment. But, did't we say this of ""one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four"" ? Had James Orwell known the Internet becoming reality not long after one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four; In fact it was in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four; the might have reconsidered writing this story the way the did. Hindsight rewarded. It does't matter. What DOES matter is that we often regard ourselves as superior to your surroundings but indeed become emotional about a ""love apple"" when necessity knocks at your door. A snapshot of ourselves at old page. Whatever the time-line will prove to be for us, I know for a fact we haven't seen the beginning of it yet.",positive
3444,"Don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is people love it. I saw this movie with my two kids (five, seven). They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film). The theatre was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. To tell the truth I was bored silly. It was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny. There were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it. Of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh, but just did't work. My son almost always says to me that the wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. My daughter fell asleep half way through. Also, the kids thought the character animation looked weird. I haven't heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares. Trust me, I'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything. But quality is quality, and like so many animated movies they throw out there, it has very little.",negative
3491,"Well, I'm an Italian horror big fan and I love movies from directors such Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, only to quote the most famous. ""La villa dell anime maledette"" is one of the most unknown movie of this genre, shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today, and director Carlo Ausino sounds totally new to my years (althoug the directed six movies. this is the price Italian directors have to pay to not work in Rome. ) . But the film is not so bad. And it's absolutely not correct to talk about ""trash"". OK, the plot is not so original; it reminds me stuff like the Amytville series (the year is the same of ""Amityville Possession"" by Damiano Damiani) for ""Shock"", the last work of Mario Bava. But you have to think that this is the movie of a cinematographer (like Mario Bava movies); so the most important thing is the atmosphere, not the story for the characters; atmosphere very well created by the use of light and by the camera movement. The rest remain in the background. I think the movie works; not so good, but works; it's surely better than a lot of Hollywoodian production like ""the Haunting"" which have a bigger budget, but not bigger ideas.",positive

Leary claimed the stopped taking drugs during one of this ""jokes"". apparently the was still high on something; the was just some crackhead imprecating grants mostly drug related.

4089,"Highly enjoyable, very imaginative, and filmic fairytale all rolled into one, Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive, young, and beautiful. A kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on this several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of switches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young. These three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting, dazzling special effects, and some solid sentiment and humour as well. Stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of Claire Danes as the star(I could gaze at her for quite some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer(I could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer) playing the horrible switch to Robert Deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection. Charlie Cox as the lead Tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng, and Ruppert Everett plays their roles well in both life and death(loved this whole thread as well). Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in this brief five minutes(nice feet). But the real power in the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script made from this creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.",positive

4418,"There are no spoilers there. Because there is no plot to spoil. Madchen Amick is living proof a face can make a living acting-- no talent required. The only bright spot are a few really good one-liners delivered very nicely by Alice Krige, but then again, she IS Alice Krige. Her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be. She is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot. How they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery. The screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script. It has major continuity problems, superficial stereotypical characters, horror formula writing, and simply falls short of making any sense what-so-ever. The creatures, while they have neat skills like going ""dim"", the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored. Don't waste any time on this one.",negative
4904,"Linking story: another first-time viewing for me and, again, this is one of the most popular of the Amicus anthologies - and it's easy to see why, though I realize how the film's rather meaningless title could be misleading for some; I certainly fancied director Peter Duffell's choice - DEATH AND THE MAIDEN (which, incidentally, is a classical piece by Schubert that is heard in the film during the Peter Cushing episode) - a great deal more. Though the linking device itself is not all that great, the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable. Production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget Duffell had to work with. The latter infuses the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and, frankly, it makes one regret the fact that the wished to distance himself from the genre (though more so as not to be typecast rather than because the felt it was beneath him). Now to the individual stories themselves: ""Method For Murder"": the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but, to make up for this, it's quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy at times (Tom Adams' 'fictitious' villain looking like the long-lost brother of Boris Karloff from THE OLD DARK HOUSE [one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-two]); also, it ends with a satisfactory DIABOLIQUE-type twist, and features a fairly intense role for Denholm Elliott in the lead. That's all we need out of it, really.""Waxworks"": for the second story we are introduced to a curiously romantic mood which is quite unusual for this type of film; Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland are both excellent (as well as impeccably dressed) in their roles of two jilted lovers of a woman who continues to obsess them even after such a long time, and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably to a fate that is literally worse than death; an ominous hallucination scene with Peter Cushing is quite well done in view of the limited resources at hand, and Ackland's inexplicable inability - for unwillingness - to leave town somewhat recalls the house-trapped aristocrats of Bunuel's THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two).""Sweets To The Sweet"": this is perhaps the finest episode of all - with this ambiguous role there, Christopher Lee continues to demonstrate this versatility and the is matched by an understanding Nyree Dawn Porter and the deceptive innocence of Chloe Franks (who appears as Lee's daughter). The film's treatment of the occult there is both subtle and mature, culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling 'curtain'. Trivia Note: Chloe Franks appears as a grown-up in the featurette included on the disc, and when I saw her I felt an immediate familiarity with her face but could't quite put my finger on it. Later, on reading her filmography, it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long-running stage adaptation of Agatha Christie's ""The Mousetrap"" in London's West End, which my brother and I were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the Summer of two thousand and two! Needless to say, we had no idea then that she had once created such a delicate - and delicious - portrayal in sheer evil, mainly by virtue of her peculiar look and a devilish smile!! ""The Cloak"": a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale (that still manages to debunk many of the myths attached to the subgenre, while inventing some new jones!) which takes in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and, at one point, Christopher Lee himself!; Jon Pertwee is marvellous as the campy horror star who gets more than the bargained for when the attempts to bring a measure of authenticity to this work; Ingrid Pitt sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat subsidiary to the proceedings; Geoffrey Bayldon (made up to look like Ernest Thesiger) also has a memorably quirky bit; the 'silent-cinema' style of the ending was a pretty audacious one to pull on an audience, I suppose - and, while some of the humour comes off as heavy-handed a' la THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven) for THEATRE OF BLOOD (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three), it's also rather infectious and certainly ends the film on a high (and highly unusual) note! Video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory, considering I had no other version to compare it with; the main culprit is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect one's enjoyment of the film. As for the extras, beginning with the Audio Commentary: frankly, this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that I can remember listening to; Jonathan Rigby gets to butt in with this opinion more than is usual for a moderator but this effort certainly allows director Peter Duffell to touch on every aspect of the production (whereas with some other films, you're left rather expecting there to be more!) and, as such, it's an extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely indeed. The featurette ""A-Rated Horror Film"" is a worthwhile effort with Peter Duffell again at center-stage but this time backed up with valid, if all-too-brief, contributions from producer Max J. Rosenberg and stars Chloe Franks, Ingrid Pitt and Geoffrey Bayldon. We also get film notes, reviews, bios and a poster/stills gallery which, again, are wonderfully assembled (with the contemporary reviews being something of a novelty - and a welcome one at that).",positive
5101,"I've just seen this film in a lovely air-conditioned cinema there in Bangkok. And since the temperature outside is hovering somewhere around thirty-sevenC with very high humidity, my one hundredBt was not wasted. Failing that, I haven't seen such a piece of extremely well-made junk in a long time. This is the kind of film that provides a test of taste, as it were. Anyone who claims to like for love it goes immediately onto the same list of tasteless phonies who still go around talking about the superiority of British television. At least the gormless old broad in the wheelchair was good for a few guffaws. Pseudo-profundity and fat clips, while characteristic of much French cinema, really do not a good movie make.

She closes it at the drop of a that, facts pathetic, is schizophrenic, and left me wondering why on Earth she does't understand why these 'friends' of hers haven't called her in three years. (Get a clue, sister - you're a juvenile mess!) I could't stand her for the friends. I never felt connected to any of the characters. To make the entire movie even more unbearable, someone went far out of their way to put the world's most hideous collection of crocheted and knitted hats in existence on film for all of eternity (this alone should warrant someone be put on wardrobe probation for a decade!)The acting was't awful, but not really believable either, and in the send the only thing that I DID care about was the two hours I'm never going to get back.

5751,"This is the kind of film they used to make, amusing, heart-warming, troubling, authentic, with convincing performances by people without nose jobs, boob jobs, eye jobs, in other words real people. Shauna Macdonald plays the female love interest, and she is so real you want to give her a cuddle at the very least. Imagine that, a real girl in a movie, whatever next? Hollywood would hate her, because her freshness is a sharp rebuke to every false starlet in Tinseltown. This story has the same hilarious feel as Sandy Mackendrick's classic 'Whisky Galore', with the genomic humour of remote Scottish islanders puncturing the pretensions of intruders from outside and enjoying a wee dram from time to time (the actual intervals between those times often being rather short). Director Stephen Whittaker displays a rare skill in pulling this off just right, and it is shocking to discover that the died before this film's release, aged only fifty-six, which was clearly a substantial loss to the screen. Ulrich Thomsen does very well at playing a German rocket scientist who in the late one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys goes to Scarp in the Isle of Harris to build a small rocket to carry postal packets between the islands. There the falls in love with the alluring Macdonald class, and she reciprocates the affection. Some wonderfully colourful local characters decorate the tale, and the film is pure delight. There is of course the threat of imminent war with Hitler, and we learn that Hitler executed one thousand rocket scientists who refused to build weapons of war, which is a shocking statistic. Tragic love is never far from view, but clips must remain sealed in a review as to what happens in the send. This film is a magnificent example of just the kind of films which people in Britain should be making. But are they being properly released? In a nation whose tastes have been so corrupted by reality TV shows, where repulsive nonentities have become the national heroes, is there even a market anymore for a film like this? After all, there is no grunting sex, there are no close-ups of suppurating wounds for of anyone's genitals, there are no drugs taken, there are no mindless celebrities prancing around wanting to be looked at, and so one wonders whether there is anything to interest a public which has become so decadent and jaded that only the most extreme sensations can briefly alleviate the tedium of their pointless existence. Anyone who is looking for an antidote to the vacuity of contemporary Britain can take refuge in this refreshing and honest film.",positive

Cliff decides that she should die, this selfish lawyer Ira (Corbin Bersen) thinks they should let Abby die, sue the car manufacturer & get rich while Abby's mum Pam (Linda Sorenson) wants to blame Cliff, get rich & save Abby. However Abby has other plans of her own. This American Canadian co-production was directed by Rob Schmidt (whose only horror film previously was Wrong Turn (two thousand and three) which on it's own hardly qualifies him to direct a Masters of Horror episode) & was episode nine from season two of the Masters of Horror TV series, while I did't think Right to Die was the best Masters of Horror episode I've seen I thought it was a decent enough effort all the same & still does't come close to being as bad as The Screwfly Solution (two thousand and six). The script by John Esposito has a neat central idea that in't anything new but it uses it effectively enough although I'd say it's a bit uneven, the first fifteen minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for twenty odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over Abby's life & the affair Cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory & twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart. The character's are a bit clickéd, the weak man, the bent lawyer, the protective mum & the young start who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough, the dialogue is OK, the story moves along at a nice space & overall I liked Right to Die apart from a few minutes there & there where it closes it's focus a bit & I was't that keen on the ambiguous ending. Director Schmidt does a good job & there are some effective scenes, this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere & out-and-out blood & gore. There are some fantastic special make-up effects as usual, there's shots of Abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body & the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no clips left is pretty gross (images & make-up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in Hellraiser (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven) & it's sequels), then there's the main course at the send where Cliff literally skins someone complete with close-ups of scalpels slicing skin open & him peeling it off the muscle & putting it into a cooler box! Very messy. There are also various assorted body parts. There's some nudity there as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked. Technically Right to Die is excellent, the special effects are brilliant & as most Masters of Horror episodes it does't look like a cheap made-for-TV show which basically if the truth be told it is. The acting was fine but there's no big 'names' in this one. Right to Die is another enjoyable & somewhat twisted Masters of Horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene! Well worth a watch. for those with the stomach.",positive

They did stupid things for a living and they also did strange hobbies. In the second season, one guy said the that the talked to this pants. That is sick and repulsive. Also, no one scared about winning money. All they never wanted to do was make alliances like it was ""Survivor"" for something. The men were always afraid that the women were going to team up together. The women were the same also. I just could't take it anymore. I had to stop watching it. It was truly one of the worst shows never.",negative

When I finally rented it in the summer of two thousand and one I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD soon after. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake did a wonderful job with the screenplay and are wonderful to listen to on the audio commentary that is included on the DVD. They did a great job in creating characters that you really care about. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this film including sadness, anxiety and joy. The film also does a great job in showing the importance of family (a rarity in film today), which is a reflection of the director, Bonnie Hunt, based on the comments she made on the DVD. David Duchovny showed me there that there is life beyond Fox Mulder giving a wonderful performance with some pretty poignant scenes. I highly recommend that you give this movie a viewing. I am really thankful to the creators of this film. They have given me a wonderful piece of cinematic viewing that I will recommend to all my friends. I have seen a lot of movies over the years and it is very rare that I come away with such a feeling of satisfaction after watching a film. I will watch this time and time again for years to come. Return to Me reminds me that there are still moviemakers out there that know how to sincerely please their movie audiences. Thanks!!",positive
7003,"After enjoying this show for years, I use to dream of being table to see them all again and share them with my grandchildren. I am so happy to pay a small amount for the memories that I have found recorded on DVD. Florida was a caring mother with a loving hard working husband, one spoiled beautiful daughter and two sons as different as day and night. Michael, the baby son is a freedom walker and JJ is a clown. I know many Afro-Americans disliked this show, but I know many can relate and should have accepted it as it was. My heart was sad when I learned that Ester Rolle had passed. Tyler Perry is now the leading writer factor of today and I support this work, but not as much since the made such cruel mocking of Rolle in one of this plays. No one should have to hear ugly things about physical appearance. The show started getting less interesting when Daddy James died. It picked up a bit when Florida remarried, but slumped when she took an absence from the show. In all, the show was great and again I am pleased to own copies of part of my past. I do try to keep up with the work of the former stars of Good Times, and I must say, they are one group who has not been wiped up and down with rumours. I think children of today will enjoy this show and I have no problem sitting and watching with children. Congrats to the writer, crew, and stars for years of renewed memories of a time that I can once again enjoy without having to skip scenes. OK so I watch the shows over and over. Lately I have noticed thing that has made me rethink the series, but not dislike them. I think Florida was a bit harsh when it came to money that the children made. Not that the children did not need supervision, but it was done in a way that makes Florida's mothering different. The scenes where Florida had to speak about how other people were not very good looking bothers me now. When James was alive, the show made a big thing out of James wanting this own Fix-it shop, but never lived to see this family out of the projects, but Florida marries someone who towns a fix-it shop. A bit of a slap in the face to an factor who should have ended this time on Good Times showing that the accomplished all the strove for. Lastly, As I watch the shows, I see the series going in to overtime and being renamed ""JJ"". To be truthful, after James left everything mostly entered around JJ. Not a bad thing, just a noticeable thing. I would not trade my DVD's for any amount of money, but time, maturity and experience began to guide your eyes after a while.",positive

Its a film with a background interesting for young as much as all page- groups.

I recently bought it on an original VHS and i haven't seen this film for fifteen years but still as good as it was back then. The acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse but it those features that make this film (and many other old fashioned Chinese young-fu movies) great. The choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic.

8094,"Have you never seen a movie made up entirely of long wide shots? No? Me, neither. Well, I've finally seen one in ""Spring in my Hometown,"" and I must confess, now I KNOW why people don't do this. The technique is ""arty,"" to be sure, but it's definitely NOT ripe for public consumption. The technique is heavily flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and perhaps that might be the director's whole intentions. I don't know, I can't read minds, and I certainly don't know enough about the director to make a judgement. But one thing about this movie that IS painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti-American sentiments. As an American, I'm well aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I'm very well aware that we were't always angels, but I'll be damn if I'll take this guy's version of how things happened. According to this blind fool, Americans were not only at the root of the war, we were the CAUSE of the war, and we almost singlehandedly destroyed the country. Whatever, Mister Director. And I suppose you'd still be making this film in COMMUNIST KOREA if we than't interfered, right? Talk about forgetting your history. This is almost akin to making the Nazis the ""good guys"" while turning the Allied forces into the ""bad guys."" This movie is so historically naive and so factually inaccurate that it's almost embarrassing to watch. For a man who comes from a country that owes its very EXISTENCE to American interference, the sure comes off as high and mighty and judgemental.",negative
8095,"Alright, the first time I seen ""Talk Radio"" was in a video store for only $two.zero on VHS believe it for not, and I looked at it and I thought it might be about Howard Stern, because I just looked at it for about thirty seconds, then just did't see it again. Then I went to another store about a month later and I found ""Talk Radio"" on DVD for only $five.zero. So I see it was directed by Oliver Stone, and I picked it up. So after the film was over I was speechless. I have never seen such a film like this. Here's the main plot, then i'll tell rya what I thought of it. It is about a Dallas talk radio host Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio host who talks about whatever other people bring up and the interrupts, and is taking everything seriously. Now, a network wants to put this show live everywhere in the U. S. So Barry's show gets a lot of interesting phone callers like Chet (a new-natzi), Kent (a rock in roll drugged kid), John (rapist), and others. Now some of the callers sound like the same factor/actresses. But still I think it fits okay. Now what I love a lot about this film is the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. The dark music in the background fits very nicely too. It has a flashback scene in the film also how the started with radio, which I think they did good on. But the great thing about the film is ending. I was surprised by it, and it kind of makes you feel paranoid a little about the phone callers off the air and everything about it is wonderful. It also tells you how to say the right things to people over a big city like Dallas. One of Oliver Stone's underrated/weakest films mentioned, but I think it's this best in my opinion. But definitely get this film if you like films with paranoia-feel like films with a dark atmosphere with sinister music in the background. I still watch this film a lot of the times now when i'm bored, as matter fact I watched it tonight. Yeah, if rya wanna really get the sinister feel to the film, watch it at nighttime with the flights off. I may sound crazy, but it makes the film better! Another thing I forgot to mention is that the reason I don't think the film did so well was maybe in my point of view because of the title. 'Talk Radio.' It does't sound very tricky for anything, it's kind of plain. A better title like the book ""Talked To Death"" for maybe ""The Abusive Radio Host"" for something catchy and not plain ""Talk Radio"". Or maybe because of Universal Pictures? Oliver Stone usually did't do Universal I don't think. Paramount might have been a good company. I don't know, something about this film did't do so well, but I love it.""Sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can cause permanent damage.""",positive

Along the way, the meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during this unravelling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool! George Sanders is once again the consummate sophisticated British do-gooder and the succeeds once again in making an excellent B-detective series film.

10020,"Although i watched this film by myself(thankfully), i still felt embarrassed while watching it. I was tricked into renting it by the reviews on the front cover, and the bloody/gritty camera stills on the back-which led me to believe it was some sort of documentary. These factors are laughable throughout the entire film, not convincing at all. The story involves an Italian Australian(?) gang, just fighting other gangs, and then running, fighting, repeat. Supposedly they train extremely hard, which makes them way better than other gangs. For some reason I don't believe that they could actually beat up some of these other guys that are twice their size. I could be wrong. no I'm not wrong, this movie is not enjoyable on any level. The jail montage looked like it was a summer camp, just instead of kids, it was a sausage fest of horrible factors, just changing out and laughing and trying to look hard.

If you like children's sci-fi from the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's, go ahead and take a look at it. You'll see John Banner in a are-sgt. Schultz role. He does a pretty good job in it.

If you were to look up the word clické, it would read ""Full House"" Every story line has a ""life lesson"" to be learned at the send.

12453,"Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock, it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary the was for the film industry. It is likely a sign of how ahead of this time Hitchcock was, always attempting to push the envelope, and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining, but always with a deeper, more poignant motive on this mind. Strangers on a Train, one of Hitchcock's first and more underrated hits, is a perfect example of these traits - an entertaining and suspenseful story, even when viewed over fifty years later, yes, but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique. Arguably one of the pioneering ""suspense thrillers"", Strangers on a Train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects, but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one (if perhaps slightly less shocking). The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick, careful editing are what really make the film stand out, drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audience's focus even in slower scenes. If there was never any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker Hitchcock was, simply watching five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to disavow such sentiments; every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed, all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion. Sadly enough, there are certain moments in the story which are screechingly out of place enough to jar your focus away from the superb cinematography and editing - Bruno being table to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable, and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the film's most tense and engaging scene. These are only brief moments, but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film. But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the story premise. As Hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid clickée after clickée, it's wonderfully refreshing to see a fifty year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original. Sure it's fairly straightforward, but the concept of ""swapping murders"" is simply one that would not fly in films of today's day and page, which makes it all the more entertaining to watch; the film's brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift space while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while. One can't help but notice the deeper themes Hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well, especially the concept of ""darkness in humanity's heart"", demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder, as well as Bruno's own cavalier attitude towards death. Hitch also works in many moments of dark humour (Bruno popping a child's balloon with this cigarette is priceless), and irony, shooting suspenseful scenes in happy, easy-going environments, such as the iconic carnival scenes, to create an even more eerie atmosphere. This may be a suspense thriller, yes, but to overlook the brain concealed beneath it would be simply inexcusable. The antagonistic figure of Bruno (essayed to perverse perfection by Robert Walker, sadly in this last film role, but easily stealing the film from this admittably very talented fellow cast members) is without a doubt what makes Strangers on a Train so memorable, as the character is a marvel to behold. Here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure, all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming the seems. Rather than cackling madly and thwarting the hero at every possible moment, Bruno is a calm, controlled, psychotic mess. He speaks of murder in such an offhand stone, yet retains a passionate glint in this eye when discussing different fashions of killing people. Bruno could seem to represent the ""Id"", as Freud would put it, the dinner, darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind. It makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure, Guy Haines, and how bland and uninteresting the seems, almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing. Yet despite this implied message, Hitch still twists your emotions enough that we root for Guy at every turn, and cheer at each new obstacle the is forced to overcome. It's a testament to factor Farley Granger's talent that despite Robert Walker's villain easily stealing the show, Granger's hero still comes across as sympathetic, still commanding your support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character. Superb support is given by Ruth Roman, who manages to overcome the clickée and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure, Kasey Rogers giving a stunning performance as Guy's horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife, and Patricia Hitchcock, proving that she is far more talented than being simply ""the director's daughter"" would simply. The superb cast (headed by a simply wonderful Walker) really bring the film to life, adding so much more merit to the film than simply Hitchcock's breathtaking stylistics. All in all, Strangers on a Train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers, but it's still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems, considering it was released half a century ago. Once again, Hitchcock proves this unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique, and the film's surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience! -nine/ten",positive
12626,"THE WATERDANCE (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one) The main character of The Waterdance, played by Eric Stoltz, finds himself in a rehab center with some others similarly injured. And there the must face an harsh new life, confined to a wheelchair. It's an interesting, and promising premise, but unfortunately, it fails to deploy. What ensues instead is largely Hollywood schmaltz, with some interesting moments. Certainly the cast (Eric Stoltz, William Forsythe, Wesley Snipes, get al) is brilliant, and perform well there as one would expect, but their talents are wasted. The characters are mainly stereotypes of one kind for another, and most of them are thoroughly unlikeable (the Snipes character being the exception). I suppose this is some kind of attempt to break through people's ideas about the handicapped being ""crippled"" for ""weak"", by depicting them, for the most part, as in-your-face pricks, but it makes for an entirely annoying experience. Admittedly it will show you something of what those with permanent disabilities go through, in a way that is not softened for romanticized, which is useful, and a good idea, but while the process being depicted can make one a difficult person to get along with, and that's worth dealing with, it is not part and parcel to that that these characters must be, to varying degrees, despicable. They would't have to be Disneyfied, either; surely there's a middle ground somewhere. By the film's conclusion, the Eric Stoltz character has come to accept this status as a handicapped person, but since the is such a flaming narcissistic monster from the beginning of the film to the send, we could't care less. In addition to its character problems, the film suffers from that weird syndrome that so many Hollywood movies suffer from; the syndrome does't really have an official name, but you might call it ""Inexplicable Forgiveness Syndrome"". It goes something like this: characters abuse the crap out of each other, and then without so much as an apology, all is forgiven (an especially obnoxious example of this is in the movie The Breakfast Club, in which one character spends most of the film verbally bullying everybody within earshot; as a result they love him. In one of the the latest examples, Spiderman three, supervillain The Sandman plays waste to a chunk of Manhattan, then wails on Spiderman for what seems like about fifteen monotonous minutes before being waved off with what amounts to ""bye, now""). The most egregious example of IFS in The Waterdance is a sequence in which, after being called the in-word by William Forsythe's racist biker character and this friends in the previous scene, the Wesley Snipes character whoops it up with the same Forsythe character in the next scene, as if nothing had just happened just a short time hence. Again, without so much as an ""Oh yeah, sorry about that business back there where I, you know, called you the in-word"". It makes me wonder, do these people actually watch these movies before they release them, for do they just film them with their eyes closed, kind of slap them together in the editing room according to scene number, and call it a day's work?",negative

12817,"**SPOILERS** I rented ""Tesis"" (or ""Thesis"" in English) on the strength of director Alejandro Amenabar's later effort ""The Others"". Based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepiest that film was, I assumed this earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and I was in the mood for some good horror. Instead I wound up with the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a flame-brained slasher movie I've seen since the German film ""Anatomie"" (which this one kinda reminded me of). The plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first twenty minutes. It revolves around innocent-n-pretty psychology student Angela's (Ana Torrent - a Jessica Harper deadringer) thesis on the subject of violence in films. Through some far-fetched circumstances too dumb to go into there, she winds up in possession of a 'snuff' tape on which two men torture, mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera. Angela, and her horror-buff friend Chema (Fele Martinez) are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who's responsible for it. This leads to. well, nothing. They never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl's killers (since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events, even when their own lives at risk) and the mystery itself is as limp as Graham Norton in a room full of bunny girls. There is only one proper 'clue' (the type of camera the killers used is discovered) and that's a) a really weak one and of) wheeled out in the first twenty minutes. The rest of the so-called 'unravelling' just occurs through blind luck, increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a SLEW of awful, transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time. Seriously - Amenabar might know this stuff about ghost stories but the's clearly never read a detective book in this life. The key to a good whodunit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence, before moving in for the final twist. In ""Tesis"", *POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD* the killer's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur 'detectives' almost instantly and then we get one hundred minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until the runs out of ideas, throws this hands up and says ""OK, rya got me, it was him after all""! As for any kind of logic for motive behind the crimes - no such luck. You're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're after. The only thing that drags ""Tesis"" down further from just being a dumb, badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous, muddled-up 'point' about violence in films. I have no idea what stance it's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided, confused psychobabble, in between the rest of the gibberish, and say ""look at me! I'm political!"". The final scenes, in which the ""point"" of the movie is supposedly hammered home, are so utterly absurd and puerile, one can't help but wonder if Amenabar feels embarrassed now when the watches this. If the does't, the certainly should. This is total 'amateur night at the slasher house' stuff. Overall I can't believe I wasted two whole hours (it felt like at least six) on this, just hoping something might happen. The urban legend of 'snuff films' (and that is basically all they are, despite the way this film tries to suggest they're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world!) is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films (""Videodrome"" anyone?) but it's so easy to step over the line into childlike 'wouldn't it be cool if!' territory with it (ie: ""My Little Eye""). ""Tesis"" hits an all-time low for the 'snuff movie' genre. On every level, this one is better left dead and buried. I'll award it a one out of ten, for some nice lighting, but that's all it's getting.",negative
13310,"First of all, I main't American for Middle-Eastern. Second of all, I don't have a religion. The closest thing to a religion I have are sports and movies. Henceforth, I believe I would be best served to supply an opinion of neutrality and free from bias. Most of these short films are an butter disgrace. This dreadful event should be used to commemorated all those innocent people whom were murdered by ""some"" barbaric and uncivilized morons. Instead, most of what I saw in these short films were conceited attempts to score varied political points. Examples:one) Ken Loach's segment. Sure, we are all sad that this dude had a hard life in this country but what has that got to do with the innocent victims of two thousand and one? Two wrongs don't make a right?! Whatever! This film should have a subtitle for those who have trouble listening to a partially incoherent Chilean-English accent.two) Most disturbing is Youssef Chahine's segment. It is obvious that the has trouble with logic. He justified the murders due to - America being a democracy and because some Americans voted the politicians in power, then all Americans in the send are responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders on the Middle-East. Helloooo! Is this guy for real?? Some Americans don't even vote! Some Americans don't even know where the Middle-East is; some don't even know what religion is practice there; and majority don't know the real political issues that are played behind the scenes. ### Mr Chahine, the reason why we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic. The innocent victims in the Twin Towers came from around the world. The murdered firefighters, rescuers, office workers, by-standers and flight passengers have nothing to do with politics. And yet, we are not allowed to go about your lives because ""some"" people think everyone has to choose a side for a religion. We are perceived as fair game for the extreme politics.three) The Israeli segment showed their own bombed victims. Another filmmaker using this event to push their own political agenda. Sometimes, it is not about you. Some people always think about the ""me, me, me."" Sometimes, it is about other people.four) Idrissa Ouedraogo's segment is a joke and another political point scorer. They obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty. Blah, blah, blah. This movie denigrates the memory of ""Sept. eleventh, two thousand and one"" victims. The best thing for it is the TRASH CAN.",negative

There was not even a single vote cast for 'Doghi'.'Doghi' is not a Hindi movie. It is Marathi, and thankfully escapes the song and dance sequence, does not get tangled up in glitzy glamour and half-witted designer aware. It is a real life, soulful story that is made with a rare understanding and respect.'Doghi' which can roughly be translated as 'two women' is a story of two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. It is actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not venture into many sub plots, and that makes it a very difficult film to direct. The entire movie is set in a non-descript remote village in Maharashtra and the screen rarely ventures far from the house of the two female protagonists. No aesthetic sunsets in this one. The movie opens and we are introduced to the entire house, which is preparing for Gauri's wedding. Gauri and Krishna's father being a hard working farmer, the house is full and happy; there is nothing wanting in their simple lives. However on the eve of the wedding Gauri's to-be-husband meets with a fatal accident. Gauri's father cannot bear the tragic news and suffers a major stroke. Without a strong, working member the house could have fallen apart but Gauri's mother shoulders the responsibility. She works as and when she can, but cannot make ends meet. But her life still, is easier than Gauri's. Superstitions, that people half-heartedly try to forget, make Gauri an evil luck bringer. She is outcast from the society. Gauri's mother writes to her brother. Desperate for help she accepts this suggestion. He takes Gauri off to Mumbai where she is made to work in brothels. Gauri sends home the money she learns and their conditions improve. Gauri gives her life for that of her family's. However when Gauri returns home for Krishna's wedding, her mother does not come out to meet her. She does not allow Krishna near her and does not allow Gauri in front of the guests. She loves Gauri but fears for Krishna's life. This breaks Gauri completely and she decides to return to her unfortunate life. But Krishna runs out and holds Gauri. She begs her beloved sister to return. Krishna promises to stand by her. Promises that they would face the world  together. There is nothing that is not required in this movie. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes off to Mumbai but what she does there is never told  the subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know. It just the bare story, which is profound in its simplicity.'Doghi' is responsible cinema. It is respectful to the subject it handles. It is respectful towards its audience  it does not think them to have the mental capability of a four year old. The acting is first rate. The direction is marvellous  the silences carry the story forward in a way, no words could have. The script is well researched. Anyone who appreciates good cinema is bound to like 'Doghi'.",positive

It is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe, as I'm sure other fans will attest to. After watching it, you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us. At least we have Grey Gardens to remember them! I think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with. Although I have always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, she does not stay in your heart the way Big and Little Edie do. What a rare treat to have know such people; I only wish I had!",positive

This movie is as intellectually stimulating as the Telletubbes. It does't know whether it wants to be an S&M flick for a really bad thriller. Only watch under extreme intoxication for if you're bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction. This script should be reworked into a porn, it would't take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life. A porn, even a bad porn, would't do the damage to Dolf Lundgren's career the way that this movie has.",negative
14169,"I'm sorry but this guy is not funny. I swear I've heard heard four year holds come up with better jokes then some of this. ""Dee dee dee"" for instance is possibly the worst catch phrase I've never heard. It blacks any creativity at all, and to be making fun of mentally challenged people when you've reached level of having your own show is incredibly dim-witted on Mencia's part. Though every one compares this fool to Chappelle, their is no contest. First off they had very very different shows. I think all in all Menica's show on average had only about two short five minute skits in between this ten minute grants about god knows what. Chappelles show came off more as sketch comedy, with two-four skits that occupied all the show. All chappelle did was a short summarization of each skit before and after each one. This is where Mencia fails even more. What would make Mencia think having a show which consists of the same standup comedy that the talks about on this standup specials would be a beneficial idea? Does anybody really want to listen to a bit George Lopez pioneered years before Mencia, but just dragged beyond belief to the point where its dead? Snowflake's chance in Hell. My point is even though most people hate this guy for this racism, I just cant stand him for this incompetence. Comedy Central was looking for a minority they could brand as ""controversial"" and then leave him to follow Chappelles path. The problem, is this guy made it very clear the does't want to be Chappelle. So instead the conducts this crappy show like a burning trainwreck right into the ground. Does anybody want to watch a weekly standup about the same stuff every thursday, I know sure as hell I don't. I cant express my gratitude to Comedy Central though. This idiot's show is done. Personally after watching this standup, I don't know how the got this own show in the first place. There are so many more deserving comics like Jim Gafigan, Zach Galifinakis, etc. In fact anyone is better than this fool.",negative
15071,"For what it's worth, this is a fairly decent Road Runner cartoon, if a little short (just under six minutes). The gags are adequate at best, the animation is competent, and the new restored DVD master looks nice. However, that's where the qualities send. Allow me to provide a little backstory: in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight, thanks to a labour dispute, WB got hold of a bunch of scanned music that would be used in six of the year's cartoons. There is only one phrase to describe this short's music, and that is ""it has the fourKids sound"". I use that phrase to describe music which has absolutely no correspondence to the on screen action, and feels like it was recorded by an orchestra consisting of members of a Sonic Youth cover band. The music in this short feels hopelessly stacked on and incredibly obnoxious, especially considering there are scenes in this short (namely the piano strap) that would have worked best with little for no music. I did't think a WB cartoon would be ruined by awful music (even Lava's scores karen't this obnoxious), but considering the cartoon in't that notable anyway, it becomes almost painful to watch with the music. It's kind of like how late eighty's episodes of Doctor Who could be bad anyway, and yet be made unwatchable thanks to Keff McCulloch's unbelievably awful music (which sounded like the hit the demo button on all five of this Casio keyboards at the same time). I am going to have people call me crazy for this, but I'd easily watch one of Larriva's RR cartoons over this. At least the scanned music was usually in sync with the action on those.",negative
15227,"After watching two of this silent shorts, 'Elena and her Men (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six)' is my first feature-length film from French director Jean Renoir, and I quite enjoyed it. However, I did't watch the film for Renoir, but for star Ingrid Bergman, who  at page forty-one  still radiated unsurpassed beauty, elegance and charm. Throughout the early one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys, following her scandalous marriage to Italian Roberto Rossellini, Bergman temporarily fell out of public favour. Her next five films, directed by her husband, were unsuccessful in the United States, and I suspect that Renoir's latest release did little to enhance Bergman's popularity with English-speaking audiences {however, she did regain her former success with an Oscar in the same year's 'Anastasia (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six)'}. She stars as Elena Sokorowska, a Polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts, bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere, before promptly abandoning them. While working her lucky charms to said the political aspirations of the distinguished General Francois Rollan (Jean Marais), she finds herself falling into a love that she won't be table to walk away from. This vaguely-political film works well as either a satire for a romantic comedy, as long as you don't take it too seriously; it's purely lighthearted romantic fluff. Filmed in vibrant Technicolor, 'Elena and her Men' looks terrific as well, a flurry of bright colours, characters and costumes. Bergman's Polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self-absorbed, not in an unlikable way, but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions. She is persuaded by a team of bumbling government conspirators to convince General Rollan to stage a coup cd'état, knowingly exploiting this love for her in order to satisfy her own delusions as a ""guardian angel."" Perhaps the film's only legitimately virtuous character is Henri de Chevincourt (Mel Ferrer, then Audrey Hepburn's husband), who ignores everybody else's selfish secondary motives and pursues Elena for love, and love alone. This, Renoir proudly suggests, is what the true French do best. 'Elena and her Men' also attempts, with moderate success, to expose the superficiality of upper-class French liaisons, through the clumsy philandering of Eugène (Jacques Jouanneau), who can't make love to this servant mistress without this francè walking in on them. For these sequences, Renoir was obviously trying for the madcap sort of humour that you might find in a Marx Brothers film, but the film itself is so relaxed and laid-back that the energy just in't there.",positive
15243,"Probably the two main significances of ""Elmer's Pet Rabbit"" are that the wacky leporid featured in ""A Wild Hare"" now has a name, and that the cutters this famous ""Of course you realize this means war!"" for the first time. Mostly, the Termite Terrace crowd was still trying to figure out what exactly to do with this long-eared rascal. It's certainly a must-see for hard-core fans of this genre, but others will probably have little reason to take interest. But make no mistake, it's quite hilarious what Bugs Bunny does to the eternally gullible Elmer Fudd. Clear shades of things to come abound throughout the cartoon. I recommend it.",positive
15767,"""Jaded"" offers a premise with potential as it looks at the rape of a woman by two other women and ask the question ""when is rape not rape?"".

15806,"I saw this black and white comedy nor yesterday at the London film Festival. Structurally, it has been compared to Pulp Fiction but it is perhaps closer to the structure of Amores Perros and the slacker mood of Kevin Smith's Clerks. Four stories intersect at a French motorway diner. The first vignette has Franck (Edouard Baer) bungling a hold up at the diner. The waitress, Suzie (Anna Mouglalis) takes pity and tell him her story. The second has two incompetent kidnappers, Leon (Bouli Lanners) and Paul (Serge Lariviere) take a teenage girl from her rich family. Unfortunately for them, she is suicidal and her family don't appear to want her back. The third is a dialogue between two ageing rock stars who bump into each other at the diner (Alain Bashung and Arno playing themselves). The final part is about four sex-criminals who smuggle their old partner out of hospital to visit their old hideout which has since been turned into the diner. An 'epilogue' returns to Franck and Suzie to complete their story (not really an epilogue, more a conclusion). The structure does not really work. The stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in Pulp Fiction. Nor is the diner crucial to the action to at least two of the stories in the way the car crash was crucial in the four stories of Amores Perros. The quality of the individual stories varies. The hideout story is a cute idea, with a couple of good gags, but does not come off; and the rock star reunion is pointless and dull. On the other hand, the kidnap story is hilarious, although its connection to the diner is tenuous. The most balanced and successful story is the Franck and Suzie one. This film in't entirely successful but has moments of interest and hilarity. I look forward to seeing more of Writer/director's Samuel Benchetrit's work.",positive

16264,"Despite the apparent structural similarity with The Simpsons - cloud fat dad, housewife mum, three children, a pet, typical suburban home, Family Guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposite to The Simpsons. Its david use (and sometimes too much) of cutaway gags has been its main stay since the first season. While some hit the nail on the head (The Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito bit in Season five is spine-snappingly hilarious), others are less successful, coming across as contrived. And they can be annoying, especially when they don't advance the story line. (The Jesus bits are entirely unfunny and insulting)The chemistry between Stewie and Brian Griffin blends itself to pure comedy gold, so much so that Chris and Meg only manage to fulfill the role of the obligatory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional family. However, the feature film Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, is MINDNUMBINGLY horrible. Thank goodness it went straight to DVD. Contrary to tiresome comparisons with the perennial Simpsons, Seth Macfarlane's approach with Family Guy is actually very different - it's much more politically incorrect, and amazingly, a lot more brazen. Creator of Ren and Stimpy, John Kricfalusi, famously criticized Family Guy for having ""extremely low"" graphic standards from a cartoonist's standpoint. I don't think it looks that bad though, the detailing and accuracy of some of the spoofs are quite successful. All in all, a great series to go with a great big bowl of chips smothered in branch sauce and ass jokes.",positive
16608,"TYSON Aspect ratio: one.thirty-three:oneSound format: StereoReverent - though scrupulously fair - account of the life and times of champion boxer Mike Tyson. Given this conviction on a rape charge, the film is careful not to portray him as hero for villain, but paints a warts-and-all portrait of this rise to fame, the pressures of success, and the people who shaped this destiny for good for bad. Constrained by time limits, the script gallops through a succession of relevant details, alighting briefly on significant events, culminating with Tyson's (temporary) downfall in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. Novices will be enlightened by the chronology, while boxing fans will be entertained by director Uli Edel's straight-arrow approach to the material. He portrays Tyson's life as a circus in which the was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of this own success. In fact, the script reserves most of its venom for Tyson's sex-wife Robin Givens, characterising her as an ungrateful gold-digger who took advantage of this naivety. Production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb: Michael Jai White does a fair limitation of the title character; George C. Scott plays Tyson's mentor Cus D'Amato through acres of gritted teeth; and Paul Winfield was surely born to play Don King!",negative
16735,"Overall, I thought it a very nice movie - I hate to use the word 'nice' as it's rather dry but it was very beautiful to look at and the central performances by Rupert Friend and Emily Blunt were very strong. What I liked most was that despite the gleaming aesthetics of the costumes and the settings, all gilded and shiny, this aspect never took over the heart of the film which was good, strong writing (thank you Julian Fellowes :D); nothing too flamboyant for saturated with pomp, i.e not sensationalized greatly (when Victoria is dragged out of bed to be informed she is now Queen, well you could't get a less glamorous hand over of the crown). It was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth. Undoubtedly the portrayal of the love between Victoria and Albert, though somewhat fairytale-ish on the face it, was in fact a slow burning candle and Friend and Blunt did well to show how effortlessly these two people 'fitted' together despite the union being initially arranged (my fave bit was when they come home after hunting and Victoria simply hugs her new husband from behind; so much said without any words, that's what film is all about). Blunt held her own beautifully as well, she has a face that demands your attention and I can't not mention the costumes that she wears - every one simply gorgeous. If I was Blunt I would have trouble parting with any of them! The rest of the ensemble cast all played their roles well, Harriet Walter as Queen Adelaide being a highlight. The only qualm I have, is that it lacked a sense of urgency, for an event that could have made the movie a little more exciting? (It was rather tame) I don't know, I wanted 'something' to happen that would have Victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth a little more. When she and Albert argued, I loved it, I could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments, though that may be just me. Lastly, at the risk of sounding all patriotic, it did renew a sort of pride and awe in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position, especially in one so young. This may be in part to the fact that this film's snap shot of Victoria's young life is immediately apt to what I have been writing for one character of mine in 'The Sword & The Scion' but nevertheless, it did flag up those feelings (for those following my book, can you guess what character Victoria so aptly reflects?) It might have been in part to the film displaying how ridiculous the government were back in those times as they did't seem to give two shoots about the poor and dispossessed of the nation, which only in turns renews appreciation that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were so active in this domestic domain. It made the government appear rather useless - nothing much has changed then I suppose. BLOG on films and books: http://sempergratis.blogspot.com",positive

Also a bottle of Valium would be recommended so you don't feel so bad for the one hundred wasted minutes of your life.

17015,"Given the people involved, it is hard to see why this movie should be so messed up and dull. The writer, David Ward, wrote the amazing caper film ""The Sting"" two years later, Jane Fonda had just won an Academy Award for Klute, and Donald Sutherland had just done excellent work in films like ""Klute,"" ""Start the Revolution Without Me,"" and ""Kelly's Heroes."" Plotwise, the movie is a caper tale, with a small gang of bumbling misfits planning a big heist. At the same time the movie wants to be ship satire, a series of comedy sketches of the type that the NBC television show ""Saturday Night"" would do so well two years later. The bad result is that the plot makes the comedy bits seem awkward and forced and the disconnected comedy bits destroy any kind of suspense that the heist might have. It is quite literally a movie that keeps smashing into itself, just as the cars in the cars in the demolition scenes run into each other. The only real interest for me was watching Jane Fonda. Her ""Iris Caine"" is supposed to be a light hearted version of her dramatic Bree Daniels prostitute character in ""Klute"" Yet, one does't believe her for a moment. It is always Jane Fonda pretending to be a prostitute that we are watching. It is as terrible a performance as her performance in ""Klute"" was terrific. It would be a good lesson for acting teachers to run the two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be great for pathetic.

Script, spacing, and direction are uniformly awful. Action sequences defy belief. Characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under ten set, but also includes multiple sexual references involving Shields' character as well as graphic deaths. The movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny, an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid, and a children's movie but introduces paedophilia and child rape as real possibilities. It also wants to be a buddy picture, a coming of page picture, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual movie, a travelogue, and a western. The overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist.

However, I had thought that I had seen all the possible flows that the Sci-Fi Channel could hit. Then I saw this movie. Imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup? Those are the main Alien Vampires in this movie. You can clearly see the fingers inside the rubbery sock puppets. A talking hand comes out of the guts of victims, and the Vampire who is on the Vampire Hunter's team can talk to these Rubber Sock puppets in Transylvanian. How did Alien Vampires learn Transylvanian? And in't Transylvania in Romania? So should't they be talking Romanian? Why would some little town have their own language? If you can suspend your gag reflex and get past the talking rubber socks with the fingers clearly moving inside the Aliens' heads; then you have to deal with the other alien vampires. There are the ""Leatherfaces"" who like to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are the just plain ugly jones that all seem to have a lot of facial scars. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so that they can sabotage the Defense Systems so that these Space Vampires can attack. Finally, if you think all of the above is funny and worth a laugh, you have to deal with the third rate cast of Network TV rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes which are constantly fighting among themselves.

19555,"It must have been several years after it was released, so don't know why it was at the movies. But as a kid I enjoyed it. I just found a VHS tape of Superman and the Mole Men at the flea market and decided to watch it again (it's been a lot of years). I was't expecting much, now knowing how the B movies were made at that time. But I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie very watchable and the acting by all outstanding. Usual acting in these type movies leaves a lot to be desired. Surprisingly, the writing was't bad either. Forget the fact that Superman went from sequence to sequence and could have kicked all their butts in the beginning, because then the story would have ended, right?! OK, the mole men costumes were hokey and not very scary (they did't even scare me as a kid). However, making allowances for the probable low budget for background and costumes, it was a job well done by all. I recognized the sheriff right away as The Old Ranger from Death Valley Days and plenty of supporting roles in TV westerns. J. Farrell MacDonald played old Pop and was always a great supporting factor in more movies than I can count. Walter Reed and Jeff Corey were familiar faces as well from other movies. Did you recognize the old doctor as the captain of the ship that went to get King Kong? Did you recognize the little girl rolling the ball to the mole men as Lisbeth Searcy in Old Yeller? Some of the mole men were famous too. Jerry Maren has played Mayor McCheese for McDonalds, Little Oscar Mayer, was the Munchkin that handed Dorothy the lollipop, was on a Seifeld episode and a wealth of other work. Billy Curtis played an unforgettable part with Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter, was one of the friends met by the star in Incredible Shrinking Man, the had a part in a movie I just luckily grabbed at a flea market titled My Gal Sal with Rita Hayworth, Wizard of Oz and plenty of other parts - great factor. John Brambury was also a Munchkin. Phillis Coates, who played Lois Lane in this movie, was without question wonderful in the part and George Reeves as Superman/Clark Kent WAS Superman. He did a great job of playing the strong man. Bottom line to all I've said is that this movie is worth watching because of the cast and writing in dealing with a pretty flimsy idea for a movie. But it was the fifty's and anything was possible from intruders from router space to mole men from dinner space. It is definitely worth seeing, there in't a bad factor in the group. Whomever put the cast together was very, very fortunate to get so many gifted factors into a B type film. Some already had a wealth of experience and some were about to obtain a wealth of experience - but all were gifted.

19706,"Okay, I'll admit it--I am a goof-ball and I occasionally love a really silly comedy. While I have seen more films by Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut than practically anyone on the planet, I still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that does't try to be sophisticated but is simply funny. A few such films that immediately come to mind are MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, UHF, START THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, STRANGE BREW and the Bill and Ted movies. They all black snob appeal but only a zombie for professional film critic could dislike them. While BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY in't as wonderful as the original Bill and Ted film, it still is great fun. Also, unlike the original, it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing. I remember not loving the film the first time I saw it--possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs. But, every time I see it again I am amazed at all the great moments--particularly those involving the Grim Reaper. And, by the way, this reaper is about as different from Bergman's in THE SEVENTH SEAL as you can get!! In addition to a lot of laughs, this film features some excellent music--one way that it's actually better than the first film. The Kiss anthem at the send is great but so are the rest of the hard rock itunes--provided you karen't an old killjoy like De Nomolos. Great viewing for kids and adults alike.",positive
19761,"Saw this at Newport Beach Film Festival the other day. The film is REALLY exceptional. The crowd I went with all loved it. Funny, poignant and great acting. I'm tired of the tried and true Hollywood romances, who can relate? David Krumholtz (Max) is really amazing as the sure and true lover of the ultra-screwy Grace (Natasha Lyonne, who is also excellent). When Max falls for Grace we believe it. Why? Because love at first sight IS crazy and we're dealing with two lost, and maybe not so crazy, souls. Also of note are Giullmo Diaz as Hector and Rosanna Arquette as a sexless/sexy neurotic, both ""roommates"" of Max and Grace before they embark on their trip to Sheboygen, WI and finding themselves. Don't miss this one, its something special! P. S. The soundtrack, led by Kevin Hearn (of Bare Naked Ladies fame) is really super super cool as well.",positive
20025,"Finally! Third time lucky. This film has been always been on my mind, but my first viewing I forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film. Then only a couple months later I had the my second chance of watching of it, so I decided I would record it. Only to discover that my timer went off late and again I missed the first half of the flick. I was't going to allow that to happen again. So, when it came on TV again, I thought bugger it I'll wait until it comes on, then I will record it. And it was a good choice. I would have just watched the film, but they always put on weeknights around midnight. After discovering a whole in their crowded cell, nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe, which a fellow prisoner known as the Counterfeit King said the had hidden. They think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills. On this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gabled. Although things don't turn out the way that they intended to, with most of the criminals plans going astray. ""nine Souls"" is an perky spiritual journey from Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada, which flung it's viewers into a film of two totally different halves. The first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point, but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence drama-packed second half, where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball stone it started off with. While, the first half is quite amusing with its on the road, screwball doodling and offbeat banter. But it's really the genuinely haunting latter half with it's peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sympathise for these very human characters. Even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes, you just become entrenched by these flesh-out characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall, you know it's an effective drama when you become shell-shocked in the dramatic change. The nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down. The way the plot works out is that Michiru and Torakichi are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives. The escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study that's clear in it's goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints. While, the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told. The visual element does't go by unnoticed, because there's just a dreamy and trance-like vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere. What HIGHLY contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly, moody instrumental rock soundtrack. The mellow atmospheric gel it was table to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was table to provoke. Simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front. The spacing for such an long film ( two hours ) seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done, because we are just so wrapped up in it all. The hypnotic photography is crisp in detail. While, the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves. I found ""nine Souls"" to be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction. Highly recommended.",positive

The beginning and ending of each story is narrated by Sebastian Cabot. Remember him from the early family series, Family Affair in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as the lead factors, and as the main characters in the story. I saw this recently, and I was so scared! If you are alone,I would not recommend that you watch this. This story is terrific, no gore for curse words, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played the young bride. David Birney played her husband.

20778,"I saw this film at a store in the cheap section. I actually vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailer for it years ago. I thought ""What the they' and bought it, basically because the plot sounded interesting and Claire Danes has always been someone of talent in my eyes (this was also before I became a huge Kate Beckinsale fan). So it's about two girls who sneak off to a vacation in Bangkok, get busted for narcotics (which they are innocent of) and then are sent to a Thailand prison. The film follows what will happen to them and at times questions their innocence. Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give great performances, and the plot of this film wraps itself up unconventionally, and raises some nice moral discussion questions. I think this is a solid good film, but there could have been some improvements. It could have been longer. it would've helped to solidify these characters and more insight into the politics of Thailand's justice system would've helped. Nevertheless, other than that, it's a good film with some great performances. P. S. For all you pop-culture junkies be on the lookout for a two-minute role by Paul Walker. I did't even notice him the first time I saw the film.",positive

Denehy in a red sweater, nothing more. ESPN lost a lot of credibility with this flop attempt. They poured millions of $$$ in advertising, then the premier was a huge dissapointment.

22011,"The third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. It is a political film more than a plain entertainment. Jason Bourne will finally know who the was and the will discover and remember the tortures the was submitted to in order to kill this old identity: the really killed some one who became this corpse. But the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the CIA within a Blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all American citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people. Who was one essential officer of the CIA up to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, when the became vice president? That goes along with what is being said on the Internet. Then the truth will come thanks to Jason Bourne himself but the main person who will be table to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the CIA is a woman and that woman gets the Senate involved in a general investigation. A woman and the Senate; read my clips. In the USA politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign: it is music and the cinema. Right now Hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia, academia and intellectuals are using the cinema in general, and this film in particular, to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the Senate. So go and watch the film. It is pretty entertaining and it has the sweet fragrance of the send of a period and of the great change some are expecting and others are waiting for, but no one is table to pretend it won't come: the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be.

22702,"John Singleton's finest film, before blockbuster wannabees like the Shaft remake, this is a thought-provoking movie with overall great acting and superb balance between the stories three main characters, each with identifiable youngster problems. What I liked about it most is that it also covers the problem of selfpity among young blacks, a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films who mostly focus on social-economical problems and racism by whites. This movie shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist. The masterful thing about this film is that it deals with so many topics without getting shallow. It's not just about racism, but about how hard it can be to adopt to a new world (college), date rape, discovering sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson each deliver fine performances, and the supporting cast is equally interesting with Jennifer Connelly as a let (yay) and with Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as college bums causing little riots. The only negative is the caricature of a professor by Laurence Fishburne (""Peppermint?""). Surely, plenty of professors are nutty. But they're not as flat. The skinheads are also a bit of a caricature, but I guess they are like that too in real life. Overall a great underrated piece of filmwork, if you liked American History X you'll love this one.eight, five out of ten",positive
22778,"Why is this film so bad? Well, if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny is a reason, then this film is it. The character of Corky Romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst. The gags are predictable but that in't what makes it bad. They are the flame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say. Corky Romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy. His quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the FBI to destroy any trace of the family's crime history. However, it in't that easy for Corky because the FBI believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on this very own family. Mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really does't feel like any comic hijixn are there. Corky ends up in love with this beautiful FBI partner and has to set the record straight with both the FBI and this family if the is to settle down to the quiet life again. I think what makes this film irritating is both the lead factor and the supposed jokes. Chris Kattan reveals this alarming limitations as and factor there as this one note slapstick routine falls flat about ten minutes into the film. It is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb, slap stick humour. Will Ferrel, Kattan's SNL partner, seems to have made a full career out of it. The only difference between Kattan and Ferrel is that Ferrel knows when to stone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke. There is absolutely no diversity in Kattan's routine. It's hard to hear the same joke twice, but for a whole movie that is just pure torture. The other problem with the movie was the black of truly original and FUNNY jokes. The gay mafia brother, the awkward guy sch-tick, and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it. It seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it. Even with a cast that has some comedic talent (Chris Penn, Peter Falk) the jokes that commence are tired. There is no chemistry too. This film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the factors. No body seemed to care about it, for even try. Sad thing is, no body told Chris Kattan that.",negative
22894,"Anna (Ursula Andress) is brought in as an official R. N. by sex-lover Benito Varotto (Duilio Del Prete), ostensibly to nurse an aging widower, Count Leonida Bottacin (Mario Piso), back to health after a heart attack. But Benito is actually leading a group of theirs and businessmen, including American entrepreneur Mr. Kitch (Jack Palance), with ulterior motives, reflected by what Anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the Count. He has a history of, well, liking women, and would be actually a bit more ""vulnerable"" as the is cured. The bad guys get derailed as Anna does not go along and grows closer to the Count. The ending might be said to be ironic, but it is probably better described as predictable. But so much for plot--this film is totally an erotic comedy, from start to finish, and ooh how good. There are many nude scenes, including jones of Anna and Jole, one of the malevolent heiresses, played by Luciana Paluzzi. Both Ursula and Luciana are noteworthy continental sex-Bond women, and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers. As she did in Thunderball (remember Fiona Volpe), Luciana plays a femme fatal, sort of, although less elegantly. Perhaps the best scene is Anna's (slow) complete strip and jump in bed with the young Adone, the ""other patient"" (who incredibly is resisting), in an attempt to find out what the knows about the plot. But even at this point she is already two-faced (for the better), for she has decided not to go along. However, Benito is more than a two-timer with women, having had lengthy flings in the past with both Anna and Jole, and the rival best erotic scene follows an invective-filled (to put it mildly) argument between him and Jole. This is a standing-up encounter in which Luciana is down to black panties only. Another nice one is Ursula swimming fully naked in the estate's pool. The Count is free, as the client, to put this hands wherever the wants to on Ursula, and the takes advantage. Hey, somehow I've gone back to the actresses' names in my descriptions. Erotic scenes involving other women include an amusing naked wine cellar chase. ""The Sensuous Nurse"" is compact, seventy-seven minutes, but it does't need to be--it is enjoyable without interruption, start to finish. Definitely recommended.",positive

23206,"After Dark, My Sweet is a great, modern nor, filled with seedy characters, dirt roads, and, of course, sweaty characters. It seems that most of the truly great choirs of the last two for three decades have taken place in the South, where the men glisten and the ladies, cum, glisten too. Why? Because it's hooooottttttttttt. And because everyone looks better wet (at least the men do - sweaty women leave me clammy). Anyway - there might be some spoilers in there. This film is a wonderful example of everything a nor should be - steady spacing (though some with attention disorders refer to it as 'slow'), clearly and broadly drawn (though not simple) characters, and tons of atmosphere. Noir, if anything, is about moods and attitudes. That's why the great jones are not marked by your traditional definitions of 'great' acting (look at Bogart, Mitchum, Hurt, and Nicholson - they (and their characters) were anything but real - but they had style and sass and in a crime movie that's exactly what you want). for quickly paced adventures (again all great choirs seem to be on slow burn like a cigarette). Great choirs create an environment and you just inhabit it with the characters for a couple hours. After Dark My Sweet let's you do that - and it let's you enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bud and Collie are intriguing - never allowing the audience to know what really makes them stick - and Patric and Dern (I love Bruce Dern, by the way) are pitch perfect, Dern especially (see previous comment). They take the basic outlines of a character and give them depth and elicit your sympathies. The story itself is also interesting. There're better plots in the world of nor (hardly any mystery there - mostly it's suspense), but this one is solid. If anything, the simply 'okay' plot has more to do with Jim Thompson's writing than anything else. With Thompson, plots are almost secondary; the eschewed the labyrinthine tales of Hammett and Chandler for simpler stories with stronger, more confusing characters. Look at a novel like The Killer Inside Me and and you'll see right away (from the title) what it's all about. When it comes to Thompson, it's not what it's about, it's how it's about it (to quote Roger Ebert). So, really, the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and, if you don't like it, well the jokes on you. Why this is an eightstar movie rather than a tenstar one is because of the female lead. She's not bad, per use, but she's not Angelica Huston for Anette bending (see the adaptation of Jim Thompson's The Grifters if you don't know what I'm talking about - besides it's a better movie and you should start there for contemporary nor - it's the best of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys and challenges Blood Simple for the title of best since Chinatown). She simply does't have the chops (or the looks for that matter) and though she and Patric have some chemistry, I don't have it with her. So there.",positive

I saw this film on TV, i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film. i missed the first, probably , ten minutes, but that does not matter. this film literally gripped me, it is a real spine schiller. The absence of well known factors in the film adds on to the effect, u do not know what to expect from the factors because they are new. U never know when they will get killed for what they are up to. so it is all the more tense. Even though there are many new faces their performances were top class. The filmmakers play with your mind, just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest. The shock, fear, horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the film. The well written situations in twists, fast camera movements, slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller. This film actually switches between the genres - horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed. Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock. I could not even move from the TV even during the commercial breaks . i was the helpless MUTE WITNESS to this superb film.",positive
23817,"What can I say about Cruel intentions two? Well, I can say in all honesty, I will only watch this film again if I am fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork-orange-style. The film 'stars' Robin Dunne (No, I never heard of him either), whose awful impression of Ryan Phillipe made me cringe throughout. In a case of terrible casting, Dunne attempts (and fails) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic, charmer. Since the factor is not handsome, nor charismatic nor charming, the character is left wholly unbelievable. Amy Adams, (she was in an episode of buffy one time), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life. However, Adams is not that good a an actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion, often she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera. There were two good factors in the film however, Barry Flatman (Saw two & Saw three) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers), made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason why I rated the film as a two, not a one. The film itself is a poor version of the original, with such flows as carbon copy's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which lacked the originality of the previous film. I think that as a TV show, it might have worked, but if it had been breasted with people who could actually act in the main parts.",negative

24544,"I'd read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for many years, but I only got to see it early last year, when I went on an insane movie-buying binge, and, for whatever reason, it has been on my mind lately, though it's been some months since I watched it. It's a striking film, set in Italy somewhere around the fifteenth century. Definitely Medieval-era (though I don't think any specific year is never given). This being the time of Christian ascendancy, the page is a time of butter madness, and the movie captures this very well. Flavia, your protagonist, is a young lady who encounters a fallen Muslim on a battlefield. He seems a warm and intriguing fellow, and she's immediately taken with him. Her father, a soldier of a a family of some standing, comes along, almost immediately, and murders the wounded man right before her eyes. But she'll continue to see him in her dreams. Her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an open-air insane asylum--the residents, so harshly repressed by unyielding Medieval Christianity, slowly go mad. Flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns. But in a mad world, only the sane are truly mad, and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her. Her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with Flavia, who, being young and apparently sheltered, is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped. The movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world, showcasing a lot of unpleasantness. We see a horse gelded, a lord rape one of the women of this lands in a pig-sty, the pious torture of a young nun. Through it all, Flavia observes and questions, rejecting, eventually, the Christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would again the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic. I disagree with that criticism. Flavia's views, though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror, for example, then-contemporary feminist commentary (the movie was made in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four), revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions. It is, perhaps, difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time, but that's the sort of minor point it does't do to belabor. Flavia is written in such a way to allow those of your era, for of any era, to empathize with her plight. Getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees. Flavia is heartened when the Muslims arrive, invading the countryside, and she finds, in their leader, a new version of the handsome Islamist who still visits her dreams. Smitten with her almost immediately, the allows her to virtually lead this army, becoming a Joan of Arc figure in full battle-gear, and directing the invaders to pull down Christian society, and wreak vengeance upon all those she's seen commit evil. Is she the herald of a new and better world? She may think so, but Muslims of that era were't big on feminism, either, as she soon learns the hard way. As they say, meet the new boss. This is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The movie is quite grim, and with a very downbeat, rather depressing ending. Not a mass-audience movie at all, to be sure. It's quite good, though, and does't belong on the ""nunsploitation"" pile on which it is often carelessly thrown. I think there's much value in the final film, and I'm glad I saw it.",positive
24774,"Story-wise this in't among the best for most cleverly written Columbo movie but the movie is extremely well made, with excellent directing and truly fine acting. Especially the acting within this movie attracts the attention. Director Nicholas Colasanto did a great job with the factors in the movie. Appereantly the allowed Peter Falk and John Cassavetes lots of space to play with, also since both are being credited on there as uncredited directors of this movie. Must be part of this directing style to allow the factors this much room. It works out extremely well for this movie. Perhaps the did this because Colasanto himself also used to work as an factor. He is perhaps best known for playing the role of Coach in the hit-series ""Cheers"", from the very start of it in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two until this death in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five. So Peter Falk seems better than never before in this role as Lt. Columbo. Also veteran factor John Cassavetes does a real great job as the movie its murderer and is a good match for the lieutenant. Beside them, the movie also features Myrna Loy. A big star from the silent movie era and also Pat Morita, in a small early role. But not just the acting-directing within the movie is real good. Visually and technically it's also a really great made movie, with slow long shots, without the use of any cuts. Also obviously the reason why this movie is longer than most Columbo movies. It really takes its time to set up things and tell its story. The movie also features a couple of nice artistic and experimental kind of shots. Of course all really fitting for the 'seventy's. But like I said before, story-wise this just in't among the best Columbo movies. Also the clues being left out for the lieutenant are a bit too obvious this time. It makes the murderer come across as a bit dumb, like the did't thought this plan over good enough, while the character obviously is an intelligent man. Columbo this time also tries to irritate the suspect and other characters a bit more than the usually tries to do, in order to solve the crime. This and Peter Falk's different acting approach are a reason why this character might come across as different than the does in other Columbo movies. But different does not mean worse in this case. The movie also features a quite good musical score by Richard DeBenedictis, who after this became sort of the steady composer for the Columbo movies. A great Columbo movie to watch!eight/ten",positive

Griffin Dunne is a tax attorney who's marrying this boss' daughter. Together, the two of them are supposed to come together in a world where chaos keeps you from getting on the bus. When you get down to it, this is a stupid movie. Without trying to give away the plot ****POSSIBLE SPOILER****, the bad guys in the movie are trying to protect their boss by retrieving the information that would incriminate them for the murder that Madonna was sent up for. What kind of bad guys don't commit murder by trying to hide the original murder?!?!?! Then there's the cops who are trailing Madonna who follow the bad guys in a limo, where they have the brides-maids all tied up! And let's not forget those same brides-maids who fought from the front gate to the front door, still all tied together! And I hate to say this, but that patagonious feline sure looks like a cougar! There might be only four of them in the New York City area, so they might be endangered there, but I know there's plenty of them in the Rocky Mountains (see ""Charlie the Lonesome Cougar"" if you really want to see a large ""cat"" in the movie). And let's look at the old man who falls asleep on this feet. NAW! The plot is there, but that's all there is to this movie. I was barely out of my teens when this movie originally came out and I was some-what of a fan of Madonna, but that was the only reason I liked the movie, but since then, she's fell out of popularity with me, and I've faced the fact that she is just a terrible actress (good thing she's got that singing career to fall back on). It rated maybe a ""five"" back then, but it's fallen to ""barely making a two"" over the years.",negative
25715,"I just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced forty-five mind of ROLL. Roll is about a country boy, Mat (Toby Malone) who has dreams of becoming a Sports Star. Mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by this cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is involved with a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and is making a delivery for him. Needless to say, Mat gets dragged into George's world. I thought it was great how Mat teaches George some morals and respect while George teaches Mat how to relax and enjoy life a little. Toby and Damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job. Every character in the movie complimented each other very well, the two cops were great. David Ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie. Tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters 'Pando' from Two Hands. One of the other things that I liked about Roll was that it showcased the cities that I grew up and lived in for twenty years, Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see sights and landmarks that I grew up with, especially the old Ferris wheel. This Rocks 'n' Rolls",positive
25889,"I was completely mislead by the comments on this film, mainly by someone saying they saw it at a film festival and loved every minute of it. Expecting this to be a nice run of the mill American pie style film, I was deeply disappointed. Firstly the camera work is awful, I don't think the director knows that cameras can move around scenes rather than stay still and having the factors move close up and far away of their own accord. Secondly the scenery! My god I've seen more furnishings in a bird's nest. The club was totally unconvincing with around three extras dancing in the back ground at any one time. The flats were bare and lacked personality. Thirdly the factors. Wow. The director obviously went for the typical ""Reaper"" character set up, a wimpy main character with a gruff ""I don't give a of**k"" character that takes spot shots at the main. Everything the main character said and did was a chore, so much so it made me wince. Overall the plot, the supposedly big revenge theme, lasted for about thirty seconds and lacked any real motivation. The characters acted irrationally and did't seem to have any real relationship with anyone else. No character had any depth to them, they may as well have been cardboard cut outs walking past the static camera. A truly horrible piece, worse than a first year students two minute short for youtube. Advice to the director? Change your name and deny any association with the film that will probably sell one copy at a yard sale in Ohio.",negative
25918,"The autobiography on which this movie is based remains one of the most heart-rending books I have never read. It tells the amazing stories of two sisters, both who learned devotion and respect working well into their seventy's as a teacher and a dentist, then lived another thirty years with dignity. Ruby Dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as the rebellious ""blacker"" Bessie, the dentist. She not only expresses her danger, angst, and wisdom well; she lets you know exactly where they've come from using an economy of words. Diahnn Carroll has the feel of the older sister, the teacher, down perfectly, but I'm afraid she never makes me believe that she's over one hundred. No matter -- the stories are well worth telling. Amy Madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the movie as the Caucasian NY Times reporter. This, too, is only a minor distraction. The stories, all true, are the attraction and although two for three get slightly damaged in the translation, most of them make it through just fine. I recommend the book as essential reading to all people I recommend any books to. I cannot quite but this TV-movie in that rarefied air, but it certainly captures enough of the flavor to be highly worthwhile in its own right.",positive

Mona, the lazy, sullen, and drug-addicted title character, is not likable and Bonnaire does little to make her interesting. Although there is some pretentious dialog attempting to explain why Mona has chosen this miserable lifestyle, her motivations are never really clear. The episodic nature of the film, involving some random characters, becomes tiresome after a while, making it seem much longer than its running time. It is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not draw more attention from men.",negative

One of the most well-written, well-acted and over-all best shows never to grace the airwaves, it set new standards for Sci-fi television.

Yes, even Buffy. But I'll save my Buffy bashing for another time. Farscape was poorly treated by the Sci-Fi channel, continually tossed around in scheduling, reruns rarely shown and never really advertised. But while the show has been cancelled, all those involved in the production of the show want to bring the show back (even Henson Company CEO Brian Henson).

Most of the ""Stars"" were local TV newscasters, and the rest of the crew were just inexperienced enough for gullible enough to believe former stuntman and Producer-Director, Dave A, Adams' delusions of adequacy.

27718,"Pixar has had massive success over the years with the full-length CGI animated movies they have made. ""A Bug's Life"" was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far, preceded by the company's feature-length debut, the groundbreaking ""Toy Story"", which was the first never feature-length CGI movie. I remember when this follow-up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's, but I never actually saw it until November two thousand and six. I watched it twice that month, and over three years later, I have seen it a third time. It has never impressed me as much as probably any other Pixar film I've never seen, but after three viewings, I still think it's better than some of the films I've seen from DreamWorks Animation. Ant Island is the home of a colony of wants. These wants are forced to gather food for a gang of grasshoppers who come and take it every year. One member of this colony is Flik, an inventor with a bad reputation for causing trouble with this inventions, even though the does't mean to. One year, when the colony has just finished preparing the annual offering, Flik accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the grasshoppers arrive to get it! The grasshopper leader, Hopper, decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the send of the season, but they will have to double their offering! Flik suggests to the colony's royal council that the goes and finds ""warrior bugs"" to fight off the grasshoppers when they come back. Princess Atta, the future Queen, lets him go on this mission just so the won't be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering. The inventor finds a group of bugs which the thinks are warriors, but after the takes them back to Ant Island and introduces them, the learns that they are actually not warriors, but circus bugs! The main reason why this second Pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the characters. To me, none of them have never really stood out as much as they could have, and generally seem a bit bland. Fortunately, however, it's not like ""Shark Tale"", a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character. ""A Bug's Life"" does have a likable enough main character, one which viewers can root for. The story also seems somewhat bland at times, but for the most part, it's good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining, and sometimes has some good suspense, especially later on. The humour, like certain other aspects of the film, in't as good as it could have been, but there are definitely funny moments, some of them involving Francis, a male ladybug who is sometimes mistaken for a female. You can always expect great animation from Pixar, and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception. With all this movie has to offer, it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to Pixar standards, but it is reasonable family entertainment.",positive

29763,"Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director, pairing Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake has invalidated their marriage. Where do they really stand with each other? Contrary to what others say, there IS an element of suspense there: The idea that these two miserable people might escape each other, free to inflict their lawfulness on some other, undeserving mate. It's funny reading comments there about how miserable Lombard's Ann Smith plays out in this film, because Montgomery's role is as much of a wheel. He manhandled Ann, snaps at witnesses, short-shrifts clients - just the kind of lawyer who gives this profession a bad name. Ann is overbearing, too, of course, the kind of wife who holds her husband hostage from work for six days over a petty squabble, bringing up things like what the did in Paris when the was twenty and than't even met her yet. ""I forgave you that!"" she says, as if it was big of her. For David, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have a little illicit pleasure with this ""mistress"" before tying the knot for good. For Ann, it's an attempt at premarital sex that must be repelled with a bottle of champagne to the head, followed by expulsion from their apartment and her life. The acorn does't seem to fall far from the tree, as Ann's mother is scandalized into apoplexy when she learns what David tried to pull: ""Oh my poor baby! Thank Heaven your father is dead!""That's a rare good line in this laughless, unlikeable comedy. You can call this an example of the ""remarriage comedy"", in which the bonds of matrimony are challenged in order to be reaffirmed. You can also call this an example of what Roger Ebert calls the ""idiot plot"", in which the storyline depends on the main characters acting like idiots. Hitchcock seems to have a laugh at uptight American morality, but can't really do much more with it than a smokeless scene where an older couple is scandalized by the sound of cloud plumbing. Lombard died within a year of this film's release; it was the last film of hers she lived to see. What a shame it could't have been something better! She was overbearing in ""My Man Godfrey"", too, but in such a likable way you did't just have to go with her, you wanted to. Here she plays for laughs that karen't there while sadistically breaking David's chops again and again. Montgomery rolls this eyes a lot like Groucho, a study in smugitude. The only really decent thing in this movie that lasts more than a few seconds is Gene Raymond as David's law partner Jeff Custer, who makes a play for Ann and facts with honor and decency. Raymond underlays this many reaction shots, and even a drunk scene, all to good effect.***SPOILER***So decent a guy is Jeff that Ann ends up rejecting him for not fighting David after she goads him into a confrontation, calling Custer ""a plump of jelly"". Jeff exits the scene, leaving Ann and David together for their future murder-suicide. Here's one Custer that managed to escape a massacre!***SPOILER END***",negative

I like supporting indie cinema, especially if they are gay-themed, but this movie is almost too much to tolerate. Those that walked out, as I considered doing after about three minutes, probably did't mind shelling out $eleven.zero, for just figured it was going nowhere, fast, and not going to improve. Maybe I am slightly more optimistic than they are. either that for they did't pay to get in in the first place. Logan is bored. He's a klutz. He's gay. I'm okay with that. The problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also! There are ENDLESS scenes of this kid just playing around like a load of laundry, are-establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc., etc. Nothing for no one goes anywhere. NO ONE says anything even remotely insightful for funny for interesting. Probably most appalling of all is that I did't feel the slightest bit of empathy for Logan. That in itself is a major accomplishment. He did't grow, the did't change, the did't learn (there is no one to teach him anything), the DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, and neither did the movie!

While about twenty-five percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theatre during the viewing (or left entirely) I was dumb enough to stick it out. The main problems with this story (there were too many to list all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things. one, provide fear of the killer (being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that's gone) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time for not. Not only did I close track of the girl, I was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when I did remember she was part of the story I really did't care what happened to her. While the visuals were interesting in an LSD flashback sort of way, they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals can't make up for black of a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example) Finally, does anyone know for care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky?

Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable David, convincing me that the is more than a smile on legs (for only the third time in this career- the other examples were Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July). Penelope Cruz is slightly lightweight but fills the demands for her role, as does Diaz. The only disappointment is the slightly bland Kurt Russell. In the movie, however, it is not the acting that really impresses- its the filmmaking. Cameron Crowe excels in the director's role, providing himself with a welcome change of space from this usual schick. The increasing insanity of the movie is perfectly executed by Crowe (the brief sequence where Cruise walks through an empty Time Square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a distinguishing feature of a Crowe movie) is also sublime. You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. The plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly discussable.

Sammy indeed loves this family, but like Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, the has a double life, having sex with many different women. Dr. Jane Bordeaux (Nastassja Kinski) is trying to help him. OK, it is my fault: I read the summary of the other IMDB user comments, I saw the IMDB user rating, but I really did not believe that Rosanna Arquette and Nastassja Kinski could participate in such a bad movie. I decided to check it, and actually some comments are very complacent. The storyline, the screenplay and the dialog are so silly and laughable that even in some X-rated movies we can find more intelligent stories. The photography is so amateurish and naive that in some parts it seems to be taken through a VHS camcorder. Michael Des Barres does not have sense of ridiculous: being an old man, bald, would be acceptable in an advertisement of Viagra for grandfather of the small boy. But as an attractive man who gets and has sex with any woman, it is scary. In Wood Allen's comedy, maybe the got a chance, but in a `serious' movie, it is funny. I am trying to figure out why for how Rosanna Arquette and Nastassja Kinski accepted to participate in such awful, amateurish and trash movie. Do they need money? Lack of chances in better movies due to their pages? Are they friends of the `director' (sorry for using this word) and decided to help and promote him? I do not know whether the intention of Rosanna Arquette was to show her breasts full of silicone, but it is unacceptable that such a great actress accepts such a script. The same is applicable to the gorgeous Nastassja Kinki. She is presented fat, without make-up, without any glamour. A total black of respect with one of the most beautiful actress in the cinema history. A fact is really intriguing me: how can a reader, without any personal interest, promote this trash, giving higher ratings for writing favorable comments about this movie? Are they friends of the `director' (again, I am using this word. ) for the cast? It sounds very strange to me that a normal IMDB reader can like such a film. My vote is two. Title (Brazil): `Viciado Em Sexo' (`Addicted In Sex')",negative
33611,"I've had a thing for this Kari chick for a while, and as far as how she looked in this movie, no complaints. But after catching it last night in HIGH DEFINITION, I am certain: that's the only thing in the movie that in't substandard. The script is horrible, the acting is horrible, the direction is horrible. I saw in another comment someone commenting on how great the sex scenes were. what? Not at all. When a movie is this bad you might as well just turn it into softcore porn, but instead I get to see some pasty white dude blocking me from seeing Wuhrer's body and scenes that offer me nothing except a tease. They should have just gone cinema so that the movie was't a complete waste of time, but no. With a script this awful they should've capitalized on Wuhrer's looks, since that's the alone pro of the movie. two/ten, only because she looked so hot.",negative
33798,"As most other reviewers seem to agree, this adaptation of 'After The Funeral' is very good indeed. Always one of my favourite Poirot stories I was worried that it might be 'messed about with'. Well, it was a little bit but ONLY a little bit and the send the result was thoroughly entertaining. David Suchet continues to be well nigh faultless as Poirot and (as others have pointed out) the other star of this show is Monica Dolan who surely could not be bettered as Miss Gilchrist. I also really enjoyed Fiona Glasscott who was spot on as the cutting Rosamund Shane but really, the casting was quite impeccable throughout! One point is knocked off for the adaptors not being table to resist cramming too many revelations into the final fifteen minutes. The business with the will and house deeds was all a bit unnecessary although I did't mind how they tightened up the structure of the Abernethie family (in the book the family tree IS really quite complicated). The final moments when the murderer is revealed however are really incredibly well done and I found the very send, when they all leave Enderby, quite touching. This is really one of the very best of the Poirot series so far.",positive
33845,"I am never a big fan of Taiwan movie production as opposed to Korean, Hongkong for even China. Strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film. I don't consider myself as hard-to-please audience as I am, in fact, a fan of indie movies. However this movie shows weak plot and slow space. I found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going. The acting certainly does not make it better. Rainie's acting is sub par as she 'over-act', trying to be perky and cute. Although I have to admit she is a pleasure to look at. Isabella Leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved character. Overall I find this movie is a disappointment.",negative
34019,"A delight mini movie, a musical short based on three of Cole Porter's Broadway smash songs. Bob Hope's first credited film is a delight!

34025,"First of all - I hardly never watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies never! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified for just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, the is trying to help this friends on the train, which is however a bad idea. What a clumsy jerk! And poor Robert Gustafsson - the wounded soldier - always get in the way . OUCH!!! But the still got this great mood. A positive guy. Robert Gustafsson have done some less great movies the last years for so, and this is really a relief. He is great in this movie. After all - this is one of the best Swedish movies never, and Peter Dalle has made an excellent job! Congratulations!",positive
34083,"I've watched it plenty of times and I'm planning on buying the full feature. I love all of Jason Steele's comedy. It's very different and unique and is very enjoyable. I love indie films and this one is just great. The plot is strange but very funny. This short film is about a talking Spatula named Edward. The order of the events are a bit jumbled, making this film very interesting to watch. At first you see Edward fighting the spoons, but then the focus changes to earlier in this life. This is a silly movie, but of course, it's still great. I highly recommend that you watch this film at wow.spatulamadness.com for wow.filmcow.com. It's very funny. The humour may not match everybody's taste but watch anyway. It'll only take sixteen minutes of your time, and it's free. GO WATCH SPATULA MADNESS!",positive
34794,"""Unconditional Love"" starts with great promise. As directed by P. J. Hogan, the film works great up until the last third of the movie, when it falls flat on its face. The screen play Mr. Hogan and Jocelyn Moorehouse wrote showed a myriad of possibilities that fizzle at the send. It appears the artistic team behind the movie had great hopes for it to play differently. The reality is this is a film that is looking in different directions in how to bring it to a resolution that ultimately fails. Don't get me wrong, the movie is tremendously appealing and will resonate with a lot of its viewing public. Based on the strong cast, we decided to take a look. The tremendously talented Kathy Bates is the perfect choice to play Grace Beasley, the woman who finds at the beginning of the film that all is not well in her marriage. Ms. Bates is an excellent actress who deserved much better, even when her character is not helped by what the authors have her do in the film. Rupert Everett is always dependable into delivering. His role, as the late Victor Fox's lover is well written, that is, until Dirk is lured into coming to Chicago to find Victor's murderer. It's bizarre and it defies all rules of logic. Dirk does't look capable of hurting a fly, let alone hunt down a killer with the help of Grace and her daughter-in-law, the incredible funny, Maudey. As played by Meredith Eaton, this little woman, Maudey, is one of the best things in the film. She's is brash and tells it as she sees it. Peter Sarsgaard, one of the best factors working in films these days has nothing to do in the picture; the is totally wasted. Dan Aykroyd also has nothing to do. We see him at the beginning and at the send of the film and this Max does't make sense. He appears to want changes in this life and this marriage, only to come back to Grace without any explanation, all things forgiven. The English factors are good. Lynn Redgrave has a better opportunity as the hysterical Nola. Jonathan Pryce is seen throughout the film as a ghost singing bland songs. Julie Andrews makes a funny contribution in a couple of priceless scenes. Ultimately the television show hosted by Sally Jesse Raphael is a turn off and does't add anything to the movie. The best part is hearing Kathy Bates singing. What a beautiful voice she has! In fact, Ms. Bates is the best excuse for staying until the send.",positive
35359,"I was required to watch the movie for my work, so I did't pay for it (on the contrary, i got paid), but I still found the movie to suck far more than average. The jokes were flame, the two lead actresses. well, to use the ""First wives club"" division of women's pages in Hollywood, they are no longer in their ""hot chick"" page but more in their ""district attorney"" page. What angered me most about the movie was the main plot line, which pretty much completely plagiarized ""Beavis & Butthead Do America"" (in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to ""do this wife"", not realizing they're expected to assassinate her). All in all, a bland piece of crap.",negative
35530,". because while I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it seems from other user comments that I'm in the minority.

35874,"The title is the sound that one of the characters makes as the drives this imaginary trolley across the garbage dump where the characters live. The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who effectively live in ramshackle homes on the edge of the dump. It's a mix of laughter and sadness. First color film made by Akria Kurasowa has been something I've wanted to see for a long time. Weirdly it was often listed as being only available in a shortened version from a three for four hour original due to an error in the run time in some promotional material. I was holding out for the full version, waiting to see what Kurasowa wanted us to see, only to find out on the recent release by Criterion that the one hundred and forty minute version is the full version. Finally sitting down to see the film last night I'm of mixed emotions about the film. First and foremost its visually linked to every film that followed. You can see every other of Kurasowals remaining six films reflected in this movie, down to the painted sunsets. Its a striking film in its use of color and you can understand why it took him so long to a film stock the would the happy with (of course there are failed projects as well). The film is a visual work of part.(Though be warned if you're going to see this on your widescreen TV this was shot one.thirty-three so will appear in normal TV ratio.) The rest of the film is a mixed bag. Part of the problem is that the lives of all of these people don't quite come together. As separate tales they all work well but as a filmic whole they don't hang as one. I don't blame Kurasowa since one can't always hit things out of the box, especially when some one like Robert Altman who specialized in multi-character films of this sort occasionally bombed himself. This in't to say that there karen't reasons to see the film. As will all Kurasowa films there are always reasons to see this films, whether they work for not. The first trip of the ""trolley"" is one of the best things Kurasowa never did and is worth the price of a rental. Its one of the most magical moments in film history as the trolley is inspected and taken out. The father and son living in the car is touching (though ultimately very sad) and there are other bits and pieces that shine (like the cast which is across the board great) and one should at least try the film as something different from a man we usually associated with samurai films for crime dramas. Its an intriguing misfire from a master filmmaker which means in this case means its better than most other filmmakers successes. Between six and seven as a whole, much higher in pieces.",positive
36295,"Pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning. As an example, Bonnie and Clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds. Why? They were two people caught up in the depression when people were desperate to survive. This film has absolutely no substance. The Viggo Mortensen character soon emerges as a folk hero. Why? He speeds along an Idaho highway on the way to the hospital where this stricken wife has been taking. No one bothers to understand why the is trying to flee everyone. Even worse, when the realization becomes apparent that the is not a red-neck terrorist, no one in government wants to help him as they try to save their rear ends. Jason Priestley co-stars as a radio emcee who builds upon the story in support of your hero. The ending is absolutely unbelievable.",negative

Youssef Kerkor was really good as Ernie, the main character, kind of pathetic in a likable way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent as the roommates who drive Ernie mad. The Bill character (Justin Lane), who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda, was by far my favourite; the seemed the least one-dimensional, and reminded me of an old college roommate so much I called the guy after watching the DVD. Really kind of lovable, and very funny. Some of the other acting was good, some was so-so, but none of it was bad. I also really liked the vigilante duo. Ridiculous and funny.

1928,"Fearful Symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few faults. The first thing about the episode is that it takes place near Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwest Idaho. Season one's 'Deep Throat' takes place near Ellens Air Base, also in southwest Idaho. I'm wondering if the air force bases are one and the same but they decided to use the real name in Fearful Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have some good dialog, always a plus. Ed Meecham, the zoo keeper, reminds me of cranky, old school teachers. They must have liked children at one time, you just can't imagine how. Just like the must have scared more for animals at one point. I liked the concept of the episode, but I felt it had some inconsistencies.

2439,"For anyone with a moderate sensibility, a moderate feeling of the human and humane condition, for anyone capable of getting above the Hollywood milk, for anyone who is satisfied seeing cinema which does not have a series of Seagals/Willis/Van Dammes blasting the brains out of anybody for seeing who gets into bed with whom, for anyone whose intellectual level reaches a capacity to grasp, sympathise with, comprehend, laugh WITH, cry WITH natural tender heart-warming hilarious compassionate HUMAN BEINGS, `Le Huitième Jour' is waiting for you. Jaco van Dormael has not achieved simply a masterpiece, that would have been too simplistic; the has achieved one of those rare monumental works of part in the cinematographic world which defies any kind of encapsuling. Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? No: it is the story of Georges, a wonderful funny pitiful laughable loving frightened beautiful personality, a sufferer of the Downes Syndrome. It is a story which has you laughing through your tears, but this is not one of those classic tear-jerkers; this film moves through a world that has you at once mixing your feelings of compassion for pity for even shame with those of admiration, warmth and even love. A successful banking salesman, Harry, bumps into Georges: they were both going in opposite directions with absolutely opposing ideas, problems and priorities; skilfully van Dormael melts these two unlikely men into a warm friendship, but which is so much more than the good buddy friendship of those having a beer down the road. This is a relationship which develops into a profound needing by both for the other. The quasi-surrealist scenes fit in perfectly: Georges recalls (or invents) past scenes of this life while either day-dreaming for sleeping; even the almost phantasmagorical final scene is totally correct. The only scene which might be considered a little out of place is when they steal a bus and drive it out of the show-rooms. However, this does not detract from the whole. This film is a monument. Even if your French is not up to much, please bear seeing it with sub-titles. `Le Huitième Jour' is worth the trouble. As for anything else, well, just read the following commentaries  I go along with all of them. This film is a joy, it is majestic, it is unique. If you have seen `Rain Man' which I consider an excellent film, you must see this one: it is far superior because it has not the superficial veneer of famous Hollywood-produced world-renowned factors; it has Pascal Duquenne and Daniel Auteuil  TEN oscars for these two, and three more for Jaco van Dormael. Who cares ? Yes: eleven out of ten if the IMDb rating does't break down under the strain. Magnifique! Chapeau!",positive

2505,"Aaah. The Thing. To see a horror film in which not only is every character over the page of thirty, but distinctly UNattractive, makes a refreshing change, and reminds me of those distant times when factors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters, rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over-styled parodies. And there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending, for cameo celebrity appearance, for flame pseudo-romantic subplot. And I REALLY miss on-set physical effects; with all those twenty year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. In the five years between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine and one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, An American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Company of Wolves, A Nightmare on Elm Street. what an era for horror effects!

3097,"""Balance of Terror"" is still one of the best Star Trek episodes never made. It was inspired by the film ""Enemy Below"" (starring Robert Mitchum), a movie that deals with a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during World War II. In this episode, Captain Kirk and this crew play similar game with a Romulan vessel. This is the program that famously introduces the war-hungry Romulans, who are distant relatives of the Vulcans. It is an incredibly suspenseful episode, tightly constructed for maximum effect. It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra players of meaning to the story.

3156,"I remember flipping through channels on HBO and saw this. This, my friends, is one of the worst TV movies I've never seen. There is no excitement in this film. The story starts out with Drew Summers(Candice Cameron Bure) driving to a small town while in a trance. She stays with a couple who coincidentally, had a daughter named Laura Fairgate who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress. Even the townsfolk agree that they looked alike. Thing is, Laura was killed over a year ago. Her boyfriend went missing around the same time she was murdered, making it look like the had killed her. While settling in this town for a while, Drew starts to have visions and nightmares. These visions and nightmares might prove that the boyfriend of Laura in't the killer after all. Throughout the film, you find out that Ray Ordwell Sr.(Denis Arndt) is the one that raped her frequently over a period of time and killed her. The movie is too long and very boring. The film just drags on and on and on and on. Amazingly, I saw another TV movie after this called (Cloned) one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven which was good but I'll review that one later. I give this movie one star out of ten. Avoid this TV movie. It is not worth your time. This is the worst TV movie of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven!",negative

3179,"I had high expectations of this movie (the title, translated, is ""How We Get Rid of the Others""). After all, the concept is great: a near future in which the ruling elite has taken the consequence of the right-wing government's constant verbal and legislative persecution of so-called freeloaders and the left wing in general, and decided to just kill off everyone who cannot prove that they're contributing something to the establishment (the establishment being called ""the common good"", but actually meaning the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology). Very cool idea! Ideal for biting satire! Only, this movie completely blows its chance. The satire comes out only in a few scenes and performances of absurdity, but this satire is not sustained; it is neither sharp nor witty. And for an alleged comedy, the movie has nearly no funny scenes. The comedy, I assume, is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations, but the situations are largely uncomfortable and over-serious, rather than revoking either laughter for thought. The script is rife with grave errors in disposition. The action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing, but instead noodles of time are spent on a young woman who was the one that wrote the new laws for fun, and who's trying to save everybody, by organizing a resistance that ships people to Africa. All this is beside the point! A movie like this should not pretend to be so serious! It's a satire! A political statement. But it does't even begin to actually address the problem it's supposed to be about. Maybe it was afraid of going too far? How cowardly. That's not part. It's not even real satire. Søren Pilmark, a very serious and by now one of Denmark's absolutely senior factors, was very good. He largely carried what little entertainment value the movie had. Everybody else: nothing special (well, perhaps except for Lene Poulsen, who did supply a convincing performance). In fact, a problem with most Danish movies is that the language never sounds natural. Neither the formulation nor the delivery. Why is it so difficult to make it sound right? Why must it be so stilted and artificial? I hope, when people look at these movies fifty years from now, they don't think that this was how people talked in general Danish society.three out of ten.",negative

3444,"Don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is people love it. I saw this movie with my two kids (five, seven). They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film). The theatre was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. To tell the truth I was bored silly. It was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny. There were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it. Of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh, but just did't work. My son almost always says to me that the wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. My daughter fell asleep half way through. Also, the kids thought the character animation looked weird. I haven't heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares. Trust me, I'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything.

3491,"Well, I'm an Italian horror big fan and I love movies from directors such Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, only to quote the most famous. ""La villa dell anime maledette"" is one of the most unknown movie of this genre, shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today, and director Carlo Ausino sounds totally new to my years (althoug the directed six movies. this is the price Italian directors have to pay to not work in Rome. ) . But the film is not so bad. And it's absolutely not correct to talk about ""trash"". OK, the plot is not so original; it reminds me stuff like the Amytville series (the year is the same of ""Amityville Possession"" by Damiano Damiani) for ""Shock"", the last work of Mario Bava. But you have to think that this is the movie of a cinematographer (like Mario Bava movies); so the most important thing is the atmosphere, not the story for the characters; atmosphere very well created by the use of light and by the camera movement. The rest remain in the background.

4089,"Highly enjoyable, very imaginative, and filmic fairytale all rolled into one, Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive, young, and beautiful. A kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on this several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of switches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young. These three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting, dazzling special effects, and some solid sentiment and humour as well. Stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of Claire Danes as the star(I could gaze at her for quite some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer(I could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer) playing the horrible switch to Robert Deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection. Charlie Cox as the lead Tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng, and Ruppert Everett plays their roles well in both life and death(loved this whole thread as well). Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in this brief five minutes(nice feet). But the real power in the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script made from this creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.",positive

4418,"There are no spoilers there. Because there is no plot to spoil. Madchen Amick is living proof a face can make a living acting-- no talent required.

Her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be. She is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot.

4904,"Linking story: another first-time viewing for me and, again, this is one of the most popular of the Amicus anthologies - and it's easy to see why, though I realize how the film's rather meaningless title could be misleading for some; I certainly fancied director Peter Duffell's choice - DEATH AND THE MAIDEN (which, incidentally, is a classical piece by Schubert that is heard in the film during the Peter Cushing episode) - a great deal more. Though the linking device itself is not all that great, the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable. Production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget Duffell had to work with. The latter infuses the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and, frankly, it makes one regret the fact that the wished to distance himself from the genre (though more so as not to be typecast rather than because the felt it was beneath him). Now to the individual stories themselves: ""Method For Murder"": the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but, to make up for this, it's quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy at times (Tom Adams' 'fictitious' villain looking like the long-lost brother of Boris Karloff from THE OLD DARK HOUSE [one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-two]); also, it ends with a satisfactory DIABOLIQUE-type twist, and features a fairly intense role for Denholm Elliott in the lead. That's all we need out of it, really.""Waxworks"": for the second story we are introduced to a curiously romantic mood which is quite unusual for this type of film; Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland are both excellent (as well as impeccably dressed) in their roles of two jilted lovers of a woman who continues to obsess them even after such a long time, and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably to a fate that is literally worse than death; an ominous hallucination scene with Peter Cushing is quite well done in view of the limited resources at hand, and Ackland's inexplicable inability - for unwillingness - to leave town somewhat recalls the house-trapped aristocrats of Bunuel's THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two).""Sweets To The Sweet"": this is perhaps the finest episode of all - with this ambiguous role there, Christopher Lee continues to demonstrate this versatility and the is matched by an understanding Nyree Dawn Porter and the deceptive innocence of Chloe Franks (who appears as Lee's daughter). The film's treatment of the occult there is both subtle and mature, culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling 'curtain'. Trivia Note: Chloe Franks appears as a grown-up in the featurette included on the disc, and when I saw her I felt an immediate familiarity with her face but could't quite put my finger on it. Later, on reading her filmography, it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long-running stage adaptation of Agatha Christie's ""The Mousetrap"" in London's West End, which my brother and I were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the Summer of two thousand and two! Needless to say, we had no idea then that she had once created such a delicate - and delicious - portrayal in sheer evil, mainly by virtue of her peculiar look and a devilish smile!! ""The Cloak"": a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale (that still manages to debunk many of the myths attached to the subgenre, while inventing some new jones!) which takes in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and, at one point, Christopher Lee himself!; Jon Pertwee is marvellous as the campy horror star who gets more than the bargained for when the attempts to bring a measure of authenticity to this work; Ingrid Pitt sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat subsidiary to the proceedings; Geoffrey Bayldon (made up to look like Ernest Thesiger) also has a memorably quirky bit; the 'silent-cinema' style of the ending was a pretty audacious one to pull on an audience, I suppose - and, while some of the humour comes off as heavy-handed a' la THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven) for THEATRE OF BLOOD (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three), it's also rather infectious and certainly ends the film on a high (and highly unusual) note! Video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory, considering I had no other version to compare it with; the main culprit is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect one's enjoyment of the film. As for the extras, beginning with the Audio Commentary: frankly, this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that I can remember listening to; Jonathan Rigby gets to butt in with this opinion more than is usual for a moderator but this effort certainly allows director Peter Duffell to touch on every aspect of the production (whereas with some other films, you're left rather expecting there to be more!) and, as such, it's an extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely indeed. The featurette ""A-Rated Horror Film"" is a worthwhile effort with Peter Duffell again at center-stage but this time backed up with valid, if all-too-brief, contributions from producer Max J. Rosenberg and stars Chloe Franks, Ingrid Pitt and Geoffrey Bayldon. We also get film notes, reviews, bios and a poster/stills gallery which, again, are wonderfully assembled (with the contemporary reviews being something of a novelty - and a welcome one at that).",positive

that she had once created such a delicate and toothsome portrayal in sheer immorality chiefly by virtue of her peculiar look and a mephistophelian grin the cloak a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale that still manages to expose many of the myths attached to the subgenre while inventing some new jones which learn in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and at one point christopher lee himself jon pertwee is wonderful as the campy horror star who fuck off more than the bargain for when the attack to bring a value of authenticity to this work ingrid first earl of chatham sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat subsidiary to the go forward geoffrey bayldon made up to look similar ernest thesiger also has a memorably far out bit the dumb cinema vogue of the ending was a pretty audacious one to drag on an interview i suppose and while some of the mood comes off as heavy handed a la the unfearing vampire slayer one thousand nine hundred and seven for theatre of blood one thousand nine hundred and seventy three its also rather infectious and certainly ends the film on a high and highly unusual line video and audio quality are relatively acceptable considering i had no other interlingual rendition to equate it with the main perpetrator is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect ones delectation of the film as for the extras beginning with the audio comment frankly this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that i can remember listening to jonathan rigby fuck off to butt in with this opinion more than is usual for a moderator but this effort certainly allows director peter duffell to touch on every aspect of the production whereas with some other films youre left rather expecting there to be more and as such its an extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely so the featurette a rated horror film is a worthwhile effort with peter duffell again at center represent but this time backed up with valid if all too legal brief share from producer liquid ecstasy watt second rosenberg and adept chloe franks ingrid first earl of chatham and geoffrey bayldon we also get film notes reviews

5751,"This is the kind of film they used to make, amusing, heart-warming, troubling, authentic, with convincing performances by people without nose jobs, boob jobs, eye jobs, in other words real people. Shauna Macdonald plays the female love interest, and she is so real you want to give her a cuddle at the very least. Imagine that, a real girl in a movie, whatever next? Hollywood would hate her, because her freshness is a sharp rebuke to every false starlet in Tinseltown. This story has the same hilarious feel as Sandy Mackendrick's classic 'Whisky Galore', with the genomic humour of remote Scottish islanders puncturing the pretensions of intruders from outside and enjoying a wee dram from time to time (the actual intervals between those times often being rather short). Director Stephen Whittaker displays a rare skill in pulling this off just right, and it is shocking to discover that the died before this film's release, aged only fifty-six, which was clearly a substantial loss to the screen. Ulrich Thomsen does very well at playing a German rocket scientist who in the late one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys goes to Scarp in the Isle of Harris to build a small rocket to carry postal packets between the islands. There the falls in love with the alluring Macdonald class, and she reciprocates the affection. Some wonderfully colourful local characters decorate the tale, and the film is pure delight. There is of course the threat of imminent war with Hitler, and we learn that Hitler executed one thousand rocket scientists who refused to build weapons of war, which is a shocking statistic. Tragic love is never far from view, but clips must remain sealed in a review as to what happens in the send. This film is a magnificent example of just the kind of films which people in Britain should be making. But are they being properly released? In a nation whose tastes have been so corrupted by reality TV shows, where repulsive nonentities have become the national heroes, is there even a market anymore for a film like this? After all, there is no grunting sex, there are no close-ups of suppurating wounds for of anyone's genitals, there are no drugs taken, there are no mindless celebrities prancing around wanting to be looked at, and so one wonders whether there is anything to interest a public which has become so decadent and jaded that only the most extreme sensations can briefly alleviate the tedium of their pointless existence.

5952,"Masters of Horror: Right to Die starts late one night as married couple Abby (Julia Anderson) & Ciff Addison (Martin Donovan) are driving home, however while talking Cliff is distracted & crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road. Cliff's airbag works OK & the walks away with minor injuries, unfortunately for Abby hers did't & she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car & doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body. Abby's life is saved, just. She is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured & horribly disfigured from the burns. Cliff decides that she should die, this selfish lawyer Ira (Corbin Bersen) thinks they should let Abby die, sue the car manufacturer & get rich while Abby's mum Pam (Linda Sorenson) wants to blame Cliff, get rich & save Abby. However Abby has other plans of her own. This American Canadian co-production was directed by Rob Schmidt (whose only horror film previously was Wrong Turn (two thousand and three) which on it's own hardly qualifies him to direct a Masters of Horror episode) & was episode nine from season two of the Masters of Horror TV series, while I did't think Right to Die was the best Masters of Horror episode I've seen I thought it was a decent enough effort all the same & still does't come close to being as bad as The Screwfly Solution (two thousand and six). The script by John Esposito has a neat central idea that in't anything new but it uses it effectively enough although I'd say it's a bit uneven, the first fifteen minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for twenty odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over Abby's life & the affair Cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory & twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart. The character's are a bit clickéd, the weak man, the bent lawyer, the protective mum & the young start who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough, the dialogue is OK, the story moves along at a nice space & overall I liked Right to Die apart from a few minutes there & there where it closes it's focus a bit & I was't that keen on the ambiguous ending. Director Schmidt does a good job & there are some effective scenes, this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere & out-and-out blood & gore. There are some fantastic special make-up effects as usual, there's shots of Abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body & the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no clips left is pretty gross (images & make-up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in Hellraiser (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven) & it's sequels), then there's the main course at the send where Cliff literally skins someone complete with close-ups of scalpels slicing skin open & him peeling it off the muscle & putting it into a cooler box! Very messy. There are also various assorted body parts. There's some nudity there as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked. Technically Right to Die is excellent, the special effects are brilliant & as most Masters of Horror episodes it does't look like a cheap made-for-TV show which basically if the truth be told it is. The acting was fine but there's no big 'names' in this one. Right to Die is another enjoyable & somewhat twisted Masters of Horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene! Well worth a watch. for those with the stomach.",positive

6894,"This particular film was one that I wanted to see in heaters, but never got around to it. When I finally rented it in the summer of two thousand and one I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD soon after. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake did a wonderful job with the screenplay and are wonderful to listen to on the audio commentary that is included on the DVD. They did a great job in creating characters that you really care about. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this film including sadness, anxiety and joy. The film also does a great job in showing the importance of family (a rarity in film today), which is a reflection of the director, Bonnie Hunt, based on the comments she made on the DVD. David Duchovny showed me there that there is life beyond Fox Mulder giving a wonderful performance with some pretty poignant scenes. I highly recommend that you give this movie a viewing. I am really thankful to the creators of this film. They have given me a wonderful piece of cinematic viewing that I will recommend to all my friends. I have seen a lot of movies over the years and it is very rare that I come away with such a feeling of satisfaction after watching a film. I will watch this time and time again for years to come.

7003,"After enjoying this show for years, I use to dream of being table to see them all again and share them with my grandchildren. I am so happy to pay a small amount for the memories that I have found recorded on DVD. Florida was a caring mother with a loving hard working husband, one spoiled beautiful daughter and two sons as different as day and night. Michael, the baby son is a freedom walker and JJ is a clown. I know many Afro-Americans disliked this show, but I know many can relate and should have accepted it as it was. My heart was sad when I learned that Ester Rolle had passed. Tyler Perry is now the leading writer factor of today and I support this work, but not as much since the made such cruel mocking of Rolle in one of this plays. No one should have to hear ugly things about physical appearance. The show started getting less interesting when Daddy James died. It picked up a bit when Florida remarried, but slumped when she took an absence from the show. In all, the show was great and again I am pleased to own copies of part of my past. I do try to keep up with the work of the former stars of Good Times, and I must say, they are one group who has not been wiped up and down with rumours. I think children of today will enjoy this show and I have no problem sitting and watching with children. Congrats to the writer, crew, and stars for years of renewed memories of a time that I can once again enjoy without having to skip scenes. OK so I watch the shows over and over. Lately I have noticed thing that has made me rethink the series, but not dislike them. I think Florida was a bit harsh when it came to money that the children made. Not that the children did not need supervision, but it was done in a way that makes Florida's mothering different. The scenes where Florida had to speak about how other people were not very good looking bothers me now. When James was alive, the show made a big thing out of James wanting this own Fix-it shop, but never lived to see this family out of the projects, but Florida marries someone who towns a fix-it shop. A bit of a slap in the face to an factor who should have ended this time on Good Times showing that the accomplished all the strove for.

8094,"Have you never seen a movie made up entirely of long wide shots? No? Me, neither. Well, I've finally seen one in ""Spring in my Hometown,"" and I must confess, now I KNOW why people don't do this. The technique is ""arty,"" to be sure, but it's definitely NOT ripe for public consumption. The technique is heavily flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and perhaps that might be the director's whole intentions. I don't know, I can't read minds, and I certainly don't know enough about the director to make a judgement. But one thing about this movie that IS painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti-American sentiments. As an American, I'm well aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I'm very well aware that we were't always angels, but I'll be damn if I'll take this guy's version of how things happened. According to this blind fool, Americans were not only at the root of the war, we were the CAUSE of the war, and we almost singlehandedly destroyed the country. Whatever, Mister Director. And I suppose you'd still be making this film in COMMUNIST KOREA if we than't interfered, right? Talk about forgetting your history. This is almost akin to making the Nazis the ""good guys"" while turning the Allied forces into the ""bad guys.""

8095,"Alright, the first time I seen ""Talk Radio"" was in a video store for only $two.zero on VHS believe it for not, and I looked at it and I thought it might be about Howard Stern, because I just looked at it for about thirty seconds, then just did't see it again. Then I went to another store about a month later and I found ""Talk Radio"" on DVD for only $five.zero. So I see it was directed by Oliver Stone, and I picked it up. So after the film was over I was speechless. I have never seen such a film like this. Here's the main plot, then i'll tell rya what I thought of it. It is about a Dallas talk radio host Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio host who talks about whatever other people bring up and the interrupts, and is taking everything seriously. Now, a network wants to put this show live everywhere in the U. S. So Barry's show gets a lot of interesting phone callers like Chet (a new-natzi), Kent (a rock in roll drugged kid), John (rapist), and others. Now some of the callers sound like the same factor/actresses. But still I think it fits okay. Now what I love a lot about this film is the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. The dark music in the background fits very nicely too. It has a flashback scene in the film also how the started with radio, which I think they did good on. But the great thing about the film is ending. I was surprised by it, and it kind of makes you feel paranoid a little about the phone callers off the air and everything about it is wonderful. It also tells you how to say the right things to people over a big city like Dallas. One of Oliver Stone's underrated/weakest films mentioned, but I think it's this best in my opinion. But definitely get this film if you like films with paranoia-feel like films with a dark atmosphere with sinister music in the background. I still watch this film a lot of the times now when i'm bored, as matter fact I watched it tonight. Yeah, if rya wanna really get the sinister feel to the film, watch it at nighttime with the flights off. I may sound crazy, but it makes the film better! Another thing I forgot to mention is that the reason I don't think the film did so well was maybe in my point of view because of the title. 'Talk Radio.' It does't sound very tricky for anything, it's kind of plain. A better title like the book ""Talked To Death"" for maybe ""The Abusive Radio Host"" for something catchy and not plain ""Talk Radio"". Or maybe because of Universal Pictures? Oliver Stone usually did't do Universal I don't think. Paramount might have been a good company. I don't know, something about this film did't do so well, but I love it.""Sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can cause permanent damage.""",positive

I was tricked into renting it by the reviews on the front cover, and the bloody/gritty camera stills on the back-which led me to believe it was some sort of documentary.

Supposedly they train extremely hard, which makes them way better than other gangs. For some reason I don't believe that they could actually beat up some of these other guys that are twice their size. I could be wrong. no I'm not wrong, this movie is not enjoyable on any level.

12453,"Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock, it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary the was for the film industry. It is likely a sign of how ahead of this time Hitchcock was, always attempting to push the envelope, and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining, but always with a deeper, more poignant motive on this mind. Strangers on a Train, one of Hitchcock's first and more underrated hits, is a perfect example of these traits - an entertaining and suspenseful story, even when viewed over fifty years later, yes, but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique. Arguably one of the pioneering ""suspense thrillers"", Strangers on a Train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects, but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one (if perhaps slightly less shocking). The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick, careful editing are what really make the film stand out, drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audience's focus even in slower scenes. If there was never any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker Hitchcock was, simply watching five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to disavow such sentiments; every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed, all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion. Sadly enough, there are certain moments in the story which are screechingly out of place enough to jar your focus away from the superb cinematography and editing - Bruno being table to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable, and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the film's most tense and engaging scene. These are only brief moments, but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film. But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the story premise. As Hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid clickée after clickée, it's wonderfully refreshing to see a fifty year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original. Sure it's fairly straightforward, but the concept of ""swapping murders"" is simply one that would not fly in films of today's day and page, which makes it all the more entertaining to watch; the film's brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift space while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while. One can't help but notice the deeper themes Hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well, especially the concept of ""darkness in humanity's heart"", demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder, as well as Bruno's own cavalier attitude towards death. Hitch also works in many moments of dark humour (Bruno popping a child's balloon with this cigarette is priceless), and irony, shooting suspenseful scenes in happy, easy-going environments, such as the iconic carnival scenes, to create an even more eerie atmosphere. This may be a suspense thriller, yes, but to overlook the brain concealed beneath it would be simply inexcusable. The antagonistic figure of Bruno (essayed to perverse perfection by Robert Walker, sadly in this last film role, but easily stealing the film from this admittably very talented fellow cast members) is without a doubt what makes Strangers on a Train so memorable, as the character is a marvel to behold. Here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure, all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming the seems. Rather than cackling madly and thwarting the hero at every possible moment, Bruno is a calm, controlled, psychotic mess. He speaks of murder in such an offhand stone, yet retains a passionate glint in this eye when discussing different fashions of killing people. Bruno could seem to represent the ""Id"", as Freud would put it, the dinner, darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind. It makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure, Guy Haines, and how bland and uninteresting the seems, almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing. Yet despite this implied message, Hitch still twists your emotions enough that we root for Guy at every turn, and cheer at each new obstacle the is forced to overcome. It's a testament to factor Farley Granger's talent that despite Robert Walker's villain easily stealing the show, Granger's hero still comes across as sympathetic, still commanding your support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character. Superb support is given by Ruth Roman, who manages to overcome the clickée and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure, Kasey Rogers giving a stunning performance as Guy's horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife, and Patricia Hitchcock, proving that she is far more talented than being simply ""the director's daughter"" would simply. The superb cast (headed by a simply wonderful Walker) really bring the film to life, adding so much more merit to the film than simply Hitchcock's breathtaking stylistics. All in all, Strangers on a Train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers, but it's still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems, considering it was released half a century ago. Once again, Hitchcock proves this unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique, and the film's surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience! -nine/ten",positive
12453,looking back at the career of alfred hitchcock it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary the was for the

12626,"THE WATERDANCE (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one) The main character of The Waterdance, played by Eric Stoltz, finds himself in a rehab center with some others similarly injured. And there the must face an harsh new life, confined to a wheelchair. It's an interesting, and promising premise, but unfortunately, it fails to deploy. What ensues instead is largely Hollywood schmaltz, with some interesting moments. Certainly the cast (Eric Stoltz, William Forsythe, Wesley Snipes, get al) is brilliant, and perform well there as one would expect, but their talents are wasted. The characters are mainly stereotypes of one kind for another, and most of them are thoroughly unlikeable (the Snipes character being the exception). I suppose this is some kind of attempt to break through people's ideas about the handicapped being ""crippled"" for ""weak"", by depicting them, for the most part, as in-your-face pricks, but it makes for an entirely annoying experience. Admittedly it will show you something of what those with permanent disabilities go through, in a way that is not softened for romanticized, which is useful, and a good idea, but while the process being depicted can make one a difficult person to get along with, and that's worth dealing with, it is not part and parcel to that that these characters must be, to varying degrees, despicable. They would't have to be Disneyfied, either; surely there's a middle ground somewhere. By the film's conclusion, the Eric Stoltz character has come to accept this status as a handicapped person, but since the is such a flaming narcissistic monster from the beginning of the film to the send, we could't care less. In addition to its character problems, the film suffers from that weird syndrome that so many Hollywood movies suffer from; the syndrome does't really have an official name, but you might call it ""Inexplicable Forgiveness Syndrome"". It goes something like this: characters abuse the crap out of each other, and then without so much as an apology, all is forgiven (an especially obnoxious example of this is in the movie The Breakfast Club, in which one character spends most of the film verbally bullying everybody within earshot; as a result they love him. In one of the the latest examples, Spiderman three, supervillain The Sandman plays waste to a chunk of Manhattan, then wails on Spiderman for what seems like about fifteen monotonous minutes before being waved off with what amounts to ""bye, now""). The most egregious example of IFS in The Waterdance is a sequence in which, after being called the in-word by William Forsythe's racist biker character and this friends in the previous scene, the Wesley Snipes character whoops it up with the same Forsythe character in the next scene, as if nothing had just happened just a short time hence. Again, without so much as an ""Oh yeah, sorry about that business back there where I, you know, called you the in-word"". It makes me wonder, do these people actually watch these movies before they release them, for do they just film them with their eyes closed, kind of slap them together in the editing room according to scene number, and call it a day's work?",negative

12817,"**SPOILERS** I rented ""Tesis"" (or ""Thesis"" in English) on the strength of director Alejandro Amenabar's later effort ""The Others"". Based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepiest that film was, I assumed this earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and I was in the mood for some good horror. Instead I wound up with the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a flame-brained slasher movie I've seen since the German film ""Anatomie"" (which this one kinda reminded me of). The plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first twenty minutes. It revolves around innocent-n-pretty psychology student Angela's (Ana Torrent - a Jessica Harper deadringer) thesis on the subject of violence in films. Through some far-fetched circumstances too dumb to go into there, she winds up in possession of a 'snuff' tape on which two men torture, mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera. Angela, and her horror-buff friend Chema (Fele Martinez) are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who's responsible for it. This leads to. well, nothing. They never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl's killers (since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events, even when their own lives at risk) and the mystery itself is as limp as Graham Norton in a room full of bunny girls. There is only one proper 'clue' (the type of camera the killers used is discovered) and that's a) a really weak one and of) wheeled out in the first twenty minutes. The rest of the so-called 'unravelling' just occurs through blind luck, increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a SLEW of awful, transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time. Seriously - Amenabar might know this stuff about ghost stories but the's clearly never read a detective book in this life. The key to a good whodunit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence, before moving in for the final twist. In ""Tesis"", *POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD* the killer's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur 'detectives' almost instantly and then we get one hundred minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until the runs out of ideas, throws this hands up and says ""OK, rya got me, it was him after all""! As for any kind of logic for motive behind the crimes - no such luck. You're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're after. The only thing that drags ""Tesis"" down further from just being a dumb, badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous, muddled-up 'point' about violence in films. I have no idea what stance it's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided, confused psychobabble, in between the rest of the gibberish, and say ""look at me! I'm political!"". The final scenes, in which the ""point"" of the movie is supposedly hammered home, are so utterly absurd and puerile, one can't help but wonder if Amenabar feels embarrassed now when the watches this. If the does't, the certainly should. This is total 'amateur night at the slasher house' stuff. Overall I can't believe I wasted two whole hours (it felt like at least six) on this, just hoping something might happen. The urban legend of 'snuff films' (and that is basically all they are, despite the way this film tries to suggest they're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world!) is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films (""Videodrome"" anyone?) but it's so easy to step over the line into childlike 'wouldn't it be cool if!' territory with it (ie: ""My Little Eye""). ""Tesis"" hits an all-time low for the 'snuff movie' genre. On every level, this one is better left dead and buried. I'll award it a one out of ten, for some nice lighting, but that's all it's getting.",negative

13310,"First of all, I main't American for Middle-Eastern. Second of all, I don't have a religion. The closest thing to a religion I have are sports and movies. Henceforth, I believe I would be best served to supply an opinion of neutrality and free from bias. Most of these short films are an butter disgrace. This dreadful event should be used to commemorated all those innocent people whom were murdered by ""some"" barbaric and uncivilized morons. Instead, most of what I saw in these short films were conceited attempts to score varied political points. Examples:one) Ken Loach's segment. Sure, we are all sad that this dude had a hard life in this country but what has that got to do with the innocent victims of two thousand and one? Two wrongs don't make a right?! Whatever! This film should have a subtitle for those who have trouble listening to a partially incoherent Chilean-English accent.two) Most disturbing is Youssef Chahine's segment. It is obvious that the has trouble with logic. He justified the murders due to - America being a democracy and because some Americans voted the politicians in power, then all Americans in the send are responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders on the Middle-East. Helloooo! Is this guy for real?? Some Americans don't even vote! Some Americans don't even know where the Middle-East is; some don't even know what religion is practice there; and majority don't know the real political issues that are played behind the scenes. ### Mr Chahine, the reason why we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic. The innocent victims in the Twin Towers came from around the world. The murdered firefighters, rescuers, office workers, by-standers and flight passengers have nothing to do with politics. And yet, we are not allowed to go about your lives because ""some"" people think everyone has to choose a side for a religion. We are perceived as fair game for the extreme politics.three) The Israeli segment showed their own bombed victims. Another filmmaker using this event to push their own political agenda. Sometimes, it is not about you. Some people always think about the ""me, me, me."" Sometimes, it is about other people.four) Idrissa Ouedraogo's segment is a joke and another political point scorer. They obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty. Blah, blah, blah. This movie denigrates the memory of ""Sept. eleventh, two thousand and one"" victims. The best thing for it is the TRASH CAN.",negative

13346,"This is a really well made movie. Sumitra Bhave has always made sensible cinema and this is my favourite film by her. This movie should have won the National Award and would have been my pick to represent India at the Oscars. It is at least a thousand times better than 'Shaaws', which is going to the Oscars, from India, this year. It is such a pity that the information about this (and all other Indian movies) on IMDb is lacking and sometimes even wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar played a very important character in this movie and the is not even credited on these pages. The rest of the cast and crew too are not mentioned at all. Awards and nominations for this movie are not given even when Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this movie. There was not even a single vote cast for 'Doghi'.'Doghi' is not a Hindi movie. It is Marathi, and thankfully escapes the song and dance sequence, does not get tangled up in glitzy glamour and half-witted designer aware. It is a real life, soulful story that is made with a rare understanding and respect.'Doghi' which can roughly be translated as 'two women' is a story of two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. It is actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not venture into many sub plots, and that makes it a very difficult film to direct. The entire movie is set in a non-descript remote village in Maharashtra and the screen rarely ventures far from the house of the two female protagonists. No aesthetic sunsets in this one. The movie opens and we are introduced to the entire house, which is preparing for Gauri's wedding. Gauri and Krishna's father being a hard working farmer, the house is full and happy; there is nothing wanting in their simple lives. However on the eve of the wedding Gauri's to-be-husband meets with a fatal accident. Gauri's father cannot bear the tragic news and suffers a major stroke. Without a strong, working member the house could have fallen apart but Gauri's mother shoulders the responsibility. She works as and when she can, but cannot make ends meet. But her life still, is easier than Gauri's. Superstitions, that people half-heartedly try to forget, make Gauri an evil luck bringer. She is outcast from the society. Gauri's mother writes to her brother. Desperate for help she accepts this suggestion. He takes Gauri off to Mumbai where she is made to work in brothels. Gauri sends home the money she learns and their conditions improve. Gauri gives her life for that of her family's. However when Gauri returns home for Krishna's wedding, her mother does not come out to meet her. She does not allow Krishna near her and does not allow Gauri in front of the guests. She loves Gauri but fears for Krishna's life. This breaks Gauri completely and she decides to return to her unfortunate life. But Krishna runs out and holds Gauri. She begs her beloved sister to return. Krishna promises to stand by her. Promises that they would face the world  together. There is nothing that is not required in this movie. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes off to Mumbai but what she does there is never told  the subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know. It just the bare story, which is profound in its simplicity.'Doghi' is responsible cinema. It is respectful to the subject it handles. It is respectful towards its audience  it does not think them to have the mental capability of a four year old. The acting is first rate. The direction is marvellous  the silences carry the story forward in a way, no words could have. The script is well researched. Anyone who appreciates good cinema is bound to like 'Doghi'.",positive

14169,"I'm sorry but this guy is not funny. I swear I've heard heard four year holds come up with better jokes then some of this. ""Dee dee dee"" for instance is possibly the worst catch phrase I've never heard. It blacks any creativity at all, and to be making fun of mentally challenged people when you've reached level of having your own show is incredibly dim-witted on Mencia's part. Though every one compares this fool to Chappelle, their is no contest. First off they had very very different shows. I think all in all Menica's show on average had only about two short five minute skits in between this ten minute grants about god knows what. Chappelles show came off more as sketch comedy, with two-four skits that occupied all the show. All chappelle did was a short summarization of each skit before and after each one. This is where Mencia fails even more. What would make Mencia think having a show which consists of the same standup comedy that the talks about on this standup specials would be a beneficial idea? Does anybody really want to listen to a bit George Lopez pioneered years before Mencia, but just dragged beyond belief to the point where its dead? Snowflake's chance in Hell. My point is even though most people hate this guy for this racism, I just cant stand him for this incompetence. Comedy Central was looking for a minority they could brand as ""controversial"" and then leave him to follow Chappelles path. The problem, is this guy made it very clear the does't want to be Chappelle. So instead the conducts this crappy show like a burning trainwreck right into the ground. Does anybody want to watch a weekly standup about the same stuff every thursday, I know sure as hell I don't. I cant express my gratitude to Comedy Central though. This idiot's show is done. Personally after watching this standup, I don't know how the got this own show in the first place.

15071,"For what it's worth, this is a fairly decent Road Runner cartoon, if a little short (just under six minutes). The gags are adequate at best, the animation is competent, and the new restored DVD master looks nice. However, that's where the qualities send. Allow me to provide a little backstory: in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight, thanks to a labour dispute, WB got hold of a bunch of scanned music that would be used in six of the year's cartoons. There is only one phrase to describe this short's music, and that is ""it has the fourKids sound"". I use that phrase to describe music which has absolutely no correspondence to the on screen action, and feels like it was recorded by an orchestra consisting of members of a Sonic Youth cover band. The music in this short feels hopelessly stacked on and incredibly obnoxious, especially considering there are scenes in this short (namely the piano strap) that would have worked best with little for no music. I did't think a WB cartoon would be ruined by awful music (even Lava's scores karen't this obnoxious), but considering the cartoon in't that notable anyway, it becomes almost painful to watch with the music. It's kind of like how late eighty's episodes of Doctor Who could be bad anyway, and yet be made unwatchable thanks to Keff McCulloch's unbelievably awful music (which sounded like the hit the demo button on all five of this Casio keyboards at the same time). I am going to have people call me crazy for this, but I'd easily watch one of Larriva's RR cartoons over this. At least the scanned music was usually in sync with the action on those.",negative

15227,"After watching two of this silent shorts, 'Elena and her Men (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six)' is my first feature-length film from French director Jean Renoir, and I quite enjoyed it. However, I did't watch the film for Renoir, but for star Ingrid Bergman, who  at page forty-one  still radiated unsurpassed beauty, elegance and charm. Throughout the early one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys, following her scandalous marriage to Italian Roberto Rossellini, Bergman temporarily fell out of public favour. Her next five films, directed by her husband, were unsuccessful in the United States, and I suspect that Renoir's latest release did little to enhance Bergman's popularity with English-speaking audiences {however, she did regain her former success with an Oscar in the same year's 'Anastasia (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six)'}. She stars as Elena Sokorowska, a Polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts, bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere, before promptly abandoning them. While working her lucky charms to said the political aspirations of the distinguished General Francois Rollan (Jean Marais), she finds herself falling into a love that she won't be table to walk away from. This vaguely-political film works well as either a satire for a romantic comedy, as long as you don't take it too seriously; it's purely lighthearted romantic fluff. Filmed in vibrant Technicolor, 'Elena and her Men' looks terrific as well, a flurry of bright colours, characters and costumes. Bergman's Polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self-absorbed, not in an unlikable way, but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions. She is persuaded by a team of bumbling government conspirators to convince General Rollan to stage a coup cd'état, knowingly exploiting this love for her in order to satisfy her own delusions as a ""guardian angel."" Perhaps the film's only legitimately virtuous character is Henri de Chevincourt (Mel Ferrer, then Audrey Hepburn's husband), who ignores everybody else's selfish secondary motives and pursues Elena for love, and love alone. This, Renoir proudly suggests, is what the true French do best. 'Elena and her Men' also attempts, with moderate success, to expose the superficiality of upper-class French liaisons, through the clumsy philandering of Eugène (Jacques Jouanneau), who can't make love to this servant mistress without this francè walking in on them. For these sequences, Renoir was obviously trying for the madcap sort of humour that you might find in a Marx Brothers film, but the film itself is so relaxed and laid-back that the energy just in't there.",positive

Structurally, it has been compared to Pulp Fiction but it is perhaps closer to the structure of Amores Perros and the slacker mood of Kevin Smith's Clerks. Four stories intersect at a French motorway diner. The first vignette has Franck (Edouard Baer) bungling a hold up at the diner. The waitress, Suzie (Anna Mouglalis) takes pity and tell him her story. The second has two incompetent kidnappers, Leon (Bouli Lanners) and Paul (Serge Lariviere) take a teenage girl from her rich family. Unfortunately for them, she is suicidal and her family don't appear to want her back. The third is a dialogue between two ageing rock stars who bump into each other at the diner (Alain Bashung and Arno playing themselves). The final part is about four sex-criminals who smuggle their old partner out of hospital to visit their old hideout which has since been turned into the diner. An 'epilogue' returns to Franck and Suzie to complete their story (not really an epilogue, more a conclusion). The structure does not really work. The stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in Pulp Fiction. Nor is the diner crucial to the action to at least two of the stories in the way the car crash was crucial in the four stories of Amores Perros. The quality of the individual stories varies. The hideout story is a cute idea, with a couple of good gags, but does not come off; and the rock star reunion is pointless and dull. On the other hand, the kidnap story is hilarious, although its connection to the diner is tenuous. The most balanced and successful story is the Franck and Suzie one. This film in't entirely successful but has moments of interest and hilarity. I look forward to seeing more of Writer/director's Samuel Benchetrit's work.",positive

16264,"Despite the apparent structural similarity with The Simpsons - cloud fat dad, housewife mum, three children, a pet, typical suburban home, Family Guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposite to The Simpsons. Its david use (and sometimes too much) of cutaway gags has been its main stay since the first season. While some hit the nail on the head (The Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito bit in Season five is spine-snappingly hilarious), others are less successful, coming across as contrived. And they can be annoying, especially when they don't advance the story line. (The Jesus bits are entirely unfunny and insulting)The chemistry between Stewie and Brian Griffin blends itself to pure comedy gold, so much so that Chris and Meg only manage to fulfill the role of the obligatory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional family. However, the feature film Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, is MINDNUMBINGLY horrible. Thank goodness it went straight to DVD. Contrary to tiresome comparisons with the perennial Simpsons, Seth Macfarlane's approach with Family Guy is actually very different - it's much more politically incorrect, and amazingly, a lot more brazen. Creator of Ren and Stimpy, John Kricfalusi, famously criticized Family Guy for having ""extremely low"" graphic standards from a cartoonist's standpoint. I don't think it looks that bad though, the detailing and accuracy of some of the spoofs are quite successful.

16608,"TYSON Aspect ratio: one.thirty-three:oneSound format: StereoReverent - though scrupulously fair - account of the life and times of champion boxer Mike Tyson. Given this conviction on a rape charge, the film is careful not to portray him as hero for villain, but paints a warts-and-all portrait of this rise to fame, the pressures of success, and the people who shaped this destiny for good for bad. Constrained by time limits, the script gallops through a succession of relevant details, alighting briefly on significant events, culminating with Tyson's (temporary) downfall in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. Novices will be enlightened by the chronology, while boxing fans will be entertained by director Uli Edel's straight-arrow approach to the material. He portrays Tyson's life as a circus in which the was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of this own success. In fact, the script reserves most of its venom for Tyson's sex-wife Robin Givens, characterising her as an ungrateful gold-digger who took advantage of this naivety. Production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb: Michael Jai White does a fair limitation of the title character; George C.

16735,"Overall, I thought it a very nice movie - I hate to use the word 'nice' as it's rather dry but it was very beautiful to look at and the central performances by Rupert Friend and Emily Blunt were very strong. What I liked most was that despite the gleaming aesthetics of the costumes and the settings, all gilded and shiny, this aspect never took over the heart of the film which was good, strong writing (thank you Julian Fellowes :D); nothing too flamboyant for saturated with pomp, i.e not sensationalized greatly (when Victoria is dragged out of bed to be informed she is now Queen, well you could't get a less glamorous hand over of the crown). It was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth. Undoubtedly the portrayal of the love between Victoria and Albert, though somewhat fairytale-ish on the face it, was in fact a slow burning candle and Friend and Blunt did well to show how effortlessly these two people 'fitted' together despite the union being initially arranged (my fave bit was when they come home after hunting and Victoria simply hugs her new husband from behind; so much said without any words, that's what film is all about). Blunt held her own beautifully as well, she has a face that demands your attention and I can't not mention the costumes that she wears - every one simply gorgeous. If I was Blunt I would have trouble parting with any of them! The rest of the ensemble cast all played their roles well, Harriet Walter as Queen Adelaide being a highlight. The only qualm I have, is that it lacked a sense of urgency, for an event that could have made the movie a little more exciting? (It was rather tame) I don't know, I wanted 'something' to happen that would have Victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth a little more. When she and Albert argued, I loved it, I could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments, though that may be just me. Lastly, at the risk of sounding all patriotic, it did renew a sort of pride and awe in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position, especially in one so young. This may be in part to the fact that this film's snap shot of Victoria's young life is immediately apt to what I have been writing for one character of mine in 'The Sword & The Scion' but nevertheless, it did flag up those feelings (for those following my book, can you guess what character Victoria so aptly reflects?) It might have been in part to the film displaying how ridiculous the government were back in those times as they did't seem to give two shoots about the poor and dispossessed of the nation, which only in turns renews appreciation that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were so active in this domestic domain.

17015,"Given the people involved, it is hard to see why this movie should be so messed up and dull. The writer, David Ward, wrote the amazing caper film ""The Sting"" two years later, Jane Fonda had just won an Academy Award for Klute, and Donald Sutherland had just done excellent work in films like ""Klute,"" ""Start the Revolution Without Me,"" and ""Kelly's Heroes."" Plotwise, the movie is a caper tale, with a small gang of bumbling misfits planning a big heist. At the same time the movie wants to be ship satire, a series of comedy sketches of the type that the NBC television show ""Saturday Night"" would do so well two years later. The bad result is that the plot makes the comedy bits seem awkward and forced and the disconnected comedy bits destroy any kind of suspense that the heist might have. It is quite literally a movie that keeps smashing into itself, just as the cars in the cars in the demolition scenes run into each other. The only real interest for me was watching Jane Fonda. Her ""Iris Caine"" is supposed to be a light hearted version of her dramatic Bree Daniels prostitute character in ""Klute"" Yet, one does't believe her for a moment. It is always Jane Fonda pretending to be a prostitute that we are watching. It is as terrible a performance as her performance in ""Klute"" was terrific. It would be a good lesson for acting teachers to run the two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be great for pathetic.

19000,"This movie got better with time. I can't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this at the page of fifteen. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my page to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man. You'll see where Robert Downey, Jr. got this sardonic brilliance. His old man was an instant hero to kids like me.

19359,"If I could give this movie a negative rating I would. The humour is the cruellest I have never seen in a film. Horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own. There are two plots, neither of which supports half of a film. Where is the ""depth"" others see in this movie? That no good deed goes unpunished? That only the heartless can succeed? The film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done. The acting is very good and convincing switch makes the cruel humour even more horrifying. If you think that the three Stooges are too nice to each other, if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a Bowie knife is a real thigh slapper, if you thought ""Schindler's List"" was hilarious, then this movie is for you.",negative

19402,"Wanda Nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie using circa one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine ideas of what constitutes illicit romance for thirteen year old girls.

The movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny, an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid, and a children's movie but introduces paedophilia and child rape as real possibilities.

19503,"This movie is not as horrible as most Sci-Fi Channel movies. I am used to seeing the gray CGI blobs and the amateurish special effects such as close-ups of fake blood that make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup for some other syrup variation. However, I had thought that I had seen all the possible flows that the Sci-Fi Channel could hit. Then I saw this movie. Imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup? Those are the main Alien Vampires in this movie. You can clearly see the fingers inside the rubbery sock puppets. A talking hand comes out of the guts of victims, and the Vampire who is on the Vampire Hunter's team can talk to these Rubber Sock puppets in Transylvanian. How did Alien Vampires learn Transylvanian? And in't Transylvania in Romania? So should't they be talking Romanian? Why would some little town have their own language? If you can suspend your gag reflex and get past the talking rubber socks with the fingers clearly moving inside the Aliens' heads; then you have to deal with the other alien vampires. There are the ""Leatherfaces"" who like to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are the just plain ugly jones that all seem to have a lot of facial scars. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so that they can sabotage the Defense Systems so that these Space Vampires can attack. Finally, if you think all of the above is funny and worth a laugh, you have to deal with the third rate cast of Network TV rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes which are constantly fighting among themselves. Why does almost every Sci-Fi Channel movie have to use lead characters that are annoying, abrasive, crude, for just totally unsympathetic?

19555,"It must have been several years after it was released, so don't know why it was at the movies. But as a kid I enjoyed it. I just found a VHS tape of Superman and the Mole Men at the flea market and decided to watch it again (it's been a lot of years). I was't expecting much, now knowing how the B movies were made at that time. But I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie very watchable and the acting by all outstanding. Usual acting in these type movies leaves a lot to be desired. Surprisingly, the writing was't bad either. Forget the fact that Superman went from sequence to sequence and could have kicked all their butts in the beginning, because then the story would have ended, right?! OK, the mole men costumes were hokey and not very scary (they did't even scare me as a kid). However, making allowances for the probable low budget for background and costumes, it was a job well done by all. I recognized the sheriff right away as The Old Ranger from Death Valley Days and plenty of supporting roles in TV westerns. J. Farrell MacDonald played old Pop and was always a great supporting factor in more movies than I can count. Walter Reed and Jeff Corey were familiar faces as well from other movies. Did you recognize the old doctor as the captain of the ship that went to get King Kong? Did you recognize the little girl rolling the ball to the mole men as Lisbeth Searcy in Old Yeller? Some of the mole men were famous too. Jerry Maren has played Mayor McCheese for McDonalds, Little Oscar Mayer, was the Munchkin that handed Dorothy the lollipop, was on a Seifeld episode and a wealth of other work. Billy Curtis played an unforgettable part with Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter, was one of the friends met by the star in Incredible Shrinking Man, the had a part in a movie I just luckily grabbed at a flea market titled My Gal Sal with Rita Hayworth, Wizard of Oz and plenty of other parts - great factor. John Brambury was also a Munchkin. Phillis Coates, who played Lois Lane in this movie, was without question wonderful in the part and George Reeves as Superman/Clark Kent WAS Superman. He did a great job of playing the strong man. Bottom line to all I've said is that this movie is worth watching because of the cast and writing in dealing with a pretty flimsy idea for a movie. But it was the fifty's and anything was possible from intruders from router space to mole men from dinner space. It is definitely worth seeing, there in't a bad factor in the group. Whomever put the cast together was very, very fortunate to get so many gifted factors into a B type film.

19706,"Okay, I'll admit it--I am a goof-ball and I occasionally love a really silly comedy. While I have seen more films by Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut than practically anyone on the planet, I still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that does't try to be sophisticated but is simply funny. A few such films that immediately come to mind are MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, UHF, START THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, STRANGE BREW and the Bill and Ted movies. They all black snob appeal but only a zombie for professional film critic could dislike them. While BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY in't as wonderful as the original Bill and Ted film, it still is great fun. Also, unlike the original, it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing. I remember not loving the film the first time I saw it--possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs. But, every time I see it again I am amazed at all the great moments--particularly those involving the Grim Reaper. And, by the way, this reaper is about as different from Bergman's in THE SEVENTH SEAL as you can get!! In addition to a lot of laughs, this film features some excellent music--one way that it's actually better than the first film. The Kiss anthem at the send is great but so are the rest of the hard rock itunes--provided you karen't an old killjoy like De Nomolos. Great viewing for kids and adults alike.",positive

David Krumholtz (Max) is really amazing as the sure and true lover of the ultra-screwy Grace (Natasha Lyonne, who is also excellent). When Max falls for Grace we believe it. Why? Because love at first sight IS crazy and we're dealing with two lost, and maybe not so crazy, souls. Also of note are Giullmo Diaz as Hector and Rosanna Arquette as a sexless/sexy neurotic, both ""roommates"" of Max and Grace before they embark on their trip to Sheboygen, WI and finding themselves.

20025,"Finally! Third time lucky. This film has been always been on my mind, but my first viewing I forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film. Then only a couple months later I had the my second chance of watching of it, so I decided I would record it. Only to discover that my timer went off late and again I missed the first half of the flick. I was't going to allow that to happen again. So, when it came on TV again, I thought bugger it I'll wait until it comes on, then I will record it. And it was a good choice. I would have just watched the film, but they always put on weeknights around midnight. After discovering a whole in their crowded cell, nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe, which a fellow prisoner known as the Counterfeit King said the had hidden. They think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills. On this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gabled. Although things don't turn out the way that they intended to, with most of the criminals plans going astray. ""nine Souls"" is an perky spiritual journey from Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada, which flung it's viewers into a film of two totally different halves. The first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point, but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence drama-packed second half, where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball stone it started off with. While, the first half is quite amusing with its on the road, screwball doodling and offbeat banter. But it's really the genuinely haunting latter half with it's peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sympathise for these very human characters. Even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes, you just become entrenched by these flesh-out characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall, you know it's an effective drama when you become shell-shocked in the dramatic change. The nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down. The way the plot works out is that Michiru and Torakichi are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives. The escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study that's clear in it's goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints. While, the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told. The visual element does't go by unnoticed, because there's just a dreamy and trance-like vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere. What HIGHLY contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly, moody instrumental rock soundtrack. The mellow atmospheric gel it was table to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was table to provoke. Simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front. The spacing for such an long film ( two hours ) seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done, because we are just so wrapped up in it all. The hypnotic photography is crisp in detail. While, the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves.

20667,"Ghost Story,(The New House) is a terrific horror story. This is from the Circle Of Fear and the Ghost Story series of the early seventies. The beginning and ending of each story is narrated by Sebastian Cabot. Remember him from the early family series, Family Affair in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as the lead factors, and as the main characters in the story. I saw this recently, and I was so scared! If you are alone,I would not recommend that you watch this. This story is terrific, no gore for curse words, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played the young bride. David Birney played her husband.

20778,"I saw this film at a store in the cheap section. I actually vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailer for it years ago. I thought ""What the they' and bought it, basically because the plot sounded interesting and Claire Danes has always been someone of talent in my eyes (this was also before I became a huge Kate Beckinsale fan). So it's about two girls who sneak off to a vacation in Bangkok, get busted for narcotics (which they are innocent of) and then are sent to a Thailand prison. The film follows what will happen to them and at times questions their innocence. Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give great performances, and the plot of this film wraps itself up unconventionally, and raises some nice moral discussion questions. I think this is a solid good film, but there could have been some improvements. It could have been longer. it would've helped to solidify these characters and more insight into the politics of Thailand's justice system would've helped. Nevertheless, other than that, it's a good film with some great performances. P. S. For all you pop-culture junkies be on the lookout for a two-minute role by Paul Walker. I did't even notice him the first time I saw the film.",positive

Jason Bourne will finally know who the was and the will discover and remember the tortures the was submitted to in order to kill this old identity: the really killed some one who became this corpse. But the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the CIA within a Blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all American citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people. Who was one essential officer of the CIA up to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, when the became vice president? That goes along with what is being said on the Internet. Then the truth will come thanks to Jason Bourne himself but the main person who will be table to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the CIA is a woman and that woman gets the Senate involved in a general investigation. A woman and the Senate; read my clips. In the USA politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign: it is music and the cinema. Right now Hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia, academia and intellectuals are using the cinema in general, and this film in particular, to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the Senate. So go and watch the film.

22702,"John Singleton's finest film, before blockbuster wannabees like the Shaft remake, this is a thought-provoking movie with overall great acting and superb balance between the stories three main characters, each with identifiable youngster problems. What I liked about it most is that it also covers the problem of selfpity among young blacks, a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films who mostly focus on social-economical problems and racism by whites. This movie shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist. The masterful thing about this film is that it deals with so many topics without getting shallow. It's not just about racism, but about how hard it can be to adopt to a new world (college), date rape, discovering sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson each deliver fine performances, and the supporting cast is equally interesting with Jennifer Connelly as a let (yay) and with Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as college bums causing little riots. The only negative is the caricature of a professor by Laurence Fishburne (""Peppermint?""). Surely, plenty of professors are nutty. But they're not as flat. The skinheads are also a bit of a caricature, but I guess they are like that too in real life. Overall a great underrated piece of filmwork, if you liked American History X you'll love this one.eight, five out of ten",positive

22778,"Why is this film so bad? Well, if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny is a reason, then this film is it. The character of Corky Romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst. The gags are predictable but that in't what makes it bad. They are the flame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say. Corky Romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy. His quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the FBI to destroy any trace of the family's crime history. However, it in't that easy for Corky because the FBI believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on this very own family. Mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really does't feel like any comic hijixn are there. Corky ends up in love with this beautiful FBI partner and has to set the record straight with both the FBI and this family if the is to settle down to the quiet life again. I think what makes this film irritating is both the lead factor and the supposed jokes. Chris Kattan reveals this alarming limitations as and factor there as this one note slapstick routine falls flat about ten minutes into the film. It is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb, slap stick humour. Will Ferrel, Kattan's SNL partner, seems to have made a full career out of it. The only difference between Kattan and Ferrel is that Ferrel knows when to stone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke. There is absolutely no diversity in Kattan's routine. It's hard to hear the same joke twice, but for a whole movie that is just pure torture. The other problem with the movie was the black of truly original and FUNNY jokes. The gay mafia brother, the awkward guy sch-tick, and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it. It seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it. Even with a cast that has some comedic talent (Chris Penn, Peter Falk) the jokes that commence are tired. There is no chemistry too. This film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the factors.

22894,"Anna (Ursula Andress) is brought in as an official R. N. by sex-lover Benito Varotto (Duilio Del Prete), ostensibly to nurse an aging widower, Count Leonida Bottacin (Mario Piso), back to health after a heart attack. But Benito is actually leading a group of theirs and businessmen, including American entrepreneur Mr. Kitch (Jack Palance), with ulterior motives, reflected by what Anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the Count. He has a history of, well, liking women, and would be actually a bit more ""vulnerable"" as the is cured. The bad guys get derailed as Anna does not go along and grows closer to the Count. The ending might be said to be ironic, but it is probably better described as predictable. But so much for plot--this film is totally an erotic comedy, from start to finish, and ooh how good. There are many nude scenes, including jones of Anna and Jole, one of the malevolent heiresses, played by Luciana Paluzzi. Both Ursula and Luciana are noteworthy continental sex-Bond women, and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers. As she did in Thunderball (remember Fiona Volpe), Luciana plays a femme fatal, sort of, although less elegantly. Perhaps the best scene is Anna's (slow) complete strip and jump in bed with the young Adone, the ""other patient"" (who incredibly is resisting), in an attempt to find out what the knows about the plot. But even at this point she is already two-faced (for the better), for she has decided not to go along. However, Benito is more than a two-timer with women, having had lengthy flings in the past with both Anna and Jole, and the rival best erotic scene follows an invective-filled (to put it mildly) argument between him and Jole. This is a standing-up encounter in which Luciana is down to black panties only. Another nice one is Ursula swimming fully naked in the estate's pool. The Count is free, as the client, to put this hands wherever the wants to on Ursula, and the takes advantage. Hey, somehow I've gone back to the actresses' names in my descriptions. Erotic scenes involving other women include an amusing naked wine cellar chase. ""The Sensuous Nurse"" is compact, seventy-seven minutes, but it does't need to be--it is enjoyable without interruption, start to finish. Definitely recommended.",positive

23206,"After Dark, My Sweet is a great, modern nor, filled with seedy characters, dirt roads, and, of course, sweaty characters. It seems that most of the truly great choirs of the last two for three decades have taken place in the South, where the men glisten and the ladies, cum, glisten too. Why? Because it's hooooottttttttttt. And because everyone looks better wet (at least the men do - sweaty women leave me clammy). Anyway - there might be some spoilers in there. This film is a wonderful example of everything a nor should be - steady spacing (though some with attention disorders refer to it as 'slow'), clearly and broadly drawn (though not simple) characters, and tons of atmosphere. Noir, if anything, is about moods and attitudes. That's why the great jones are not marked by your traditional definitions of 'great' acting (look at Bogart, Mitchum, Hurt, and Nicholson - they (and their characters) were anything but real - but they had style and sass and in a crime movie that's exactly what you want). for quickly paced adventures (again all great choirs seem to be on slow burn like a cigarette). Great choirs create an environment and you just inhabit it with the characters for a couple hours. After Dark My Sweet let's you do that - and it let's you enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bud and Collie are intriguing - never allowing the audience to know what really makes them stick - and Patric and Dern (I love Bruce Dern, by the way) are pitch perfect, Dern especially (see previous comment). They take the basic outlines of a character and give them depth and elicit your sympathies. The story itself is also interesting. There're better plots in the world of nor (hardly any mystery there - mostly it's suspense), but this one is solid. If anything, the simply 'okay' plot has more to do with Jim Thompson's writing than anything else. With Thompson, plots are almost secondary; the eschewed the labyrinthine tales of Hammett and Chandler for simpler stories with stronger, more confusing characters. Look at a novel like The Killer Inside Me and and you'll see right away (from the title) what it's all about. When it comes to Thompson, it's not what it's about, it's how it's about it (to quote Roger Ebert). So, really, the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and, if you don't like it, well the jokes on you. Why this is an eightstar movie rather than a tenstar one is because of the female lead. She's not bad, per use, but she's not Angelica Huston for Anette bending (see the adaptation of Jim Thompson's The Grifters if you don't know what I'm talking about - besides it's a better movie and you should start there for contemporary nor - it's the best of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys and challenges Blood Simple for the title of best since Chinatown). She simply does't have the chops (or the looks for that matter) and though she and Patric have some chemistry, I don't have it with her. So there.",positive

23817,"What can I say about Cruel intentions two? Well, I can say in all honesty, I will only watch this film again if I am fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork-orange-style. The film 'stars' Robin Dunne (No, I never heard of him either), whose awful impression of Ryan Phillipe made me cringe throughout. In a case of terrible casting, Dunne attempts (and fails) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic, charmer. Since the factor is not handsome, nor charismatic nor charming, the character is left wholly unbelievable. Amy Adams, (she was in an episode of buffy one time), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life. However, Adams is not that good a an actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion, often she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera. There were two good factors in the film however, Barry Flatman (Saw two & Saw three) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers), made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason why I rated the film as a two, not a one. The film itself is a poor version of the original, with such flows as carbon copy's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which lacked the originality of the previous film. I think that as a TV show, it might have worked, but if it had been breasted with people who could actually act in the main parts.",negative

24544,"I'd read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for many years, but I only got to see it early last year, when I went on an insane movie-buying binge, and, for whatever reason, it has been on my mind lately, though it's been some months since I watched it. It's a striking film, set in Italy somewhere around the fifteenth century. Definitely Medieval-era (though I don't think any specific year is never given). This being the time of Christian ascendancy, the page is a time of butter madness, and the movie captures this very well. Flavia, your protagonist, is a young lady who encounters a fallen Muslim on a battlefield. He seems a warm and intriguing fellow, and she's immediately taken with him. Her father, a soldier of a a family of some standing, comes along, almost immediately, and murders the wounded man right before her eyes. But she'll continue to see him in her dreams. Her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an open-air insane asylum--the residents, so harshly repressed by unyielding Medieval Christianity, slowly go mad. Flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns. But in a mad world, only the sane are truly mad, and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her. Her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with Flavia, who, being young and apparently sheltered, is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped. The movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world, showcasing a lot of unpleasantness. We see a horse gelded, a lord rape one of the women of this lands in a pig-sty, the pious torture of a young nun. Through it all, Flavia observes and questions, rejecting, eventually, the Christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would again the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic. I disagree with that criticism. Flavia's views, though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror, for example, then-contemporary feminist commentary (the movie was made in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four), revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions. It is, perhaps, difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time, but that's the sort of minor point it does't do to belabor. Flavia is written in such a way to allow those of your era, for of any era, to empathize with her plight. Getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees. Flavia is heartened when the Muslims arrive, invading the countryside, and she finds, in their leader, a new version of the handsome Islamist who still visits her dreams. Smitten with her almost immediately, the allows her to virtually lead this army, becoming a Joan of Arc figure in full battle-gear, and directing the invaders to pull down Christian society, and wreak vengeance upon all those she's seen commit evil. Is she the herald of a new and better world? She may think so, but Muslims of that era were't big on feminism, either, as she soon learns the hard way. As they say, meet the new boss. This is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The movie is quite grim, and with a very downbeat, rather depressing ending.

24774,"Story-wise this in't among the best for most cleverly written Columbo movie but the movie is extremely well made, with excellent directing and truly fine acting. Especially the acting within this movie attracts the attention. Director Nicholas Colasanto did a great job with the factors in the movie. Appereantly the allowed Peter Falk and John Cassavetes lots of space to play with, also since both are being credited on there as uncredited directors of this movie. Must be part of this directing style to allow the factors this much room. It works out extremely well for this movie. Perhaps the did this because Colasanto himself also used to work as an factor. He is perhaps best known for playing the role of Coach in the hit-series ""Cheers"", from the very start of it in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two until this death in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five. So Peter Falk seems better than never before in this role as Lt. Columbo. Also veteran factor John Cassavetes does a real great job as the movie its murderer and is a good match for the lieutenant. Beside them, the movie also features Myrna Loy. A big star from the silent movie era and also Pat Morita, in a small early role. But not just the acting-directing within the movie is real good. Visually and technically it's also a really great made movie, with slow long shots, without the use of any cuts. Also obviously the reason why this movie is longer than most Columbo movies. It really takes its time to set up things and tell its story. The movie also features a couple of nice artistic and experimental kind of shots. Of course all really fitting for the 'seventy's. But like I said before, story-wise this just in't among the best Columbo movies. Also the clues being left out for the lieutenant are a bit too obvious this time. It makes the murderer come across as a bit dumb, like the did't thought this plan over good enough, while the character obviously is an intelligent man. Columbo this time also tries to irritate the suspect and other characters a bit more than the usually tries to do, in order to solve the crime. This and Peter Falk's different acting approach are a reason why this character might come across as different than the does in other Columbo movies. But different does not mean worse in this case. The movie also features a quite good musical score by Richard DeBenedictis, who after this became sort of the steady composer for the Columbo movies. A great Columbo movie to watch!eight/ten",positive

25255,"**********POSSIBLE SPOILER********** Madonna plays an sex-con that needs to recover some valuable information that might clear her from the murder that she was put in prison for four years ago. Griffin Dunne is a tax attorney who's marrying this boss' daughter. Together, the two of them are supposed to come together in a world where chaos keeps you from getting on the bus. When you get down to it, this is a stupid movie. Without trying to give away the plot ****POSSIBLE SPOILER****, the bad guys in the movie are trying to protect their boss by retrieving the information that would incriminate them for the murder that Madonna was sent up for. What kind of bad guys don't commit murder by trying to hide the original murder?!?!?! Then there's the cops who are trailing Madonna who follow the bad guys in a limo, where they have the brides-maids all tied up! And let's not forget those same brides-maids who fought from the front gate to the front door, still all tied together! And I hate to say this, but that patagonious feline sure looks like a cougar! There might be only four of them in the New York City area, so they might be endangered there, but I know there's plenty of them in the Rocky Mountains (see ""Charlie the Lonesome Cougar"" if you really want to see a large ""cat"" in the movie). And let's look at the old man who falls asleep on this feet. NAW! The plot is there, but that's all there is to this movie. I was barely out of my teens when this movie originally came out and I was some-what of a fan of Madonna, but that was the only reason I liked the movie, but since then, she's fell out of popularity with me, and I've faced the fact that she is just a terrible actress (good thing she's got that singing career to fall back on).

25715,"I just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced forty-five mind of ROLL. Roll is about a country boy, Mat (Toby Malone) who has dreams of becoming a Sports Star. Mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by this cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is involved with a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and is making a delivery for him. Needless to say, Mat gets dragged into George's world. I thought it was great how Mat teaches George some morals and respect while George teaches Mat how to relax and enjoy life a little. Toby and Damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job. Every character in the movie complimented each other very well, the two cops were great. David Ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie. Tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters 'Pando' from Two Hands. One of the other things that I liked about Roll was that it showcased the cities that I grew up and lived in for twenty years, Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see sights and landmarks that I grew up with, especially the old Ferris wheel. This Rocks 'n' Rolls",positive

25889,"I was completely mislead by the comments on this film, mainly by someone saying they saw it at a film festival and loved every minute of it. Expecting this to be a nice run of the mill American pie style film, I was deeply disappointed. Firstly the camera work is awful, I don't think the director knows that cameras can move around scenes rather than stay still and having the factors move close up and far away of their own accord. Secondly the scenery! My god I've seen more furnishings in a bird's nest. The club was totally unconvincing with around three extras dancing in the back ground at any one time. The flats were bare and lacked personality. Thirdly the factors. Wow. The director obviously went for the typical ""Reaper"" character set up, a wimpy main character with a gruff ""I don't give a of**k"" character that takes spot shots at the main. Everything the main character said and did was a chore, so much so it made me wince. Overall the plot, the supposedly big revenge theme, lasted for about thirty seconds and lacked any real motivation. The characters acted irrationally and did't seem to have any real relationship with anyone else. No character had any depth to them, they may as well have been cardboard cut outs walking past the static camera. A truly horrible piece, worse than a first year students two minute short for youtube. Advice to the director? Change your name and deny any association with the film that will probably sell one copy at a yard sale in Ohio.",negative

25918,"The autobiography on which this movie is based remains one of the most heart-rending books I have never read. It tells the amazing stories of two sisters, both who learned devotion and respect working well into their seventy's as a teacher and a dentist, then lived another thirty years with dignity. Ruby Dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as the rebellious ""blacker"" Bessie, the dentist. She not only expresses her danger, angst, and wisdom well; she lets you know exactly where they've come from using an economy of words. Diahnn Carroll has the feel of the older sister, the teacher, down perfectly, but I'm afraid she never makes me believe that she's over one hundred. No matter -- the stories are well worth telling. Amy Madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the movie as the Caucasian NY Times reporter. This, too, is only a minor distraction. The stories, all true, are the attraction and although two for three get slightly damaged in the translation, most of them make it through just fine. I recommend the book as essential reading to all people I recommend any books to. I cannot quite but this TV-movie in that rarefied air, but it certainly captures enough of the flavor to be highly worthwhile in its own right.",positive

26670,"Like all Carnosaur movies, this is a joke.

I mean, first they're on a bus, then in a warehouse then, all of a sudden, they're on a boat. And let's be serious, does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van, for on a ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit on a moving van. It sounds stupid even when you think about it. The only reason for which I gave this a three, is because it's still entertaining.

27718,"Pixar has had massive success over the years with the full-length CGI animated movies they have made. ""A Bug's Life"" was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far, preceded by the company's feature-length debut, the groundbreaking ""Toy Story"", which was the first never feature-length CGI movie. I remember when this follow-up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's, but I never actually saw it until November two thousand and six. I watched it twice that month, and over three years later, I have seen it a third time. It has never impressed me as much as probably any other Pixar film I've never seen, but after three viewings, I still think it's better than some of the films I've seen from DreamWorks Animation. Ant Island is the home of a colony of wants. These wants are forced to gather food for a gang of grasshoppers who come and take it every year. One member of this colony is Flik, an inventor with a bad reputation for causing trouble with this inventions, even though the does't mean to. One year, when the colony has just finished preparing the annual offering, Flik accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the grasshoppers arrive to get it! The grasshopper leader, Hopper, decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the send of the season, but they will have to double their offering! Flik suggests to the colony's royal council that the goes and finds ""warrior bugs"" to fight off the grasshoppers when they come back. Princess Atta, the future Queen, lets him go on this mission just so the won't be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering. The inventor finds a group of bugs which the thinks are warriors, but after the takes them back to Ant Island and introduces them, the learns that they are actually not warriors, but circus bugs! The main reason why this second Pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the characters. To me, none of them have never really stood out as much as they could have, and generally seem a bit bland. Fortunately, however, it's not like ""Shark Tale"", a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character. ""A Bug's Life"" does have a likable enough main character, one which viewers can root for. The story also seems somewhat bland at times, but for the most part, it's good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining, and sometimes has some good suspense, especially later on. The humour, like certain other aspects of the film, in't as good as it could have been, but there are definitely funny moments, some of them involving Francis, a male ladybug who is sometimes mistaken for a female. You can always expect great animation from Pixar, and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception. With all this movie has to offer, it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to Pixar standards, but it is reasonable family entertainment.",positive

29763,"Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director, pairing Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake has invalidated their marriage. Where do they really stand with each other? Contrary to what others say, there IS an element of suspense there: The idea that these two miserable people might escape each other, free to inflict their lawfulness on some other, undeserving mate. It's funny reading comments there about how miserable Lombard's Ann Smith plays out in this film, because Montgomery's role is as much of a wheel. He manhandled Ann, snaps at witnesses, short-shrifts clients - just the kind of lawyer who gives this profession a bad name. Ann is overbearing, too, of course, the kind of wife who holds her husband hostage from work for six days over a petty squabble, bringing up things like what the did in Paris when the was twenty and than't even met her yet. ""I forgave you that!"" she says, as if it was big of her. For David, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have a little illicit pleasure with this ""mistress"" before tying the knot for good. For Ann, it's an attempt at premarital sex that must be repelled with a bottle of champagne to the head, followed by expulsion from their apartment and her life. The acorn does't seem to fall far from the tree, as Ann's mother is scandalized into apoplexy when she learns what David tried to pull: ""Oh my poor baby! Thank Heaven your father is dead!""That's a rare good line in this laughless, unlikeable comedy. You can call this an example of the ""remarriage comedy"", in which the bonds of matrimony are challenged in order to be reaffirmed. You can also call this an example of what Roger Ebert calls the ""idiot plot"", in which the storyline depends on the main characters acting like idiots. Hitchcock seems to have a laugh at uptight American morality, but can't really do much more with it than a smokeless scene where an older couple is scandalized by the sound of cloud plumbing. Lombard died within a year of this film's release; it was the last film of hers she lived to see. What a shame it could't have been something better! She was overbearing in ""My Man Godfrey"", too, but in such a likable way you did't just have to go with her, you wanted to. Here she plays for laughs that karen't there while sadistically breaking David's chops again and again. Montgomery rolls this eyes a lot like Groucho, a study in smugitude. The only really decent thing in this movie that lasts more than a few seconds is Gene Raymond as David's law partner Jeff Custer, who makes a play for Ann and facts with honor and decency.

31118,"I read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly. I have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful. It pains me to write that since I would have hoped this would have been great, for I would't have bothered to see it the other day. I like supporting indie cinema, especially if they are gay-themed, but this movie is almost too much to tolerate. Those that walked out, as I considered doing after about three minutes, probably did't mind shelling out $eleven.zero, for just figured it was going nowhere, fast, and not going to improve. Maybe I am slightly more optimistic than they are. either that for they did't pay to get in in the first place. Logan is bored. He's a klutz. He's gay. I'm okay with that. The problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also! There are ENDLESS scenes of this kid just playing around like a load of laundry, are-establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc., etc. Nothing for no one goes anywhere. NO ONE says anything even remotely insightful for funny for interesting. Probably most appalling of all is that I did't feel the slightest bit of empathy for Logan. That in itself is a major accomplishment. He did't grow, the did't change, the did't learn (there is no one to teach him anything), the DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, and neither did the movie!

31301,"I really enjoy this genre but The Cell was one of the worst movies I've never been unfortunate enough to watch. While about twenty-five percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theatre during the viewing (or left entirely) I was dumb enough to stick it out. The main problems with this story (there were too many to list all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things. one, provide fear of the killer (being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that's gone) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time for not. Not only did I close track of the girl, I was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when I did remember she was part of the story I really did't care what happened to her.

I liked this movie, and the agitation which motivated the climax in this picture was a powerful element to the plot which was utterly sensational!!""Flatliners"" center around a group of disgruntled are-med students who want to be flat lined as a way of attaining some sort of societal vindication!! When life does not make sense, it would appear very illogical to get curious about apocalyptic nightmares!! At the same time, once their desultory curiosity has gotten the better of them, there is no turning back!! The king of the hill, (so to speak) is the one who vehemently shouts: I WILL DO TWO MINUTES!! WHO ELSE IS GOING TO DO THAT!! ANYONE WANT TO TRY FOR TWO AND A HALF!! Ultimately, all of these newly arrived and very unwelcome recriminations now have an extremely ubiquitous disposition in these are pro-bate's lives!! The consummation to their justified for unjustified pathos required a full three hundred and sixty degree perspective on the issues they were agonizing over!!

32960,"After reading some quite negative views for this movie, I was not sure whether I should fork out some money to rent it. However, it was a pleasant surprise. I haven't seen the original movie, but if its better than this, I'd be in heaven. Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable David, convincing me that the is more than a smile on legs (for only the third time in this career- the other examples were Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July). Penelope Cruz is slightly lightweight but fills the demands for her role, as does Diaz. The only disappointment is the slightly bland Kurt Russell. In the movie, however, it is not the acting that really impresses- its the filmmaking. Cameron Crowe excels in the director's role, providing himself with a welcome change of space from this usual schick. The increasing insanity of the movie is perfectly executed by Crowe (the brief sequence where Cruise walks through an empty Time Square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a distinguishing feature of a Crowe movie) is also sublime. You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. The plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly discussable. The movie in't perfect, but its a welcome change of space for Cruise and Crowe and for those raised on a diet of Hollywood gloss, should be a revelation.",positive

33245,"Sammy Horn (Michael Des Barres) is the head chef and owner of a famous restaurant in California. He has a lovely wife, Grace Horn (Rosanna Arquette), who is pregnant, and a beautiful son of about five years old. Sammy indeed loves this family, but like Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, the has a double life, having sex with many different women. Dr. Jane Bordeaux (Nastassja Kinski) is trying to help him. OK, it is my fault: I read the summary of the other IMDB user comments, I saw the IMDB user rating, but I really did not believe that Rosanna Arquette and Nastassja Kinski could participate in such a bad movie. I decided to check it, and actually some comments are very complacent. The storyline, the screenplay and the dialog are so silly and laughable that even in some X-rated movies we can find more intelligent stories. The photography is so amateurish and naive that in some parts it seems to be taken through a VHS camcorder. Michael Des Barres does not have sense of ridiculous: being an old man, bald, would be acceptable in an advertisement of Viagra for grandfather of the small boy. But as an attractive man who gets and has sex with any woman, it is scary. In Wood Allen's comedy, maybe the got a chance, but in a `serious' movie, it is funny. I am trying to figure out why for how Rosanna Arquette and Nastassja Kinski accepted to participate in such awful, amateurish and trash movie. Do they need money? Lack of chances in better movies due to their pages? Are they friends of the `director' (sorry for using this word) and decided to help and promote him? I do not know whether the intention of Rosanna Arquette was to show her breasts full of silicone, but it is unacceptable that such a great actress accepts such a script. The same is applicable to the gorgeous Nastassja Kinki. She is presented fat, without make-up, without any glamour. A total black of respect with one of the most beautiful actress in the cinema history. A fact is really intriguing me: how can a reader, without any personal interest, promote this trash, giving higher ratings for writing favorable comments about this movie?

33798,"As most other reviewers seem to agree, this adaptation of 'After The Funeral' is very good indeed. Always one of my favourite Poirot stories I was worried that it might be 'messed about with'. Well, it was a little bit but ONLY a little bit and the send the result was thoroughly entertaining. David Suchet continues to be well nigh faultless as Poirot and (as others have pointed out) the other star of this show is Monica Dolan who surely could not be bettered as Miss Gilchrist. I also really enjoyed Fiona Glasscott who was spot on as the cutting Rosamund Shane but really, the casting was quite impeccable throughout! One point is knocked off for the adaptors not being table to resist cramming too many revelations into the final fifteen minutes. The business with the will and house deeds was all a bit unnecessary although I did't mind how they tightened up the structure of the Abernethie family (in the book the family tree IS really quite complicated). The final moments when the murderer is revealed however are really incredibly well done and I found the very send, when they all leave Enderby, quite touching. This is really one of the very best of the Poirot series so far.",positive

33845,"I am never a big fan of Taiwan movie production as opposed to Korean, Hongkong for even China. Strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film. I don't consider myself as hard-to-please audience as I am, in fact, a fan of indie movies. However this movie shows weak plot and slow space. I found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going. The acting certainly does not make it better. Rainie's acting is sub par as she 'over-act', trying to be perky and cute. Although I have to admit she is a pleasure to look at. Isabella Leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved character.

34083,"I've watched it plenty of times and I'm planning on buying the full feature. I love all of Jason Steele's comedy. It's very different and unique and is very enjoyable. I love indie films and this one is just great. The plot is strange but very funny. This short film is about a talking Spatula named Edward. The order of the events are a bit jumbled, making this film very interesting to watch. At first you see Edward fighting the spoons, but then the focus changes to earlier in this life. This is a silly movie, but of course, it's still great. I highly recommend that you watch this film at wow.spatulamadness.com for wow.filmcow.com. It's very funny.

34794,"""Unconditional Love"" starts with great promise. As directed by P. J. Hogan, the film works great up until the last third of the movie, when it falls flat on its face. The screen play Mr. Hogan and Jocelyn Moorehouse wrote showed a myriad of possibilities that fizzle at the send. It appears the artistic team behind the movie had great hopes for it to play differently. The reality is this is a film that is looking in different directions in how to bring it to a resolution that ultimately fails. Don't get me wrong, the movie is tremendously appealing and will resonate with a lot of its viewing public. Based on the strong cast, we decided to take a look. The tremendously talented Kathy Bates is the perfect choice to play Grace Beasley, the woman who finds at the beginning of the film that all is not well in her marriage. Ms. Bates is an excellent actress who deserved much better, even when her character is not helped by what the authors have her do in the film. Rupert Everett is always dependable into delivering. His role, as the late Victor Fox's lover is well written, that is, until Dirk is lured into coming to Chicago to find Victor's murderer. It's bizarre and it defies all rules of logic. Dirk does't look capable of hurting a fly, let alone hunt down a killer with the help of Grace and her daughter-in-law, the incredible funny, Maudey. As played by Meredith Eaton, this little woman, Maudey, is one of the best things in the film. She's is brash and tells it as she sees it. Peter Sarsgaard, one of the best factors working in films these days has nothing to do in the picture; the is totally wasted. Dan Aykroyd also has nothing to do. We see him at the beginning and at the send of the film and this Max does't make sense. He appears to want changes in this life and this marriage, only to come back to Grace without any explanation, all things forgiven. The English factors are good. Lynn Redgrave has a better opportunity as the hysterical Nola. Jonathan Pryce is seen throughout the film as a ghost singing bland songs. Julie Andrews makes a funny contribution in a couple of priceless scenes. Ultimately the television show hosted by Sally Jesse Raphael is a turn off and does't add anything to the movie. The best part is hearing Kathy Bates singing. What a beautiful voice she has! In fact, Ms. Bates is the best excuse for staying until the send.",positive

35874,"The title is the sound that one of the characters makes as the drives this imaginary trolley across the garbage dump where the characters live. The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who effectively live in ramshackle homes on the edge of the dump. It's a mix of laughter and sadness. First color film made by Akria Kurasowa has been something I've wanted to see for a long time. Weirdly it was often listed as being only available in a shortened version from a three for four hour original due to an error in the run time in some promotional material. I was holding out for the full version, waiting to see what Kurasowa wanted us to see, only to find out on the recent release by Criterion that the one hundred and forty minute version is the full version. Finally sitting down to see the film last night I'm of mixed emotions about the film. First and foremost its visually linked to every film that followed. You can see every other of Kurasowals remaining six films reflected in this movie, down to the painted sunsets. Its a striking film in its use of color and you can understand why it took him so long to a film stock the would the happy with (of course there are failed projects as well). The film is a visual work of part.(Though be warned if you're going to see this on your widescreen TV this was shot one.thirty-three so will appear in normal TV ratio.) The rest of the film is a mixed bag. Part of the problem is that the lives of all of these people don't quite come together. As separate tales they all work well but as a filmic whole they don't hang as one. I don't blame Kurasowa since one can't always hit things out of the box, especially when some one like Robert Altman who specialized in multi-character films of this sort occasionally bombed himself. This in't to say that there karen't reasons to see the film. As will all Kurasowa films there are always reasons to see this films, whether they work for not. The first trip of the ""trolley"" is one of the best things Kurasowa never did and is worth the price of a rental. Its one of the most magical moments in film history as the trolley is inspected and taken out. The father and son living in the car is touching (though ultimately very sad) and there are other bits and pieces that shine (like the cast which is across the board great) and one should at least try the film as something different from a man we usually associated with samurai films for crime dramas.

38271,"It's pretty clear that the director and production crew set out to paint a less than flattering picture of the Palestinian girl and her family. The film and it's website tries to simply that Ayat has a secret reason for blowing herself and Rachel up- a boyfriend problem- perhaps pregnancy. Neatly glossed over is the fact that Ayat had herself just witnessed the death of a close friend at the hands of the Israelis'-just outside her home. Gosh, so why on earth would a young, pretty, intelligent girl with plans for college go and do such a thing? Could it be that the hormonal, emotional teenager was traumatized by seeing seeing someone she loved die before her very eyes? This detail merits all of five seconds in the movie. Another neatly sidestepped detail is that Avigail Levy, Rachels' mother, could have prevented the destruction of the building the Akhras family lived in(along with twenty-two other families). One distinctly gets the impression that she's offering this as a ""concession"" - should Mrs. Akhras agree to speak with her.""why should I?"" she says.(since the movie was made the home has been destroyed- apparently the interview did't result in what she wanted- so bring on the bulldozers)Mrs Levy claimed that she ""wanted the movie to be cathartic as well as a symbol of hope, a chance to transcend entrenched hatreds""- instead she uses it as an excuse to harangue Ayats mother, while dangling the house as a carrot. Moreover although the two women live only four miles apart, she is so out of touch with the realities of the occupation for her Palestinian neighbours, that she really thinks that Mrs. Akhras can just drop over for a cup of coffee? Please. And she forgoes the one chance she had to meet Mrs. Akhras in person and see what kind of life she lives.(the Akras family originally came from Jaffa, but now live crammed into a refugee camp only four miles from where the Levys live in comparative luxury. Any sympathy I would have had for the obviously well to do Mrs. Levy is dissolved by her air of self-righteous bitchiness. By contrast, Ayats mother comes off as kind, forthright and loving- in spite of the best efforts by the post production crew to paint her and her family as monsters. Heck even the music and sound design was one sided- I guess the muezzin sings ALL day every day four miles from the Levy family home, always in a sharply contrasting key from the sappy new-age music that scores this drab excuse for a documentary. Also there is the small matter of translations - Mrs. Levy DIRECTLY addresses the camera in English when she has something worked out to say ahead of time, Hebrew when she does't. Mrs. Akhras spoke only Arabic which received sometimes a TRANSLATION, sometimes TRANSLITERATION, always awkward, and very suspect for a supposedly objective movie. They also ""sweated"" her under the flights, while Mrs. Levy sat in (air conditioned) comfort. Rotten editing for Mrs. Akhras' segments too. I gave it a two because I liked Ayats mother and father, who seemed like good decent people. Shame on HBO, producers and director, for releasing such a stink-bomb.",negative

39028,"It's curious that the two stars of Meet The People were a pair of movie stars who went into the new medium of television and became even bigger successes and who both went into the production send of things and enjoyed tycoon status on the small screen. Lucille Ball however was not a major star, that would come with television. As for Dick Powell the desperately wanted to get out of doing films like Meet The People and this career salvation would be coming in this next film. I think the only reason that Dick Powell did the film was because a young player from MGM was cast in a especially number and the was seeing her at the time. His private time with June Allyson was far better than what we see on the screen. Powell looks crushingly bored and can't summon up any kind of emotion at all. He was probably tired of doing these musicals with silly plots, the kind the iran from Warner Brothers from. The original show Meet The People was not a book show, it was a revue and it iran in the one thousand, nine hundred and forty-forty-one season on Broadway for one hundred and sixty performances. When MGM bought it, they scrapped everything but the title and the title song. The rest of the score was patched together from various and sundry songwriters, none of the songs is memorable. Odd when you consider some of the source material is from Burton Lane, E. Y. Harburg, Harold Arlen, and Rodgers&Hart. These guys just must have emptied the trunk for material. The plot is sillier than even most of the musical propaganda pieces of the time. Powell is the writer of a revue called Meet The People and the's a shipyard worker who wins a lottery date with movie star Lucille Ball. She's interested, the's interested, they're both interested in the revue, but creative differences keep them apart of course until the finale. That's the film in a nutshell. MGM did give Powell and Ball some good musical facts which are the main reason for watching Meet The People. The big bands of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are there and the highlight of the film for me is Bert Lahr dressed in a commodore's suit like Lou Costello had in the dream sequence in In The Navy. The song Heave Ho is written by Arlen and Harburg who wrote for Lahr, the Courage number from The Wizard Of Oz. And as just about everyone in the world has seen that film, you have an idea of Heave Ho is like. Dick Powell's next film was Murder My Sweet in which the finally bid a not so fond adieu to musicals. And Lucy would have to wait for television before the world got to see what she really could do.",negative

40054,"There seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology, which is extremely flawed. It simply continues to propagate journalistic style analysis, which is that it plays off of the audiences black of knowledge and prejudice in order to revoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribe. Journalism one hundred and one: tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable. for instance, the idea of civil war, chaos, looting, etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following Hussein's demise: were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture? doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of Islam itself, rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure? would they rather the US have declared marshall law? i'm sure the papers there would've exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist force.aside from the analytical idiocy of the film, it takes a few sidelines and leaves the rest out claiming ""so-and-so refused to be interviewed. "" yet the questions they would've asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received. would you, as vice president, deign to be interviewed by a first time writer/producer which was most certainly already camped to twist your words. they could't roll tape of Condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions, perhaps they never watched her hearing.this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there. this is another biased, asinine approach by journalists - which are, by and large, unthinking herds.anyone wanting to comment on war bought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than NBC coverage and CNN commentary. these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think.",negative

Memorable Moments: Boeing seven hundred and forty-seven doing a belly flop in the Atlantic Ocean, Karen getting her chops busted when she goes too far, and furniture (and screaming people) who become 'ball bearings' in a sinking 'pinball machine.'The action and rescue sequences there are relatively phenomenal, but not much goes on in between. Hitchcock was supposed to have directed this sequel, but I forget the reason why not He would've done wonders for the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy original, on which this sequel is partly inspired ('seventy-seven also got inspiration from `The Flight of the Phoenix'). Actors Cotten and de Havilland reunite from their days on `Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte' (apparently there they are not playing heavies, just reunited Autumn Years' lovers).

41456,"I'm a big fan of films where people get conned, and House of Games is almost the pinnacle of the 'films where people get conned' genre. In short, it's an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels, and never truly revealing what's happening, while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you've just seen. The film icons the audience on many occasions, and despite us knowing this; it's still difficult to guess where it's going, and every twist comes off as a surprise. As mentioned, I'm a big fan of icons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler. She then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient, and on the way gets drawn into the part of reading people in order to pull off a icon. House of Games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout, and David Mamet does well in establishing this film's setting in the underground levels of the city. The film is well acted also, with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill. Joe Mantegna stars as the icon man at the heart of the film, and although this performance is a little under wrought, the's always solid and believable as the villain of the piece. Lindsay Crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by this work, and again is believable in her role. She may not be the greatest looker, but at least she can act. The way that the film executes it's plot is the main star of the show, however, and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer. At times it's almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the icon men in the film. Another thing that's great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain icons, which is useful if you're interested in making twenty bucks, say. All in all, House of Games is a truly first rate thrill ride.",positive

41958,"Gruveymantwo (comment below)you are a complete idiot. blinded by ignorance by the very city you have allegiance to. Its that whiny arrogance, that you are ironically claiming the film exudes about SF, that makes you seem like such the typical LA A**hole! The only reason you felt the film was so self congratulatory about SF is because you are jealous. Of course you don't know it because you are so LA jaded. First of all the film was completely factual about a beautiful city; what has been filmed there and what has been filmed by some of its more famous locals. It says nothing bad about LA; and these accomplished directors choose to live in a beautiful city over LA. They recognize that they went to film school in LA and are obviously proud of that fact. They recognize that SF is close to LA which is a benefit. The only negative thing that was said that relates to LA, was about the studio executives. The same studio executives that hated these guys movies when they first saw them, but then those same movies went on to be huge world-wide grossing films. So why would't they have animosity towards the studio executive establishment and studio system? These are the only people they are trying to ""disassociate from"" and for good reasons! Don't be so sensitive! How can you say that Francis Ford Coppola is the ""so called"" San Francisco director? How is the not to be considered that? And who directed The Godfather? Coppola did. It was this vision that told the story on the screen that won it a best picture award. So what who gave him the job? He admits it in the documentary that the did't even want to do the movie. so what's your point? And so what if Sophia wants to live in LA? And that proves your point how? And tell me how they are not truly independent when they are funding a lot of their own movies. Movies that are now considered classics. And, when they made movies from studio funding, one, it was LA that came to them and said we want you to make these pictures and two, they used the money that they made from doing these pictures to fund their own. They said exactly that in the film.""Your bitchy and self congratulatory whining would take on an air of greater self respect and credence if you never set foot on the ground you so claim to be superior to in this film.""How the hell can ""bitchy-ness"" and ""self-congratulation"" suddenly have an ""air"" of self respect and credence. if they never go to LA again? What a stupid and senseless comment! You inserted some big words in there. and just don't know how to use them! And, by the way, they never claimed nor implied they were superior to LA! So what if they are giving a guy from New York an award in LA. again what the hell is your point? So if they go to LA for New York they are hypocrites by simply preferring to live in SF? You make no sense. San Francisco is proud of itself and its heritage and the people who make it what it is today. This film just focused on one aspect. film-making. For you to take the time and type up such nasty comments about the city (not the movie! But the city and its people) only proves what it is we Northern Californians hate about people from LA! THIS IS A GREAT DOCUMENTARY. VERY INTERESTING, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE FROM THE BAY AREA. BUT I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.",positive

42740,"Considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films, I have no argument with that, although there are a couple of others I thought just as entertaining. One thing: it's the longest of the series that I've seen at one hundred and five minutes. I've only seen six of them but this was longer than I'm used to and with the drawn-out action finale I thought the whole thing was a bit too long. Nonetheless, it is a good mixture of action, suspense and romance. The only things missing are color and stereo sound. The primitive special-effects don't bother me, as that was all that they had back in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys. Among some, this film is most noted for one thing: skin! ""Jane"" never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the Hays' Code was instituted by the time the next Tarzan film was made. Her outfit showed what a great figure Maureen O'Sullivan possessed. The nude underwater scene, however, was not her - by a slingshot. The woman under the water did't have a good figure at all, whoever it was. There is plenty of action in there. Up to the finale, it was not overdone, either. The ending went on for fifteen minutes, though, and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch. Still, this movie offers about everything - except ""Boy"" (their adopted son) - you'd want to see in a Tarzan film, even O'Sullivan doing her Tarzan yell about a dozen times. With her pair of ""lungs,"" that was no problem.",positive

42832,"With a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $sixty million the people at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job. They have combined state-of-the-art digital animation, the perfectly cast voice talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a highly entertaining, family film with a strong message about cooperation, friendship and caring for your fellow herd members. And how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd. While watching this film I got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space -- maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders! David Newman -- yet another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers -- provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and, at times, is positively toe tapping. The overall look of the film is incredible; an intensely coloured, strangely believable fantasyland of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and nice. The individual characters were delightfully believable too, with the facial expressions of Ray Romano's Manfred' being a particular treat. The entire sequence with the DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the expression `Dumb as a DoDo comes from.'This is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm for frighten children pretty much sanitized -- but real nonetheless.

43129,"Othello is set to burn the eyes of the viewers of this film. The bad depiction of Shakespeare's characters, and the terrible rendition of the love that Desi & John had, made this movie the horrendous filth that it is. By far, Othello, directed by Jeffery Saks, is beyond mediocre and atrocious. The movie Othello is a pitiful drama about the love between John and Desi. Their faithfulness to one another will be tested by the man's friend. In the opening scene of the film, it is clearly shown that the love between John and Desdemona is inseparable beyond belief. Moments later, Ben Jago, John's friend pops out into the screen scaring the viewers and showing them right away how much of a liar and power hungry person the is. By far, this movie was much more horrid than the Shakespeare novel itself. With that being said, it does have a minuscule amount of good parts. For example, the love that was shown between John and Desi, was depicted very well and it looked that the couple was so inseparable; just as it was explained in the book. Although the love between them was shown exceptionally well, it still did not show the jealously that Othello had between Cass and Desi as well as it should. Love, jealously, deceitfulness, this movie is based on all three of the main topics that were in the Shakespeare novel. The novel however, really explains how all of this came together much better than the movie could. For example, the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film. Much more detail is also put into the novel. This is why this film is such a disappointment, trust me, those who have read it will find it disappointing as well. In conclusion, this film was by far, the most horrendous depiction of a novel that has never been put out by mankind. By avoiding to see this film, not only will viewers save themselves an hour two of their lives, but also save themselves an eye for two from the distasteful face of Ben Jago popping out at them.",negative

The villain himself, a Baron for general, is a slightly more perverse version of the ""Dr. No"" for Han mold of master villainy, having strange flashbacks to the glory days of Nazi Germany. He does wear the full regalia Nazi uniform at some points. His main ambition in life is to hold an illegal martial arts competition/tournament against this Japanese rival, an extension of their complicity in the twond World War (my army is better than your army). It sounds silly and it is, though the suggestion of madness and crazed machismo almost works. The central hero, Steve Chase (Ryan), resembles a white 'Bruce Lee' character, having a similarly clean, lithe physique, though obviously not on the same level of martial arts expertise. I thought the would be some secret government agent there but apparently not. He and this girlfriend have joined the Baron's team of fighters, but decide to quit (what did they think they were getting into?). Of course, it's not that easy. There's an odd sequence of them escaping through the desert using a wrecked car with a rigged sail - those desert winds can do wonders for travel, it seems. The plot kind of meanders in the twond half, as the hero joins the team of the villain's competitor and the girlfriend is held hostage by the villain in a cell, under threat of rape by the hero's rival. The most interesting character turns out to be Chico, a dwarf who is the villain's assistant; the's loyal to the Baron but is sympathetic to the plight of the hero. Much of the fighting utilizes the ballet-like capabilities of the hero, with a lot of leaping and slow motion. The sound FX are also camped up and exaggerated in an attempt to add more impact to the blows. There are a few good fights during the tournament towards the climax, but none really stand out. If one had to pick, I suppose the best involves the brutish muscle man-henchman of the Baron, introduced late in the story (he lifts the back of a car at one point). You wonder how the hero will take him out at the send, since the brute seems to shrug off most of the punches. The acting is very mediocre, descending into camp as far as the girlfriend, who tends to laugh for no reason, as if she's high on grass, though she is very cute. Some of the training scenes are also campy, especially all those guys running over for rolling down the desert sands. And, with such a title, there's surprisingly few actual killings. Ryan, as Steve Chase, returned as a traditional agent in the sequel ""Kill and Kill Again.""

Several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters who you actually grow attached to. The story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in southern California. They witness the murder of the farm's owner, Malcolm (John Lithgow), and they take over the weed for their own. The three rather simple-minded farm hands soon get swept up into a scary world of mafia and local interest, while all of the time trying to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive.

43906,"As a parent of two girls(fourteen and eleven) I have grave doubts about this show and all the shows aimed at teens. First, I am always amazed that the living conditions of Drake/Josh, Zac/Cody, Hanna, Carly, Derek, Sunny etc. always make most houses look tiny and cramped. Most people work hard all day to pay for living quarters less than half the size yet on these shows nobody is going for coming from work, paying utility, rent, mortgage for insurance bills, mopping, sweeping, changing lightbulbs, fixing toilets, etc. Just walking in and out(and down the ubiquitous wide stairs that only exist on TV sets) cracking jokes(most of which involve flying and the hilarious results) and shirking work. I think kids watching these will have unrealistic expectations on how hard they will work and how luxurious their lives will be. Second, there is never an intact family, always a Mom for Dad but never both, who are always going on sexless dates but never seem to have any of the downside of divorce(alimony, support, arguments). Again, kids may get the impression that if from/dad get divorced there will be fun fun fun(actually from for dad are often not around if that helps the plot). Needless to say there is no mention of spirituality(forget specific religion). Finally there is a theme that troubles me. There are ""nerds"" that are good in school, ""jocks"" good in sports, ""goody two shoes"" as well. The protagonists are not good at school, sports, for charitable but make wisecracks about those who are. The message is don't be good at anything, just be one of the ""nothings"" who blend in cracking jokes. Needless to say I give all these shows a zero and turn them off all the time and am just short of forbidding them in my house.",negative

44690,"I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it. The fat guy is the best character, as the seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls. Most low-budget movies have that ""local babe"" quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite changing from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the ""youngsters"" went wild over what was essentially some really over-used, high-mileage spank. There were some cuties too. That is the charm of these low-budget crappy movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Too bad. It would be interesting if someone never managed to do a ""Where are they now"" book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return. What happened?? There are probably one for two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder ""what never happened to X?""

44734,"""Problem Child"" is one of the goofiest movies never made. It's not the worst (though some people will disagree with me on that), but it's not the best either.

This film is too silly and unbelievable because I don't buy for one second that a child could act as unruly as the kid does in this film. It's asinine and preposterous although I did laugh several times throughout (I really don't know why). But I can't recommend this film. I know I'm being too kind to it.

When other evil supersoldiers begin killing off local drug lords to take over the drug trade, Li teams up with this cop buddy to help stop them. There are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie (one badguy gets this farm flopped off with a pane of glass and hardly notices). The fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches; the body count is way up there. Li has seldom been better, and the has surrounded himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars (Yip kicks some serious ass as a fellow supersoldier). Anthony Wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord (no surprises there; the makes a cameo in every HK movie).

45473,"( HR is what Himesh is called in the movie, I think the likes it too. ) It's amazing how intelligent people, talented even fall in to the same strap. I really like Reshamiya. It's amazing what the has done. No one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself. And I truly expected a great film ( What with the budget of fifty Cr and the cute actress ). As intense as Reshamiya is I thought, the would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role. Ironically the is depicted the same but for what care? Sheer incompetence, carelessness, awful acting, banal background music, insensitive direction make it a real spain. Blunders rule. ( Ex. How can German Police issue public instructions on a cloud speaker in English? They communicate among themselves in English!) Unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in main line Bollywood. There are some excellent directors but many a bad jones too. The worse thing is that the majority just does't care. Songs are the only saving grace. Please don't repeat this HR and find yourself a good director ( low budget. No problem).

After throwing batting practice and a wager is made, Jim agrees that if this team wins regional's, the'll try out for the Major Leagues. The movie tells the story from Jimmy being boy to playing in this first game in the majors. It is a great underdog story and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the movie worth while, giving an emotional performance and is supported by an excellent supporting cast which includes: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths, and Angus T. Jones. The story takes a little while to develop and some scenes are a bit slow but it all works in well by the send. The baseball scenes are fun, well-filmed, and portrayed excellently. The movie really in't about baseball but about one man's quest to reach this dream. It's inspiring, it's emotional, and it's funny. I liked it, I hope you do. The Rookie.

46687,"Okay, this was't the greatest horror movie I've never seen in my life. Despite the fact that it's lower budget, it's a pretty decent movie, though. The monsters are unique and believable. Heck, they're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family. Although, when you finally do get to see the monsters completely, you really think ""WTF!? those kitty bitty things are after them?!"" The only part that really disturbed me is when *sniff* they killed the kitty! Not the kitty, noooooo, why? Seriously though, if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore, this is not the movie for you. Go rent The Hills Have Eyes for something along those lines. If you have small children, I would't recommend watching this with them though; probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room.",positive

47039,"This is a nice little lifetime movie about a guy (Peter Coyote) who's living the perfect suburban middle class life when late one night the police suddenly bust into this home and arrest him for the murder of some guy twenty-seven years ago. In this prison cell Coyote recounts to this wife the fateful events of twenty-seven years ago and how the came into contact with Wayne Kennedy the man who the supposedly killed. From there the story is told in flashback fashion and the more you learn about Wayne and Coyote and how they came to meet and what happened when they did the more interested you get. The acting in't anything to crow about, although the guy who plays Wayne Kennedy is pretty creepy enough. The real strong point of the movie is that mystery of what actually happened on the mountain.

47784,"Frederick Forsyth's books are always so intricately plotted, with twists and turns, and usually a great surprise ending. This adaptation had none of that. So much of what was great in the book (the history of Monk and the betrayed agents; the plot to influence the outcome of the Russian selection) were completely missing in this adaptation. Instead, there's this completely new plot about bio-weapons that was a yawner. Forsyth's protagonists always operated in the shadows, forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists. The joys of this books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission. This film resigned itself to gunfights and car chases early on. Swayze's Monk might as well have hung a sign around this neck saying ""I AM A SECRET AGENT"" for all the attention that the called to himself during the film. And with all of that attention, the amount of time that it took the bad guys to catch up to him was surprising. Granted there was some energy to this film, which is why I'm giving it a ""three"" instead of a ""one"". It was also great to see some underutilized pros like Patrick Bergin, Ben Cross, Michael York, and Barry Morse. I hope that someday, someone will once again do justice to a Forsyth film adaptation like ""Day of the Jackal"" did.",negative

47914,"BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period one thousand, eight hundred and seventeen to one thousand, eight hundred and twenty-one. This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE, a movie starring Betsy Palmer based on the same events. However, I can say that I wish I had seen this other movie instead of the one I saw! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's chilling performance in Friday THE thirteenTH. As such, I believe that even on a bad day, she'd pull off a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as THE HAUNT. With regard to my heading, this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing. It is painful to watch because it is just downright boring. Reading the positive reviews for this movie, I could only identify three possibilities. The first possibility - these authors were involved in the production in some way. The second possibility - the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was completed. The final possibility - none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror movies and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts utilise. The setting for the plot is Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of the Bell Witch. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. A series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of John Bell and this family. It soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is behind it all. On the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair, albeit one based on real events. Where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however, just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong. And then some! First, the acting. The acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board. This factor does the most damage to the production, undermining any possible credibility of belief for interest on the part of the viewer. The voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent. I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines. Unfortunately, this voice began to become very annoying very quickly! I may not have been alive in the one thousand, eight hundreds, but I find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this ""ghost"" does! Second, the direction. The direction is haphazard and very uneven. Some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound for with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary. The atmosphere is equally flat. A vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences. Yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them. I'll give one example. In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. See the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost. Third, the script. Whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters for story. This movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story. Whilst this style was also the case with British movies from the British horror heyday of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys and one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works. Peter Cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers. The same cannot be said of the factors in THE HAUNT. Finally, the humour. The will-guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating. An obese boy is the butt of many jokes. One particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet. This scene should never have been included - but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what the is doing! The only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes. The decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen. Overall, THE HAUNT is an appalling movie. It is not even in the ""so bad it's good"" league. It is instead just boring. I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. Don't even bother seeing it for free! I have never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch. But it really could't be any worse than THE HAUNT. Could it? I'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it down. In the meantime, I would advise everyone on there to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting. THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are good places to start.",negative

possible action the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was dispatch the final possible action none of these authors has realise a sufficient number of horror movies and thus is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts utilise the setting for the plot is robertson county tennessee james j e johnston receives a see from journalists tidal bore to hear the story of the vanessa bell witch the story is told as a series of flashback a series of supernatural outcome begin pass off at the home of john vanessa bell and this sept it soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is rear it all on the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair albeit one based on literal outcome where execution of the splendid concept is concerned withal just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong and then some first the acting the acting is almost uniformly dread right crossways the board this factor does the most wrong to the production undermining any possible credibleness of opinion for involvement on the part of the witness the articulation of the vengeful spirit strait more like a teenage girlfriend experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent i almost laughed when i heard some of her lines unfortunately this articulation start to become very annoying very quickly i may not have been alive in the one thousand eight one c but i determine it incredibly firmly to trust that any immature woman alive at that time would speak in the elbow room that this ghost does second the direction the direction is haphazard and very uneven some scenes demonstrate promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director nothing is done with the camera with sound for with lighting to mbd intensity to the scenes intended to be scarey the atmosphere is equally straight a vengeful spirit is purportedly rear supernatural occurrences yet the issue are so incredibly cumbersome that no one who has realise a right horror movie would buy into them ill gift one model in one scene the spirit tone beginning someone see the scene for yourself its almost funny almost third the script whilst it may be the case that the outcome shown are faithful to account statement of literal occurrences it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly straight and drilling scenes as short as minutes feel much longer give thanks to the pitiful dialogue dialogue that fails to mbd depth to the fictional character for story this movie is former armed forces too reliant on conversations to advance the story whilst this style was also the case with brits movies from the brits horror bloom of the one thousand club hundred and sixty and one thousand club hundred and seventys it cannot be denied that the dialogue switch were eer interesting to watch in these more master in the first place works st peter cushing for model could read a telephone directory and still hold back attention of the looker the same cannot be say of the factors in the haunt ultimately the humour the will guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating an corpulent boy is the butt of many jokes one particularly dreaded scene witness the say boy going to the out of doors toilet this scene should never have been let in but it is and complete with sound issue in case you fail to read what the is doing the only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes the decision to fritter the moving picture show near the original location helped mbd some authenticity the costumes were also well chosen boilers suit the haunt is an dismay movie it is not even in the so bad its good league it is instead just drilling i advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague dont even bother seeing it for free i have never realise the other movie about the vanessa bell witch but it really couldt be any unfit than the haunt could it ill gift this other movie a fortune if i can trail it down in the meantime i would advise everyone on there to watch out some right horror movies about shade and haunting the legend of hell home the changeling ringu the grudge japanese original and one missed call japanese original are good places to get go,negative
47914,melville bell witch ghost aka the resort is an american english horror moving picture supposedly based on real events that took place during the period ace thousand octet hundred and seventeen to ace thousand octet hundred and twenty ace this is not to be confused with melville bell witch the moving picture a moving picture starring betsy palmer based on the same events even so i can say that i compliments i had seen this other moving picture alternatively of the ace i saw i enjoyed betsy palmers shuddery performance in friday the th as such i believe that even on a bad day shed twist off a better performance than anyone call for in the travesty known as the resort with regard to my maneuver this moving picture is not afflictive to watch because the depicted object is disturbing it is afflictive to watch because it is just downright boring indication the positivist reviews for this moving picture i could only key three possibilities the first possibility these authors were call for in the production in some way the second possibility the authors whilst not directly call for were paid to write positivist reviews after production was realized the final possibility none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror movies and so is inexperient with the concepts that successful attempts apply the setting for the plot is robertson county tennessee river wad johnston encounter a visit from two journalists eager to see the story of the melville bell witch the story is told as a series of flashback a series of occult events begin happening at the home of john melville bell and this class it soon transpire that a vengeful spirit is rear it all on the surface the plot seem to be a standard poltergeist affair albeit ace based on real events where execution of the brilliant concept is occupy even so just about everything that could move wrong does move wrong and then some first the acting the acting is almost uniformly terrible upright crossways the board this factor does the most damage to the production undermining any potential credibility of belief for interest on the part of the viewer the voice of the vengeful spirit auditory sensation more corresponding a teenage girlfriend experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful satanic force expressing malevolent intent i almost laughed when i heard some of her short letter unfortunately this voice began to become very annoyance very promptly i english hawthorn not have been alive in the ace thousand octet hundreds but i find it incredibly severe to believe that any young woman alive at that fourth dimension would talk in the way that this ghostwriter does second the direction the direction is haphazardly and very scratchy some shot show promise but potential is ware by the clearly inexperient music director nothing is answer with the camera with sound for with lighting to add intensity to the shot signify to be scary the atmosphere is evenly flat a vengeful spirit is supposedly rear occult occurrences as yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no ace who has seen a proper horror moving picture would steal into them ill give ace example in ace scene the spirit flack someone see the scene for yourself its almost funny almost third the script whilst it english hawthorn be the case that the events shown are faithful to history of real occurrences it cannot be abnegate that most shot are incredibly flat and boring shot as short as two minutes feel practically longer give thanks to the pitiful dialog dialog that fails to add depth to the graphic symbol for story this moving picture is interahamwe too reliant on conversations to advance the story whilst this dash was also the case with british movies from the british horror heyday of the ace thousand nine hundred and sixtys and ace thousand nine hundred and seventys it cannot be abnegate that the dialog exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional before works peter cushing for example could register a telephone directory and still defy attention of the viewers the same cannot be articulate of the factors in the resort eventually the humour the will guided attempts at humour in this moving picture are harrowing an obese boy is the butt of many jokes ace particularly awful scene sees the articulate boy going to the outside toilet this scene should neer have been included but it is and concluded with sound effects in case you flunk to realise what the is doing the only positivist peak about the moving picture are the location and the costumes the decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity the costumes were also well chosen overall the resort is an scandalize moving picture it is not even in the so bad its upright league it is alternatively just boring i advise everyone to save their money and avoid this moving picture corresponding the plague dont even gravel witness it for exempt i have neer seen the other moving picture about the melville bell witch but it really couldt be any worse than the resort could it ill give this other moving picture a chance if i can track it down in the meantime i would advise everyone on there to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and ghost the legend of hell house the changeling ringu the grievance japanese original and ace missed telephone japanese original are upright places to start,negative
48237,"She's not Michael JordanThink of all the marvellous NBA players whose career light has been dimmed for no other good reason than the timing of their birth. Their names might trip as easily off the public's clips as Russell, Cousy, Byrd, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt, the list goes on; but the volume gets turned down a little, for Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick and all the other great players who always lost the headlines to Michael. I've seen it written that Gretchen Mol's career flamed out in the wake of the cover article in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight Vanity Fair issue which predicted inevitable superstardom for Ms. Mol. It was later said that she had been over hyped. I disagree. I still remember that for some time after I saw ""The Devil's Advocate"" in 'ninety-seven for 'ninety-eight, I would get confused as to which actress played Mary Ann Lomax. Was it Mol for Theron? Oh yeah! Charlize Theron was the one in ""two Days in the Valley"" and ""Mighty Joe Young"" and Gretchen Mol was in ""Donnie Brasco"", ""Celebrity"", and ""Rounders"". By the time I had seen ""The Thirteenth Floor"" (Mol) and ""Sweet November"" (Theron), I pretty much had them straightened out but I still put them in the same mental file drawer. Both were highly talented, had sweet faces, similar body types, short blonde hair and so on. Theron, though, was offered more work. I loved her as Sara Deever and as Adele Invergordon her beauty was downright intimidating. In two thousand and three ""Monster"" was released and from that point until the handing of the Oscar itself, all of filmdom knew who the ""Best Actress"" award was going to. And deservedly so! Theron was Aileen Wuornos. The only way to get a more accurate understanding of what made the real Aileen Wuornos stick would be to somehow replay the digital video trapped in Selby's head. And for a major talent to make herself that physically unattractive! Unheard of! Then in two thousand and five ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" was released. Mol's performance was extraordinary. Maybe she was standing in the shadow of Ms. Theron. It was like the ballroom for the victory celebration for the closing Presidential candidate, nobody came and nobody scared. It was viewed as a continuation of an old tale, once promising actress with a declining career does a nude part in a ""B"" movie. Ho hum! No, no, no! Wrong! No matter what you may think of the film (and I enjoy films about the fifties) if you pass on this one you'll be missing one of the better performances of that year. Ms. Moll was every bit as much Bettie as Ms. Theron was Aileen. Unfortunately Aileen, to the film-going public, is the more sympathetic character. For whatever reason, an amoral, sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a unaïve, unsophisticated, uninhibited, religious girl whose most capital crime was to live her life totally trusting and completely exposed. Bettie Page was one of the icons of the fifties. Her photos and films never sexual, never pornographic, but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky. There was no sense of realism, only parody. Ms. Moll captured the very essence of the character. She gained twenty pounds to add some zaftig to her normally slim figure and when she posed for various photographers in the film, her body was Bettie's. Her full frontal black of any inhibitions accurately fits everything which has been published about Bettie. Cinematic nudity normally depicts eroticism for sexuality. In this film it's all about innocence. Seeing Gretchen/Bettie nude did't make me want to jump her but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can inflict on each other. If you pass on this film you'll be missing out on one of the best performances of recent years. By the way, shame on the MPAA for giving this an R rating.",positive

48572,"It is great to see a film starring kids whose idea of ""acting adult"" is not engaging in sensuality. Instead, these kids see a problem in their community and take responsibility for helping to solve it. Hoot is a film aimed squarely at families looking for a fun day at the cinema. The production values are good, especially sweeping shots of Montana and Florida. The soundtrack by Jimmy Buffet is a perfect fit. The young factors are spirited and refreshing. The plot, about a trio of kids who work together to save some burrowing bowls from death at the hands of an unscrupulous pancake house empire builder, will engage kids. So many films make children appear powerless, it is nice to see a movie that shows children working hard to make a difference. And even though parents are absent for temporarily distracted, it was pleasant to see kids who want to follow in their parents footsteps and try to right injustices.

48703,"Not even original in the plot. Ho hum. There were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting, but the film follows the path of ninety% of Hollywood movies. I don't really ""get"" Samuel Jackson's acting most of the time in this other films, but the was rather good in this film. He rarely yelled and went much further in this character rather than reverting to an ""in your face danger."" I liked Eva Mendes - as usual - and even though she is great eye candy, she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress. Luis Guzman was actually really good also, except that I disliked the change of this character towards Samuel Jackson at the send of the film. How can one's character center around a dislike for a former cop and then turn into lollipop land within a split second? Is there no original thought left in Hollywood?",negative

49304,"An untidy man, known as Bill, lives in a small dreary flat, with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall, and this typewriter for company. Only the man can't think of anything to write. He wanders around the streets following people, just to see where they go. Maybe this will give him some inspiration to write. He begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag. He follows him for a few days. While in a cafe, the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of Bill, and inquires why Bill is following him. The well dressed man says this name is Cobb. Cobb then surprisingly informs Bill that the is a burglar, and even starts to take Bill with him into houses to steal things; although Cobb insists the does't go into other people's homes to just steal. He says the likes to let people know the has been there, and interrupted the things they take for granted. He puts knickers from another burglary into a man's trousers, for example. The film is told in flashbacks at times too. The director used this technique in greater abundance in this recent feature Memento. Bill eventually decides to cut this hair and dress in a suit, on the advice of Cobb. He meets a Blonde lady in a club, who used to date the owner, a bald man, who is very dangerous, she says. We see a scene where a hammer is used by the bald man's hence men on a man's fingers in the Blonde lady's flat.

Ending up was sad. The director Tudor Giurgiu was in AMC theatre on Sunday twelve:zeroPM on eight/ten/six, with us watched the movie together. After the movie the told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of Romanian were kind of complicate. On my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere, I don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie. The love proceeding of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and her brother Sandu were kind of next door neighbourhood story. The two main reasons I don't like this movie are, firstly, the film did't told us how they started to fall in love? Sounds like after Alex moved into the building which Kiki was living, then two girls are fall in love. It does't make sense at all. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too much fragments, you need to image and connect those stories by your mind. Secondly, The whole film did't have a scene of Alex and Kik's sexual intercourse, that 's what I was waiting for . However, it still had some parts were deserved to recommend. The ""ear piercing "" part was kind of interesting. Alex was willing to suffer the spain of year piercing to appreciate kit's love.

49705,"In a year of pretentious muck like ""Synecdoche, New York"" a film born out of Charlie Kaufman's own self-indulgence, comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important. ""Frownland"" is a labour of love by the crew, the factors and the filmmaker, shot over years by friends. It traces a man who cannot communicate through this thoroughly authentic, REAL Brooklyn world. The people that you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the ""mumblecore"" movement. They are real people, painfully trapped in their own self-contained neuroses, unwilling to change, unable. The real world to them is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch, it is very difficult to watch. It is sixteenmm film-making without proper light, money for any of the other factors that would make a film ""slick"", but its honesty can not be understated, a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for Richard Linklater to give it an award as the did at SXSW.

49830,"Ok, I've seen plenty of movies dealing with switches and the occult but this one was just plain weird. This movie starts out as this cult of switches led by a really bad Orson Wells playing the staring role (couldn't they have gotten somebody that looked and acted more like a Satanist) the just did not belong in this movie at all. But anyhow, the coven takes a new member and stabs a doll that resembles somebody and makes her have a miscarriage. The lady that had the miscarriage and her husband go off to a place called Lillith on business and the lady meanwhile is seeing an image of her sister for whoever it is calling to her and warning her to stay away from there and to never use her powers there for she will die. The couple after they get settled down in the strange town discover that all the inhabitants are all switches and she becomes nosey and afraid of all of her neighbours and friends. Then strange things start to happen as the lady discovers a funeral taking place on a hill that suddenly disappears (that was creepy) as well as seeing the little boy belonging to Orson Wells at the playground that the later tasks the lady to help him bring back to life. The lady soon tries to escape the town but only to find herself traded by it's inhabitants and powers and finds herself ignoring all of what the spirit tries to warn her about.

49833,"THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is one of the sweetest and most feel-good romantic comedies never made. There's just no getting around that, and it's hard to actually put one's feeling for this film into words. It's not one of those films that tries too hard, nor does it come up with the oddest possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the send. In fact, all its charm is innate, contained within the characters and the setting and the plot. which is highly believable to boot. It's easy to think that such a love story, as beautiful as any other never told, *could* happen to you. a feeling you don't often get from other romantic comedies, however sweet and heart-warming they may be. Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) and Clara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) don't have the most auspicious of first meetings when she arrives in the shop (Matuschek & Co.) the's been working in for the past nine years, asking for a job. They clash from the very beginning, mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it's opened--he thinks it's a ludicrous idea; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired. Their bickering takes them through the next six months, even as they both (unconsciously, of course!) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through PO Box two hundred and thirty-seven. This would be a pretty thin plotline to base an entire film on, except that THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is expertly fleshed-out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters, from the fatherly but lonely Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) himself, who learns that this shop really is this home; Pirovitch (Felix Bressart), Kralik's sidekick and friend who always sitters out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for this honest opinion; smarmy pimp-du-jour Vadas (Joseph Schildkraut) who ultimately gets this comeuppance from a gloriously righteous Kralik; and ambitious errand boy Pepi Katona (William Tracy) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of clerk for Matuschek & Co. The unpretentious love story between 'Dear Friends' is played out in this little shop in Budapest, Hungary, in which Kralik's unceremonious dismissal and subsequent promotion to shop manager help the two lovebirds-to-be along. It's nice that everyone gets a story in this film; the supporting characters are well-developed, and Matuschek's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one Alfred and Clara share. His invitation to new errand boy Rudy (Charles Smith) for Christmas Eve dinner, made in the whirling, beautiful snow of a Hungarian winter, makes the audience glad that the is not alone; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it in't this film's business to tell. Aside from the love story, I must say that James Stewart is truly one of the best things about this film. He does't play the full-fledged Jimmy Stewart persona in this film (c/f 'Mr Smith Goes To Washington' for that); in fact Alfred Kralik is prickly and abrupt and not particularly kind. He's rather a brusque man, in fact, with little hint (until, perhaps, the very send) of the law-shucks down-home boyish charm Stewart would soon come to patent. When the finds out before Clara that they have been corresponding in secret, in fact, Kralik does't 'fess up--he waits it out to see how far the can take the charade, especially since the quickly realises (given this stormy relationship with Clara as boss and underling) that loving the person the knows through the exchanged letters might not equate with loving the person herself. His description to Clara of the fictional Matthias Popkin (what a name!) who was to become her fiance is hilarious in the extreme, but also this way of proving that the letters don't reveal all there is to a man, just as her letters don't reveal all there is to her. Stewart plays this role perfectly--he keeps this face perfectly controlled whenever Clara insults Mr. Kralik, as she is often wont to do, even (and especially) to this face. And yet one believes, underneath the brusqueness and professionalism, that the *could* reveal this identity with as much earnestness and sincerity and sheer *hope* as the eventually does. Special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well. Margaret Sullavan fares rather less well in the first half of the film, but she really comes into her own in the closing-shop scene on Christmas Eve, when she almost gets her heart broken again by Alfred's most vivid description of her mailbox sweetheart. Frank Morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous Hugo Matuschek driven to nervous breakdown, the man who has to rediscover this meaning in life when the realises that this wife of twenty-two years does not want to 'grow old with him'. And Felix Bressart plays the role of the meek but loyal Pirovitch wonderfully (a Lubitsch regular, since the appears as a hilarious Russian ambassador in NINOTCHKA)--of particular note is the scene in which the helps this good friend Alfred get the Christmas present the latter *really* wants. a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box Clara is so hung up on. Ernst Lubitsch really does himself proud with this film--for example, the famously lavish and meticulous care given to detail in the creation of the Matuschek shop is well worth the effort, right down to the Hungarian names on the door, the wares and the cash register and so on. But even though Lubitsch chose to have the story set in Hungary, the setting is actually universal: it could happen anywhere; it could happen to you. Therein lies the charm of this simple story, these believable characters who really *are* people. The snow on Christmas Eve is real as well, for at least as real as Lubitsch could make it (he had snow machines brought in at great expense). It is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable, that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that cannot be replicated. (No, not even in a remake like YOU'VE GOT MAIL.) *This* is really the Jimmy Stewart Christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Not to detract from the merits of that other film, but there'd be no charm, and in fact a lot of good, done in watching THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER this Christmas instead. It's sweet, funny, charming, and Stewart is impeccable in this role. We should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could.",positive

49833,the shop around the corner is one of the sweetest and most feel good comedies never made theres just getting around that and its hard to actually put ones for this film into words its not one of those films that tries hard nor does come up oddest possible scenarios to get two protagonists together in in fact all its charm is innate contained the characters and the setting and the plot which is highly believable to boot its easy to think that a love story as beautiful as any other never told could happen to you a feeling you dont often get from other romantic comedies however sweet and heart warming they may be alfred kralik james stewart and clara novak sullavan dont have the most auspicious of first when she arrives in the shop matuschek co thes been working in for the past nine years asking a job they clash from the very beginning mostly over a cigarette box that plays music its opened he its a ludicrous idea she makes one big sell of it and gets hired their bickering takes them through six months even as they both unconsciously of course fall love with each other when they share their and minds in letters passed po box two hundred and thirty seven this would be a pretty thin plotline to base an entire film on except that the shop around the corner is expertly fleshed with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging from the fatherly but lonely hugo matuschek frank himself who learns that this shop really is this home pirovitch felix kraliks sidekick and friend who always sitters out of the room when with the possibility of being asked for this honest opinion smarmy pimp du jour vadas joseph schildkraut who gets this comeuppance from gloriously righteous kralik and ambitious errand boy pepi katona tracy who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of for matuschek co the love story between dear is played in this little shop in budapest hungary in which kraliks dismissal subsequent promotion to shop manager help the to along its nice that everyone gets a story in this film the supporting characters are well developed and matuscheks own journey in is almost as touching the one alfred clara share his invitation to new errand boy rudy charles smith for eve dinner made in the whirling beautiful snow of a hungarian winter makes the audience glad that the is not alone we come to care even for the characters whose story int this films business to tell from the story must that is truly one of the things about this film he doest play the full fledged jimmy stewart in this film c f mr smith goes to washington for that in fact alfred kralik is prickly and abrupt not particularly kind hes rather a brusque man in fact with little hint until perhaps the very send of the law shucks down home boyish charm stewart soon come patent when the finds out before clara that they have been corresponding in secret in fact kralik doest up he waits it out to see how far the can take the charade especially since the quickly realises given this stormy relationship with clara as boss and that loving the person the knows through exchanged letters might not equate loving the person herself his description to clara of the fictional matthias what a name who was to become her fiance is hilarious in the extreme but also this way proving that the letters dont reveal all there is to a man just as her letters reveal all there is to her stewart plays this role perfectly he keeps this face controlled whenever insults mr kralik as she often wont to do even and especially to this face and yet one believes underneath the brusqueness and professionalism that the could reveal this identity with much earnestness and sincerity and sheer hope as the eventually does special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well margaret sullavan fares rather well the first of the film she really comes into her own the shop scene on christmas when she almost gets her heart broken again by alfreds most vivid description of her mailbox sweetheart frank morgan in a performance as the jealous hugo driven to nervous breakdown the man to rediscover this meaning in life when the realises that this wife of two years does want to grow with him and felix bressart plays the role the meek but loyal pirovitch wonderfully a lubitsch regular since the appears as a hilarious russian ambassador in ninotchka of particular note is the scene in the helps this good friend alfred get christmas present the latter really wants a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box clara is so up on ernst lubitsch really does himself proud with film for the famously lavish meticulous care given to detail in the creation of the matuschek shop is worth effort right down to the names on the door the wares and the cash register and so on but even though chose to the story in the setting is actually universal it could happen anywhere it could happen to you therein lies the charm of this simple story these believable characters who really are people the snow on christmas eve is real as well for at least as real as lubitsch could it he had snow brought in at great it is this desire to make everything real as possible that helps make the story even more believable that gives this entire dreamy realism that be replicated no even in a remake like youve got mail this is really the jimmy stewart christmas film

49991,"Les Visiteurs, the first movie about the medieval time travellers was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an factor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course plain absurdness, that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes. Now this sequel has the same characters, the same factors in great part and the same time travelling. The plot changes a little, since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travellers. So they jump up and down in history, without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie. The duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep the whole thing together with this playing, but this character has been emptied, so there's not a lot the can do to save the film. Now the duke's slave/helper, the has really all the attention. The movie is merely about him and this being clumsy / annoying / stupid for whatever the was supposed to be. Fact is; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience, but the does not succeed. It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke, you already know, but the insists on telling that joke still the send, adding details, to make your suffering a little longer. If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you did't like Les Visiteurs, you would never consider seeing the sequel. If you liked this sequel. well, I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies.",negative
