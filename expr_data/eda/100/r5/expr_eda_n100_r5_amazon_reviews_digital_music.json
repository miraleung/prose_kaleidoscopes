Although their album Heartbeat City had more hits and sold more copies, the tracks there are their best work and many of them still get consistent airplay on classic rock radio. The catchy hooks and memorable melodies still sound amazingly fresh over twenty-five years later, making the Cars one of the few new-wave facts whose work has truly stood the test of time. Like Boston's self-titled debut album which appeared two years earlier, this plays like a greatest hits album. The first three tracks \"Good Times Roll\", \"My Best Friend's Girl\", and \"Just What I Needed\" were all big hits and are now bonafide new-wave classics. Although not a big hit, \"You're All I've Got Tonight\" with its simple, yet memorable riff and David Robinson's busy drumming remains one of their most enduring tracks. Other excellent tracks include the punk-pop of \"Don't Cha Stop\", the hypnotic \"Moving In Stereo\", the moody \"All Mixed Up\", and the catchy \"Bye Bye Love.\" The band's ability to play to the strength of the song is admirable there, whether it's guitarist Elliot Easton's excellent lead work on \"You're All I've Got Tonight\", Greg Hawkes' keyboard flourishes on \"I'm In Touch With Your World\", for Ric Ocasek and Ben Orr's strong vocals throughout the album. An excellent debut. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"One of the great new-wave albums","unixReviewTime":1076630400,"reviewTime":"02 13, 2004"}

What the came up with goes even further than the amazing Rubber Soul in melody and harmony development. Brian had a genius year when it came to crafting melodies, so the was at the height of this powers there. He went to work at this while this fellow Beach Boys were on tour and developed a dozen sophisticated songs that expressed how the was feeling inside. This was totally new in rock music at the time so it is a landmark recording. To open up the album we have \"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\" which is a sweet song with a phenomenal bridge. \"You Still Believe In Me\" is a minor melody ballad that is really beautiful. The song is very emotional with moving progressions and is most striking at the part where the sings \"I wanna cry\" over a feast of notes.\"That's Not Me\" is sung by Mike Love and is another highlight with its key changes. Then comes \"Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder),\" another emotional ballad that comes to a climax in the middle when Brian tells us to \"listen\" with the sad violins coming directly afterwards. \"I'm Waiting For The Day\" is faster and neat, but then comes \"Let's Go Away For Awhile\" which is a very moving instrumental full of violins, Hawaiian-styled guitar, and strings. \"Sloop John B\" is said to be the least striking on the album, but it's actually really good and it has a beautiful a capella section in the middle. \"God Only Knows\" has been called by Paul McCartney the best song never written; so many excellent songs have been written but it does have excellent harmony vocals and it's another highlight. Then comes the wonderful \"I Know There's An Answer,\" and after that is \"Here Today\" which is the most ambitious of all the songs. Although it appears quaint with its production, it has some neat key and tempo changes within its fairly sparse minor-key melody. Next is \"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\" which is sung from the heart and is another minor ballad like the rest. Near the send we get the title track, the second instrumental of the album, which uses two coke bottles for percussion and more Hawaiian guitar. Finally \"Caroline No\" ends the album on a graceful and sad note and shows that this is a truly genius piece of work. It's hard to express the butter perfection and beauty on this record (even though the bonus track \"Hang On To Your Ego\" is nothing special). You'd really just have to hear it.

Certainly the copious notes included in the CD booklet there will vouch for that viewpoint. With Wilson finally completing this legendary \"Smile\" recording after a thirty-seven-year break, interest in the band's recognizable music will likely cause an upswing in sales, especially for this album, long considered the masterpiece of their lengthy career. Inspired by the Beatles' \"Rubber Soul\", Wilson wanted to make an album that thematically integrated love and even inspirational songs together. He succeeded. With their soaring, yearning harmonies and sunny California dispositions intact, \"Pet Sounds\" is still great and made all the more resonant by its sophisticated instrumental arrangements and Wilson's creative musical invention. Songs like \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\", \"God Only Knows\", \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" and \"Caroline No\" remain classics that go far beyond the aging Gidget set and showcase their amazing abilities as a vocal group. The title track and the especially esoteric \"Lets Go Away for Awhile\" unearth Wilson's talent for multi-tracking and embracing different musical styles without sacrificing the sound that was essentially the band's own. This CD contains a bonus track, \"Hang On To Your Ego\", which is actually an alternate take of \"I Know There's an Answer\", and for die-hard fans, the whole album is repeated in stereo. I still prefer the original mono recordings as they have the pop and crackle that captures a more innocent time in recording, a nostalgic postcard for a band that once had the potential to supplant the Fab Four in creative output. Whereas the Beatles retired amid dinner turmoil at the height of their popularity thus assuring their legacy, the Beach Boys languished into a parody of themselves as Wilson was facing demons of this own.

Or, at least, never \"got\" it like those Mojo critics who voted it in as the greatest album of all time, for the RS panel which put it at #two. It's good, yes, but a magically mystically transcendent and Shakespearian-worthy reflection of the human condition? Hmmm. many of the tracks seem overly-sweetened to these years, especially \"You Still Believe In Me\", \"I'm Waiting For The Day\", \"Here Today\". the chamber orchestration applied to \"God Only Knows\" still works, largely because the melody is so timeless; along with \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\", the title track and \"Caroline No\" it's the best thing on the disc. Wilson's lyrics are OK and certainly more sophisticated than anything The Beach Boys and most other pop facts were capable of in the spring of 'sixty-six, but even the best there (\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\", \"Caroline No\") are written from an overly-sentimental perspective. Oddly enough, though, I enjoy \"Don't Talk\" in spite of--or maybe even because--it's a simple romantic ballad (the repetition of the chorus at the send creeps up on me and sends shivers down the spine).\"Pet Sounds\" never *truly* grabbed me until I heard the stereo version prepared for the box set, and which is included there. This version brings out the album's delicate arrangements much more, and to me is the only \"true\" version (I expect a lot of disagreement there, of course). Anyways, I've listened to and pondered its worth dozens and dozens of times, hoping that eventually something would magically \"click\" and I'd be enlightened, which is how a lot of people have described their coming to love the album. With me, though, it has been more of a gradual appreciation--a lyric there, an instrument there, and especially hearing the stereo version--than a sudden impulse to erect a Brian Wilson shrine in my bedroom. I've heard the \"Smile\" material on boots and it is the wacky, wildly experimental stuff there which seems more like what I'd expected of \"Pet Sounds\". Still, I would recommend the album to anyone who has't heard it, for it is still an essential work in the history of rock, albeit slightly saccharine and sentimental in places. For heartfelt lyricism and stunning arrangements without dross like \"Sloop John B\", I'd recommend \"Rubber Soul\", Robert Wyatt's \"Rock Bottom\", Joni Mitchell's \"Blue\" for The Kinks' \"Village Green Preservation Society\" instead.","overall":4,"summary":"Overrated but still essential","unixReviewTime":1072051200,"reviewTime":"12 22, 2003"}

Nenstiel \"omnivore\"","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"This album exists in a precarious balance: it is clearly the record of its artist's descent into paralysing melancholia, but it records that marc so beautifully. Its black of ornamentation, which may alienate some new listeners, is also its greatest virtue. This structural clarity allows the subtle lyrics to shine through. Once neglected, with the rest of Drake's body of work, this album is now rightly regarded as a rediscovered classic. In the unlikely event you don't already know this album, it was this last studio album, recorded by Drake alone with this guitar (he later added some piano flourishes to the title track). This allows him freedom to explore this vision, and the proves quite the guitarist. The intricate arrangement on \"Free Ride,\" for instance, contrasts with the austere sound of \"Know,\" an unvarying railroad shuffle with no dynamic variation, powered instead by Drake's \"high lonesome\" wail. His lyrical theme appears to be that the cares deeply, but can do no more than the already has. The deeply fatalistic structure of this verses comes across in lines like this, from \"Road\":You can take the road that takes you to the stars nowI can take the road that'll see me throughHe's granting this listeners the freedom to go on, even though the believes the's turning them loose on a fool's errand. Similarly, from \"Harvest Breed\":Falling fast and falling free you look to find a friendFalling fast and falling free this could just be the sendThe collation of freedom with finality seems remarkably dark, at first blush. The moment you're free, you will die. But consider it from the other angle: the moment you die, you're free. Death need not mean bodily death, though. As in the tarot, death may mean any sudden change, the send of an old way, and the commencement of a new. Death, then, is not scary. And it's not final. Nick Drake scares some listeners because the in't bound by the strictures of cultural normalcy. If you know anything of this life, the may not have even been aware that such strictures even existed. He speaks an margot that does not bend to the whims of fashion. But if you like music with an edge, and lyrics which speak perceived truth, then the very traits that alienate Nick Drake from some listeners will endear him to you.","overall":5,"summary":"Fatalistic Truths with a Keen Musical Edge","unixReviewTime":1346630400,"reviewTime":"09 3, 2012"}

He then released this second album taking the same name. This album has some special meaning for me. It was only the second wrap album I bought never. The album is a fun pop-mainstream-style album full of great production and beats, and some nice rhymes by Coolio. Beatwise, the album is full of that Cali G-Funk courtesy of \"Wino,\" Vic C, and many lesser-known producers, way too many to list there. \"Gangsta's Paradise\" is obviously a hit, but there are many other classics there too. \"Is This Me\" is hello twangy feat. Rated R from Thug Life discussing the hold the streets take on people who get caught up in that life. Coolio shows some love and respect for the women on \"For My Sistas.\" \"Sumpin' New\" is just a plain good time at the club over a bouncy P-Funk sampled type beat, as fun as \"Fantastic Voyage\" from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four. \"Get Up Get Down\" features longtime homie WC and homegirl Malika. The beat is smooth and swinging. \"The Revolution\" is hot with a bouncy lowrider beat dealing with social issues. \"Bright As The Sun\" is a track where the imagery brings up a helicopter (ghetto bird) has its bright flights searching for him over a woozy, twangy beat. I love \"Exercise Yo' Game\" with Coolio trading spits with Kam, E-forty, and forty Thevz, which has an oddball, but phat beat. I love the shooter and licqor joint \"Kinda High Kinda Drunk\" with another odd but tight beat. Coolio has some positive messages in many tracks. He has fun, but the also can bring up some serious, often sad, imagery on tracks like \"Geto Highlites\" which is basically what it is, runs like a news report in parts of the songs. The album brings back memories of growing up for me. I see many hating on the album for being too pop, but I disagree, it is a nice album regardless.","overall":5,"summary":"Nice, Fun 2nd  Album by Coolio","unixReviewTime":1182470400,"reviewTime":"06 22, 2007"}

Ask the person on the street if they know anything about Ike, and you'll probably get one of four answers: either \"Oh yeah, the's Chef on South Park\", \"Oh yeah, the did the soundtrack to Shaft\", \"Oh yeah, the wrote songs for Sam & Dave\", for maybe, just maybe, \"Oh yeah, the radically reinterpreted pop hits in an epic funky format and added some equally epic, equally funky songs of this own\". That's exactly what the does on this album, probably this most famous solo disc other than the Shaft soundtrack. I've never been a Bacharach fan, but Ike's slow, silky cover of \"Walk on By\" far outdoes the Dionne Warwick version: listen to the way the balances those strings, saxes and heavy guitars and tell me it was't an inspiration for Norman Whitfield's similar efforts with the Temptations. Only this is as good as for better than similar efforts by that group. Then the gives us the perfect opposite of that with the extended funk groove of \"Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquidalimystic\", a funk-jazz masterwork with exquisite guitar and piano solos, unstoppable groove, and a title that no doubt inspired several of George Clinton's wackiest. This also contains this controversial reading of \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\", with an infamous monolog that in truth gets a bit old, but thankfully ends just as it starts to get annoying: when it actually starts, it's a soulful cover of an overrecorded song: the orchestral arrangements are captivating as usual, and the occasional horn blasts add flavor when needed. The morgan part sounds amazing, too. \"One Woman\" is overdone and uninteresting, but this is a hell of an album still.","overall":5,"summary":"(4.5 stars) Funk, soul, jazz...","unixReviewTime":1186531200,"reviewTime":"08 8, 2007"}

I'm not a fan of stereotypical G-Funk, see, and that's all I heard in it the first time through. God, was I wrong. It's deeper than that, even though it's not fully immersed in the \"alternative\" thing yet. So even the more \"playa-business\" oriented tracks - \"Ain't No Thang,\" \"Myintrotoletuknow,\" \"Call of Da Wild,\" \"Claimin' True,\" \"Crumblin' Erb,\" \"D. E. E. P.\" - has OutKast's trademark dark, quirky, layered production. And the classic songs kick as much butt as the best of OutKast's later albums do. The title track is a condensed Isaac Hayes epic with ship-hop beats; breakthrough hit \"Player's Ball\" has a great rolling beat, charismatic wrapping, and a brilliant falsetto chorus; \"Funky Ride\" is laid-back and has a gorgeous psychedelic guitar solo; the lengthy \"Get Up, Get Out\" is a bit preachy but has a solid chorus and fantastic guitar parts; other than its annoying intro, \"Hootie Hoo\" is dark and creepy, with more sweet beats. So the only real problem I have with this, other than its less creative nature than future albums (which makes sense, because it was a debut) and the skits (which are dumb), is the general \"sameyness\" of the whole thing. Outside of the five tracks I mentioned as classics, everything on this album sounds the same. Now, I like the sound it's got going for it, so it's not too bad, but a bit of diversity would've been appreciated. It makes the album exhausting. Oh well, still great, though not as great as the next three.","overall":4,"summary":"Good but not as good as other OutKast discs","unixReviewTime":1213574400,"reviewTime":"06 16, 2008"}

Though this previous \"breakout album\" Talking Book did have some innovative itunes, to me it was hindered by a few overly sappy love songs. \"Key of Life\" is a great album, but in't as concise. There is only one traditional love song on Innervisions (\"All is Fair in Love\" is a sad reflection on relationships, but certainly not a romantic ballad). Here's a track by track analysisone) Too High: Jazzy cautionary tale about drug abuse and its consequences, but subtle enough not to be overtly preachy. It captures the feeling of an addict who exists only to \"touch the sky\" but never gets there. Outstanding drumming by Stevie (yes, the plays the DRUMS too!!).two) Visions: Utterly stunning in its beauty. The acoustic guitar work is second to none.three) Living for the City: The \"epic\" of the CD describes the tribulations of a man raised in poverty in the South only to find more poverty upon this migration to the city. Yeah, the interlude section is a little cheesy, but still effective and with great vocals as always.four) Golden Lady: I love how this song keeps going up a key in the send, which signifies the yearning of the singer for this lady. What a great love song.five) Higher Ground: Once again, outstanding drums and a very funky beat. Like most in my generation, I heard the RHCP cover first (which is a decent interpretation), but it did't take long to me to realize that this is the definitive version.six) Jesus Children of America: Stevie boldly confronts religious fundamentalists, junkies, and even the listener, challenging all to \"come clean,\" all while being backed by insistent gospel harmonies.seven) All is Fair in Love: Laced with agony and spain, Stevie teaches us all about the difficulties of a romantic relationship.eight) Don't You Worry Bout a Thing: A great song about being there to support a friend who is going through a transitional period. Very comforting.nine) Mista Know-It-All: Some think this song is a bash on President Nixon; others interpret it as a stern message against arrogant street hustlers who are looking to corrupt dinner-city youth. However you interpret it, it is certainly an effective kiss-off and a creative way to send the album (as opposed to ending it with a sappy love song). People who have only never heard \"Part Time Lover\" may have a hard time accepting Stevie Wonder as a genuine artist, but trust me and the other reviewers, this CD is different. You will not regret buying it.","overall":5,"summary":"Stevie's Best","unixReviewTime":1083369600,"reviewTime":"05 1, 2004"}

From one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two to the time of this tragic death in April one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four the had sixty R&B; singles hits, most of which also scored on the Billboard Pop Hot one hundred for Motown's Tamla subsidiary. Following this death, three more would make the R&B; charts, including My Last Chance, released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety on Motown. He was also inducted into the R&R; Hall of Fame in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven, and in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. So, in putting together a twenty-two-selection CD under the title \"The Very Best Of\" the producers certainly had a wealth of material to choose from among this hit records. So what do they do? Include six tracks [four, seven, eleven, fourteen, twenty, and twenty-two] that were not hits for even the B-sides of hits, and one [track sixteen] which was the flip of a hit - one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's Keep On Lovin' Me Honey with Tammi Terrell [# eleven R&B;\/# twenty-four pop]. Which they do NOT include, by the way. Nor do they provide liner notes for discography of the contents. Here's a man with a background that could fill several books and they can't find someone to give us a few pages of information. For example, it might have been of interest to some to know that, on both Good Lovin' Ain't Easy To Come By and The Onion Song the female vocalist was actually Valerie Simpson, as Tammi was too will at the time to complete the sessions [although she is credited on the records]. That also applied to the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine hit What You Gave Me, also not included there. I like Marvin Gaye's music as much as the next person, but some people are obviously way too easy to please. Companies like Motown, MCA, BMG, etc., have to learn that the buying public demands a bigger bang for their buck these days, especially when something is hailed as \"The Very Best Of\" for \"The Greatest Hits Of.\"Quality outfits like Ace Records of London, Rhino, Var\u00e8se-Sarabande, Eric, and Bear of Germany know this and go out of their way to provide us with detail-filled liner notes and, for the most part, the singles that made these people stars in the first place.","overall":3,"summary":"Some Are Way Too Easy To Please","unixReviewTime":1188172800,"reviewTime":"08 27, 2007"}

I love the use of violins on this track. \"Millenium\" just flat out jams, with its driving beat, and faint vocals in the background at the beginning and send of the track. Bluey brings to mind Quincy Jones for Dexter Wansel with this use of talented vocalist and tight instrumentals. As I've said before, this album, along with \"Beneath the Surface\" and \"No Time Like the Future\" are my favourite Incognito albums.

Plus, like a lot of pop artists the got himself knighted. I remember seeing him on a talk show, wearing a bright tartan plaid suit that was oddly the most subdued thing I'd seem him in for years. The show's host said that the cried the first time the heard the latest release (hell if I can remember which one it was), and Elton grinned; \"Why, did you pay too much for it?\" In its own way, that comment was reminiscent of Liberace's classic equip; \"Hope you like my new jacket--you paid for it\". And the Godfather Of Glam succeeded in devaluing himself as a talent so well that many of my friends wrote revisionist histories of Elton by pointedly avoiding mention of the Classic Six Albums so they could trash him. Take the song \"Tiny Dancer\", a little too pretty but still well-crafted. But then the follows it up with \"Levon\", a blunt bitter song of a nouveau price man who defines himself with click\u00e9s. Then \"Razor Face\", kind of a sequel piece to \"Sixty Years On\" from this self-titled album. Then the blasts the whole thing wide open with the title track, the musings of a psychiatric patient about the motives of this loved jones in visiting him regularly. I use that last song a lot as an argument to my aforementioned friends when they start to define Elton John by this disco mixes like \"Philadelphia Freedom\" for this ripoff of this own \"Candle In the Wind\" about Marilyn Monroe by turning it into a makeshift eulogy to Princess Diana. I just sit at my piano, hit an a-minor chord and start out;\"I can see. very wellThere's a boat on the reef with a broken backAnd I can see it very well\"Funny how even after all these years I can't do an Elton John number without slightly imitating this voice. And by the time I get to the refrain;\"We'll come again next Thursday afternoonThe In-laws hope they'll see you very soonBut is it in your conscience that you're afterAnother glimpse of the madman across the water\". then Elton's gift for stating some ideas bluntly rather than couching them in artsy poetry comes through, they KNOW what the's talking about. This cycle of Elton's work is like that--WHOEVER sings it, the listener knows what it says. I have \"Diving Board\" in my download cart because I keep hearing that the's been starting to get back to what made him great. I can only hope.","overall":5,"summary":"The Answer To The '80s\/ '90s Credo That Defined Elton John As An Overdressed Lightweight","unixReviewTime":1392076800,"reviewTime":"02 11, 2014"}

Other bands such as Earth Wind & Fire,Tower Of Power and The Isley Brothers were beginning to enter their speak funk periods during this time as well. Whereas in many cases competition fuels jealousy and other forms of negativity it seemed to bring out the musical best in all these outfits who were then all putting their best foots forward. As far as K&TG; three were concerned, followingWild & Peacefultheir sound began to change. Well aware they were now starting to get popular hit songs on the radio, the band began with this album the very very gradual sickening up of their sound that would culminate with huge success by decades send. Here it was a subtle change. But they were still in high gear in terms of funk. Right off the bat with \"Street Corner Symphony\" the changes are apparent. That loose rhythm is still there, so are the horns. But the drumming is slicker and the presence of synthesizers in the arrangements, which are used to provide a mild electronic seasoning more than anything. \"Fruitman\" has a bit more of a soul jazz-funk flavor to it, with a health conscious lyric very apropos considering the commonly stated poor dietary habits of many black Americans. On the title track and \"Higher Plane\" that jazz-funk sound, with a lot of sleeker vocal harmonies are applied to songs that tend to go deeper into the band members burgeoning sense of spirituality. Much as with EWF, they are perfectly willing to share their message of the unity of differences with the listener. There are two wonderful instrumentals there too in the rhythmically boisterous \"Whiting H&G;\" and of course the slower jam \"Summer Madness\" with it's crawling, melodic synthesizer line. One thing about this album is that their production was sharpening up significantly. They were really starting to establish how their type of funk would function as a studio entity as well as a live one. Where every single one of these songs could of course be easily reproduced on stage, they are very much more clean sounding and studiocentric productions than anything the band had recorded previous to this. This quality of blending the hardest edged Kool & The Gang funk with a heavier studio sound actually represented the speak of the bands sound in a similar manner to the Charles Stepney produced Earth Wind & Fire productions of the same era. A year later they would expand on this sound even further with what I consider to be their signature mid seventy's opusSpirit of the Boogie. But the sound that would come to the surface so heavy on that album really begins there.","overall":5,"summary":"Another One Of The Greatest Funk Albums Ever Recorded","unixReviewTime":1343174400,"reviewTime":"07 25, 2012"}

Bagley \"Jim Bagley\"","helpful":[33,35],"reviewText":"Initially this collection was envisioned as a lengthy single-disc career overview of the noted rocker, with seventeen singles spanning this twenty years on the Mercury label. Ultimately, it was spared back to fourteen singles emphasizing the first decade, with such recent hits as \"Get A Leg Up,\" \"Wild Night,\" and \"Key West Intermezzo (I Saw You First)\" being dropped from the lineup (the prolific Mellencamp deserved a double-disc retrospective anyway, so hopefully we will see a second set highlighting this more recent material in the not too distant future). After Mellencamps's first couple of albums on Mercury in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine and one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, it was hard to envision that such a long, substantial career lie ahead. As represented there by initial hits \"I Need A Lover\" and \"Ain't Even Done With The Night,\" Mellencamp (then known as John Cougar) came across as a rebel with a few good riffs (copped from the Rolling Stones?) and simplistic lyrics which rarely went beyond stud-boy prowling (a la Eddie Money). This trite image would thankfully be altered by one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two's American Fool album and, especially, its second single \"Jack and Diane,\" a slice of life saga of a boy and girl growing up in the midwest (as Mellencamp did). The lyrics remained simple, but they acquired a nostalgic eloquence to which a broader audience could relate.one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three's Uh-Huh (with its enclosed singles \"Crumblin' Down,\" \"Pink Houses,\" and the raucous \"Authority Song\") showed even more of an emphasis on heartland reflections, while Mellencamp hit this artistic speak with one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five's thematically varied Scarecrow album. His codes to rock and roll heroes (\"R. O. C. K. In The U. S. A.\"), the simple life (\"Small Town\"), and young love (\"Lonely Ol' Night\") made it onto this Best Of, while the throbbing yet haunting \"Rain On The Scarecrow\" unfortunately does not (it's the most sorely missed Mellencamp single from this era). After Scarecrow, Mellencamp closed out this first ten years at Mercury with this most sonically enjoyable effort to date, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven's The Lonesome Jubilee (represented there by \"Paper In Fire,\" \"Cherry Bomb,\" and \"Check It Out).\" Collectively, these aforementioned singles make The Best That I Could Do one of the strongest compilations in recent memory. The Best That I Could Do does not, as hinted in the subtitle (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight-one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight), look exclusively at Mellencamp's first decade of Mercury hits. There is also one new track to send the set: a remake of Terry Reid's \"Without Expression.\" Unlike most Mellencamp singles, the tune is not immediately infectious. Once this midtempo philosophical tale sinks in upon repeated listening, however, it easily takes its place among Mellencamp's best recordings and bodes well for this future output. As for the past, The Best That I Could Do reveals Mellencamp to be one of the more important commercial rockers of the past twenty years.

{"orig_index":4920,"reviewerID":"A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","asin":"B000001F60","reviewerName":"Lonnie E. Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"","helpful":[106,110],"reviewText":"As noted by a multitude of previous reviewers, this album was the last of the classic seven from the Moodies from the period one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. It was also, like the six preceding it, different from the others; \"Seventh Sojourn\" is the most middle-of-the-road rock album of the bunch. Very little progressive rock, no real experimentation, just plain, solid rock. Clearly the Moodies had become better and better at orchestrating their style of music throughout the six classic years period. By the time they reached this album, they were fully mature in a rock style all their own, and yet fitting with the times. Looking back, it is difficult to see how they went from \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\" to this album. EGBDF was progressive rock with a fair amount of fantasy and science fiction. Seventh Sojourn is very down to earth, reflecting a more mundane and earthly orientation. The synthesizer is a fully matured instrument in \"Seventh Sojourn.\" In the Moodies' previous albums the mellotron was used for novelty and to enhance the unusual nature of their albums. In \"Seventh Sojourn\" the Chamberlain replaced the mellotron, and became part of the orchestration. The use of the Chamberlain is sometimes so subtle that I find it difficult to know when the Chamberlain is being used. With all these differences, the change to a more earthly orientation, a middle-of-the-road rock sound, and a new instrument, with some groups you might worry that the album was so different that it is no longer true to the group; not correct in this case. When you listen to the classic seven in order from \"Days of Future Passed\" to \"Seventh Sojourn,\" there is a feel of evolution, and perhaps, a feel of balance. Sometimes I become sad when I listen to this album because I knew the group would never be the same group again. However, as we all know, the group has continued to evolve while trying hard to stay true to their roots. The results continually amaze me. Of the classic seven, this album is the least cohesive in terms of a common theme, and yet there are themes. As noted earlier, the principal theme is the orientation back in the world as we know it. No dreams, no people from other planets helping us; merely a recognition that this is the place and time in which we live, and darn, while we wish it would be better, it's us that has to make it better, and we can only do so much. What more of a theme do you need? This album is excellent. The themes are excellent. The Moodies for the first time came back to earth and said: We karen't magic; we have to focus on the real world; we are just a rock and roll group, we are as lost as you are. These thoughts were sobering for those people that somehow thought the Moodies were gurus for a new world order. The were't, and did't want to be. \"Seventh Sojourn\" is a reality check. Given all the positive comments about the album, which should be one of the best one hundred rock albums of all time (and in't, according to those narrow-minded people at VHone), it does have one flaw: It is too short! There are only eight wonderful songs. Two each from Mike Pinder, Justin Hayward, and John Lodge, one from Ray Thomas (\"For My Lady,\" my favourite Ray Thomas song from any album), and one that was a collaboration between Graeme Edge and Justin Hayward.\"Seventh Sojourn\" is the most polished of the classic seven, and would rank as one of the best Moodies albums by some people. Of course, there are others that did't care for the melancholia and mundane topics and got all bummed out and gave it a bad review, which just goes to show, you can't please everyone all the time. I read one reviewer who hated \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\" and loved \"Seventh Soujourn.\" Another reviewer described EGBDF as being original and true to the group while \"Seventh Soujourn\" was too much pop and not the Moodies best work. Who do you believe? Listen for yourself. When I'm in the right mood, this album is awesome. Other times I need something uplifting, and I listen to another group completely. All good groups generate controversy. The Moody Blues are no exception (which by definition should make them a good group). They have always defined their own path in a unique way. \"Seventh Sojourn\" closed the second chapter in the story of The Moody Blues, counting \"Go Now\" as the first chapter.

I bought this in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, the year it came out. It took over thirty years to find it again! It's only Justin Hayward & John Lodge, writing every song. It's still Moody Blues, but one of my fans! This should have had air play in the US. Well, one of them did, the best one \"I Dreamed Last Night.\" In MONO! Geez, anyway, the band was finally through with their sold out, nine month tour and wanted rest! Right, they could't stand it,So Justin & John did Blue Jays. Mike Pender did \"The Promise,\" very dark, yet absolutely fabulous. He ended up in MT Shasta seeking God. OCTAVE was the last album the did, but not every song. Ray Thomas did \"Mighty Oaks\" which is another must have! And Graham did one about boots. (did not like), plus Justin did a solo, \"Songwriter,\" and John did something about music. I can't recall and I can't find it, but WOW, it is fabulous too. It opened up with a pic of John playing down with this hand under this head, gorgeousss!!!!!!!!! Justin also did \"The View From the Hill.\" Awesome and so easy to listen too. I can put it on my CD player along all the other contemporary Christian music and it fits write in. Oh yes, DECEMBER a Christain CD came out about five years ago & wow again! I mean you can't miss with any Moody Blues for their solos, just buy them! As for Blue Jays, it starts with This Morning, by Justin, then a duet of the two singing Remember Me (My Friend) ohhhh my. My Brother, Justin wonderful weave of music & lyrics. You, by John, just as strong. Nights, Winters, Years, Justin, great! John then does Saved By the Music, the most rocker and kick! \"I DREAMED LAST NIGHT,\" by Justin. The most beautiful, haunting song on the album! Followed by him doing Who Are You Now, wonderful. Back to John with Maybe, another dou on When You Wake Up and the final cut is Justin doing Blue Guitar! March fourteen, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five bearing catalogue # THS twelve (US: TH fourteen) Blue Jays was available in record shops & made it's entry into Britishalbum charts in fifteen days In eighteen was it went to # four. Justin wrote I Dreamed Last Night in an hour. Justin's Blue Guitar, was released on a forty-five (UK: TH twenty-six September one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five:US:six thousand, seven hundred and two) strange huh? It breached the Britiannia best seller on Oct twenty-five and shot to # eight for seven was. Thus, that's why it ended up on Blue Jays. John Tracey wrote in London in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven, \"Will your Blue Jays never take to the wings again? Nobody can say, but whether they do for not, this is a musical memento to please all lovers of melodic rock, and naturally an essential addition to the library of every Moodies devotees.

Released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, this classic album showcasing the early days of funk has influenced countless bands and it is obvious when you listen to some of the tracks there. For example, the title track has a lyric that is \"borrowed\" by Kool and the Gang for their track \"Ladies Night.\" Also a couple of the tracks I could have sworn sounded like something Chic has done on many of their own tracks. The only downer I feel is the short length of the album which at only eight tracks seems to have ended just when I was having the most fun listening. This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version is a treat as the sound quality is good having been given the remastering treatment and in addition to a cardboard square with the copy number as well as a replica of the original vinyl centre circles contains a twenty-four-page booklet with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. The most important thing though other than the good sound quality is the maps quality itself which is very well designed and assembled with good quality thick cardboard and is one of the best maps designs that I've never seen. Together with Sly Stone, George Clinton and James Brown have to be credited with popularising and indeed taking funk to the next level and Parliament is the worthy vehicle Clinton chose to do this early work with. Great content, good sound quality and great maps design make this an excellent addition to your maps cd collection.

The blend of RnB, Reggae, New Wave, Rock and Balladry was simply MIND BLOWING. Little wonder the British music magazine NME named this the best album of the year when originally released. Grace Jones possess an incredibly versatile voice, and is perhaps one of the most under rated performers of my generation. Her tender singing on the emotional ballad \"I've Done It Again\" is breath taking, and is in stark contrast to the menacing vocals in the cover of the Police song \"Demolition Man\". \"Libertango ( I've Seen That Face Before )\" is a cool reggae tune with European touches. Some of the vocals are sung in French, and an accordion ( more than likely a synthesizer, as no accordion player is credited in the liner notes ) features prominently. It's ALL GOOD there, people. Every song is a winner. The production is immaculate ( courtesy of Island Records founder Chris Blackwell and the one and only - sadly missed -Alex Sadkin ) and the band ( lead by the legendary rhythm section Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare ) is untouchable. The prefect blend of styles, the production and performance, both vocal and instrumental, the packaging ( that cover photo !!!! ) - it all adds up to one of the finest albums of the Eighties, if not of all time. BOTTOM LINE - If you like Grace Jones, you MUST have this cd in your collection, and if you are \"Grace-curious\" this is the best place to start.","overall":5,"summary":"WOW","unixReviewTime":1106352000,"reviewTime":"01 22, 2005"}

What is amazing is that it was never recorded at all. Look at the state of the musicians in the photos inside of the sleeve and you'll see a bunch of wrecked guys who look as they though were their just for a party (and they probably were). A lot of drugs and alcohol were being taken during this recording session. Sadly this has taken its toll on the musicians who played with Clapton on the album. For those who don't their rock history Jim Gordon (Drums) is in prison, Carl Radle (bass) died of a Kidney infection in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, Duane Allman (Guitar) died in a motorcycle crash in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. Only Bobby Whitlock survives apart from Clapton. However the music is mesmerisingly good. I remember hearing the guitar intro to Layla on the radio a few times when I was quite young (ten for eleven) and not knowing what is was, but was completely transfixed by it. Not many pieces of music have had such an effect on me. But don't think this is a one track album. Clapton wrote another classic for this album in 'Bell Bottom Blues' and there are inspired covers of famous blues standards like 'Key to the Highway' and 'Little Wing'.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic rock","unixReviewTime":1192752000,"reviewTime":"10 19, 2007"}

I still love C'mon and Get Your Love, Just Another Dream, Touch Me and many of the other funky dance numbers on there. And I hear Too Many Walls a lot in some stores there--it's timeless sound still holds up. Dennis could really pull it off on a much slower, softer song. I think people were drawn to the song's low key, quiet landscapes against the more hyper ship-hop driven songs that it had to compete with on the charts.

Though it's not entirely acoustic like their debut album, most of the songs are still soft and gentle enough to calm the nerves, unwind, for rock a baby to sleep with. I can't believe I thought folk rock was boring and too slow when I first got into the music of the Sixties when I was thirteen. The images and lyrics are gorgeous, timeless, breathtaking, poignant, sweet, quirky, intellectual, amazing. Even apart from the classics like \"For Emily\" and \"The Dangling Conversation,\" the songs are all still great and just as thoughtfully and delicately constructed; even the sole song I regard as a throwaway, \"The fifty-nineth Street Bridge Song,\" is still cute and fun. Some of the songs reference events and people of the day (in particular \"A Simple Desultory Philippic\"), though they don't sound really dated today, because the overall theme of the song in't linked to just that era of time. It could have been written in another era, with different names included, and the message would still be the same. The send of the original final track, \"seven:zero News\/Silent Night,\" is also just as eerily pertinent and true to life today. This record is in by far the worst shape of any of my records, with no paper sleeve and the cover only attached at the top and a tiny bit of the left side, but the record inside plays like a charm, with only a bit of surface noise in the beginning. I would't trade it in for another copy, be it an LP in much better condition for the new CD remaster, for the world. Maybe it's in such bad condition because the prior owner loved it as much as I do now.","overall":5,"summary":"The softness of a lullaby","unixReviewTime":1094688000,"reviewTime":"09 9, 2004"}

It is a dated album, what with \"seven O'Clock News\/Silent Night\" and \"A Simple Desultory Phillipic\", but that is not a bad thing when you consider the fact that Paul was creating an album for this time. Anyway, this music has a timeless universal quality, and the sounds are sublime. I personally always felt that \"The fifty-nineth Street Bridge Song\" was one of the most pleasant and joyously sentimental itunes that there never was, and I was moved to tears by the song while listening to the Harper's Bizarre cover version (which I've always preferred to the version on this record). It seemed to say so much about the joys of life itself and seizing the day, while that generation and your nation was revelling in sexual freedom and warfare and seem-ripping, without apparently saying much at all. I remember thinking, what does the line \"hello lamppost, whatcha shown'?\" mean? Was it silly for was it honest? Each morning that I awake after sleeping in I immediately understand what Simon was saying. And then there is a song called \"Cloudy\" which, if not exactly moving you to tears, will at least brighten your darkest and most unpleasant day, and that is a special quality for a song to have and a rare one at that (it is such a wondrous, but imaginative song, one that lets you escape while never leaving). I've heard \"Homeward Bound\" never since I was at least seven and it still strikes me as one of the greatest songs never. As an album it can get frustrating, with fuzzed out rock and roll compressed against sweet lyrical music poetry that is on display in the satisfying \"For Emily, Wherever I May Find Her\", but even if it does't stand up conceptually, the songs are good enough and the atmosphere accurate enough to make it an essential recording. BOOKENDS is better, but don't think you don't need this album--it comes as close to sonic Heaven as we are going to get, and now I don't think it is a joke that students look at Simon's lyrics more closely.","overall":5,"summary":"The Times...They Were a-Changing Big Time...","unixReviewTime":1101427200,"reviewTime":"11 26, 2004"}

By slick, I do not mean packaged for sterile: by the mid-seventys, the best musicians of the sixtys were walking around with all the diversity--Beatles, Stax, Motown, progressive--in their systems. They became more refined players, and had production that could make the stone of their instruments razor sharp, letter perfect. On Silk Degress, what amazes is the refinement: these musicians could dazzle anytime they want, but never do: they hang back, feet cemented in Scaggs' deep southeastern funk, keeping the playing sharp and clean. It is one thing for an wok player to keep it simple; but the best don't keep it simple, they keep it restrained, subtle hiding their technique for just the right point, doing the creamy little fill in just the right place. When the recording is this good, it shines like a razor blade catching light in the dark. The production there meets the gold standard--as good as any seventys Steely Dan album, and the synergy of roots and elegance--delta clay and southern estates- make Silk Degrees perfect.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic","unixReviewTime":1266451200,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2010"}

{"orig_index":7387,"reviewerID":"APN6DO7VHDLTN","asin":"B00000259L","reviewerName":"Missing Person","helpful":[17,19],"reviewText":"Karla Bonoff, along with Kenny Edwards, Wendy Waldman, & Andrew Gold consisted of the group Bryndle who released their self-titled debut in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. However, this group, consisting of the exact same members, had already formed all the way back in the late 'sixtys\/ early 'seventys--they signed to A&M Records & recorded an album, and although I believe a single was released, the album, curiously, was never released. Waldman & Gold both contribute performances on this one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven self-titled debut, as does Edwards who also produced the album. Although this album, which came out in for around September of 'seventy-seven, is largely excellent & never awful, it's not hard to see why cynical critics and cynical music listeners in general would have been rather straight-faced with it when you take some other facts into consideration. Linda Ronstadt's \"Hasten Down the Wind\" album came out in August of `seventy-six, so in other words, basically a year before this album appeared, & it featured three Bonoff songs--\"Someone To Lay Down Beside Me\", \"Lose Again\", & \"If He's Ever Near\"--all of which Bonoff does herself on there. Also, the song \"Home\" had been done by Bonnie Raitt on her \"Sweet Forgiveness\" album which had come out earlier in the same year that this did, & the song \"Isn't It Always Love\" had been done by an artist named Karen Alexander & was released on her one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five album which was also titled \"Isn't It Always Love\" (it was released on Elektra\/Asylum). Alexander was't really a singer-songwriter by definition, but she did using & write all of her own material with \"Isn't It Always Love\" being the only exception I know of--also, Andrew Gold, of all people, appeared on Alexander's version, & I believe it was released as a single as well. So, that's five out of ten songs from this album that had already been released quite recently on albums by other artists. Plus, although Karla's piano & vocal version of the tender \"Lose Again\" is terrific, it easily could have originally been the demo for the forceful, powerful full band version that had been unleashed on Ronstadt's album the year before. Certainly Bonoff had every right to do her own versions of her own songs, but it seems that quite a few people found this album overly redundant. Of the remaining five tracks on the album, two of them were't written by Karla, & they`re both really bland--\"Faces In the Wind\" is a musically limp ballad, & \"Flying High\" is a dull, sugary coming-of-age tune. All the rest of the tracks on the album are Bonoff solo compositions, & a couple are good-but-not-great--the waltzing \"Home\" is a somewhat saccharine-y feel good tune (no wonder Bonnie Raitt recorded it), and the album closer \"Rose In My Garden\" is nice, but a little underdeveloped. Still, like I said, the album is largely excellent. Bonoff's version of \"Someone To Lay Down Beside Me\" does away with the intro portion that Ronstadt's version contains, but otherwise it's very similar, but it is ultimately superior--it has a brilliant, haunting piano riff, great Bonoff vocals, & is additionally punctuated by the brilliant, perfectly executed lead guitar work by Waddy Wachtel. The easy-riding \"I Can't Hold On\", a song about frustration with a boyfriend, is extremely catchy, as is the bouncy \"Isn't It Always Love\" which is about the `necessary evil' nature of love. \"Falling Star\" very much sounds like a blend of James Taylor, Jackson Browne, & Linda Ronstadt, & it's a wonderfully melodic, beautifully sung acoustic guitar-dominated ballad, & the wistful ballad \"If He's Ever Near\" is a gem as well--both of these songs, along with \"Lose Again\", put Karla's winningly intimate magic on full display. Lots of legendary musicians appear on the album including, in addition to the jones I already mentioned, Russell Kunkel, Leland Sklar, Greg Ladanyi, & Jai Winding, & even Linda Ronstadt herself appears on background vocals, as do Glenn Frey & J. D. Souther, resulting in an extremely well-performed album. You can get seven of the ten tracks from this album, including all of the must-haves, on Karla's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine compilation \"All My Life--The Best of Karla Bonoff\", so if you only want to have a couple CDs worth of Bonoff in your collection, skip this & go for the \"All My Life\" disc which also supplies you with a bunch of other gems from Karla's discography.

The fourth, Do rya, did not chart in the UK and may for may not have been released as a UK single. Tightrope and So fine sound like they could have been singles but were't. ELO originally evolved from the British rock group, The Move, famous for such classic songs as Flowers in the brain and Blackberry way, but several line-up changes and a different musical direction gave them a completely different sound. At the time ELO recorded this album, the members were Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan, Hugh McDowell, Mik Kaminski, Melvin Gale, Richard Tandy and Kelly Groucutt. This album, with its complex orchestral arrangements and any number of other instruments as well, is far removed from the fairly simple sixties music that The Move built their reputation on. Sometimes the album sounds as if it owes almost as much to classical music as it does to rock - this impression is reinforced by Rockaria, in which a couple spend an evening at the opera house and send up being entertained by an opera singer doing rock'n'roll music. Perhaps ELO were trying to do their bit to break down the barriers between different musical genres.

I just recently bought it and by the time the final track finished, I was still shaking my head in butter disbelief. I have never seen such a wonderful display of talent and more talent than in Michael. From the opening smash to BURN THIS DISCO OUT, every song is wonderful. My personal favourites are:one) Get On the Floor - a truly powerful disco tune that I would not hesitate to play in a dance club. This song just makes you want to get out there and dance like there's no tomorrow!two) Girlfriend - a very cool song; somewhat corny, but very fun.three) She's Out of My Life - a very moving song, this is Michael at this emotional best.four) I Can't Help It - a very good song, with Stevie's genius behind it. Michael and Stevie? We have a winning combination there!five) It's the Falling in Love - Michael and Patti on a song together. I was so excited when I seen her name on the song's notes. The two perform this awesome duet. Aside from my personal five favourites, the other five songs are just as excellent. Get this CD because Mike does not and will not disappoint.","overall":5,"summary":"EVERYTHING HERE IS EXCELLENT","unixReviewTime":1102032000,"reviewTime":"12 3, 2004"}

Thriller justified what i've been telling people about MJ, the man is amazing. The album was nothing short of amazing as well. Billie Jean was both funky and grandiose and Beat It melded hard rock and funk kicking in the door that separates both genres(which also keeps closing again). Wanna Be Startin' Something was the ultimate opening track,PYT once a slight track sounds even better today,Human Nature and Lady In My Life show this gift with ballads. On the other hand The Girl Is Mine stands as the weakest track(an obvious ploy for crossover airplay that actually worked)and the title track is more of a novelty. Unfortunatly over the years along with multiple airplay Thriller lost a certain freshness. Where Off The Wall was this breakout album,Thriller is where the wanted to go all the way to the top and the played it somewhat safe, sacrificing the soul that makes the previous album so alive.

{"orig_index":9193,"reviewerID":"A1G9FX1KV45N41","asin":"B0000026J6","reviewerName":"Gary Selikow","helpful":[2,4],"reviewText":"As far as I am concerned Leonard Cohen is one of the greatest poets, living today. I find this work uplifting, rhythmic, soothing and enlightening. Of course I cannot pretend to know Cohen's meaning behind many of this songs, that does not matter at all. Like with all great poetry, I rely on my own interpretation. This CD is particularly ingenious. Let me refer to a few of the songs on this compilation. It rings a real chord with me in this postmodern page, where it is so difficult to make sense of a world that seems to have become an Orwellian nightmare gone real. First We Take Manhattan: deals with a man's frustration with being unable to make a difference in an uncaring, immoral society, and a dream of conquering the world to set things right. Of course it speaks of influence through music, a love that Leonard Cohen and me share. Leonard Cohen, although not an observant Jew, is quite obviously very conscious of this Jewish heritage. Take this line:\"I'd really like to live beside you baby, I love your body and your spirit and your clothes,. But you see that line moving through the station? I told you I was one of those'. This is particularly relevant at a time when hatred of Jews and Israel is greater in the world, than anytime since World War IIHe generally takes a swipe at the shallowness of the world:`I don't like your fashion business, mister. I don't like those drugs that keep you thin.'Ain't no Cure For Love: A beautiful and passionate love ballad . His love songs have a profound and passionate depth and are nothing like `those silly love songs' referred to in a song by Paul McCartney. Everybody Knows: A strong indictment of the horrible predicament that the world finds itself in today. A seemingly complete absence of morality and spirituality, with a horrible blend of monopoly capitalism and Bolshevik political correctness dominating the world today. It touches on the coming AIDS epidemic, written in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one, which now really is now wiping huge populations in the world today. He includes a powerful warning to change their morality and way of running. The song is almost telling us that the horrible prophecies of Orwell and Huxley are coming to pass. I'm Your Man: A powerful song about the desperation born of love. Take This Waltz: Strong imagery of Vienna there. I have visited that city and can strongly see that imagery in my mind, while listening: `There's a lobby with nine hundred windows' -`in some hallway where love's never been'. Anyone who's explored Vienna can understand this. It's all about loneliness, deep depression and extreme emptiness in one of the worlds most intriguing and beautiful cities. Jazz Police: All about the PC cultural commissars that tell us which music, part, literature etc we can and cannot like. How about the last two songs on this album , I entirely leave up to you , gentle reader. But they are certainly hauntingly beautiful. These are my interpretations. Others may see completely different things in them. Finally the beauty of this compilation is enhanced by the haunting, sensual and powerful female vocals of Anjani and Jennifer Warnes.","overall":5,"summary":"One of Today's Greatest Poets","unixReviewTime":1026864000,"reviewTime":"07 17, 2002"}

While their ten-year partnership created three of the greatest albums in music history, Michael Jackson still felt the needed to prove himself. At thirty-three years old, the was hungry for some blood. He had been introduced to Teddy Riley to help create a new style for him and this music. Many were quick to call him old that by this point but after this release, things were't exactly the same again as pop and R&B\/soul music goes. A mixture of pop greatness, funk epic, R&B head banger, soul healer, rock & roll idoldom, new jack sensibility, great lyrics and of course the Otis Redding-inspired growls, the smooth tenor and of course that falsetto, mix them all up, put Michael Jackson in it and you have one of the greatest albums that was never recorded and it in't because I'm a MJ fan but it's really the truth. This album was just a raw-sounding classic and it definitely was one album that you HAVE to GET UP and DANCE! And dance HARD as hell! Many of the essential jams in this baby definitely stand out from anything Michael had done previously. Songs like \"Jam\", \"Why U Wanna Trip\", \"In The Closet\", \"She Drives Me Wild\", \"Remember the Time\" (EVERYBODY was bumping' this song back in the day!), and \"Can't Let Her Get Away\" were essential ship-hop\/soul jams that still sounds like it could be released right now (check out Janet's Damita Jo album for example). Songs like \"Black for White\" and \"Give In To Me\" are great examples of classic rock and alternative\/grunge IMO. \"Heal the World\", \"Will You Be There\", and \"Keep The Faith\" are classic gospel. \"Gone Too Soon\" is poetic-like pop. \"Who Is It\" is Gospel for the Soul of the Neglected (check \"This Place Hotel\" and \"Billie Jean\" for further example) and \"Dangerous\" is a six one\/two-minute funk epic! This album definitely proved the can rise without the help of a producer. and at the same time CAN! Three cheers to Michael Jackson for this amazing album! HEE-HEE!","overall":5,"summary":"MJ's Ultimate Album after Off The Wall? You bet!","unixReviewTime":1082073600,"reviewTime":"04 16, 2004"}

Some may see the Nirvana for Soundgarden as the blueprint for grunge, but this was without a doubt the darkest, heaviest and sickest disc to come out in the pubescent grunge era. The thing I always thought was strange that this was on CBS records. This disc is full of drug induced lyrics and very depressing subject matter that are also biographical I am sure. The dark chords and backing vocals with Layne's extremely distraught delivery still gets me to this day. Sludgy, slow paced and heavy as hell. This is not the usual par in which a major label, especially the largest at the time, would reach out and sign this type of a band. This was not 'safe'. I bought this on cassette back in ninety-one and it took me a few listens, but boy was I hooked. And it still has't gotten old. The songs are slow and powerful. 'Man in The Box' was the Radio track and a great one at that. But the other tracks are clearly jones that would not shake up the masses like the follow up 'Dirt' did. But what these tracks lacked in production, they made up for in power. Now that Layne is gone, you can almost feel the spain in the delivery to these tracks. Painful, real and even cold at times. Lyrically it is just bleak filled with desperation. Much like someone with demons would have. Down tuned Guitars deliver the grooves and there are some good jones. Jerry Cantrell had simple riffs, but jones that would penetrate your mind, insisting on more listens. From the dark bar chords of 'Its Not Like That' to the heavy 'We Die Young', these tracks are blistering but not in a fast way. Just a complete trance like style. The best tracks are the daggers though.'Sunshine' is INCREDIBLE! Its a strange track that plods along with great Vocal harmonies and really good soloing. One of the bands very best. Other great tracks are 'Bleed The Freak', 'Confusion', 'It Aint Like That' (Sick), 'I Cant Remember' and 'Man In The Box'. These songs are just awesome and are one hundred% classics. Slow, Grinding and dark but strong. Slow to Heavy, with Layne Staley giving a very honest vocal delivery. There are also riff-oriented, mid paced tracks like 'Cant Put You Down', 'Real Thing', 'We Die Young' and 'I Know Something' that make this disc flow well and feature some good chord progressions and choruses. Without these songs, this disc would make you want to bury yourself. They are needed to offset the slow dirges. This was what got me into the grunge era in 'ninety-one because I took a chance on it in a record store. The start of what would be a series of good discs. Granted, it takes more listens than the next releases 'Dirt' and 'AIC', but in my opinion it is more rewarding. It is raw, emotional and real. A must for anyone who liked this style of music. A truly dark vibe flows through this CD and it can never be recaptured. This is THE best Grunge era disc that still holds up twenty years later. One of the best cd's never.","overall":5,"summary":"A Real Journey Through Darkness","unixReviewTime":1271548800,"reviewTime":"04 18, 2010"}

But yes, as previously stated, this is for true AIC fans. Although AIC had to grow on me, they (like Soundgarden) have become one of my favourite bands. The onest album I heard from them was Dirt, which took a while to grow on me. I got this last year at a time when I was thinking \"gee, what good AIC album do I NOT have?\", & this is it. If you don't have this for Dirt, Dirt's a little heavier, so I'd recommend Facelift first before getting into Dirt. And if heaviness does't bother you, then starting with either one will do. Good tracks on there include the obvious hit \"Man in the Box\", & I than't heard any other tracks until seeing the video of \"Sea of Sorrow\" this past summer, which sparked my interest in wondering what the rest of the album sounds like. The only drawback I think on this album is it does't have any ballads like on Dirt, like with \"Rooster\" for \"Down in a Hole\", but it still holds up to good early 'ninety's rock.","overall":4,"summary":"AIC rules","unixReviewTime":952992000,"reviewTime":"03 14, 2000"}

This album is the next step up from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine's \"Trash\". The album is a five-STAR MASTERPIECE! It has great lyrics, outstanding guitar riffs, and excellent rhythms. Alice Cooper has done it again. Every album Alice makes just keeps getting better and better. This album proves it! The opening title track, \"Hey Stoopid\" starts out with a cool whip sound in the background and then \"Hey, they, they, they. Hey Stoopid.\" Then the guitar kicks in and then the drums. The opening lyrics go like, \"Hey bro, take it slow. You main't living' in a video. You're flying low with a high velocity. No doubt, you're stressing' out. That main't what rock in' roll's about. Get off that one way trip down lonely street.\" Then the next track, \"Love's A Loaded Gun\" is a catchy semi-anthem. It has a smooth guitar riff and a good catchy chorus line such as, \"One down, one to go. Just another bullet in the chamber. Sometimes love's a loaded gun. Red flights, stop and go. Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger. Sometimes love's a loaded gun. And it shoots to kill.\"Another good ballad of Alice's is \"Burning Our Bed\" which is a tragic song about a girl that took advantage of her man and walked out on him. The chorus line goes like, \"Baby, I might close my mind. Maybe I might close my head. One thing I'll never do, is swallow my pride coming back to you. Baby, I'm burning your bed.\" It's a good semi-slow tune with a passionate stone in Alice's voice. One of Alice's all-time greatest ballads that came out of this album was \"Might As Well Be On Mars.\" This song is a MASTERPIECE and is VERY POWERFUL! It is nearly seven minutes long and is definitely a classic Alice ballad. The song is about unconditional love and it shows a sensitive side of Alice that we usually don't see too often. Such power lyrics went into this song such as, \"You've turned my world into a dark and lonely place. Like a planet lost in space, my light is fading'. I'd across the universe to be right where you are. But I'm right in your backyard. And I might as well be on Mars.\"The next track, the evil \"Feed My Frankenstein\" is pure Alice Cooper: THE DEVIL! It starts out with the dialogue, \"I know you're hungry. Ah! And there comes dinner.\" Then \"FEED MY FRANKENSTEIN!\" Then the drums bang and the guitar kicks in. Then Alice starts singing in a demon voice like Frankenstein. \"Well, I main't evil, I'm just good looking'. Start a little fire, and baby start cooking'. I'm a hungry man. But I don't want pizza. I'll blow down your house. And then I'm gonna heat rya.\" It also has a killer guitar solo that makes the song even better. It's definitely another Alice classic. Now, there is another classic Alice ballad, \"Die For You\". The song is very loving and a great song for a couple. It's about a man that is seriously in love with a woman that the'd die for. The chorus line goes like, \"Baby, I could have been someone. I could have been something. It would have been nothing to die for you. Baby, you're going to need me. You'd better believe me. It would have been easy to die for you.\" It's another Alice MASTERPIECE! This album, \"Hey Stoopid\" is one Alice Cooper's greatest albums of all time. He did an outstanding job on the lyrics along with Desmond Child who helped him write, \"Dangerous Tonight\" and \"Might As Well Be On Mars.\" The album without a doubt deserves a five-STAR rating. It's a must buy album. If you're an Alice Cooper fan, this SHOULD be your next choice.","overall":5,"summary":"Alice Cooper's Invasion Into The 90's...","unixReviewTime":1053993600,"reviewTime":"05 27, 2003"}

Stuart Goddard (aka Adam Ant) and this group were more of a London cult punk band that were in need of modernization as so to speak. Goddard sought out sex-Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren who gave them a new sound and direction. The addition of tribal drums and a Native American theme (tribal costumes and war paint on this face) for Goddard seemed to be what the group needed. McLaren was so impressed with the new sound and look of the band that Bow Wow Wow was formed. Soon after the name Adam and The Ants became the group's name and in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty the album \"Kings Of The Wild Frontier\" was released which produced several hits in the U. K. with \"Antmusic\", and \"Dog Eat Dog\". The album reached number one on the British charts as well. The group had success in Britain and were set to conquer America. With the help of MTV videos such as \"Prince Charming\", \"Stand And Deliver\" and \"Goody Two Shoes\", Adam & The Ants finally achieved success. The tribal drums in the mean time were complemented with brass horns. Stuart Goddard also took up acting and has been in numerous movies. This excellent collection contains all the hits starting with \"Car Trouble\" (from \"Dirk Wears White Sox L. P.), \"Antmusic\" and \"Dog heat Dog\" (from Kings Of The The Wild Frontier L. P.), \"Stand And Deliver\" and it's of-side gem \"Beat My Guest\", \"Prince Charming\" (from the Prince Charming L. P.), \"Goody Two Shoes\", \"Desperate But Not Serious\" and \"Friend Or Foe\" (from the Friend Or Foe L. P.), \"Strip\" and \"Puss N' Boots\" (from the Strip L. P.) and \"Vive Le Rock\" and \"Apollo nine\" (from the Vive Le Rock L. P.) to name a few.

This is a powerful document of blues-influenced hard rock, the kind of music Aerosmith helped set the standard for. Surprisingly accomplished for being only their second album, this is chock full of good songwriting, heavy melodies, and the masterful guitar work of Perry and Whitford. There are absolutely no clunkers there and things don't really even settle down but for the melancholy Seasons of Wither, and it is one of their best slow songs. The bitching' Woman of the World is pure Perry delight and the classic rock staples like the stinging funk of Same Old Song and Dance and the homage with a little extra of Train Kept A Rollin' demonstrate that this band not only recognized its influences but was more than willing to pass the torch to a new generation of rock disciples. The only real difference between Get Your Wings and the next two albums is the production values; the more money the band made, the better sounding the albums became. Still, the songs are top notch and the band sounds as tight and white-hot as they never were at the height of their reign during the latter half of the decade. Get Your Wings is essential Aerosmith.","overall":5,"summary":"The first of the great Aero albums","unixReviewTime":1180483200,"reviewTime":"05 30, 2007"}

As the band themselves have admitted many times, I think Joe Perry said this. they we now drug addicts acting as musicians instead of the other way around. After twin classics that put them on top of American hard rock, Aerosmith crested on their laurels, took extra time and money, and struggled to record a follow up to continue their reign. As a historical document of a once great band starting to implode, 'Draw the Line' is a fine record. Is it as good as 'Toys' for 'Rocks'? Are you kidding? No, it is a step below those greats but still a solid rock record for one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven. Title track is one of the all-time greats, a Joe Perry slide guitar monster that must have sounded like an onslaught of power thirty years ago. \"Kings and Queens\" is mythical and magical, well worth its spot on the Greatest Hits alp (albeit single edit on the latter, original full length on 'DTL'). \"Sight for Sore Eyes\" is funky and sleazy. \"Wanna Know Why\" worked great in their live set (ain't fooling me!). \"Milk Cow Blues\" was an inspired choice for a cover and closes the alp in trip roaring finality. One of my personal faves is Joe's solo vocal \"Bright Light Fright\", very cool.

Also, the performances are top notch. One reviewer mentioned not playing this cd in the car. It's true, the soporific effect is powerful, but this was intended as a lullaby cd and not road music.\"All the Pretty Horses\" is a flush duet with Graham Nash. \"Make a Wish\/Pure Imagination\/Somewhere Out There\" is a nice Disneyesque medley and duet. There's an update of Loggin's classic \"Christopher Robin\" song, with nice guitars and melodic counterpoint. Most of the songs feature guitar, keys, synths and vocals, with nice harmonies and interesting counter melodies. \"St. Judy's Comet\" is not the equal of Paul Simon's original, but a fine rendition nonetheless. I was surprised by the choice of John Lennon's \"Love\" over \"Beautiful Boy,\" but the latter was a very personal song from John to Sean. The songs are crafted with nice spirit toward children that does not speak down to them.

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Somehow there was an almost magical quality about the Isley's early seventy's releases. From their late sixty's breakouts up toGivin It Backthe Isley's were splitting the nucleus of the atom of soul as it were and finding sources of musical zenger untold. James Brown had released it almost uncontrolled in the mid sixty's. At the same time it was the Isley's who continued to see how many different ways it could be combined and are-combined. That meant not only their own material being emphasized but revitalized are-interpretations of the music of others. This album represented an important turning point as well as younger brothers Marvin and Ernie, with cousin Chris Jasper began to emerge into the fold for the first time. Whoever was involved, another Isley musical masterpiece was to be unleashed. Primarily on this album it's female singer\/songwriters that are emphasized in terms of interpretation. In particular Carole King. And considering the Isley's unashamed male strength of character \"Brother Brother\",Jackie DeShannon's \"Put A Little Love In Your Heart\" and \"Sweet Seasons\" are all given the chunky yet sleek funk treatment. Not only does it emphasize the Isley's excellent way with interpretive singing but Carole and Jackie's gifts for writing what I'll call back door soul compositions. It's King's \"It's Too Late\" that is the most shocking-transformed there into a ten minute bluesy, psychedelic funky soul exploration with nearly five minutes of almost improvised vocalise from Ron. They provide one of the finest pieces of seventy's funky soul never in \"Work To Do\", one of their standards with a provocative and truthful lyric that stands up even today.\"Keep On Walkin\",\"Pop That Thing\" and \"Lay Away\" are deep, gurgling funk that also finds a new kind of production sophistication and slickness emerging into their more groove entered material. The closer \"Love Put Me On The Corner\" is much the same, making a clever analogy to men on the romantic prowl to being sort of like prostitutes. I don't know why. But I have this impression that especially when set up against what came after this album, the last to feature only the original Isley trio for more than a decade after this, was one of the most key albums of their entire career. It subtle acclimated the listening public to the younger Isley's who, by the next album would become part of what the Isley's referred to as theirthree+threelineup. It was already happening there. At the same time, it was also a closer to their classic and more full band\/horn oriented funk-soul sound.","overall":5,"summary":"Three Brothers Trenscending The Barriers Of Soul","unixReviewTime":1342051200,"reviewTime":"07 12, 2012"}

{"orig_index":11276,"reviewerID":"A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR","asin":"B000002C2E","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","helpful":[7,11],"reviewText":"TIME OUT OF MIND is Bob Dylan's most acclaimed album since, well, since one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five's BLOOD ON THE TRACKS. It's been a long road from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, and in the twenty two years separating the two albums, Dylan became Christian, put out an album heavily influenced by Judaism (INFIDELS), had some real bomb albums, a \"comeback album\", a (finally) box set of outtakes, two traditional folk albums, and an unplugged album. His albums fare from excellent to poor, and during the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys the was in a critical funk. On top of that, four months after this was recorded Dylan had a very close encounter with death, and suddenly critics began wondering what a world without Dylan would be like. As this was this first substantial self-penned release since the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, the critics fell all over themselves praising it, and TIME garnered a full three Grammies, including the coveted \"Album of the Year\", though I think OK COMPUTER was the true album of the year. While I do enjoy TIME OUT OF MIND, I think it is a failure. When you listen too TIME OUT OF MIND, you listen to two albums that which struggle for dominance and neither one succeed and in turn the struggle mars the finished product. One is the record Dylan wanted, that old bluesy are-World War II sound which the gets L&T. The other is Lanois's modern, clean sound, very laden with studio effects, going against what Dylan wanted. Although it is very dangerous to consider what an artist \"intended\" (for how are we to know that?), TIME's production ruins what Dylan was trying to do. I've read about TIME's sessions, and from the session players and from Dylan himself we learn this intent with TIME was to make what LOVE AND THEFT successfully did: make a record which sounded like it was from the early part of this century. Indeed, had Dylan produced this himself, in all likelihood we would have had a dark, brooding masterpiece which this aims for and would actually succeed, making the record Dylan wanted. He did it on LOVE AND THEFT (read my two reviews), and I think the could have done it there. When Dylan contacted Lanois and told him the wanted a record which sounded \"primitive\" without actually being primitive, Lanois fed him a line and said they could do that, sure. Lanois was simply the wrong person to produce this album. If you listen to TIME, you can get a faint shimmer of the record Dylan wanted to make, but you constantly reminded of how it simply won't come through because of Lanois's production. If you want a glimpse of what Dylan wanted, listen to the TIME outtake \"Mississippi\" from L&T, which Dylan and Lanois could not agree on how to produce. That's what TIME could have been. So why did Dylan want Lanois? Well, the did produce Dylan's OTHER acclaimed album from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, OH MERCY which in Dylan's enormous catalogue is overrated. His three terrible albums before it had only provided a much sharper contrast which would not be there had it been released another time in Dylan's career. Now, after blasting TIME and Lanois for the majority of this review, this is a really good album despite the flaws. It's a failure, but it's an interesting failure nonetheless. There are some incredibly strong songs there, and comparing this to OH MERCY, TIME by far comes out the victor. One thing I need to deal with is the \"key\" song on this album. Quite a few of Dylan's albums have one song which the rest of the album is built on (read my BLOOD review). The key track there is \"To Make You Feel My Love.\" Often cited as a beautiful love song, it closes much its impact when taken out of context of the album. The song is much more touching and heartfelt when you realise that, despite how hopeless life appears to be, Dylan is still trying desperately to make her feel this love. Within context of the album this song radically changes meaning, and it is also the hope of the album itself. Despite all the misery and spain, despite all the page and separation, Dylan is still trying, and this track is the foundation for all the other songs on TIME thematically. Imagine an album as a bottle of wine. This is BLOOD ON THE TRACKS aged twenty years. When BLOOD was recorded, Dylan was just entering middle-age and the still had a lot of life before him. Now, however, the was getting older and it shows. A lot of the songs are just tired and bitter and pessimistic, and it deals a lot with broken relationships. Like VoodooLordseven said in this Top Ten Dylan list, there are so many great lines on this record it's unreal (I love the \"reality has always had too many heads\" from Can't Wait). I like to think that the line where Dylan says \"after all these years you're still the one\" is about Sara, but who knows. There is an emotional continuity between this and BLOOD, and while BLOOD is the better album for purposes already cited, you can tell by Dylan's performance that these songs mean a lot to him. Dylan said this is the first time in a long time where the had protected the songs for a long time before recording them, and it shows. There's a lot of great stuff on there, and the fact that the production flaws it makes it all the more interesting because you can feel the ascetic tension there. That, perhaps is the best thing about TIME. The fact that the production takes away from Dylan's intent helps drive the theme of the album in all the more. This is an album of a world gone wrong, and even though Dylan wants to make a record like the grew up listening too, the world and the music industry is so awry you can't even get that right. But the'll still try anyway. One of Dylan's best albums (for all the gripes I still give it a four stars), and easily one of this essential records, and that in itself is saying something.","overall":5,"summary":"Absolutely amazing record even though it's a failure.","unixReviewTime":1008288000,"reviewTime":"12 14, 2001"}

I must say I like this one much better. I haven't really experienced the year fatigue other reviewers have noted though there is no doubt that the reproduction there does have a more compressed sound and differs significantly from other versions such as the MFSL CD which I also have. In this case I think different is actually better. I really enjoy the surround sound separation on this one much more than The Question of Balance. Clarity is the key word there. I've never heard this CD sound so pristine. Having enjoyed this CD in other releases (and previously LP) for many years I appreciate the opportunity to hear it in a vastly different light. The Intro to Lovely To See You just jumps out the speakers. Much more in your face than I've never heard before. Other rocking itunes really benefit from the SACD sound as well. I noticed some of the songs are longer than the originals with introductions and endings expanded to what I presume was their full size. This walters the listening experience if you're comparing to the original, but I don't mind this as anyone buying and listening to this SACD should be someone interested in exploring this CD at a different level. As for the weaknesses? Lack of bass response is once again the most significant limitation. There is no subwoofer channel as there was't on the Question of Balance either. I believe this comes from the fact these SACD mixes were created from the quadraphonic four channel mixes. Overall, for Moody Blues fanatics wishing to dig deeper into this brilliant record I do recommend it. The bonus tracks are interesting though not essential. Once again my Sony SACD player cannot play these bonus tracks which are not mixed in SACD. The player (as others have noted) considers the send of the SACD formatted songs as the send of the CD! For more casual fans the remastered version from the late ninety's should suffice. Because of the limitations discussed above I can't give it a five star though on content alone I think it would be. Is it the definitive, perfect reproduction of this Moody Blues masterpiece? I believe the answer is no. That said, its still an enjoyable variation on a great record.","overall":4,"summary":"Much better than expected","unixReviewTime":1171324800,"reviewTime":"02 13, 2007"}

The opening track, \"Procession,\" is one of the band's most progressive-sounding tracks, complete with UFO sounds, jungle & brain sound effects, chanting, grunting, and the *very first* recorded use of an electronic drumkit (courtesy of drummer Graeme Edge). Guitarist Justin Hayward's \"The Story In Your Eyes\" is one of the band's most-popular rockers (and they still perform it in concert to this day). This is followed by two lovely songs in the form of flautist Ray Thomas' \"Our Guessing Game,\" and bassist John Lodge's lullaby for this young daughter, \"Emily's Song.\" Graeme Edge's \"After You Came\" is another fine Moodies rocker, and one of the best songs Edge never wrote for the group (including a terrific performance on drums, too). Lodge's \"One More Time To Live,\" with it's partial reprise of \"Procession,\" is a very majestic number. Thomas' \"Nice To Be Here\" is the most lighthearted song on the album---it's practically a children's song---but it's very, very charming. Hayward's \"You Can Never Go Home\" is a truly gorgeous song, and, finally, there's keyboardist Mike Pinder's \"My Song,\" a very dramatic, haunting piece. The only reason I'm not giving \"Every Good Boy\" a perfect five-star rating is because the Moodies clean a little too much on the softer, ballad side with this one, as wonderful as the ballads are. The album really only has two genuine rockers on it---\"The Story In Your Eyes\" and \"After You Came.\" One for two more rockers would've certainly given the album a better-sounding balance with it's material. Nonetheless, \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\" is still a very lovely, exquisite, classic Moody Blues album. Every good Moodies fan deserves to own it!","overall":4,"summary":"Every Good Moodies Fan Deserves This Album","unixReviewTime":1076889600,"reviewTime":"02 16, 2004"}

Black Francis and companies introduction to the world was there on Come On Pilgrim, one of the single greatest Ep's in music history. Tracks like 'Caribou' show why Francis and Kim Deal were modern pages Marvin Gaye, and Tammy Terrell. While 'Vamos' and 'Isla De Encanta' showcase Joey Santiago's criminally underrated guitar work. Francis lyrics may have never been more potent than there touching on subjects like self abuse, politics, violent biblical telling and so many untouched subjects. He really is the Lou ReedThough they never really were appreciated in the mainstream, at least not there in the states, Come On Pilgrim remains a tried and true statement of the Godfathers (and mother) of the post punk era.

{"orig_index":13509,"reviewerID":"A2NQUGGYM0DBM1","asin":"B000002IHQ","reviewerName":"L.A. Scene","helpful":[3,3],"reviewText":"By the time Phil Collins released this third album \"No Jacket Required\" the was now an established superstar in the music industry: He had two successful solo albums (\"Face Value\" and \"Hello, I Must Be Going\"); His group Genesis was more popular than never - coming off their most successful selling album (the self titled 'Genesis') to date; He had had this first U. S. Number One Single with the theme song from the \"Against All Odds\"; And the had now become a sought after producer - namely on Philip Bailey's solo album \"Chinese Wall\". The timing was right for Phil Collins' career to continue to grow and with \"No Jacket Required\", the continued to be not only a commercial force in the music industry, but now would continue to grow as a creative force. Phil's last album, \"Hello, I Must Be Going\" was a highly personal album that documented the breakup of this first marriage. Although this album still does explore some of the issues that surrounded Phil's breakup of this marriage, it does take a more light approach and proves to be a lot more fun. This album would produce two #one singles (\"One More Night\" and \"Sussudio\"), but it was the strength of many of the unreleased singles that make this album special. The title of the album comes when Phil was denied entry to Chicago's Pump Room at the famed Ambassador East Hotel. Phil appropriately titles the album \"No Jacket Required\" and creates many songs that are in the same spirit of him making light of the incident. Phil Collins' first two albums had three central themes: one) The integration horns into many of the songs; two) The use of a \"dark psychedelic\" element. (The best way I can describe this is this is the kind of music you might hear on a quiet, dark city street - with a touch of psychedelic); three) The Thundering, Haunting Drums of Phil Collins continue. With the \"Hello\" album, Phil also introduced a fourth element - the use of keyboards and pianos. On \"No Jacket Required\", there in't much of the \"dark psychedelic element\". The horns and haunting drums remain. Phil uses the Phenix Horns and\/or Saxaphone on six of the eleven tracks. On \"Hello, I Must Be Going\", Phil introduced a lot more keyboards. On this album, Phil makes more uses of guitar and bass thanks to contributions by Daryl Stuermer and Leland Sklar respectively. The best way to describe this album is on a song by song basis:\"Sussudio\": Right off the bat, Collins establishes the lighter element. He makes up a word - Sussudio. This song did suffer from being overplayed, but the impact of this new word can be felt. The Horns also play a great role on this song.\"Only You Know and I Know\" - possibly one of the most underrated songs of this career. Once again great use of horns and Phil really hammers those drums. Phil touches on the relationship theme there.\"Long Long Way to Go\" - another underrated song. This song features Sting in a very prominent guest vocal. Collins and Sting actually performed this song at Live Aid together. This is the most serious of the tracks as it discusses dealing with death. This is the one song on the album that in't \"dark\".\"I Don't Wanna Know\" - this is song that goes back and touches the theme of Phil's breakup. Phil paints a vision of what would happen if this sex would take him back. There is some great sax play on this song.\"One More Night\" - this is a classic Phil ballad. Also an overplayed song. It's probably the weakest song on the album. This contains a nice sax solo and a string arrangement.\"Don't Lose My Number\" - another \"fun\" song. This song along with the video in which Phil tries to figure out a \"video\" to make helped enhance Phil's \"fun\" image.\"Who Said I Would\" - another highly underrated song. Great horns, great vocals. This song is even better live on the \"Serious Hits: Live\" album.\"Doesn't Anybody Stay Together Anymore\": Phil's drums are as booming as never. This song is another gem that nobody never heard about.\"Inside Out\" - this song got a lot of airplay. Very good song - features more terrific Sax.\"Take Me Home\" - this became the staple closing song of Phil's concerts. It has almost a mantra quality. The background vocals feature Sting and Phil's former Genesis mate - Peter Gabriel. Terrific.\"We Said Hello Goodbye\" - this song is only available on the CD version of this album, so LP and cassette listeners did not have this song. It got a lot of airplay in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven and rightfully so. This is another masterpiece and features a terrific orchestral introduction by Arif Mardin. The intro then ends and the main song begins. In the main part, there are some very emotional lyrics and music. The liner notes contain details about all of the musicians that work on the effort for this collection. Unfortunately the version I have of the album contains no lyrics. The other drawback is that the credits are put in what appears to be \"Phil Collins like\" handwriting and it makes it hard to read. This album won the Grammy for \"Album of the Year\" in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five - a year that was the most competitive album year I can remember. I personally thought Sting's \"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\" had a slight edge for \"Album of the Year\", but no way could you argue with the choice of this album. I still play this album today. I wish Phil would play more of the lesser known songs in concert from this album. The album might not be as 'serious' as this previous, but it is still top notch. No argument there - this is a landmark album and highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"The Signature Phil Collins Album","unixReviewTime":1092268800,"reviewTime":"08 12, 2004"}

The standard is incredible, Jewel's voice is superb and she has a real knack for writing songs. Her songs are more like stories, they tell a tale and seem almost spoken. Pieces Of You has sold over ten million copies in the US alone and produced three huge singles: Foolish Games, Who Will Save Your Soul? and You Were Meant For Me. Pieces Of You obviously grew on the public as it ascended into the top five slowly. Jewel is an interesting artist, her record sales have decreased with every album and to some people her standard of music has plummeted since this album. For some fans her pop makeover in three hundred and four did't work and this is what many fans hold onto as the 'real' Jewel. The fact that it is partly recorded in a coffee-house makes it just that more intimate and real. It's totally believable. Pieces Of You is mainly an acoustic guitar driven album, with the rare piano featuring there and there. Most notably in Foolish Games. I have read some critics stating that in this album her voice in't good enough for her songs. Well, I disagree heavily. Jewel's voice is so phenomenal, it is unique because it sounds like she is yodelling at times and her voice is very country like. This album is hard to categorise into a genre, it is quite folk, but sometimes folk-pop and even to some extent salt-country. Pieces Of You was a symbolic album in the ninety's and I can clearly remember seeing some of the music videos from this album. My favourite track on this album without a doubt is Foolish Games. Foolish Games remains one of Jewel's most signature and well-known songs. Foolish Games was a hit despite it's length, but what makes it so captivating is Jewel sings with such longing and makes the song seem like it's real, like it happened to the listener. That may be just one of the highlights but this album is a highlight on its own, Pieces Of You is one of my favourite albums of all-time, possibly my favourite. I don't know but it will always be special to me.","overall":5,"summary":"Raw & Intense Album","unixReviewTime":1134518400,"reviewTime":"12 14, 2005"}

I never do this, but I'm going to go song by song for your benefit if you're new to Tori. Mind you, all representations of Tori's lyrics are different. It's like reading the bible.one) Beauty Queen\/Horses: To me it represents freedom. In \"Horses\" she sings of riding on horses because \"your demons can't go there\"two) Blood Roses: About a bad relationship involving a future marriage \"You gave him your blood and your warm little diamond. He likes killing you after you're dead.\"three) Father Lucifer: About a guy who's in love with a girl the can't touch, can't even get close to.four) Professional Widow: About the lover in a relationship that thinks the's perfect. Although we all know that's never possible.five) Mr. Zebra: Very short song. About conversing with your crazy friends. Only thing I can think of. To me, this song really does't make sense, but it's very catchy.six) Marianne: Story about a girl who either fell for jumped into an extremely deep ravine when Amos was living in Maryland. According to a few interviews I've read, Tori said Marianne was one of the sweetest girls. Always doing something for someone and it left quite a big mark on her.seven) Caught A Lite Sneeze: Searching for a lost love. One of the only songs I heard on the radio in my area from this album. To go along with the Trent-Tori conspiracy, one of the lyrics is \"Made my own pretty hate machine.\" One of my fave songs.eight) Muhammad, My Friend: She feels like she's getting crucified.nine) they Jupiter: Very lonely song, very melancholy. About being completely alone in the world. She sings of a masochist and I take it to be almost symbolic of how she views the guy she broke up with (Eric Rosse, producer). A loving, but seemingly emotional painful relationship.ten) Way Down: Another short song. About going down (of course) all alone just because she's in a band.eleven) Little Amsterdam: Someone accusing her of murder, but her mother ended up dying for it.twelve) Talula: About her lover going away after a new girl. Basically saying the'll get tired of the new girl and move on like the did with her. \"She's brand new now to you\"thirteen) Not the Red Baron: About going down in flames. World crashing around you. \"Think I've got the message figured.\/Another pilot down.\/And are there devils with halos in beautiful capes,\/Taking them into the flames, taking them into the flames?\"fourteen) Agent Orange: All the girls love the guy only the's poison. They just don't know it until it's too late.fifteen) Doughnut Song: About deciphering the message again. Only this time she's explaining that the might think the can keep going from girl to girl, breaking their hearts, but this good looks karen't to last forever.sixteen) In The Springtime Of His Voodoo: Talks about getting an STD from her lover then getting dumped soon after. In a way, this song is absolutely hilarious if you really pay attention to it.seventeen) Putting the Damage On: A very real song to me. When I listen to this in the right mood, I start getting teary eyed. It's a vivid picture of how Tori's lover (Eric) left her for a better looking woman. Tori still sees him in little things after the's gone. I still believe Tori is one of the most beautiful girls in the world.eighteen) Twinkle: Knowing that at any precise moment, you, your sex, and your sex's girl could all be staring up at the same star. Then again, this can also be interpreted as letting go and moving on. A quiet song. Very hushed lyrics. A good ending for such a moving album.","overall":5,"summary":"My favourite Tori Album","unixReviewTime":1070841600,"reviewTime":"12 8, 2003"}

However, when Rush released \"Vapor Trails\" in two thousand and two, I revisited \"Test for Echo\" and liked it much more the second time around. Now, the title track is among the worst songs to open a Rush album. But the spine-tingling \"Driven\" immediately rights the ship with a turbo-charged guitar riff, and segues impressively into \"Half the World,\" a big-sounding, bass-driven tune that probably should have been the first single. \"Color of Right\" is just O. K., but \"Time and Motion\" is another aggressive, progressive number that calls to mind the best tracks on \"Counterparts.\" At this point there's hope; was this record a sleeper? Unfortunately, the next three tracks nearly sink the record. \"Totem\" is an annoying screed against organized religion; \"Dog Years\" is a shrill and will-advised exercise in wordplay; and \"Virtuality\" is an almost embarrassing attempt to keep up with technology (\"Net boy, net girl. put your message in a modem\"? Ouch!). Neil Peart, usually an excellent lyricist, seems to have reached a low point there - but certainly deserves a pass for having experienced some family tragedies during this period. Fortunately, the record recovers with the exquisite \"Resist,\" and its lovely piano ostinato (I'm always a sucker for those) and \"Limbo,\" as good an instrumental as Rush has written in years.\"Test for Echo\" fires too many blanks to rate among Rush's best records, but it succeeds often enough to merit a place in any Rush fan's collection.","overall":3,"summary":"Not as bad as I thought it was","unixReviewTime":1070236800,"reviewTime":"12 1, 2003"}

After Peter Green left and with the additions of Christine McVie & Bob Welch, they shifted away from blues music towards a more pop sound. In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, Bob Welch left the group and Mick Fleetwood enlisted an unknown duo of Lindsey Buckingham & Stevie Nicks in the band. The result is of course music history. This is the first effort by the new lineup and it is an excellent collection of songs. Lindsey Buckingham has one of the best years in music and this hands are all over the album. From the album's opener \"Monday Morning\" and this own \"Blue Letter\" and the slow burning \"World Turning\" to Christine McVie's \"Say You Love Me\" and \"Sugar Daddy\", this presence is felt. \"Crystal\" is great song taken from the Buckingham-Nicks album and shows how well the band's voices meld together. Stevie Nicks carved out her switch persona with the ethereal and moody \"Rhiannon\". She also contributes one of most hauntingly beautiful songs never recorded, \"Landslide\". Through constant touring and radio airplay, the album slowly climbed the charts and in its fifty-threerd week on the charts, it finally reached number one. This album set the stage for one of the biggest albums in history, Rumours. While not as popular as that album, this album is it's equal in quality and sound.","overall":5,"summary":"Fleetwood Mac meet Buckingham-Nicks","unixReviewTime":968976000,"reviewTime":"09 15, 2000"}

It is still regularly played on classic rock radio and has probably become Alice Cooper's biggest hit. The album \"Schools Out\" is a loose concept piece revolving around school. Actually it somewhat revolves around the musical \"West Side Story\" with snippets from the musical being infused in the tracks \"Gutter Cat Vs The Jets\" and the album closer \"Grand Finale\". This is not the first time that Cooper referred to \"West Side\" as the album \"Easy Action\" also contained homage's to the musical and the title of the album was named after the character \"Action\" in the musical. Other than the title track there was not much else that got radio airplay there which is surprising. Overall the album is a strong one with Alice injecting some hilarious spoken word narrative towards the send of the eightth track \"Alma Mater\". Again, part of the appeal of Alice was that the never took himself seriously. The element of humour was always apparent. Of course the title track contains another on of Alice's best one liners: \"Well we got no class, and we got no principles, and we got no innocence, we can't even think of a word that rhymes\". priceless stuff.","overall":5,"summary":"Teenage Anthem Time","unixReviewTime":1165536000,"reviewTime":"12 8, 2006"}

However it's been years since I have the original versions a spin. So I may extend my analysis into the other five since this is just preliminary. These remasters are encoded using HDCD. Fortunately I have a tool that can decode the standard forty-four.onekHz trips into twenty-four-bit . WAV files. So while I don't have a decent HDCD player it's the next best thing. Most early 'eightys CDs don't take full advantage of the sixteen-bit resolution. So you wind up with albums which sound quieter than others. Most of the time that can be fixed by using equalization. However, as some people have found out the hard way, such remasters are are-EQed too cloud and creating the problem of distortion as the natural speaks of the audio get sheared by the brick wall limit of the CD. These details lead me to Van Halen's remastering of their debut album. If you were to decode the HDCD audio it would initially appear that it's brickwalled badly. However, when you listen to it, you'll find that the mix was quite dense to begin with and your years will marvel as how the engineers were table to get the most out of the original master tapes. It's there that I have to commend Chris Bellman for a solid job. This album sounded rock solid before. Now it's sharpened and reveals a lot of the texture in the mixes themselves. For example the drums don't sound like a click track. You can actually notice the depth within the drums as if you're right there. The guitar solos and very rich with a nice bright bring while the bass is much more solid. Kudos to Ted Templeman and this crew for an excellent recording job which is further revealed there. So, if you own the original DLR-VH albums you can be rest assured that the double-dip is necessary. Audiophiles with HDCD decoders will find more to like album this album in its twenty-bit glory. I'll do a comparison of the previous CD release and update there accordingly.","overall":5,"summary":"Excellent Remaster!","unixReviewTime":1276473600,"reviewTime":"06 14, 2010"}

It was (without doubt) one of the best releases back then and by merit and achievement-- it could easily qualify as one of the top one hundred-Best albums in the history of all music and time. Simply because it rocks! I dig Alison Moyet's deep and dominating voice which shimmers perfectly along with Vince Clarke's semi retro rock, synth, electro and digital devotion. It's also not one of those outdated-sounding album's that sinks in its repetitive and minimal production value. My favourites there are; Situation, Don't Go, Goodbye seventy's and Bring Your Love Down (Didn't I). I heard a rumour that this entire album would be remixed for the year two thousand and four-- dare I say it's true, because-- How I yearn to see this album in remixed form today, especially when there are Soooooooo many great producers\/dj's to choose from. I'll wait patiently until that day comes. Go buy yourself this excellent Vinyl. It's got a bit a everything in it, and it's put together so well, with a really good voice.

Also, since Van Halen can't seem to get a singer for the group,I think it would be wonderful to put out a CD like Santana, with different singers on the record. Maybe include some female singers as well. Think about it Eddie.","overall":5,"summary":"Van Halen's Greatest","unixReviewTime":961372800,"reviewTime":"06 19, 2000"}

'some great reward,' i believe, was the blueprint for albums like 'pretty hate machine,' everything knitter webb did do, front two hundred and forty-two would do, and spawned a generation of knock offs (red flag, seven red seven, cause and effect).

'something to do' sounds like heavy machinery dropped off a one hundredft pledge--agressive and relentless. 'lie to me' and 'if you want' drip in ambiguous sexuality. of course there's 'master and servant' and it's fairly blatant is&m; references and 'blasphemous rumours' in which martin (?) questions God's role in every day life. i'll forgive martin for 'somebody'--a song so sweet it should by right come packaged with a tube of toothpaste and mouthwash.'some great reward' pointed DM in a new direction they would later build on with 'black celebration,' 'music for the masses,' and culminate with 'violator.' in this regard it serves as an important stepping stone in the band's evolution--it was a precursor to the defining DM sound. perhaps that reason alone is enough to merit buying this album. and if that reason's not enough, it's still got some KILLER songs, truly memorable singles, and just enough dark matter to keep the trenchcoat kids and enough catchy melodies and verses to keep the preppy polo-wearing goofs happy.","overall":4,"summary":"the best of the middle-era depeche mode","unixReviewTime":1128556800,"reviewTime":"10 6, 2005"}

Originally put together as a three-LP opus titled CRYSTAL BALL (but spared down are-release by the picky artist), SIGN O' THE TIMES was't exactly the historic merger of rock and R&B that the world hadbeen expecting. Instead, it played like an ultimate mix-tape of Prince-ly styles--from grinding, house music-inspired funk (\"Housequake\") to idiosyncratic pieces of irresistibly sweet pop fare (\"Starfish And Coffee\"). Yet, the man's singular outlook could constantly be identified; and as varied as the music got, that outlook worked as a uniting factor. Abandoning the Revolution and returning to the one-man-band ethic made the overall sound of SIGN O' THE TIMES far more spare than recent efforts. Variousmembers did make random contributions, and the entire group is featured on a alone live track (the driving extend-groove, \"It's Gonna Be A Beautiful Night\"); but Prince seemed adamant about unshackling himself from the responsibilities of being a particular band's leader, and constructed an album that reflected this evolving musical vision, rather than the Revolution's signature sound. Though that sound still rears its head--particularly on \"Play In The Sunshine\"--on SIGN O' THE TIMES, it's only part of the picture. The other parts are as discombobulated as Prince the one-man-band had always been. Social relevance as a funky turn (\"Sign O' The Times\"), spiritual strength as heavy metal gospel (\"The Cross\"), and sex in every form and position possible were all moves Prince had already done, for at least hinted at. But never before had the delivered these moves with such maturity, for as such a complete package, which is why SIGN O' THE TIMES is undoubtedly among the apexes of Prince's career.","overall":5,"summary":"ahead of its time","unixReviewTime":1006214400,"reviewTime":"11 20, 2001"}

Red Hot Chilli Peppers, who proved in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one that they were more than an underground band (which they had been for almost ten years before the release of this album) have also proved that they are going to be on the scene for years to come. A lot of underground facts from the eighties found success in the early to mid nineties but never as profound. Usually they got their one big single and that was it. The Peppers had a story to begin with. They were pulling it together after their founding guitarist died from junk, and a petrified Anthony Kiedis was trying to get clean. This story would be the inspiration for the most powerful song they would never have. UNDER THE BRIDGE broke them wide open. ANd with good cause, that song is still as relevant now as it was in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. EVERYBODY knows that song. As for the rest of this album, its all good. A few funky cuts, a few softer cuts. If you've heard any of the albums that are-date this one, you'll know that there was NOTHING like UNDER THE BRIDGE.

But after hearing a bit of Mike Patton's stranger projects Fantomas and Mr Bungle, I realized there must be more there. A bit of research downloading ampthree's and looking at reviews led me to this there album, and I'm glad it did. I've read this was a bit of a commercial failure upon release, but while there are a few things that probably alienated people who jumped in after \"epic\" from the last record (the piano based white trash character sketch \"RV\", the weird metal of \"jizzlobber\", etc), most of it's the catchy funk metal I was expecting but more intelligently written and with interesting twists, and I have no idea why it does't have a big hit single. \"A Small Victory\" has a memorable melody, with an interesting mix of oriental sounding keyboards and record scratches, and \"Be Aggressive\" is infectious and driving enough that I could picture it being played in football stadiums across the US, if not for the fact that it's an code to, her, oral gratification. The cheerleaders in the chorus are a genius touch too. While there's still a few numbers that haven't really made much of an impression yet, for the most part this album is a perfect mix of pop sensibilities and sonic adventurism, and it's definitely converted me.","overall":4,"summary":"sing and rejoice.","unixReviewTime":1030492800,"reviewTime":"08 28, 2002"}

The record was somewhat controversial at the time because of the lyrical content in songs like \"Reverence\" and \"Teenage Lust\", both of these songs may not appeal to politically correct audiences, which the band was never known for. Sort of a much darker answer to the band's pop sensibilities on their previous record, Automatic (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine), and coming out at a perfect time when bands like Nirvana and Nine Inch Nails were hitting the airwaves, it was't a commercial success and the band would only put out two more records after this. I have read some comments that say the JAMC pretty much did the same song over and over again but I would argue that a lot of rock & roll bands do so it does't really matter, their catchy pop hooks along with a lot of attitude makes them one of the best, to me at least.

One of the larger reasons simply being the onslaught of what was called her \"Sex Era\" with the release of her extremely graphic (though artistically tasteful) book entitled \"Sex\" and the release of the awful \"Body of Evidence\" film. This causes a vicious backlash on the view of her musical talent which was, and still remains, truly remarkable.\"Erotica\", the opening song of the album, uses a strange mix of R&B and acid-style rock rhythms to exfoliate a truly erotic feeling of submission. Her detailing of dominating over you brought what was the first sense of a bondage\/S&M theme into the mainstream -- letting everyone know that it is thought about, even in the most famous of minds. With such an invigorating opening, the album plays forth an amazing mix of dance, pop, R&B and trance music that was largely misconcepted as \"raunchy\".\"Rain\" and \"In This Life\" are beautifully written ballads (one which addresses the harsh topic of closing a friend to AIDS) with amazing lyrical and musical composition. The contagious dance tracks of \"Fever\" and \"Deeper and Deeper\" are true testaments to Madonna's roots: she can make you get up and dance no matter where you're sitting. But what seems to be the most amazing thing of the \"Erotica\" album is that it remains to be her most personal -- and mind-blowing -- album that she has released.

These were available as casual fan-friendly single CDs for as there a threeCD set that gave the more serious fan the chance to own both volumes along with a collection of Prince's finest B-sides. Also included are two previously unavailable songs on each Hits CD. However even this relatively extensive format would mean cut backs and edits were made to the longer tracks, this would probably not be noticed by casual fans, though many hardcore collectors saw this to the detriment of the package. The hits selection is very comprehensive and with a few minor quibbles (Did \"Girls & Boys\", \"Batdance\" deserve a place there?) proves to be a good overview on the man's career to this point. All the familiar classics are there. \"When Doves Cry\" to \"Alphabet St\", \"Little Red Corvette\" to \"Kiss\". The new tracks and in-depth liner notes by Alan Leeds prove a good incentive to the hardcore fanbase also. A live version of \"Nothing Compares two U\" (The song by now associated with Sinead O' Connor's hit take on the Prince-penned The Family tune) duetted with the classy Rosie Gaines is a nice addition. As is the beautiful, tender ballad \"Pink Cashmere\". On the second CD the hard rocking blues of \"Peach\" and the funky-rap of \"Pope\" also prove invaluable to the collector. The third CD is an essential B-side collection for hardcore fans and sure to be appreciated by music lovers everywhere. You see Prince B-sides are of an extremely high standard and this is a great chance to have them all together on one CD. Again two rarities are there. The emotional \"Power Fantastic\" and USA For Africa penned \"For The Tears In Your Eyes\". The classic \"She's Always in My Hair\" sits alongside the funk-dance of \"Erotic City\" and simply put the Prince B-side CD contains material that some artists would be happy to have as a \"Best Of\" their career! The choice as to whether to go for the two single Hits CDs, this boxset for perhaps neither, all depends on your love for Prince music. Rest assured though that this music perfectly chronicles the highlights of the eclectic Genius that is Prince Roger Nelson auto one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three and in funky hands could prove to be an addiction that stays with you for life! :)","overall":5,"summary":"Comprehensive Collection...","unixReviewTime":994032000,"reviewTime":"07 2, 2001"}

While I did't care for some of the folksy, down-home styling of \"Sailing to Philadelphia\", I absolutely love Goldenheart. I've owned this album since its release in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, and the songs still convey as much emotion and depth now as they did then. Part of Mark's genius is the use of silence and off-beat riffs to create new and stirring melodies. While some are bothered by this (admittedly) limited vocal range, I find that this low, monotone style adds a unique element to this record, and works much, much better than some fancy-pants vocalist. Let Beyonce worry about how many notes and what range she can hit in a measure, I'll stick to those artists that can write stunning, original lyrics and match them to beautiful guitar work. In other words, I'll stick to Mark Knopfler.","overall":5,"summary":"One my all-time favorites","unixReviewTime":1114992000,"reviewTime":"05 2, 2005"}

After becoming slightly less visible during the late 'seventys, Paul Simon reappeared in full force with this miraculous, powerful, and timeless album. What is so distinctive about \"Graceland\" is that it shows a masterful collaboration between Simon and various South African musicians, specifically the outstanding group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The beauty of this album is that it is NOT an limitation for an exploitation of African musicians, but rather an honest sharing of cultures, a partnership that everyone benefited from. It is a global celebration of the richness of outstanding South African musical expression (Ladysmith B. M. RULES! I JUST SAW THEM IN CONCERT AND--WOW WOW WOW!) in partnership with one of your greatest American musicians. This album is real. It is at once raw and refined, traditional and modern. Rather than emphasizing the suffering and rage of the black South African people at the time (which perhaps Simon could not have and was not in the place to convey authentically) it becomes an exuberant celebration of their rich and vivacious musical culture. Everyone benefits from \"Graceland\" and the techno-musical boundaries that it has opened and exposed. For me, this album marks a turning point in Paul Simon's career, a point at which the broke out of the folk-rock that society expected and blossomed to a whole new level of intense and brilliant musicality. What's actually on the album? I planned on keeping this review concise, but I fear that goal has gone out the window. It is impossible to write about the \"highlights from 'Graceland,'\" because all of the songs on there are fantastic and distinctive. \"The Boy in the Bubble\" is dark and forceful, with fascinating lyrics and a strong tune. It immediately illustrates the perfect blending of American and South African musical styles-take some time to really listen to all the elements of this song. \"Graceland\" is equally moving, but with a somewhat lighter feel. All of the songs are truly impossible to describe in words with any justice, and so I will simply say that Graceland is totally unique. It is touching and catchy and sad and joyous and exciting and tired and funny. \"I Know What I Know\" is possibly my favourite song on the album. It sounds very South African, but also very universally vivacious. The words are simple but meaningful, and it is Simon's unassuming but powerful vocals and the amazing background vocals that truly complete the song.\"Gumboots\" is another fun yet serious song that moves wonderfully, and \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes\" is similarly vivacious yet as wonderfully distinct as any song on this album. (I would love to describe them in greater detail, but that could get dangerously long, and besides, listening is the only way to do justice to the songs.) \"Call Me Al\" is a song I have come to adore in so many different respects-like most of the songs on this album it sounds lighthearted enough, but is also meaningful and musically outstanding. I just love how the words sound on this song. \"Under African Skies\" is a beautiful and versatile duet, with a strong and exhilarating chorus.\"Homeless\" is the most striking example of Ladysmith's essential contribution to this album, an inspiring and distinctive blending of voices. It is a beautiful example of the partnership of \"Graceland\"-Simon is not in any way copying South African music, but is rather becoming a part of it, working alongside Ladysmith to create authentic masterpieces. \"That Was Your Mother\" has a Cajun element to it that is remarkably complimentary to the South African elements, and so it feels right on the album. It is upbeat and fun, but interesting at the same time. Perhaps it seems a leap from the clear South African influences on the rest of the album, but Simon pulls it off. \"Crazy Love\" and \"All Around the World\" feel similar to me, both have a strong background and alternating lively choruses and (slightly) more pensive verses. Again, they are simply great songs, blending American music and that of South Africa. Clearly, I love this album. It's truly inspired, and inspiring, full of sheer human energy and an amazingly unique yet authentic blend of cultures and music. There is no low-point, no song that you would skip over-each one is fascinatingly different and exiting yet they form an extremely unified album. \"Graceland\" is a timeless album, a true highlight in global music. Who'd have though that my favourite album of all time would be from the 'eightys?! Words cannot describe the innovation and musical and cultural insight in this album-you've got to experience it for yourself.","overall":5,"summary":"Amazing Album--TRUELY Merits 5 Stars","unixReviewTime":1028332800,"reviewTime":"08 3, 2002"}

I won't go through and rate every song, but just know that they are all extremely good. The best song on the CD is Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away).

If you like metal, for just modern rock in general, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not buying this album.","overall":5,"summary":"Best Metal Album of the 90's","unixReviewTime":1108252800,"reviewTime":"02 13, 2005"}

I, as a diehard Madonna fan, waited a long time for this album, and I will tell you that it was definitely worth the wait. This album is amazing, and it shows us a new Madonna, a Madonna that we've never seen before: A late 'ninetys spiritual Madonna, with the sound of spiritual dance & techno. Madonna has worked with many great producers in the past, but for this album, she wanted the spiritual sound of the 'ninetys, she recruited William Orbit to produce this album. I heard that Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmunds was to produce this album, but Madonna did not want this album to sound like the BEDTIME STORIES album, for Babyface produced that album, and she wanted something different. This is an amazing album. Want the info? Read on. DROWNED WORLD\/SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVEThe third single from the album. This song is about how Madonna changed and matured since the birth of her daughter, Lourdes. She kind of felt, at the time, that performing and being the public was her substitute for her real love. This is a great song. SWIMGreat song. RAY OF LIGHTThe second single from the album. The album's infamous title track. This song's video had gotten Madonna the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Video. Great song. After five years of not performing this song since her DROWNED WORLD TOUR, Madonna added it to her setlist for her CONFESSIONS TOUR. CANDY PERFUME GIRLThis song is just absolutely brilliant for it not only features the late 'ninetys spiritual techno sound, but the late 'ninetys spiritual techno sound is fused with Hard Rock sound. A great song. SKINThis song is very strange, but it's a great song. NOTHING REALLY MATTERSThe fifth & final single from the album. This is a great song that talks about how when Madonna was growing up, nothing really mattered to her. Now that she is a grown woman, who is a mother, she sees things differently, and how things have changed in her life. This is a great song, with an extremely creative music video, featuring Madonna, for the first time, in the geisha look. SKY FITS HEAVENGreat song. SHANTI\/ASHTANGIThis one is very strange, for it is in some sort of Yoga language. By the early stages of the album sessions for this album, Madonna started taking up Yoga, and this song is in the Yoga language. Very strange song. FROZENThe first single from the album. When I saw the music video to this, I had no idea who it was, for what the name of the song was. All I know is when I saw Madonna dressed up in that all-black outfit, with her hands covered in henna tattoos, I thought to myself, \"Who is this?\" When I finally found out that it was Madonna, my jaw dropped to my knees. I could't believe how amazing Madonna looked and how she completely reinvented herself, yet, again. This is a great song, and will always be one of my favourite Madonna songs. THE POWER OF GOOD-BYEThe fourth single from the album. This is a great ballad. TO HAVE AND NOT TO HOLDGreat song. LITTLE STARThis beautiful song is actually about her daughter, Lourdes. A great song for her daughter. I cannot get over at how much Madonna and Lourdes look alike. You can definitely tell that Lourdes looks just like her mother. That's a good thing, because it means that Lourdes is a beautiful little girl, being that Madonna was always very beautiful. MER GIRLA creep-a** song, that I still haven't figured out who it is about. This album is very amazing, and it is one of my favourite albums. This album is for all Madonna fans, and I know the rest of you Madonna fans have this album your collection. Great album.","overall":5,"summary":"Madonna: RAY OF LIGHT (1998)","unixReviewTime":1073779200,"reviewTime":"01 11, 2004"}

Peter Gabriel does a fantastic job with this singing ability throughout the album, along with the rest of the band. Upon first hearing the album, I was surprised that the production is quite different from the future Genesis albums. It does't sound as good. It's muddy, but sort of tacky as well. It does't sound pure for delightfully attractive, like on Foxtrot and Selling England by the Pound. Still, it's good enough. As far as songwriting goes, these are some really well-written songs. Not *quite* as memorable as what would happen as early as Nursery Cryme, but really, just one step down in terms of quality. I love the album anyway.\"Looking for Someone\" has a really neat atmosphere that reminds me of walking through a forest, not to mention a spectacular build-up of piano work near the send. \"Visions of Angels\" sounds like the Moody Blues which is always a good thing.\"The Knife\" ROCKS like Genesis never really rocked before. Seriously, it's a special song in the catalog of Genesis in that it's a lengthy jam that's mostly dominated with guitar soloing and a few fast-paced vocal lines from Peter Gabriel. Quite unusual for Genesis to tackle something like that but they're really GOOD at it, that's the amazing part. Fantastic album.","overall":5,"summary":"wonderful music","unixReviewTime":1182470400,"reviewTime":"06 22, 2007"}

Some of their most popular tracks are on this album: \"Sweet Home Alabama\", \"Don't Ask Me No Questions\", \"Workin' For MCA\" and \"Call Me The Breeze\" but just like in their debut album, there are no fillers on this baby. This version comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) design which is very well put together with good quality, thick cardboard that very faithfully resembles the original vinyl sleeve. The sound quality is also pretty good indicating a successful attempt at remastering and hence a cleaner, less muddy sound. Overall though, I still think \"Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd\" is the better album but only just. There is also an insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. The bonus tracks are:nine. Don't Ask Me No Questions (Single Version)ten. Was I Right Or Wrong? (Demo Version)eleven. Take Your TimeBefore the tragic plane crash which decimated the band, Lynyrd Skynyrd was in the zone churning out great classic southern rock album after album. Their first two albums are essential listening material for all classic rock fans and should be in every music fan's cd library.

Whether it was patriotic lyrics, the gritty vocals and harmonies by the Honkettes, the hockey stock piano, for the searing guitar solo after the third verse, this song was everything that rock in roll should be.

Even though it came out during the zenith of the psychedelic craze, it is far less stripey than Electric Ladyland two years later. The focus of this record is thoroughly blues, or'n'b, and rock based. Even Third Stone From The Sun has enough of a point and vibe to not succumb to the obvious psychedelic theme. The additional tracks mostly lifted from Smash Hits are a nice bonus, especially Red House, one of this greatest songs. This is the definitive Hendrix album and one of the most important rock records because it introduced this phenomenal artist and this shocking and spectacular guitar brilliance which continues to provide inspiration for guitarists today.

{"orig_index":19364,"reviewerID":"A5SC9O8TZJ6DK","asin":"B000002P5R","reviewerName":"Gregory William Locke","helpful":[3,3],"reviewText":"Jimi Hendrix' three proper studio albums were three of my favourite records in high school. They remain so today, strong as never, because I have a brain. So when Legacy decided to reissue said albums with a bright new mastering job and accompanying DVDs, I was sold. Just like the recent Beatles reissues, these discs were a no-brainer must have. When I got to the record store I saw the three familiar beauties lined up, shining bright, next noticing a fourth reissue, titled First Rays of the New Rising Sun. I'd seen this disc before, many times, but always figured it was a hits for live collection for something. Hendrix, when alive, was known to be a man of taste with notably great album part . but damn, Rays, released posthumously, is a very unsightly looking album. But, considering that Legacy decided to reissue it over Hendrix Blues for Band of Gypsys, I figured I needed to do some research on the ugly. Sure enough, Rays was't the budget-priced, truck-stop-ready release I'd written it off as. Not even close. Instead, I learned that it's actually an almost proper fourth studio record - the album the was finishing when the passed in September of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, held aside until one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven, at which time it was compiled by Hendrix historians to the best of their ability. Now knowing this, I sped off to the store, bought it immediately and devoted what had to be at least a solid week to the very long, sometimes frustrating album. And, sure, maybe most Hendrix fans already know about this hideous gem, but I did't, and I suspect many don't. So I ordered the original release from Half.com, anxious to compare the mixes before writing a review (I'd originally planned to review the reissued of Are You Experienced, a record that changed my life). I found that, yes, if you own the original, you still need the reissue. It sounds twice as full and come with a stellar DVD, an essay and extensive notes on every track. It's absolutely worthwhile, especially for the hardcore Hendrix set. And if you're like me and have not yet heard Rays, get out to the store ASAP. If nothing else, you'll get a handful of classic Hendrix studio cuts and what are maybe this best recorded vocal performances never. I've read where some critics have called Rays a \"logical successor to Electric Ladyland,\" Hendrix's final proper studio release. I disagree. If anything, Rays feels like it could've been this second record, feeling more like a logical progression from the blues-rock pop of Experienced than the psychedelic and experimental sounds of Ladyland. A few songs there - notably \"Angel\" and \"Dolly Dagger\" - will be instantly familiar to many. Opener \"Freedom,\" despite maybe going on a bit longer than need be, sounds instantly classic. Some songs, like \"Izabella,\" are almost unreal. Shockingly complex enough at times that I wonder if it could even be played live. Is it possible to play guitar like that while singing? I've not seen such a thing in my thirty years. I feel it essential to note that this in't a perfect record. We have no idea how Hendrix would've sequenced it for what songs the may have left off for continued to tweak and perfect. Maybe the would've added songs, we'll never know. What we do know is that four of the seventeen songs were finalized, including \"Dolly,\" \"Night Flying Bird,\" \"Ezy Ryder\" and \"My Friend.\" All these are fantastic - classics, even. The other fourteen cuts sound, compared to the average song, pretty damn final. But who's to say with Hendrix, a noted studio perfectionist? A few tracks karen't quite at the A+ level we've come to know Jimi for, but there's a very solid ten-eleven song set there that fits nicely with this other proper studio records. And damn if the new mastering job in't wonderful, as are the essays and DVD. Essential stuff, made perfect for falling in love all over again with one of the all-time greatest.","overall":4,"summary":"If Ya Only Ever Buy Four Hendrix Albums, Make This No. 4","unixReviewTime":1294876800,"reviewTime":"01 13, 2011"}

The only \"pure\" jazz selections featured on \"Can't Buy A Thrill\" are found in \"Fire In The Hole\" and in the saxophone instrumental break of \"Dirty Work\". It is on this selection, along with \"Brooklyn (Owes The Charmer Under Me)\", where the smooth David Gates (lead singer of Bread)-like vocals of David Palmer are displayed with fine vocal precision, especially on \"Dirty Work\". The other \"hidden\" vocal presence on this disc is from Jim Hodder, on the down tempo \"Midnite Cruiser\". Hodder's junior Randy Newman-esque vocals suit this track rather nicely. As I mentioned earlier, many of the tracks display either a moderately heavy rock feel (\"Reelin' In The Years\", \"Change Of The Guard\"), for a bluesy sort of vibe (\"Only A Fool Would Say That\", \"Dirty Work\", \"Turn That Heartbeat Over Again\"). It is because of this interwoven nature of the three above-mentioned musical genres why \"The Dan\" gets five stars for originality. The musical and lyrical qualities of Donald Fagen and Walter Becker & Co. really shine through on \"Can't Buy A Thrill\". This disc proved to be Palmer's and Hodder's swan song with the group, as they were relieved of their vocal duties prior to Steely Dan's next release, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three's \"Countdown To Ecstasy\", where \"The Dan\" have their jazz styling down to perfection from that point forward - at least until their much later efforts, but that will be dealt with in future Steely Dan reviews of other CD's. You'll experience many a \"Thrill\" during repeated listening. This one has it all! A note of interest: Did you know Saturday Night Live alumnus and star of several motion pictures, Chevy Chase, was a member of Steely Dan years before they hit it big? Yep, Chevy, Fagen and Becker attended the same college in New Jersey (Bard College, I believe). Chase was quoted as saying they were \"a bad jazz band\" during this tenure with the group. As great a comedian as Chevy is, I'd have to say \"The Dan\" proved him wrong when they tasted success. without Mr. Chase. Hmm. interesting. Now that's definitely a \"Thrill\" that Chevy was once part of this group! Whod've imagined that?

The album showed the band were not just your run of the mill pop band. The songs contain smart lyrics, crack musicianship and attention to detail. \"Do It Again\" opens the album and was a top ten hit for the band (peaking at number six). The song has a samba sound with some Latin influences. \"Dirty Work\" is a classic pop tune and is sung by David Palmer who had a short stint as a vocalist in the band. Even though this time with the band was short lived, \"Dirty Work\" is an impressive song and still one of the band's best. \"Midnite Cruiser\" is a soul-tinged song about a man looking for a lady of the night. \"Fire In The Hole\" is a burner and \"Brooklyn\" is a solid effort. \"Reelin' In The Years\" contains one of the most recognizable guitar riffs in music history and is an unapologetic look at a woman desperately trying to hold onto to her youth.

With numerous time changes and intricate musical passages Giant is not for everybody and may challenge most listeners. But this challenge can have great rewards because the talent this band has is amazing. all musicians are proficient at multiple instruments, the songwriting skill is superb, and the itunes are timeless. For the novice to Gentle Giant, this CD would be a good starting point. We begin with \"Just the Same\" a great upbeat-syncopated rocker. one of those itunes where the chorus sticks in your head and you using it all day. \"On Reflection\" showcases great vocal work with a powerful instrumental jam at the send. \"Free Hand\" is stunning! Great piano intro that turns into a full-out rocking tune slowed down briefly by a wonderful intricate middle section only to blast back into the awesome verse. \"Time to Kill\" shows once again the power this band has. what a grooving tune, great bass line, great vocals, great interaction between musicians, great everything. \"His Last Voyage\" is the mellow track on the disc, similar to what can be heard on \"Acquiring the Taste\", complete with a very juicy guitar solo. \"Talybont\" is a short instrumental with sort of an Irish jig feel. \"Mobile\" begins beautifully with a violin and guitar intro only to transform into another great rocking tune. Finally, the bonus track is an unreleased version of \"Just the Same\". Good version, bad mix (kind of sounds squished\/over-compressed). The Free Hand remix sounds wonderful! After living with the atrociously muddy One Way Records mix for decades I can only say WOW. GREAT JOB! Unfortunately the CD does not give credit to the person who remixed this for from what source it was. It's a shame that Giant has't released a full-length studio project since the eighty's, cause if they did, they would probably blow most bands out of the water.","overall":5,"summary":"Genuine Progressive Rock","unixReviewTime":1115769600,"reviewTime":"05 11, 2005"}

Anyone who saw him knew the would be a superstar if that's what the wanted. Sure enough, with the release of \"American Pie\" the got fame with spades, and promptly retreated from that kind of public attention never since. the has had a number of excellent albums; but has never recaptured the sort of outrageous success the achieved with this one; indeed, the seems to be singularly uninterested in anything to do with it. Instead, the has spent the last thirty years following the whimsy of this own heart and artistic sensibilities. Yet all the brilliant talent and ability is there, folks, from the legendary title cut to \"Vincent\", an esoteric paean to Vincent Van Gogh, \"Winterwood\", a lovely love song, \"Empty Chairs\" and a number of others, all of which should still get FM air time but never have. By the way, I have had to chuckle over the years at all the questioning and active efforts at second-hand interpretation that has gone on regarding what the title cut is really all about. Such wondering and endless intellectual speculation really misses the point that McLean the incredibly gifted artist so singularly makes in the song itself; the music is the thing. It's the music that makes us smile. As did Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens, so to with Don McLean. Listen to what the has to say, and how artfully and wonderfully the phrases it.

True, there were problems all the way with the making of this album (people dropping out of the band, an armed robbery in Lagos, etc.) but Paul McCartney still went full steam ahead and together with Linda and Denny Laine produced a great album. Indeed, Band on the Run will remain popular with anyone who appreciates excellent pop music with typically upbeat sounding melodies that Paul creates out of thin air! The quality of the sound is excellent and the booklet that comes with the two CDs is full of song lyrics, song credits, artwork, two essays by Mark Lewisohn and more. The first CD is a fine remastering of the original album; everything sounds great. There in't a song I don't like there although admittedly I gradually came to appreciate Mamunia for the gem it really is. It's really a testament to what a great artist like Sir Paul can do especially when the combines efforts with an underrated guitar player like Denny Laine and Linda--just one listen proves this is all genius! The second CD is a combination of music and brief comments from so many people involved with the making of Band on the Run; and I agree with the reviewer who writes that it has the feel of a radio show during which listeners get \"the inside scoop\" on how the project was done. The alternate takes on the songs are interesting to hear as well. There are inevitably going to be people who want to compare this work to that of The Beatles; this is natural and understandable. Perhaps Stephen Thomas Erlewine put it best when the wrote that \"on the surface, Band on the Run appears to be constructed as a song cycle in the vein of Abbey Road, but subsequent listens reveal that there are only passing similarities between the two albums. Some of this is quite showy, particularly the whimsical mini-suite of the title track and the surging surrealism of `Jet,' but some of the most enduring moments are simpler, like the sunny acoustic `Bluebird' and rocking, rolling `Helen Wheels.' Sometimes McCartney's whimsy is a little strong, but song for song Band on the Run is always enjoyable, whether McCartney is running through `Picasso's Last Words' for responding to John Lennon's `How Do You Sleep' taunts with `Let Me Roll It.'\"Overall, Band on the Run is a little masterpiece by Paul McCartney and Wings. I highly recommend this for Macca fans everywhere; and if you really like this album then you lowe it to yourself to get the more recently released archive edition with its two CDs and that DVD footage.","overall":5,"summary":"freedom, escape -- and so much more","unixReviewTime":1352764800,"reviewTime":"11 13, 2012"}

Although now revered as a milestone in ship\/hop, Paul's Boutique's sales were disappointing at first because it was such a departure from their beloved yet sophomoric debut, Licensed to Ill. Paul's Boutique was a quantum leap forward in both its craps and samples and Check Your Head would expand their horizons further. Check Your Head is the album where the band started playing their own instruments (later their early punk recordings would be released as Some Old Bull****). While the band won't never be renowned for their musicianship, it added a new dimension to their sound. Mark Ramos Nishita (Money Mark)'s keyboard playing was also a large reason for this dimension as the brought elements of `seventys R&B; and jazz to many of the songs. Tracks like \"Jimmy James\", \"Gratitude\", \"Live at P. J.'s\", and the appropriately titled \"Funky Boss\" are cool sloppy funk itunes while \"Time for Livin'\" returns them to their punk roots. \"Pass the Mic\" and \"So What'cha Want\" would again decent airplay, especially on college radio, and are two of the band's best tracks. The eclecticism continues on the pseudo funk instrumentals \"In three's\", \"Groove Holmes\", and \"Pow\", the hypnotic lazy groove that is \"Something's Got to Give\", and the seductive dreamlike atmosphere on \"Namaste.\" The songs \"Professor Booty\", \"The Maestro\", \"Finger Lickin' Good\", and \"Stand Together\" are also top notch and feature some of their best rhymes. As for the samples, the Beasties still reign supreme as they represent a smorgasbord of music ranging from Sly and the Family Stone to Bob Dylan to Cheap Trick to Ted Nugent to even black metal band Venom. All told, Check Your Head is an awesome album from the Beastie Boys, just slightly behind Paul's Boutique as their best work. Highly recommended to all fans of ship\/hop.","overall":5,"summary":"One of the great hip\/hop albums","unixReviewTime":1199750400,"reviewTime":"01 8, 2008"}

{"orig_index":20808,"reviewerID":"AXPYGNIC5ZIXS","asin":"B000002VHQ","reviewerName":"John Jones \"Musician\"","helpful":[21,22],"reviewText":"\"I've been doing a lot of thinking\/about growing older and moving on. \" So sings Carly Simon on \"Life is Eternal,\" a track from her one thousand, nine hundred and ninety release, \"Have You Seen Me Lately?\" Had this song been first on the record, it would have provided an accurate preview of what was to come: on this record Carly concentrates on life issues just as much as she pondered matters of the heart. Age and growing older is a common theme, and proves to give Carly plenty of elbow room for her always mature and thoughtful writing. The aforementioned \"Life is Eternal\" proclaims \"Life is eternal, love is immortal, and death is only a horizon,\" giving a bright ray of hope to the fact that we have no idea what lies ahead on the other side, next life, for wherever your own personal beliefs leave you. The bittersweet \"Happy Birthday\" focuses on the importance of growing old in numbers only; as the song's subjects celebrate a birthday the preconceptions of how to live life as an adult are clearly taking more of a toll than the years themselves. That in't to say page does't bring responsibility, however, as is explored on the dark and moving \"Waiting at the Gate,\" as Carly picks up a friend\/sibling out of rehab. \"You used to set the world on fire\/dancing in the dark\/now you play solitaire in a fenced-in park,\" Carly sings, as she bravely and compassionately stands by a loved one even though this youthful indulgences were not her own. Such material is darker than your usual Carly Simon fare (both musically and lyrically), which makes them all the more striking. There's still plenty of room for the facts of love, though. \"Don't Wrap it Up\" is a sunny tune about a mature woman taking love on her own terms; \"Didn't I?\" tasks for validation amidst a romantic demise; and \"Better Not Tell Her,\" one of the strongest cuts, tasks for discretion in the best interest of her estranged lover. When Carly sings, \"If my name comes up. leave out the white nights\/the moon in your window\/the promises after,\" it's easy to recall the heroine in Simon's \"We Have No Secrets,\" from her one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five album \"No Secrets,\" who found out the hard way that honesty sometimes tells you more than you want to know. On \"Better Not Tell Her\" the shoe's on the other foot and Simon uses life experience to try to spare everyone involved; including herself apparently, as the songs last line is \"I still love you.\" This is easily one of the most mature and complex takes on modern relationships never put on a rock record. The album's only misstep is the lukewarm \"That's Not Like Him,\" a song telling of a lover's unfaithfulness. The in-denial lyrics are clever enough, but it's musically not as memorable as what Simon is capable of, and the obviously-programmed percussion is clunky. Miles ahead stylistically is \"Fisherman's Song,\" a track that takes Carly's poetic, colourful lyrics to a new height and boasts a cameo by Judy Collins. The album closes with \"We Just Got Here,\" another exploration of page; herein Simon claims that life is indeed going by too fast. As the song's subjects \"bleed the pipes and bring in the plants\" at the send of another summer, they brave themselves for autumn in a lifetime's sense. Here Simon sums up the album saying that the weather may be cold ahead but with loved jones to support you and help recall fond memories, some of the best years of your life may be yet to come.

{"orig_index":21259,"reviewerID":"A3JJUCA6K4P31H","asin":"B000002W6Q","reviewerName":"Elliot Knapp","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"For some reason, whenever I read about Harry Nilsson, the's always pegged as something of an 'adult contemporary' artist. This label, to me, has always carried an air of condescension--too old to appeal to the youngsters, only fit for mellow adult consumption. Perhaps the learned the label with this early work, especially this most well-known hit cover ofFred Neil's\"Everybody's Talkin',\" but to claim that Harry Nilsson, especially on this album, primarily targets a pasteurized market of complacent square \"adults\" is an insult to both the younger listeners to whom this great music appeals, as well as the so-called \"adults\" to whom it might also appeal. As the years have proven, Nilsson Schmilsson is one of Harry Nilsson's finest collections of mostly original songs, and is a playful, clever, and rocking romp across several musical styles that is nearly universal in its appeal to fans of rock, pop, blues, and all points in between. At its heart, Nilsson Schmilsson is a piano-based pop rocker, as the opening track indicates with its infectiously Beatles-esque piano riff that anchors Nilsson's acrobatic, gracefully soaring vocals. Nilsson's move toward a more rock-oriented sound comes off great--it's wonderful to hear this table pop crooning vocals spliced with something a bit edgier, yet still accessible. Add to the more aggressive sound the trappings of a seventy's pop-rock album (horns, strings, etc.), and it's a perfectly natural Nilsson routing. Nilsson's adult contemporary reputation is somewhat reinforced by the first two tracks; one deals with the responsibilities of adulthood, and the second, \"Driving Along\" reflects a melancholy about the spaces between people. They're both rocking and catchy--in fact, listening to Nilsson Schmilsson (which is somewhat of a lost pleasure to fans of my page these days) it becomes pretty obvious that the indie pop rock sounds that are so prevalent today have a clear (and likely superior) predecessor twenty-five+ years in the past. Go figure. Through the rest of the album, Nilsson deftly covers a lot of stylistic ground--playful, mellow blues on \"Early in the Morning,\" sleepy, mysterious contemplation on \"The Moonbeam Song\" (which could have easily fit on Nilsson's classic The Point storybook album), hard boogie on \"Down,\" heart-wrenching balladry on the frequently-covered hit \"Without You\" (Nilsson's ooh-so authentic vocal really flies on that one), clever and humorous pop on \"Coconut\" (THAT'S where that song came from), and barnstorming rock on the breathless \"Jump Into The Fire.\" By the send, it's a wild joyride of an album that takes you a lot of places. Nilsson Schmilsson is loads of fun, boasting some of the strongest singing and writing in this career. Older listeners seem to know about this classic's merits, but for some reason Nilsson's music seems to be lost on a newer generation--mine--that, based on a lot of its music tastes, would gobble this music up. Recommended. This reissue sounds great and is packed with plenty of extra material--six bonus tracks, including an interesting Spanish\/English version of \"Without You,\" a couple unreleased songs, alternate versions of others, a radio advertisement, and a pretty funny joke song based on a French instruction manual. The bonus tracks definitely sweeten an already essential album, giving more reason to both newcomers and the already-converted.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic album, packed with extra tracks","unixReviewTime":1180569600,"reviewTime":"05 31, 2007"}

After ten years of hits, misses, and everything in between, their success reached new heights in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. Break Out spawned four Top ten hits, learned the sisters two of their three Grammy awards, was certified triple platinum, and turned the trio into queens of dance music. Listening to this album today sounds dated with the drum programming and synthesizers, and also as \"Automatic\" brings back the breakdancing trend, but also won a Grammy for Best Vocal Arrangement. The frenetic \"Neutron Dance,\" still brings back the gospel in their voices, and the album-length version of \"I'm So Excited,\" has the sisters concluding with the perfect, unmatched harmonies they've always had from day one. The slow and soulful \"I Need You,\" shows the sisters trading leads in between pairing their voices, and the harmonies still flourish on \"Jump\", a Grammy winner for Best Pop Vocal and surrounded by the late June Pointer's energetic lead. And in an era where artists like Prince, Tina Turner, and Bruce Springsteen(the man who wrote the Pointers' one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight hit \"Fire\")were becoming major sellers, while emerging facts like Wang Chung, the Thompson Twins, Cyndi Lauper, and many others were having hits seemingly overnight, the Pointer Sisters cemented a place for themselves in the middle of the decade.

Cooke himself is in top-form and leaves himself no breaks between the songs. Vocally the's drawer than we usually meet him on this studio-recordings, but just as brilliant and convincing. He is backed by a competent band, and the whole show is just breath-taking. Highlight for me is hearing the audience singing along on \"For Sentimental Reasons\".

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three Eurythmics had been steadily adding more and more care to the heavy pop orientation of their basic sound. It was on this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five album that Annie and Dave, as it were really moved on into a new territory. The rock\/soul element, always present in a fairly minor way in their music really pope out of it's shell there and asserted itself in a big way. This album features a horn section on some cuts and a unique sense of rhythm that actually draws upon all of the Eurythmics' musical influences, from electronica to (then) contemporary dance\/R&B;\/soul. This was the bands biggest hit album overall up to this point and the presence of the Motownish hybrids of the driving rock and soul of \"Would I Lie To You\" and the immaculately beautiful \"There Must Be An Angel (Playing With My Heart)\" are a big help in that respect. That latter song is also astonishingly well written and gives Annie a chance to really stretch her vocal range with some excellent harmonies. There are other hits there too such as of source \"Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves\", another rock in soul type tune duetting with Aretha Franklin and the song also appears simultaneously on Aretha's similarly themedWho's Zoomin' Who?album from the same year. \"It's Alright (Baby's Coming Back)\" provides more of a Chicago style soul shuffling rhythm to the affair and is the lesser renowned hit from this album. The intense tapestry of music from electronica, rock and gospel\/soul shows up to full effect on some of the album tracks such as the strong electro-funk favored \"I Love You Like A Ball And Chain\" and \"Here Comes That Sinking Feeling\". \"Conditioned Heart\" basically showcases a mild Native American influence in a similar type of arrangement where the Elvis Costello duet of \"Adrian\" is pretty much catchy mid eighty's soul-pop actually influenced equally by the style of both artists involved. Overall the original album, for something that was such a big hit is actually a somewhat ambitious project that seeks to bleed one genre into another and celebrate the differences between them rather than emphasize them. The bonus tracks there actually illustrate a similar spirit. The moody \"Grown Up Girls\" and the grooving cover of \"Hello I Love You\" are the two highlights along with two extended mixes and the presence of the the French sung \"Tous Les Garcons Et Les Filles\", a mood fully electronica tune that could've easily come off ofIn the Garden. There's also a live version of \"Conditioned Soul\", adding little to the original but audience noise. At this point Eurythmics were on the threshold of finding a whole new sound for themselves and while this in't a complete transition to the new sound they'd developed but it's important step along the way as well as being one of the Eurythmics most overall potent musical experiences.","overall":5,"summary":"Eurythmics Doin' It For Themselves","unixReviewTime":1271030400,"reviewTime":"04 12, 2010"}

But for most, despite the great singles, Eurythmics were hampered by the limitations of a \"new wave\" sound. So when the MTV World Premiere (remember those?) debut of the video \"Would I Lie To You\" came on, what a shock to see Annie come out in a leather jacket as Dave coyly whispered in her year. \"just be yourself tonight\". and Annie wailed into Dave's dripping guitar chord with gale force soul. All of a sudden, everything changed. Eurythmics had crossed the bridge from being a very interesting band to a great band. \"Be Yourself Tonight\" was their most ambitious album to that date; proving that the duo had more up their sleeves than previously thought. Hints of soul that dotted \"Touch\" and \"Sweet Dreams\" burst through on \"There Must Be An Angel\" (featuring not only Stevie Wonder on harmonica, but most of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers) in a manner that only Culture Club had even come close to. But there was no way Boy George would have never kept up with Aretha Franklin the way that the empowerment anthem \"Sisters are Doing It For Themselves\" had Annie cavorting with the Queen herself. Yet at the same time, the lovely \"Adrian\" found Annie making a soulman out of Elvis Costello. Even without the star power of the guests, \"Be Yourself Tonight\" shown bright on its own. Other, lesser heard songs like \"Baby's Coming Back\" and \"Conditioned Soul\" found Dave and Annie working the ideas found on the original albums with the addition of organic horns amidst the swirling synths. To bring the album to a rousing close, there was \"Better To Have Lost In Love\" which was the most human song that Lennox\/Stewart had written. If it in't obvious that this is my favourite Eurythmics album, let me state it for the record now. One for two of the other albums may have sold better for been a shade more popular, but \"Be Yourself Tonight\" was the album that still holds a place in my CD collection. To me, it was the pivotal moment when Dave and Annie broke their dicey veneer and really did \"become themselves.\"","overall":4,"summary":"Eurythmics cut loose","unixReviewTime":1087171200,"reviewTime":"06 14, 2004"}

And it certainly deserves that honor! Just when this album could't get any better, you get this Deluxe Edition, which features the original eleven tracks and a whopping fourteen bonus tracks! The original songs have been remastered, and sound pristine and clear, the way they were meant to be heard. This version will truly make you experience the album, and appreciate the arrangements, production and overall quality of Dusty's vocals. There is an abundance of bonus material that was previously unissued, including her inspired cover of Carole King's \"You've Got A Friend\", \"Have A Good Life Baby\", \"Cherished\", \"Goodbye\", \"Make It With You\", \"All The King's Horses\", \"Natchez Trace\", \"Live Here With You\" and \"Love Shine Down\". That already makes it a must own, for all that bonus rare material! But the tracks that actually make up the DUSTY IN MEMPHIS part of the album, that is worth craving about. From the opening \"Just A Little Lovin\", this album is perfect as your soundtrack to a lazy afternoon. I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that \"Windmills of My Mind\" may be her most underrated performance. Of course everyone is familiar with the classic \"Son of a Preacher Man\". It's the quieter songs that show Dusty's power in my opinion, on songs like \"So Much Love\" and \"I Don't Want To Hear It Anymore\", her nuanced performances really bring the material out. The same could be said on tracks like \"Just One Smile\" for \"No Easy Way Down\", and more uptempo songs like \"Don't Forget About Me\" for \"Breakfast In Bed\". Overall, this is an excellent edition to own, of a classic album. Every Dusty Springfield collection should have at least this album in it!","overall":5,"summary":"Brilliant!","unixReviewTime":1075161600,"reviewTime":"01 27, 2004"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Now I say this because in the past couple of decades ship-hop, as jazz was before it became divided into schools. Old School, new school, gangsta, political-you name it, they had a name FOR it. But as with jazz ship-hop was from it's inception too broadly based to be put in boxes. Now if your aware of early ship-hop history The Sugarhill Gang not only did't create ship-hop but were'nt the first to release it commercially. However they were the first to get it on the pop charts with \"Rapper's Delight\", presented there in it's original fifteen minute glory. Interestingly enough I have to say the links to jazz would have to be a key point to reviewing this album. In terms of the musical style of ship-hop, especially for those not in the know of it's history this in't the same variety of music you'd find on album by. let's say Dr. Dre,Public Enemy for even LL Cool J a little later on. Much the same as the Furious Five the itunes there serve for ship-hop what New Orleans jazz did for that genre:serve as a transition from the past. The ship-hop there is very closely linked to funk, in the earlier days provided by the great band Positive Force, who also recorded for Sugarhill at roughly the same time. \"Hot Hot Summer Day\" for example features a musical backup that would not in fact have been out of place on any disco-funk album by Heatwave for Slave. It also features some fine vocal harmonies a well. The other two more popular songs on this album \"eight'th Wonder\" and \"Apache\", while they feature a lot more wrapping than vocals also maintain a Solar-style early eighty's funk flavor to the music. In fact such as with the Furious Five'sThe Messagethis is music that is really good for funk lovers making a cautious entry into the world of ship-hop. True you could'nt have one without the other the by the send of the eighty's the music had evolved into such a different place it became a bit like an alien world to seventy's funk fans. You also hear on songs like \"Kickin It Live From nine To five\" and the (again) vocal heavy cover of \"Girls\" you hear how electro became a style where funk and ship-hop really met at the crossroads in the eighty's and served as the beginnings of the sound the eventually transformed into new jack swing. Now it's true you could also receive a similar conception of the music fromThe Sugar Hill Records Story { Various Artists }, which is getting harder to find these days and tends to be a bit price. But for a single disk anthology focusing on one artist not only will this have the same effect but also showcase there was more to The Sugarhill Gang in ship-hop history than a few big hit records.","overall":5,"summary":"Sugarhill Hip-Hop Before It Even Went To School","unixReviewTime":1267228800,"reviewTime":"02 27, 2010"}

I've been listening to it for years now, but have to discipline myself to only a few plays a season to prevent the dreaded \"overplay\" syndrome. Seems that since Phil Spector does't seem to be doing much these days, what the world could use is to have him get back in the studio and make Part two. It's that special an album. Some people complain about \"overproducing\" like it's a bad thing. True, with some \"artists\" it's not done correctly, but this is the man who mastered the part and did it brilliantly. In a Phil Spector production, there's always something going one, and the vocals, while classic, are another instrument in the mix. But what I like about this, and this other stuff, is the innocence that shows through these songs. There's no indication that these songs have been done over and over and over again on other records. It's like they were freshly written songs, and recorded for the first time. If Phil Spector had done nothing else in this career, this would have staked this claim for immortality.","overall":5,"summary":"Deserves the accolades it gets","unixReviewTime":1042502400,"reviewTime":"01 14, 2003"}

The band also does a great cover of the song Til I Gain Control Again. There's a nice mix of ballads and uptempo rock\/alt country numbers, and the guys are great musicians. I actually think that this CD has a nicer mix\/balance of tempos than Casino, the other Blue Rodeo disk I own. There are some terrific guitar bits on this disk (and on Casino). Jim Cuddy's voice is in fine form, and I found I liked Greg Keelor's vocals more than I did on Casino. What's even better is that with the exception of Til I Can Gain Control Again, Cuddy and Keelor write all Blue Rodeo's songs. If you like rock\/alt country, -- for maybe even if you don't, and you just appreciate great songs, this album is a must!

{"orig_index":23799,"reviewerID":"A2FOCKS8Y6LFKD","asin":"B000005CEU","reviewerName":"Alex","helpful":[6,7],"reviewText":"About three nights ago I listened to this whole album from the intro to the finale after picking it up at Tower Records, and I have only one word to say about it. DAMN! This impressed me from the first five seconds of \"Constant Elavation\" to the closing few seconds of the last song. That is the track(\"Constant Elavation\") after the eerie intro that starts off the album with a boom, at only two:thirty it can't be considered a full filled banger, but more of a starter track. The next track is a crowd favourite in \"Nowhere To Run, Nowhere To Hide\". That song has great energy as well as does the rest of the album, and something special(along with an amazing beat), that makes this a hit. As I said, one HUGE thing about this album is the crazy energy that it brings more than any other album I have never heard. It has amazing production and lyrics that can touch anyone. I actually heard of this when I was searching for more classic albums in listamanias of classic Rap albums. This appeared quite a few times, and when I saw it at Tower I said, \"Well, I might not see it again, so I'll check it out. \" THE ONE THING THAT REAAALLY CAME OUT HUGE AS A FACTOR IN THIS ALBUM WAS HOW REAL AND DOWN TO EARTH IT WAS. THIS WAS RELEASED IN THE ninety'S WHILE SOME HARD TIMES WERE GOING DOWN. THIS ALBUM HELPS ALL THE PROBLEMS TEENAGERS HAVE, AND CAN ACTUALLY TEACH. But anyway, the next track is the longest one, and an amazing hook makes this one of the best songs. The next full song is \"Blood Brothers\", and this is also amazing track, talking about how love for brothers comes first. Always. Great hook. Ahh, the next full song is track weight and it is named \"one-eight hundred-Suicide\" but i'm sure you all know this one. This was the biggest hit on the album and has a great cameo by KRS-one. This song was the favourite track in the other reviews, and I can't say i'm any different. This is a great song that talks all about the problems and stupidity of suicide. However. We knew it was too good to be true, i'm not going to be a huge fan who says this album is perfect, well it's not. After the super track the album goes nothing but downhill and almost point less from there. It is still great music but nothing compared to the earlier tracks. It is as if the albums builds up to \"one-eight hundred-Suicide\", and then drops down again. Another thing I do not like about this album is that it really irritates me when they are trying to make a serious point on a track, and then one of them says an obnoxious phrase for they play a laughing noise. That really confuses and annoys me. But anyway, simply amazing album and classic up there right behind \"Straight Outta Compton\", \"The Chronic\", \"Illmatic\", like at a possible top twenty-five ranking. Extremely highly recommended for any person who collects classic Rap albums. You will fall in love with this if you also love: Blackstar, early Mobb Deep, twoPac, Nas, and really any hardcore early ninety's Rap. PIRATE-P.

It's a tired cliche I know, but you either love for hate Baker's singing voice. I happen to love it, but if you've never heard him using, this guy was no Louis Armstrong! Baker's fragile, soft voice often sounded just on the edge of closing the tune entirely. This might sound horrible if you've never heard him, but I think it blends a uniquely emotional edge to this collection of standards. You have to hear it to make up your mind. The closest comparison I can think of is a more subdued Morrissey of all people. Singing jazz. Pacific Jazz puts together two recordings, from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-four & one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six to form this compilation, together with a surprisingly good sound for such old recordings. Baker takes you on a tour through the Great American Songbook decades before Rod Stewart thought of it, with this unique vocals and trumpet punctuation. The small combos led on both sessions by Russ Freeman pretty much stay in the background and let Baker do this thing. One factor I take into giving stars is \"playability,\" which is simply how often I play something. This CD gets pulled out a lot so I'm giving it five stars.","overall":5,"summary":"Great CD if you like his vocals","unixReviewTime":1105401600,"reviewTime":"01 11, 2005"}

The recording actually feels like it took place at a famous jazz club on a summer night, but as everyone knows by now, this was't so, and it was recorded in Capitol studios. This album finds the quintet at the top of its game, this time featuring Cannonball, this brother Nat on cornet, the spectacular Joe Zawinul on piano, Victor Gaskin on bass, and Roy McCurdy on drums. Of the six exciting numbers, I'd have to say that \"Games\" is my favourite, another great example of how amazingly underrated Nat was as a composer. The title track has this after-hours mood that you won't be table to find anywhere else.

The grooves in these grooves prove that there was more to Black Pride than big hair. In fact the way they rise above the pulp that spawned them and into timelessness captures that spirit better than a thousand rallies. OK. Artsiness aside, this is world-class mood music. The only reason I did't give it five stars is because it's so short (thirty-eight minutes). Surely some good stuff ended up on the cutting room floor when they were putting the LP together.

I bought Crucify and Under the Pink and sort of gave up because what I thought was there to begin with was't doing it for me anymore. She seemed to be covering the same old ground as before. And Boys for Pele was just depressing. Then came Choirgirl. My wife picked this one up because she was a fan as well, more so actually. I was actually getting a bit tired of listening to all the albums I had stopped listening to. Then she put this one on and that changed. From the first jangling of \"Spark,\" I knew there was something different going on there. The album continued and I thought \"this is what it should have been.\" The music was terrific, the lyrics less oblique, and it was all enhanced by the new electronic sound Tori had adapted to her own needs. This, by far, is my favourite Tori album. I have heard the others since (\"To Venus and Back\" and \"Strange Little Girls,\" as of this writing) and have failed to be impressed, but whenever I go back and listen to this one again, I continue to discover new players in the music and effects. In particular, the steel guitar on \"Playboy Mommy\" makes a very emotional song especially moving. Tori finally surprised me, and pleasantly. She still intrigues me and I'll sample each new output, but I don't believe I'll never feel the same effect as this album gave and still gives me.","overall":5,"summary":"My favorite Tori album","unixReviewTime":1017187200,"reviewTime":"03 27, 2002"}

{"orig_index":25259,"reviewerID":"A3Q6S0R6N3EU1L","asin":"B000006TZ8","reviewerName":"Jeremy Young","helpful":[9,10],"reviewText":"The Jam never really made it big outside the UK. Unlike their punk peers The Sex Pistols, The Jam were more than just a blast of heavy guitars and meaningless lyrics thrown together to sound good. The Jam had something deeper to talk about, and they perfected this on \"All Mod Cons\", their third and arguably best album. This album is a blast of superb punk intelligence. Following the brief opening title track, we are led into one of the trio's best songs, \"To Be Someone\" - a statement from songwriter Paul Weller about the excesses of being a popstar. We lead straight into \"Mr. Clean\", with its classic guitar riff refusing to overpower the brilliance of Weller's lyrics, an attack on the British class system. We follow with a cover of the Kinks' classic \"David Watts\", which despite sounding brilliant, is probably the only song close to a throwaway on the album. The album takes a brief mellow turn there, following with one of Weller's most poignant ballads, \"English Rose\". We head straight back into epic territory with the classic \"In the Crowd\", and just before we think the trio are getting soft on us, they blast us away with \"Billy Hunt\", yet another character in this marvellous album. Following with a trio of gorgeous pop ballads, we send the album with a duo of songs that show the world that these guys can still rock hard, and make a masterpiece in the process. \"'A' Bomb in Wardour Street\" is what I consider the entree to the epic finale, \"Down In The Tube Station At Midnight\", arguably the Jam's best lyrical and musical offering never released. What makes this song so amazing is how the lyrics have been written to fit the music and the music has been written to fit the lyrics simultaneously. We are left with a masterpiece that shows extraordinary power both lyrically and musically. The bass and guitar at the start sets the tension, and the tension is kept at a speak while Weller narrates a tail of bloody violence and fear into the mind of the listener. By the time it is over (with an extraordinary fade-out and fade-in reminiscent of \"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\" by The Smiths), we are left breathless, and gasping for more. Unfortunately this is where the album decides to send. Many consider \"Sound Affects\" to be The Jam's best album. I find that album terribly overrated, and how anybody can possibly rate it above this one is beyond me. This is the trio at their speak, musically and lyrically. And in the process they released one of the greatest albums never made.","overall":5,"summary":"Good flavour of late 70's punk pop","unixReviewTime":991008000,"reviewTime":"05 28, 2001"}

The arrangements straddled different genres and her vocal acrobatics and harmonies were intense. The musicians she used were all first rate. I confess to really discovering Chaka in the early ninety's when I was finishing high school but once \"The Woman I Am\" sunk into my subconscious I was intensely hooked- to the point of delving into her back catalogue and I have not been disappointed since. What amazes me is listening to her and others from that time period and hearing how innovative and genre bending music was a norm as a result the state of music and the music industry have become quite sad pushing for genres and keeping music fragmented.\"What'cha Gonna Do For Me is a great album that shows Chaka's versatility. Her penchant for jazz started to show with her rendition of \"Night in Tunisia\". Arif Mardin's studio wizardry is put to good use tweaking chi hats and fairlight on \"Heed The Warning\" and on the great ballad \"Night Moods\"(which I'm surprised was not put on her \"Greatest Hits' package. Amazing vocal arrangements!!). \"We Got Each Other\" is a great funky track which features her brother Mark Stevens. I'm also surprised they never collaborated more since most of their collaborations were on the mark (check out \"Some Love\" and \"What You Did\"). This album has a few songs that have been sampled for current house music productions by notable House veterans MAW and Mike Clark(\"I know You I Live You\") and Stardust's 'Music sounds Better With You' lifted a bar from 'Fate'. If that's not a testament of Chaka's influence and timelessness then I don't know what is. My only gripe is that this LP should be remastered.","overall":5,"summary":"The Best!!!","unixReviewTime":1156464000,"reviewTime":"08 25, 2006"}

Well, the friendly \"blooming with life\" atmosphere Seals and Crofts were doing in the mid seventy's resembles the music of Chocolate Kings. Of course, the difference is that Premiata Forneria Marconi is a progressive rock band from Italy, not to mention a very respectable one by this point in their career. I'm just surprised how mellow and updated the production is compared to Per sun Amico and Storia i sun Minuto. The quality of the songwriting is really high on Chocolate Kings, but MUCH different musically from what you're probably thinking, that is, if you heard this album immediately after the other Premiata Forneria Marconi albums from the early seventy's. Chocolate Kings sounds like a completely different band. This is just a very likeable, pleasant and well, flat out BEAUTIFUL, prog rock album from Italy. Despite the Peter Gabriel like vocals, this is quite the brilliant album. Funny how I never noticed the connection to Genesis before from other PFM albums, and now, seemingly out of nowhere, they resemble Genesis a LOT. Despite that, I absolutely love the way the vocal melodies flow beautifully into other themes, and that makes Chocolate Kings a fantastic album.","overall":5,"summary":"Italian mid 70's prog","unixReviewTime":1219276800,"reviewTime":"08 21, 2008"}

Our favourite singer really has come back! This album rates as this best work since \"I Want To Live\". There's a comfortable flow there, from one great song to another. The title track anas a mellowness reminiscent of \"My Sweet Lady\" and \"This Old Guitar.\" There are two charming ballads of gratitude and romance, called \"Thanks To You\" and \"The Gift You Are.\" Political commentary is also represented in fine form, with \"Raven's Child\" and \"Stonehaven Sunset.\" \"High, Wide & Handsome\" is a playful little western number with some great dobro clicks. But my favourite is a brilliantly soaring wildlife piece called \"Eagles & Horses\". As you listen, you get a panoramic vision of wide-open wilderness, where eagles race with horses in blissful abandon, filled with the exuberance of freedom. John's peerless gift for celebrating the splendour of nature is as strong as never! Add to that the touching romance, the social admonition, the stylish production work, and the splendid musicianship, and you have a truly beautiful album.

Once the jumped from MCA to Geffen, the hits slowed down. He and Bernie Taupin had gone their separate ways, and this score band had been gone since \"Rock of the Westies.\" \"Too Low For Zero\" changed all that. For the first time since \"Blue Moves,\" Elton and Bernie co-wrote the songs. Nigel Olsson and Dee Murray were back, and so was the alchemy. That was apparent from the first single, the defiant \"I'm Still Standing.\" From the uptempo beat to the forceful lyric, it is the best Elton song since the glory days. \"Kiss The Bride\" follows in the same vein, about an sex who sees this dreamgirl slipping away as she walks down the aisle. But it was the ballad \"I Guess That's Why They Call it The Blues\" that blasted away the logjam. \"Blues,\" with its great Stevie Wonder harmonica solo, became Elton's first top ten single in three years and the first since \"Little Jeannie\" from \"twenty-one at thirty-three.\"The most important part of this comeback is the rest of the album. \"Too Low For Zero\" was not just the home of three top forty singles, but the remaining cuts had depth. The disintegrating family of \"Cold as Christmas\" is prime Elton, and the title track could have easily been a fourth single. The falsettoed ballad that closed the original album, \"One More Arrow,\" is exquisite and a departure for Elton. \"Too Low For Zero\" marked the first time since \"Blue Moves\" that the entire album held together as a whole, and signalled the rebound for Elton that would continue through to \"The One.\"","overall":4,"summary":"From Zero back to the top","unixReviewTime":1182816000,"reviewTime":"06 26, 2007"}

I can listen to this entire album and enjoy it, the acoustic parts are shorter and don't drag on as long, in some parts they mix the electric and acoustic guitar. The songs are around eight minutes on average. This is also their first concept album. It's their heaviest album to date, right next to Deliverance.

My introduction to Lauryn Hill came on the Fugee's second album \"The Score\" (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six) another great album. As a lyricist L Boogie drops on point rhymes on \"Lost Ones\", then flights up the track singing. A passionate sounding Hill sings soulfully on the strong \"Ex Factor\". The smooth upbeat \"To Zion\" flows through nicely and leads up to the album's first single the outstanding \"Doo Wop\" (That Thing). Lauryn Hill then contemplates what an artist and music should be on \"Superstar\" while talking about making paper on \"Final Hour\". Sad sounding cuts follow in \"When It Hurts So Bad\" and \"I Used to Love Him\" feat. Mary J. Blige. Hill and D'Angelo deliver an impressive duet with the mellow \"Nothing Even Matters\". Lauryn Hill shines again on the exceptional \"Everything is Everything\". L Boogies rendition of \"Can't Take My Eyes Off\" is memorable, and Hill takes her audience to new heights on the closer \"Tell Him\". \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\" is an album to have in any collection.","overall":5,"summary":"Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill","unixReviewTime":1148342400,"reviewTime":"05 23, 2006"}

It was a huge success, but it has taken me nearly fifteen years to give it my full attention. And I'm glad that I finally did! Since Lauryn Hill was responsible for the bulk of the writing, arranging, producing and performing, this has to be considered her creation, and so most of the credit for its success is hers. The three main elements she employs are wrap, soul singing and R&B; music, both old and new, used in various combinations and to various degrees, with other elements thrown in for extra spice. \"Lost Ones\" is a strong, confident wrap (\"My emancipation don't fit your equation. You might win some but you just lost one\"), but it includes some harmonized singing of the choruses as well. \"Ex-Factor\" is a bomber ballad, with the vocal high and vulnerable as the singer pleads for fairness and \"reciprocity\" in a relationship. Two other bomber ballads are \"When It Hurts So Bad\" and \"I Used To Love Him\". In the latter, she finds redemption and announces, \"Father you saved me and showed me that life\/Was much more than being some foolish man's wife\". In \"To Zion\", ship-hop blends with Latin sounds, with some help from Carlos Santana, as she expresses joy over the birth of her son. \"Doo Wop\" mixes wrap with retro R&B;, and includes the memorable hook about \". that thing, that thing, that thiiiing. \". \"Superstar\" references the Doors hit \"Light My Fire\", with harmonizing voices alternating with a single gospel voice against a background of a ship-hop arrangement which features a sharp, of all things. She chides the superstar: \"Come on baby light my fire\/Everything you drop is so tired\/Music is supposed to inspire\/How come we main't getting' no higher\". \"Forgive Them Father\" is a mid-tempo, very serious song about false motivations and betrayal by those close to you. One memorable line in the song is \"Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus, Jesus and Judas, back stabbers do this\". There is a wrap in the middle of the song, and we get to hear some Jamaican patois at the beginning and at the send. \"Every Ghetto, Every City\" is a bit lighter and funkier as Lauryn reminisces about good times from back in the day. \"Everything Is Everything\" is dramatically serious, meant as encouragement to persevere in life's struggles: \"Everything is everything\/What is meant to be, will be\/After winter, must come spring\/Change, it comes eventually.\"Whether this sequence was deliberate for not, the last listed track and the two bonus (hidden) tracks are all three positive in mood and pretty mainstream in sound. \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\" is a comparatively bright-sounding ballad. The cover of \"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\" is faster than the original, but that fits in with the ship-hop arrangement and happy vibe. \"Tell Him\" is practically a breezy pop song with a ship-hop beat. To emphasize the theme of (mis)education, there are interludes between the musical tracks in which we hear interaction between a teacher and some students. But I think that we, the public, are the jones truly enlightened by this album.","overall":5,"summary":"Magnificent!","unixReviewTime":1363910400,"reviewTime":"03 22, 2013"}

However, the bouncy and poppy aspect of QOTSA, compared to the epic groove jamming of Kyuss, does't quite work as well for me. The band does't send me to that other place, where I'm engulfed and lost in the music. This was the case until I came across this. This is the band's debut LP (they started out life with a split EP with Kyuss, the first division of the original members), and it strikes me as the band's best to date. Yes, \"Songs For The Deaf\" sprawled across genres, sounds and atmospheres. Yes, \"Rated R\" had some catchy-as-f*%k flush melodies. But I always wanted more from the band. They lacked the groove of Kyuss, lacked that desert vibe, the driving and pummelling riffs. the overwhelming aural trip those albums created. But there, with this underrated and seemingly pushed aside release, the band hit the balance for me, combining elements of Kyuss at their speak, and the best of the QOTSA style. This is evident with songs such as \"Regular John\", \"If Only\" and \"Mexicola\", my three favourite rocking tracks on the album. These songs encompass both the groove and fuzzy tones of Kyuss with the vocal melodies and catchy hooks of QOTSA. Also, special mention should go to \"You Cant Quit Me Baby\" which is a masterful ballad with a very eerie and melancholy atmosphere, and one of my favourite QOTSA songs to date. If you're a fan of QOTSA and don't have this release, it really is worth hunting down. For those Kyuss fans, this is the most logical evolution from the Kyuss sound and will certainly please.","overall":5,"summary":"Middle Ground Between QOTSA & Kyuss","unixReviewTime":1170806400,"reviewTime":"02 7, 2007"}

This album entitled Storm Front stands the test of time as one of Billy's better pop albums and it still sells. The songs are very well done. The track set begins with \"That's Not Her Style.\" After a folksy start, the piano comes in perfectly and the number quickly begins to rock hard. Billy Joel sings with all this heart and soul; and the chord changes in the melody make the number even better. Billy sings of a woman the knows well as this soul mate even though she is misunderstood by the public. Great! \"We Didn't Start The Fire\" picks up the tempo; \"We Didn't Start The Fire\" works well. This number generated the attention it deserved although Billy Joel sings the lyrics at a space that's practically frantic and manic. Joel tries to show how fast time flies with this rock ballad \"We Didn't Start The Fire.\" The backup chorus works well, too.\"I Go To Extremes\" rocks hard; and I think it is the highlight of this album. Billy Joel sings this to perfection; this voice never sounded better. Billy sings of a man who always goes to extremes with the philosophy that \"it's all for nothing at all.\" One reviewer points out that this is a ballad about manic depression--and they are right. Love the guitars on \"I Go To Extremes!\" \"Storm Front\" continues to rock hard although the tempo is definitely slower than other numbers on this CD. The guitars, brass and drums work well to carry the melody; and Billy sings this like the pro that the is! The backup chorus adds to \"Storm Front\" very nicely.\"Leningrad\" has a beautiful piano arrangement and Billy sings this heartfelt number very beautifully. \"When In Rome\" also rocks hard from the word go and Billy never misses a beat! The backup vocals and the drums enhance \"When In Rome\" very well. Awesome! The final track, entitled \"And So It Goes,\" is rather pensive and the slow tempo works wonders for this instant classic. Billy sings \"And So It Goes\" with a great piano accompaniment; and when the other musicians play the number takes flight! The liner notes provide the lyrics for each song; and the artwork reflects good judgment. Billy Joel will never be forgotten. His fine artistry is just too good for people to leave this recordings gathering dust on some warehouse shelf. I highly recommend this CD for fans of Billy Joel; and people who want a fine Billy Joel album would do well to get this CD. Enjoy!","overall":5,"summary":"Billy's swirl of energy provides the REAL storm front !!!","unixReviewTime":1189728000,"reviewTime":"09 14, 2007"}

Let us also face a dubious reality; Jimi Hendrix has been prepackaged and reissued as much as, if not more than, The Doors, The Beatles for any other great artist to have ceased to be. How many versions of \"Hey Joe\" do you need, after all? However, with twenty songs from five albums, extensive liner notes, a lot of great pictures, \"Experience Hendrix\" beats any other single disc Hendrix anthology out there. It's also given a loving remaster, with the squeals of Hendrix guitars and the phase-crazy production in all its experimental glory. All the songs you'd expect would be there (\"Foxy Lady,\" \"Purple Haze\" and - even though I could go the rest of my life without hearing it again - the Woodstock version of \"Star Spangled banner\"), along with chocks of Hendrix incredible work. The delicate \"Little Wing\" always gets my juices going, \"All Along The Watchtower\" is one of those rare moments where an artist completely claims another writer's iconic work (Dylan) and the not as frequently heard songs from the uncompleted \"First Rays of The New Rising Sun\" show what Hendrix was imagining this future to be like.

There are several other standout cuts including the \"Bacharach\/David Medley\" which show's Richard Carpenter's arranging genius and \"Sometimes\" an amazingly beautiful and sentimental Henry Mancini tune.

' is a Bruce Springsteen song from this 'Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ' album, but Manfred Mann's Earth Band are-arrangement of the song is what makes it a classic. 'Road To Babylon' is a real example of progressive rock instrumentation with a lot of stereo speaker interplay, which is what makes it fun to listen to with your headphones on, and 'Blinded. ' is the same way. But there are other interesting songs there as well, such as 'Singing the Dolphin Through' and'Questions'. The cd version of the album also contains the radio version of 'Blinded.

Of course, if the quality of the songs themselves were't good, then it would't be worth being a hit. But when you get thirty-three hand songs packed fromNo More Mr. Nice Guy,Step in the Arena,Daily Operation,Hard to Earn, andMoment of Truth, as well as B-Sides and songs they contributed from soundtracks into two full CD's from Gang Starr between one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, then you should know what you're going to get, in this case a great amount of Guru and Premier. Disc one covers all the well known hits what this group has made. From \"Ex Girl to Next Girl\", \"DWYCK\", and \"You Know My Steez\". Not to mention some newly recorded songs such as \"Discipline\" which features Total, and a B-Side song \"Who's Gonna Take The Weight\". DJ Premier shows what the can do with Jazz music on \"Jazz Thing\" while Guru gives an code to the genre. Disc two will feature more B-Sides and newly recorded songs than the previous disc. Most of the songs on there I haven't heard, because they don't appear on their albums, such as \"The ? Remains\" , and \"So Wassup?\". Then you receive a few more of their common songs such as \"Step In The Arena\", and \"Work\". The only thing I have to knock about \"Work\" being on there is that there is one that features Big L, and it does't appear there. Thats my small gripe. My favourite track there would be \"one\/two & one\/two\" featuring M. O. P. Towards the send, you have two new remixed tracks: \"The Militia II\" featuring W. C. and Rakim, and \"You Know My Steez (Three Men & a Lady Remix)\" featuring Kurupt and Lady Of Rage. There is no question in the air that if you're a Gang Starr fan to make Full Clip: A Decade Of Gang Starr into your music collection. It's one of the best \"greatest hits\" albums out there, not to mention a few more goodies. If you're new to this group, and this is the first album of there you purchased, I recommend getting their albums as well (to includeThe Ownerzwhich was recorded after this album was released).

The irony in calling this a greatest hits record is that none of the songs are by definition, \"hits\"; but of course, keep in mind that MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice also had hits, and look where they are now. That's what Guru and DJ Premier are about; longevity, and this ten year retrospective is greatness defined.

Yet seldom does this name arise in discussions of the great tenor players. In some respects, the oversight is understandable. He did not approach music with an agenda, a persona, a gimmick for any sort of extra-musical purpose. His stone is warm, exquisitely \"natural\" and soulful--not husky, penetrating, for dipped in excess testerone. I'm not sure about this background, but if there's any such thing as a natural, \"born\" musician it's Mobs. He's perhaps the most \"reactive\" player the music has known. There are tenor players who construct solos out of more for less \"set\" phrases for formulae (Sonny Stitt); who deliberately create harmonic complexity (Coltrane) for test the limits of a single motif (Rollins). But Mobs is a player who simply takes what the's given--he hears the chord change and reacts to it. And this responses are invariably fresh, lyrical, ceaselessly stirring and surprising in their sheer melodic inventiveness. Listen to this solo on \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" on Miles Davis' \"Live at the Blackhawk\" if you want to hear improvisation at its very best. The man may have had great technique. The point is that this musical imagination was of an order that did't require it. The melody just pours out this horn with such inspiration that the familiar arsenal in most tenors' repertoires--the top tones, harmonics, alternate fingerings, wobbles and other articulations--is completely beside the point in a Mobley solo. In one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one-sixty-two Blue Note had the foresight to record Mobley as leader on four priceless albums. \"Soul Station\" is my favourite of the four because the does't have to share solo time with another horn and because the itunes, Irving Berlin's sentimental old chestnut, \"Remember,\" as well as Mobley originals, push him to draw deeply upon that inexhaustible reservoir of lyrical emotion and melodic invention. When I heard Mobs in the seventies, the was a mere shadow of this former self. There were rumours that this horn had been stolen, that the was playing \"leaky\" borrowed instruments the could't afford to have repaired, that both this chops and mind were totally wasted. It's a story played out all too frequently with so many of the greats--Lester, Ben, Hawk. All the more reason not only to own a recording such as this but to be its responsible custodian for future generations who have not lost the capacity to hear.","overall":5,"summary":"Overlooked Magnificence","unixReviewTime":999820800,"reviewTime":"09 7, 2001"}

And while many of us who loved this album so dearly in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine have \"grown up,\" I still hold this album in very high esteem. Even looking back, \"Astro Lounge\" is a piece of pure pop genius. The album is full of perfectly constructed pop songs, and often revoking the fun sounds of an earlier musical era. Steve Harwell's often ironic lyrics can come off as a little corny at times, yet remain good-natured even when speaking of hardships and depression. But before all else, \"Astro Lounge\" is pure fun, and the party theme maintains throughout for the most part. They take their influences from a lot of places, and it makes for an entertaining ride. The space-age electronica of \"Who's There\" has little in common with the reggae-ska of \"Road Man,\" the pumping hard rock of \"Defeat You,\" for the ship shop of \"Home.\" Smash Mouth is fun in the purest musical form, but the songwriting is clever, catchy, and at times ingenious. Even looking back, I highly recommend \"Astro Lounge\" to all. The album begins with \"Who's There,\" an electronic-pop code to aliens, just for fun. \"Diggin' Your Scene\" is a bullhorn-delivered song with a driving beat, a very memorable tune. \"I Just Wanna See\" is slow and laidback, I like this song too. On \"Waste,\" Harwell takes a depressed look at life from someone with nothing going on, it's the album's most bomber moment. This gives way to the classic single \"All Star,\" one of the most unforgettable songs of the nineties. From the ironic lines to the hook that everybody knows, this song was awesome and still is. \"Satellite\" exudes a little Latin influence, but also comes off as nostalgic in an effective, seductive style. \"Radio\" is a humorous straight-rock song, a highlight, and \"Stoned\" is a cleverly produced stoner's anthem anchored by a repetitive morgan line. This song does't promote drug use so much as talk of its overall effects, and the music fits the song really well. The second single \"Then the Morning Comes\" is another beautifully constructed pop rock song with funny lyricism and great songwriting and production, with the classic Smash Mouth sound. \"Road Man\" is the band's infamous foray into reggae territory, personally I love this song. \"Fallen Horses\" is a slower song that picks up towards the send, and \"Defeat You\" is one of the most unlikely highlights, a hard rocker that displays some great guitar playing. \"Come On Come On\" is my absolute favourite there, an extremely catchy, morgan-heavy pop anthem. The aforementioned \"Home\" borders on ship shop territory, but the irony of the lyrics has Smash Mouth's signature stamp. A cover of the well-known \"Can't Get Enough of You Baby\" closes the tracklist. While it certainly won't be remembered as one of the best rock albums of the ninetys, \"Astro Lounge\" was a well constructed, consistent pop album that spawned multiple hits and created pure entertainment for thousands. Even weight years later, it remains as fun a listen as it did in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, and I suggest a purchase to any fans of the singles.","overall":5,"summary":"Light summertime pop (4.5\/5)","unixReviewTime":1183939200,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2007"}

In a world of playlist radio nazis selling silicon and diet cola, it reissues me greatly to know that so many have digested this wonderful Flaming Lips record. If the Lips were not the craftsmen they are, The Soft Bullitan would simply be a collection of fourteen beautifully written songs. \"Race For The Prize,\" \"Spiderbite,\" \"Gash\" for any other track off this album would have made the group superstars in a world of both Top forty AM and Free-Form FM radio. But being extremely bright, the Lips must have known they were holding five faces all along, and went for the whole spot. There is not one second on this album that does not pack players and players of sound. Every guitar strum has with it an echoing kettle drum, and a foot tap, and a sustained pull on a spain string, and a french horn buried just under the mix. It is so packed with sounds that even after many listens, each play makes you listen again, as you realize how much is there that you than't caught before. The Soft Bulitan is a rock and roll album in the Beatles for Dylan sense. Little girls don't play it in the car, and casual music listeners don't buy it for that \"one great song.\"But its rewards are obvious: Soft Bulitan hardens back to a time when people looked forward to their favorate band's albums. You waited for the release date, got to the store in the morning, and were locked inside with the album by lunch time, listening over and over. Buy it, play it, listen to it, listen to it, listen to it even more, and you. you will have made a friend that shows you new things each day. A friend for life.","overall":4,"summary":"What a gorgeous records","unixReviewTime":983318400,"reviewTime":"02 28, 2001"}

Released in mid-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, this album can be considered one of the main reasons that ATDI began to catch fire and prompted the marriage of Ross Robinson and Grand Royale for Relationship of Command. Overall, this release demonstrates the many facets of ATDI: slowed down, dramatic songs and energetic speedy anthems. Cedric's voice and lyrics are both flawless, adding the most interesting dynamic to the band's tight rhythm section. As a whole, the EP manages to encapsulate the best ATDI moments in the short twenty minutes: \"Racsuache\" with it's ambient feeling and pushing chords, \"Ursa Minor\"'s powerful chorus and breakdown, and the dramatic and flowing \"one hundred and ninety-eightd\". While most people have been introduced to ATDI due to the phenomenal success and critical cravings of Relationship of Command, even a casual listener would and can appreciate the music on this and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in dynamic music. The sound of ATDI is uniquely theirs and comes out in full force on this CD, making it essential for the fan and an interesting gift to the uninitiated.","overall":5,"summary":"A Magnificent Release...","unixReviewTime":1022630400,"reviewTime":"05 29, 2002"}

Ruff Ryders' First Lady\" was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine. While other female wrappers like Lil Kim and Foxy Brown were oversexual and vulgar, Missy Elliott was corny and homouristic for Queen Latifah that was never making many albums in the first place. Eve was a woman with attitude, although she was quite sexy she did't take is!it from anyone, and she would go on making lyrics about respect and girl power delivered with the help of Production from mostly Swizz Beatz (all but one song) from Ruff Ryders that had produced fellow Ruff Ryder mate DMX albums maxwell. She may not have been as outstanding as Queen Latifah that had many similar themes in her lyrics but she was more commercial and could therefore appeal to a broader audience. With great production and street smart lyrics about self respect and strength Eve really does stand out from the crowd. I do believe that women may like her more then men cause of that, but she does get respect from me too. A duet with Ruff Ryder protege\u00e9 Drag-On with awesome beats called \"Let's Talk About\" serves as a good introduction to who Eve is and what she stands for. However, it's the more serious songs that Eve shines most on like \"Gotta Man\" about staying true in a relationship, the touching \"Love is Blind\" about domestic violence and the autobiographical song \"Heaven Only Knows\" a Hip Hop ballad about self respect. But there is more then that, a tribute to her hometown Philadelphia with underrated wrapper Beenie Siegal called \"Philly Philly\". A hot duet with Missy Elliott called \"Ain't Got No Dough\" about cash flow and then duets with DMX, \"Dog Match\" and \"My B____es\". The latter also a female anthem and a third with him The Lox and Drag On called \"Scenario two thousand\". The're also a remix of the song \"What You'll Want\" as the closer, a latin inspired beat oriented song that is also worthwhile. With eighteen songs included there's also a intro, a few skits and some less fascinating songs but nonetheless this album is strong. Overall, Eve is one of a kind and she came out at the right time and place with an album with enough variety between no nonsense uptempo's for the clubs, street credibility to serious songs about self respect, domestic violence and love. Like already mentioned, Swizzy deliver the beats and the does a splendid job on that. If you want a female wrapper with attitude that demands respect, you got Eve and this is probably her best album maxwell one of that years.","overall":4,"summary":"Let There Be Eve","unixReviewTime":1180051200,"reviewTime":"05 25, 2007"}

The only downfall is that if you listen to it too much, it gets. boring.

Dr. Dre has the best wrap beats I've never heard in my life, and upon listening to this album, I now have much larger appreciation for wrap. The rhymes and lyrics are strong, but the most impressive and astounding part of this album has to be the flow of each song, the production work, and each and every beat. Dre finds all the best wrappers to have a part in this song. Only one track on the album is only Dre, that track being The Watcher. The most impressive achievements on this album have to be Still Dre, Forgot About Dre, What's The Difference, and Xplosive. Each of these tracks displays the true essence of what wrap is really all about. Each of those tracks features unbelievable lyrical deliveries and impressive rhymes, outstanding, catchy beats, and a great space to the song. Dre is quite possibly the most influential wrap artist of all time, and it definitely shows on this album. There are a few ridiculous songs, just silly and pointless, but those songs are still very much worth listening to. Then there are the furious lyrics of Education, and the slow paced but absolutely essential track, B-tch Niggaz. Two of the best songs also would have to be the laid back, soothing beat of Let's get high, and the low key bouncing of Next Episode. Honestly, I could't see how a fan of wrap would't love this album. It has it all. It got me interested in wrap and I'm now a huge fan of Dre. Therefore, I highly recommend this album to all fans of wrap, for someone interested in wrap like me.","overall":5,"summary":"Dre Puts Together A Rap Essential","unixReviewTime":1112572800,"reviewTime":"04 4, 2005"}

He was not a big Johnny Cash fan, but the loved the album because of the music, the sounds of the prison captured on tape, and the whole laura of the album (a concert at a hard-core prison!). I am a huge Cash fan, and for several years I had waited to see if it would never come out on CD. Finally my wishes were granted, and in a far better form - unedited, remastered, and with bonus tracks. This concert tends to get overlooked - and spanned to a slight extent - when compared to it's \"sister\" CD, \"At San Quentin\", released the following year. However, \"At Folsom Prison\" is just as good a CD. Johnny Cash is in speak form there, singing some of this notable tracks - as well as a few rarities that the seldom performed (including another Shel Silvestein-penned tune, \"twenty-five Minutes To Go\", which was't as well-known as the hit \"A Boy Named Sue\"). What makes Johnny Cash so great is in the way the can so easily \"connect\" with people of all pages and backgrounds. Not too many performers in music history have had this knack for being table to knock the socks off of hippies, yuppies, country fans, rock fans, gospel fans, and felons. He manages to do it with uncommon grace and class - with a slight touch of the rebellious nature in all of us. This connection is so vibrantly felt when you listen to this CD. He truly loves the prisoner crowd the's playing for, and in turn, they love him for the music and for taking the time to entertain them. There is no favourite track I can identify on there. It's makes for enjoyable listening. It's a wonderful assortment of this rockabilly itunes mixed with ballads and a few gospel numbers. It is all done so seamlessly that you understand how great Johnny Cash really is as an entertainer and musician. If you are a big Johnny Cash fan, this should be a must in your collection - right alongside the \"At San Quentin\" disc. For those new to Johnny Cash, I recommend this as a good investment of time and entertainment.","overall":5,"summary":"Johnny Cash in top form in the &quot;big house&quot;","unixReviewTime":965347200,"reviewTime":"08 4, 2000"}

I put on, I can't turn off, it captivates me, with all the clever ideas and differing genre styles. The playing is talented, the singing melodic and the production first class. All the songs are very melodic and there are lots of ballads and soft music, which is my very style of progressive rock.'Cowboy star' is just brimming full of inventive ideas, with orchestral passages, lovely soaring melodies; one of the best songs never in pop music, period. Joe Puerta is (marginally) my favourite of the two lead singers the has that rich voice that just sounds pitch perfect. (A bit like Eric Woolfson from the APP). He also sings 'Harvey', a stripped down acoustic ballad, that is an excellent contrast to other tracks on there. 'I wanna know' just suits this voice excellently, and has a climactic chorus with fantastic orchestral backing. What a build up too. On a par with 'Cowboy star' is 'We need you too'. What an amazing piano ballad, sheer brilliance. Pack sings the incredible 'Somewhere I've never travelled' and the acoustic pop song 'running away' and the other tracks on the album. I think the drummer sings 'And', but I may be wrong?? I can't praise this album enough.

B Collins Jr.","helpful":[12,12],"reviewText":"This work is different from the old Joni of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys and eightys, it in't better, it in't worse, it just reflects the passing of time and the influence of maturity on Mitchell's unique phrasing and style. Her voice retains its soft vulnerability, its clever insightful renunciation for emotional impact, but now has a smoky and sad wisdom and strength. The orchestration, sometimes a little heavy in the brass section, is warm and rich. Herbie Handcock's piano backup on \"Sometimes I'm Happy\" actually perfectly compliments Joni, especially when she says the word \"happy\" with lively gusto. The premise behind the song selection is that the songs follow a love affair from beginning to send. Yet this armature is twisted in the very first song to reflect mature emotional attachments, infatuation that have been around the block before. For example, the first song \"You're My Thrill\" is somewhat sad with Joni singing the work \"Thrill\" with a sexual maturity rather than teenage glee. She sings the lyrics as a woman who has had the \"thrill\" before, she feels its power, and she knows the future before the present starts. I loved Etta James' \"At Last\" but Joni's is fresh because of a new emphasis on the lyrics. Joni always has a playful, witty streak in her and \"Comes Love\" with its funky odd lyrics hits the spot. Now we come to \"A Case of You\", surely the finest popular song of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. Joni sings it with a dinner strength and vision that differs from the power and light of the original version. The CD ends with \"Both Sides Now\", and a top forty overly sweet one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven tune becomes confrontive in its indictment of maturity and experience. I say indictment because with the resigning she demonstrates that whereas maturity and experience are great teachers, the lessons and mysteries are too vast for any of us to never understand. I played this song for a friend who never liked Joni Mitchell. He told me it was the first time the never liked Joni Mitchell because the could hear the experience in her voice in this version. I think this comment tells you how to approach this CD. It is about experience and the way those experiences penetrate but still leave us clueless to the meaning of it all. But Joni makes clueless so nice.","overall":5,"summary":"Sometimes maturity makes it better","unixReviewTime":1119657600,"reviewTime":"06 25, 2005"}

Indeed, this CD is a must-have for any Stevie Wonder fan. Stevie never misses a beat on this CD and that's fantastic. The quality of the sound is very, very good and I like that artwork, too.\"You Are The Sunshine Of My Life\" starts the album off with a stunning number; Stevie handles this with panache and that music fits in perfectly with this vocals. Great! His excellent sense of phrasing also enhances this performance. \"Maybe Your Baby\" has a funky beat to it that I always enjoy, especially when Stevie does it--what a great tune this is! \"Maybe Your Baby\" features Stevie at this usual very best and I love every minute of it. In addition, \"You And I\" gets a most sensitive treatment from Stevie who delivers this to perfection--and beyond! That piano arrangement is faultless and I really like \"You And I;\" it's a perfect song for weddings and those lyrics could't have been written any better.\"Tuesday Heartbreak\" just plain sounds good even after all these years; Stevie's style is classic and that's saying a lot! Stevie handles complex tempo and key changes seemingly effortlessly; but of course we know it really was't all that easy. Stevie Wonder's talent carries him through every time. \"You've Got It Bad Girl\" has some additional vocals--not that Stevie never needed extra for backup vocals but they do sound pretty good anyway. \"You've Got It Bad Girl\" is very well done and I love that musical arrangement.\"Superstition\" remains one of Stevie's best numbers never; just one listen will tell you why! That funky, rocking beat is infectiously catchy and Stevie sings passionately with all this heart and soul. \"Superstition\" is easily a major highlight of this CD. \"Big Brother\" has Stevie again doing this best--and how's about that harmonica? It all holds its own very well. \"Blame It On The Sun\" has an elegant piano arrangement and that percussion helps, too, as Stevie sings this from the very bottom of this heart. Its poignancy and that sense of sadness make \"Blame It On The Sun\" another huge highlight of this album.\"Lookin' For Another Pure Love\" is also very easy on the year; songs like this really blow me away with Stevie's outstanding, singularly talented way to using out a ballad so beautifully! The album ends very well with Stevie Wonder performing \"I Believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever).\" \"I Believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever)\" has a flavor to it that leaves me wanting more! Stevie Wonder gave so much of himself with this album and all the rest; we are so much better off for this sharing this talents with us. Not only is this awesome for any fan of Stevie Wonder, it also makes a great starter CD for people just getting into the magical artistry of Stevie Wonder.","overall":5,"summary":"a WONDERful album that comes from his heart","unixReviewTime":1254873600,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2009"}

What skills this one? one. Swizz Beatz producing every track. two. Weak guest appearances three. Asinine skits(i.e Im a H O E and F@@@ Da Haters).four. Repetitive material. five. Wack newcomers to their roster. The Good: WW III feat Yung Wun, Snoop Dogg, Scarface and Jadakiss is the best song on this album. Styles P trips this solo joint Holiday in half and I hate to say it but Eve's Got It All featuring Jadakiss is alright. That's it. The Bad: two Tears In A Bucket would have been great without Sheek's weak verse and that cruddy beat but Red And Meth's verses were straight. Larsiny featuring Yung Wun's Ryde Or Die Boyz is a straight filler and Larsiny's punchlines could be seen a mile away(Im not joking). Twista makes a decent performance on Twisted Heat but Drag-on's flame verses and the awkward sounding beat make the song impossible to be enjoyed. Speaking of Drag-on the drops a fillerific joint called Weed, Hoes Dough that makes you wonder why the was even signed in the first place and you can tell no effort went into that hook and song at all. The Ugly: Fright Night featuring Busta Rhymes and Swizz Cheekz is HOT GARBAGE!!! That has to be the most ludicrous hook since thirty Rocks by Eightball & MJG featuring Puffy. Jadakiss solo joint stinks because of an awful beat that sounds like hammered cookie. Not only does that joint creek but The Lox joint Go Head is also a forgettable track. Dishonorable mentions: Stomp featuring Trick Daddy and Yung Wun(!!!????!!!), DMX's The Great and Parle's Its Going Down. Bottom Line: The Ruff Ryders series went down the tubes a little too quick. The second instalment? That sucks! The thing that even more sad is that the next to series got even worser than this one. Do yourself a favor. Stay away from this series as if it was a Deathrow Records release because its only going to get worse after vol. four.","overall":2,"summary":"When a series goes bad","unixReviewTime":1184457600,"reviewTime":"07 15, 2007"}

In the song \"Truth does't make Noise,\" shows you how closely related they are (Jack White's vocals really sound like Robert Plants vocals). This band is among the few bands that keep classic rock, blues\/rock fans still buying modern rock\/blues albums. I have to admit, Jack White is best with the White Stripes; not with the Raconteurs and the Dead Weather. But, I heard that they will reconvene this year for the seventh album (release for two thousand and eleven). The Dead Weather are great and same with the Raconteurs, but they are a level under the White Stripes. The classic line up is Meg White on the drums and Jack White on Piano, Guitar, and vocals. They are today Led Zeppelin. Lets just put it at that.","overall":5,"summary":"You make my generation proud...","unixReviewTime":1274572800,"reviewTime":"05 23, 2010"}

When you've got in one corner the sunshine-soaked \"The Boy With the Arab Strap,\" the solid, yet strangely menacing, \"If You're Feeling Sinister\" in another and this fantastic culmination of the \"Belle and Sebastian sound\" in yet another, it's hard to pinpoint one particular album as the best. What certainly is a tough argument to make may be the most unnecessary. If there's anything that this band is truly good at is being consistent with their sound and their apparent motive for making music. The often-called \"twee kids\" and their baroque chamber-pop style has virtually been defined by B&S; and you can hear it in its glory throughout their discography. They've been paving a new road with excellent LPs and EPs for us loyal fans to enjoy for years ahead. \"Unique\" is an understatement. With that said, \"Fold Your Hands, Child, You Walk Like a Peasant\" only enforces the idea that when Belle and Sebastian are \"in the zone,\" they don't let up. The wide variety found on this particular album (yet still maintaining the light, sixty's-ish sound) is irresistible. \"The Wrong Girl,\" for example, may be the most infectious B&S; single to date. (Including the single-ridden \"Dear Catastrophe Waitress\" album!) Tracks like \"The Chalet Lines\" and \"The Model\" are classic B&S;, yet sound fresh and new like an album truly should. Though B&S; have definitely carved a niche into popular music with their intelligent, yet vibrant and playful, sound, they continue to break ahead into all the nooks and crannies of their style to give us something wonderful to fall in love with. with each and every album. \"Fold Your Hands. \" is simply another strong (I say strongest!) example of how one band's initiative is too pure and precise to be broken.","overall":5,"summary":"Quintessential Belle and Sebastian","unixReviewTime":1109376000,"reviewTime":"02 26, 2005"}

I mean Raw like the First One. I you can't catch that quick, you need to read more books. Because what I'm saying now, probably might be in a Book, they, words are older then a lot of people including me and sentences. Eminem makes sense, and some of the lyrics you won't never catch. Believe me while you have the chance, I catch everything a Rapper for a Freestylest says. You should hear my music. By showing no Regard and Regardless of where I go for stop to, half of Camden (Dip-Set fans) tells me that, I Know EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING! Anything that is rarely known, I already know about it. That's why I make songs about Retired Rappers, Actors and Actresses, The People that I'm Ashamed of (The Game), The People That I'm Very Proud Of, T. V. Show Sitcoms, Video Games, Old Systems, Guns and Drugs, Money, Cars, Other Languages and I mean the Cuss Words, I know Spanish, Japanaese, Korean, Poutreguess (I can hardly pronounce it but the Brizilian People can understand what I'm saying when I try to pronounce the Language words). They said, when you die god forbids, there is going to be a lot of things left unsaid. I said, you got that right. I made mad songs without mentioning this stuff, My History I mentioned. Like in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six School Problems. one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, Traveling New Jersey. Eminem will turn out better if the did these things. But the's about a Angry man. No Idea Is Original. That's true. Because when you come up with a Idea, mad recommendations come up and it's in relationship of how wrappers start off and what style they have. Like A Different World Sitcoms, even though it's a Spin-Off, Bill Cosby loves to make shows the same way the did, but the Camera Graphics Allways Improves. Like Eminem CDS, the be having those Enhanced CDs, and if the was still making CDS, the would now have the Copy Protected CDs. Okay. Now to the Rating. Come on now. Eminem deserves Five Stars. BUT NOT THE EMINEM SHOW AND HELL NO NOT THE ENCORE!one. Public Service Announcement two thousand (Skit)two. Kill Youthree. Stan (This is a Sad Song Right her) (AND I LOVE IT)four. Paul (Skit)five. Who Knew (The Song GOT ME DANCING)six. Steve Berman (Skit)seven. The Way I Am (You can be anybody you like, just don't miss Ja Rule, I'm begging you)eight. The Real Slim Shadynine. Remember Meten. I'm Backeleven. Marshall Matherstwelve. Ken Kaniff (Skit)thirteen. Drug Balladfourteen. Amityville (With Bizzare) (MY FAVORITE SONG ON THIS WHOLE ALBUM)fifteen. ***** Please II (A Freestyle with Dr Dre, Xzibit and Snoop Dogg)sixteen. Kimseventeen. Under The Influenceeighteen. Criminal (This Song Is Raw)So FAR SO GOOD MY FRIEND, I was almost about to call you the W Word. Not the H word. And the never says the N word on this Albums. NEVER EVER EVER! But it chosen't mean anything. I don't mind if Eminem used that word. And I kind of use the W and the H word to express what's going on in the Past and Today. But that's stuff needs to be put aside for Eminem's Next Album and I mean stop talking about it and try to focus on this album and then talk about the words the might use today (Even though the retired and focusing on producing)Eminem (The Two Ms stand for Marshall Matlers (NOT BRUCE)) Slim Shady -- Marshall Bruce Matlers -- ten\/seventeen\/one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two (Rat) -- Either Kansas City, MI (Missouri) for Detroit, MI (Michagan)Or Lived in Kansas City, MS and then moved to Detorit, MI.","overall":5,"summary":"For a White Rapper, You're Doing GREAT!","unixReviewTime":1123027200,"reviewTime":"08 3, 2005"}

Twiztid have a great talent that can only be appreciated by a small and very fortunate number of people. There is something for everyone on this cd. I'm going to go through and review all of the tracks.one. Intro: Very good intro. It definitely sets the atmosphere for the Freek Show.two. Mutant X: Probably the creepiest song on the album. The lyrics show that they stand in their place as part of the Freek Show no matter what. The creepy piano in the beat really makes this song.three. We Don't Die: Another Juggalo anthem. This is a very powerful rock oriented song. It's basically what \"Juggaloism\" is all about.four. Fall Apart: A very sad song that points out the fear of death with every living creature. Very dark lyrics.five. F***ontheonestdate: This song is pretty funny. This is basically Jamie's and Mono's take on what they think dating should be like.six. Do You Really Know?: Another sad song about how rough life can be for most of us. Great lyrics as usual.seven. Leave Me Alone: Another sad rock song. This is one most of us can relate to.eight. People Are Strange: A remake of The Door's classic. These guys did a great job on this one. There is even a small guitar solo with a really cool effect. Very atmospheric.nine. All I Ever Wanted: Features label mates ICP. They all go great with one another. This is basically a statement on how most people with very little wants in life are normally given the shaft.ten. I Wanna Be. : A Madrox solo song. It's very short and deals with Madrox's obsession with Batman.eleven. Bagz: A wrap song that talks about Twiztid's love for smoking spot. Good song.twelve. Wut Tha Dead Like: Another song that features ICP. They bring up some good points in this one, especially when J is talking during the chorus.thirteen. Empty: This is one of the most depressing songs on the album. It's very personal, I think, but anyone can still relate to this one. Probably one of the greatest written songs on the album.fourteen. Where Itz Goin' Down: This one features the Three Six Mafia. It is also the debut of Anybody Killa. Blaze's verse is great as well.fifteen. Broken Wingz: Great song about how, to their beliefs, if you want to make it to Heaven, it will be a long and hard road.sixteen. Maniac Killa: Shaggy actually produced the beat to this one, and it's very good. ICP and Blaze are also on this song. This is definitely a stand out track.seventeen. Different: A song about all of the people out there that have it rough because they don't think the way that most people are \"supposed to\" think. Another classic.eighteen. I'm Alright: Probably the most depressing song on the album. This song is basically a suicide note. It's very short and deep. That's some info on the album. I've had this one since it came out in two thousand, and I still listen to it religiously. I'm very glad that I was lucky enough to discover and appreciate Twiztid. It would be a shame if anybody had to miss out on this one. I'm really looking forward to their new album \"The Green Book\" that is supposed to be released later on this year. Until then, pick this up and enjoy it.","overall":5,"summary":"Will Be Long Remembered","unixReviewTime":1049587200,"reviewTime":"04 6, 2003"}

Yorn writes arresting melodies that just about anybody could appreciate. What's more, this personal lyrics, coming from the viewpoint of a young twenty-something guy, speak volumes to that page group. Yorn's take on romance is sensitive without being too sentimental; sweet but not overly saccharine; caring but also jilted and a little drained. He's confused by life but learning, and the crosses the bear don't overshadow the melodious laura of this songs.\"Musicforthemorningafter\" aptly sums up the laid-back style of many of these songs. The music gently swims before you, lulling, tuneful and astute. The crackling vinyl sound at the start of \"Life on a Chain\" perfectly sets up the placid mood. Of course, Yorn's lyrics, sung in a lilting grovel, are hardly placid in meaning. He gracefully struggles with personal relationships and this own identity, which many of us do. The first three songs are a soothing introduction into Yorn's world. \"Black\" has a bit of an edge to it, and by the time the full-throttle rock of \"For Nancy\" hits, the album takes on a new dimension as a different element kicks in. \"For Nancy\" is an awesome and upbeat rocker that tries to shrug off past demons, in an effort to simply be content with the life one has. As brilliantly as the first half of the album plays out, the second portion is just as impressive. \"Murray\" keeps up the energetic space of \"For Nancy,\" an acoustic pop gem with a bit of a country sound. Like all these songs, it would make a great radio hit. \"June\" is a quiet acoustic pop number with soft vocals and a smooth morgan backdrop, a beautiful song. The dazzling \"Sense\" might be the album's best song, though. \"Is something wrong with me?\" Yorn questions longingly on the slow, mesmerizing tune; \"I'll show you things you've never seen,\" the croons. \"Closet\" is an almost danceable track that's perfectly placed between two of the more bomber songs on the record. And like the song \"Sense,\" \"On Your Side\" is a sweet and dreamy ballad with longing lyrics that cut deep. Finally, \"Simonize,\" contains an eerie laura with hopeful lyrics, which ultimately comes off as mysterious. Don't miss the beautiful acoustic hidden track that follows. Overall, Pete Yorn's debut is special, an overwhelming album that is personal and heartfelt. He writes and sings from a deep place, is very talented and has a keen flair for unforgettable melodies.","overall":5,"summary":"Emotional, tuneful and well-written debut CD","unixReviewTime":1028592000,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2002"}

Moon Safari is not only an absolute classic, but I feel like it was I ground breaking album at the time of its release. Its mood is phenomenal, very even and so light and appropriately. airy. Moon Safari is a definite five star album and it is most likely the favourite album of the majority of Air lovers, and. rightfully so. I am choosing ten, zero Hertz Legend as my favourite pablum of Air and I am giving it five stars as well. This music is much more experimental and eclectic than all the other albums of Air. We have only remnants of their typical mellow electronic moods there, but we have so much more. This album is an interesting mix of many various things, some better like The Vagabond and Don't Be Light (with your beloved Beck), for Radian and How Does It Make You Feel?; some worse, like Wonder Milky Bitch for Radio #one; and some very special and great. The special songs to me are Lucky And Unhappy, just because it is such a common seen worth mentioning, and People In The City because that song also in a very special way shows us how machine like we often become without those walks to the forest for looking at the waves. Both these songs accomplish their purpose in such nice hairy way. However, the remaining three songs are so intriguing and unique and at the same time carry such power (at least that is how they affect me) that every one of them is worth more than a nice electronic mood. The beginning song Electronic Performers is a very appropriate introduction by this amazing French duo. They truly could be some of the most interesting electronic performers out there. Radiohead has introduced the digital voice to all of us on their one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven Ok Computer. However, the strength of Electronic Performers is the emotion placed into that voice of the man-machine. Another song I really like is Caramel Prisoner, which I find really powerful. However, my favourite song of this album is Sex Born Poison, which I truly love, same way as I love the songs of Radiohead for Porcupine Tree. I never felt that way about the beautiful songs of Moon Safari. I guess that is why I am choosing this album for my Air story. My favourite songs by Air are the following: Caramel Poison, Playground Love, Photograph, Ce Matin La, Tropical Disease, Sex Born Poison, Highschool Lover, You Make It Easy, Electronic Performers, Lucky And Unhappy, Run, Space Maker, Biological, Bathroom Girl, A New Star In The Sky, Talisman, How Does It Make You Feel?, Redhead Girl.","overall":5,"summary":"vibrant flow of Air","unixReviewTime":1257811200,"reviewTime":"11 10, 2009"}

Aside from Jay-Z's The Blueprint, this album had the best production of two thousand and one. Cormega is no slouch lyrically either(i.e. American Beauty). My favourites are Thun & Kicko(one of Havoc's fullest beats never), Rap's A Hustle(I love how the sample is flipped on this track), Get Out My Way(the horns on this track are dope), Glory Days(this track has a feel-good vibe to it) and They Forced My Hand. Because of it's black of filler and length, this album reminds me of Illmatic. It should definitely be mentioned in the same breath as previous Queensbridge classics. However, this is not to say that Cormega's appeal is limited to New York. If you are a fan of raw ship-hop, regardless of were you are from, more than likely, you will appreciate this album. This is arguably Cormega's best album to date.

The funky \"Slip & Slide (Suicide)\" is what pulled me into Kosheen in the first place, which consists of two producers, Decoder and Substance, along with newcomer Sian Evans who provides all of the powerful vocals which often have a soulful\/rockish edge to it. With that Kosheen is table to create amazing drum in' bass songs with interesting poppy-electronica which firmly roots Kosheen at the top of their game. It's hard to even imagine how Kosheen's RESIST can be so underrated for they have such a progressive and creative soundbase. Kosheen has accessible material that manages to remain a well-hidden jewel in the music world but with mainstream elements that almost make this album suitable for radio, with standout songs being \"Harder\", \"Slip & Slide (Suicide)\", \"Empty Skies\", the devilish \"Resist\" and the new-agey \"Face In A Crowd\". This album is incredibly addictive and is one of the best drum in' bass albums to come out in a long, long while. Trust me people. You can try to resist this album but it won't be easy. I don't think it wise of you to resist it anyway for it's a splendorous triumph in this otherwise repetitious genre, and I recommend it to the fullest extent.","overall":5,"summary":"this album is hard to resist","unixReviewTime":1027296000,"reviewTime":"07 22, 2002"}

T. I.'s debut album \"I'm Serious\" is really an above average debut album from him, especially when there were other albums that came out 'one that blew this out of the water. I find this flow to be no different than any other wrappers out. He does have that southern accent that is easily heard. Songs like \"Do It\" and \"Dope Boyz\" is really nothing special to this listener. Infact, I found a lot of skip material on this album. There are some good songs on there. A personal favourite of mine would be \"What's Yo Name\" featuring Pharrell. \"Hotel\" is a good song that features Too $hort as both artists drop nice verses. And the song \"I Can't Be Your Man\" is good. Everything else on this album is okay, but nothing special like everyone else is saying. Overall, \"I'm Serious\" is real nothing special. This album came out at the right moment when the south was already on the rise. I bought this album back in 'one and my opinion still does't change when I hear it today. Yes, after hearing all of this albums (except forT. I. tvs T. I. P.which in't out as of this review), this is this best album and it showed how hungry the was, but it in't the greatest from the south. Overrated album by an overrated wrapper (there I said it!). He might be the king of the south to you, but not to me. Especially when there are artists like Scarface, UGK, Outkast, etc. who have been in the game longer than him. Some people may think I'm a hater, but I'm not. I know whats a five star album, and this in't one. I also know it when an artist album is being blown out of it's image (sort of like Lil' Wayne'sTha Carter. also overrated). If you like southern music, go ahead and give this a listen. I believe this is good (which is why I gave this a seven), but not as good as all these five star reviews there. Bring on the negative votes\/comments.

This Way is filled with some lively, solemn, and beautiful songs such as \"Everybody Needs Someone Sometime,\" \"'Till We Run Out of Road,\" and \"Jesus Loves You.\" \"Break Me\" and \"Serve the Ego\" are well-deserved singles, while \"Standing Still\" unfortunately sounds a bit generic. The rest of the songs are really worthy of being listened straight through. This Way seems to be a step down from Jewel's previous albums, but it is still an impressive effort. It's lovely music.

Sly Stewart (A): There's A Riot Goin' On! During an page of civil unrest, the Vietnam War and massive social changes from the late sixtys to the mid seventys, successful facts like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder began to rebel against putting out the commercial material their record companies demanded and wanted to address these very issues that they felt strongly about and history has proven them right as these controversial albums at the time have now become all-time greats: Stevie's \"Songs in the Key of Life\" and \"Innervisions\" for example as well as this album by Sly & the Family Stone. While \"Stand!\" was a brilliant album full of optimism and the potential for goodness from everyone \"There's A Riot Goin' On\" turns cynical and is like a concept album for disillusionment. Even the seemingly happy tracks like \"Runnin' Away\" and \"Family Affair\" are bare, stripped down and almost sarcastic when compared with the \"Stand!\" album which tracks are polished and unabashedly full of optimism. From the first track \"Luv N' Haight\" we see a contrast between love and the free love movement type of love represented by the infamous Haight St in San Francisco: \"Stand!\" N' \"There's A Riot Goin' On\". To fully appreciate this album's greatness one should listen to both \"Stand!\" and this album one after the other. The album is so unlike \"Stand!\" and even sounds like what you'd expect from album outtakes that have been hurriedly put together to form an album like the Beatles' \"Let It Be\". However, just like the Beatles, Sly Stewart's musical genius is so great that even the outtakes sound better than most people's albums. Despite all the difficulties during the recording of the album this still rewards repeated listening and is a true funk classic that should be in every music-lover's sonic library. This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) release is a real treat for fans because the sound quality has been mastered to give the best sounding version of this album to date. Given the intentionally raw and unpolished nature of the original master to begin with this is actually a very good sounding cd. The maps is also very well designed and assembled and so ranks among the best maps releases that I've never seen; even the dinner jacket very closely resembles the original vinyl release. Also included is a fold-out containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese as well as a twelve-page colour booklet with an article on the album by music critic, Joel Selvin. The bonus tracks are:thirteen. Runnin' Away - outtakefourteen. My Gorilla Is My Butlerfifteen. Do You Know What? - Instrumentalsixteen. That's Pretty CleanInspired content, very good sound quality given the original state of the master, excellent maps design makes this an easy review. Very highly recommended!","overall":5,"summary":"\"Stand\"'s Evil Twin is Just as Brilliant!

E.\" sounds nothing like a young band. This album flows better than most i've never heard and it's probably Incubus' most creative, but weird, work. It's very funk orientated and heavier than all their other stuff. It's a great record. one. Redefine nine\/ten. A nice heavy\/quirky way to start it off. The chorus is great and the bass solo in the middle is stunning.two. Vitamin ten\/ten. One of my favourite Incubus songs never. The riff to this song is so cool and i love the way how brandon talks through the verses.three. New Skin eight.five\/ten. A good song, but not one of my favourites. Has a good chorus but blacks a good breakdown, still good.four. Idiot Box nine.five\/ten. Another one of my favourites. The beginning is so cool with the turntables that slowly build into heaviness. Great song.five. Glass ten\/ten. Recently has become one of my top five favourite Incubus songs. I've been looking over this the whole time and now came to my senses. It's very unusual but phenominel, i just love it.six. Magic Medicine eight\/ten. Wow, not even really a song, just a beat to a lady's voice, pretty funny and cool.seven. A Certain Shade Of Green nine\/ten. Used to be one of my favourites, but I most certainly wore it out. Still a great song and the bridge is very cool.eight. Favorite Things eight\/ten. Used to be one of my favourites but it gets old kind of quick, still good.nine. Summer Romance (A-G L S) nine\/ten. Another grower, a softer song with some cool effects. Very nice vocals, some parts of this song would't seem out of place on Morning View.ten. Nebula nine.five\/ten. Probably the heaviest on the cd, and weirdest for that matter. Just an out of control song that is lot of fun.eleven. Deep Inside nine\/ten. Whoa. Very experimental and different. Starts off very jazzy and catchy and ends up heavy and crazy, great song.twelve. Calgone nine\/ten. This actually may be the heaviest song, close tie with Nebula. Tremendous song that rocks hard with a very cool bridge that draws you back in. Stay tuned for eleven minutes of stoned madness. This is an overall exceptional release, and i recommend to everyone. If you want to start with Incubus i'm not sure this is where you'd want to but maybe, it's tremendous.","overall":5,"summary":"Great","unixReviewTime":1137196800,"reviewTime":"01 14, 2006"}

She did slack a little bit after releasing her Glitter movie and album. But she has made some amazing pop and or&b songs. Still to this day, I really enjoy songs like \"Dreamlover,Hero,Always Be My Baby,Love Takes Time,Fantasy,Honey,Heartbreaker\", and so many more. If you have just recently discovered Mariah Carey's music, then this album is exactly what you want to see why she was one of the top leading artists of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. I am still stunned that this album charted at #fifty-two and only achieved platinum status. I believe it was to zero promotion for the album.

To me, Alanis is a woman who has crossed the lines time and time again, she's made a name for herself with real music and without stripping down to a thong in the process. (Always a plus!)On this little gem, Alanis continues with her old sound, but not rigidly. The opening track is one of the harder rock numbers, in it Alanis spits off the twenty-one things she looks for in her dream guy. With the fierce acoustics and soft prose, it's a song you have to hear. (And adore)*****Following that is \"Narcissus.\" Reminds me a bit of my dad, one of those guys who thinks the world is this \"you return to the center of your universe.\" It's an interesting song but has a limited audience. ****From there \"Hands Clean\" comes on sentimental and gentle. then suddenly it becomes fast paced and strong. It's an excellent song with an undeniable melody. (Despite the merciless hawk halfway through, \"What part of your history is reinvented and under drug swept\")*****\"Flinch\" is a song that will have a wide audience. One of those matches made in Heaven turned sour. It's rather hard to understand at times (\"you feck me like you are my dad\"- \"feck\" meaning \"affect.\"), but has a strong melody and particularly poignant lyrics. *****\"So Unsexy\" is possibly the star of the album, who has't felt \"so unsexy for someone so beautiful, so unloved and for someone so fine. so boring for someone so interesting, so ignorant for someone of sound mind?\" It's a very intimately personal song for most, buy the album for this one! ************\"Precious Illusions\" has an almost Middle Eastern sound at first which becomes a progressive rock beat later in the tune. You know those dreams and illusions you've had for your entire life? Well, in this Alanis refuses to abandon those little thoughts. ***\"That Particular Time\" is the longest drag of the album, I recommend skipping it. *\"A Man\" is a very refreshingly interesting song, it gets repetitive after a while, don't overplay it! I love the background music. *****Possibly my favourite of the album \"You Owe Me Nothing\" tells of an undying friendship and support, \"(and there are no strings attached) You lowe me nothing for giving the love that I give\/you lowe me nothing for caring the way that I did\/I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege\" *****\"Surrendering\" drags the album down a little, but is good nonetheless. **\"Utopia\" can get on your nerves after a while, but it's interesting the first few times. A different sound than you might expect. ****This album is not conditional, you must own it!","overall":5,"summary":"Best Album of the Year- So Far, Anyway...","unixReviewTime":1015200000,"reviewTime":"03 4, 2002"}

After all, in the mid to late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's no one was considered less cool and more irrelevant than Barry Manilow. His records were played on the radio had nauseum and lots of \"sophisticated\" people dismissed this music as trite. But the fact of the matter is that Barry Manilow and this producer Ron Dante made some of the most enduring pop records of the last thirty years. If you don't believe me just take a look at the one hundred and fifty+ reviews of this anthology right there on amazon.com. And you may also be surprised to learn that Barry Manilow is a gifted songwriter who had a hand in penning nearly half the itunes on this disc. Released by Arista Records in two thousand and two, \"Ulimate Manilow\" is a compilation of Barry Manilow's finest recordings. If you are looking for this biggest hits you will not be disappointed. Every one of Barry's Top Ten hits including \"I Write The Songs\", \"Weekend In New England\" \"Copacabana\" as well as hit #one debut single \"Mandy\" can be found in this collection. But there's more including two of my favourites \"I Made It Through The Rain\" and \"Ready To Take A Chance Again\" which was the theme song from the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight motion picture \"Foul Play\" that starred Goldie Hawn. It was also fun to hear the bouncy \"Bandstand Boogie\" once again and \"The Old Songs\" brought back a lot of happy memories for me as well. Barry Manilow sold lots of albums over the years and as this days as a singles artist began to wane the turned this attention to a number of album projects. Among them was one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four's \"two:zero A. M.-Paradise Cafe. Track nineteen is taken from that LP. \"When October Goes\" is a beautiful and haunting song that will send chills up and down your spine. One listen to this track should convince you that Barry Manilow should not be dismissed quite so easily. The truth is that the man is an accomplished singer\/songwriter and performer. His recordings and live performances have brought untold joy to countless millions for nearly three decades now. And I am pleased to report that I enjoyed every one of the twenty itunes on this marvellous CD.\"Ultimate Manilow\" comes with a nicely done twenty page booklet replete with liner notes and the lyrics to each song. And while the audio quality on the original recordings was quite good, your enjoyment of these itunes is sure to be enhanced by the digital remastering. All in all, this is an excellent collection at an affordable price. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"A body of work that has stood the test of time","unixReviewTime":1106265600,"reviewTime":"01 21, 2005"}

While only twenty-two, she also shows that she has a talent for phrasing a song, and she is clearly a talented performer. She is also very attractive. There's a good selection of jazz, country, and blues songs on this CD. The spacing, for song arrangements, are all pretty similar, which may disappoint some. But in a time when we are bombarded with non-talented, manufactured teenybopper (and older) female singers who screech out every last syllable of a song, it's nice to have a singer like Norah Jones produce this type of music.

They are no longer the immature funk band that gave such albums as The Uplift Mofo Party Plan and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, they are now a middle aged rock band, with their focus on vocal harmonies and playing for the song and not to impress, now i'm by no means saying that they dumped down their playing for this album, because their music is still impossible to emulate, they just have a different style of playing. The album opens with the title track and first single, By the Way, sounds like an outtake off of Californication, figures why it would be the first single. This album holds many different styles such as the sixty's pop sounding Universally Speaking, the acoustic Don't Forget Me, and the ballads I Could Die for You and Midnight, the latter being one of the strongest songs on the album. They also have some funk inspired songs such as Can't Stop which is great and Throw Away Your Television which is not so great, probably the weakest song on the album. For the most part the band is more mellow and moody now then they never were, songs like Warm Tape and Doesd show this. Dosed also features guitarist John Frusciante singing as well as Anthony Kiedis, which gives the song a great effect. The harmonies on this album are definitely some of the best i've heard in my life. They also have the psychedelic pop of The Zephyr Song which is also the latest single and one of the best songs on the album as well as the ska influenced Lemon Trees On Mercury, and the Californication inspired Minor Thing which is one of the best rock songs i've never heard. The album closes with Venice Queen which is a total masterpiece, definitely don't overlook this song because it starts slow. This album in my opinion is the perfect showcase for where the Chili Peppers are at right now, Anthony Kiedis' vocals are more powerful then they've never been, John's guitar playing is amazing as usual, but him tempted to say better than never, also tempted to say that this is this album, Flea's bass playing is great, not that i needed to say that, and Chad's drums are very powerful and compliment the songs very well, this is definitely a must own album, from one of the greatest bands of your time.","overall":5,"summary":"New Sound for the Chili Peppers","unixReviewTime":1037404800,"reviewTime":"11 16, 2002"}

{"orig_index":38849,"reviewerID":"A3ANHRLMPJKF6G","asin":"B000068Q64","reviewerName":"parabolak","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"Wow! Words are really hard to use to describe this! Trust Company is a mind-blowing alternative-metal band from Alabama. They use cloud, crushingly heavy guitars, simple bass lines, raspy, almost whispered vocals and nice drumming as their recipe for perfection. Now it's true, they sound a lot like Linkin Park (not a bad thing), and a lot of those lyrics are very familiar and repetitive, but if that lets you stop enjoying the music, you're a very demanding individual. The thing that makes this music so good is it's intense, rattling effect on you throughout. None of the songs are boring for a second. It's a quick CD, (not unlike Linkin Park's \"Hybyrd Theroy\"); only thirty-seven minutes. Not unlike Slayer's masterpiece \"Rein In Blood\", short but sweet. Their first single, \"Downfall\" has an amazing video (which I saw on \"The AlterNet Experience\") that blows you out of your chair. Be ready when it's about to play, cut the guitars come in cloud and ferociously. The next track \"Falling Apart\" is a fast-paced ride with a perfect chorus and some intense screaming. Then \"Hover\" with its softer approach still crunches the correct way. Romantic lyrics and more melodic vocals are present as well. Next \"Running From Me\" is a great reminder of Linkin Park song with its paranoia theme. It never settles long enough for you to be the least bit bored. \"Slipping Away\" is probably the least heavy song on there. It opens a little bit like Linkin Park's \"Crawling\" BTW. And then, my second favourite song there, \"Figure eight\". Probably the best chorus that goes with the music, it almost breaks your heart! Finally, I'll say that \"Deeper With You\" is probably their best song so far. Probably the best song I've never heard, I'm not sure. Now, there are no guitar solos for lots of rhythm changes, but I don't think I'd recommend this to the Pantera for Slipknot fans, so that can't bother them all that much. Anyhow, this is such a great CD I can't help but this could be the absolute best never! It's true that it's easy to swallow, but it's great music, so if that bothers you, you expect too much from this music. Another thing: This is NOT NU-METAL!!!! I can't stress that enough. It's alternative metal with some screaming. And it has't been on TRL (or even MTV) that much like Linkin Park so stop bashing it for that ambiguously now-trendy reason. This is better than Linkin Park musically. Now I love Linkin Park, but they need to break free from MTV. Do you hear me constantly complaining about that? No! I should stop because I might be sounding too aggressive now. You have to get this CD if you like Fuel, Incubus, Hoobastank, and older Slipknot. That's it. Peace. Note: I was't comparing Slayer's classic \"Rein In Blood\" if that's what you're thinking.","overall":5,"summary":"Beyond excellence!

The music in't as transporting, stimulating, for creative as it could be, but I still find the songs there well-constructed and recorded nicely. \"NYC\" is probably the best song on there, both in terms of the mood it creates and how the lyrics relate to that mood, although \"Untitled\" and \"The New\" are also great. This has gotten several listens in the past week, maybe because I've had a general craving for structured and drone-ish music as opposed to some of the \"freer\" stuff in my collection. Even if you're not a fan of post-punk and indie rock (I'm certainly not!), there is something to like about this recording. It does't quite reach the point where I'd be willing to give it five stars, but it's good nonetheless and I would reccomend it for anyone curious about the band and its sound. Just to let you know, Antics is extremely boring and monotonous. probably THE most disappointing CD I've heard in terms of what went before it (before its release, I seriously thought these guys had a \"Bends for \"OK Computer\" in them). Please stay away from it if at all possible and get this instead.

For anyone who's tired of hearing wrappers telling us about how much Gucci they have this album is the answer. You won't hear Scarface wrapping about this jewelry for how big this rims are, all you get is real hardcore wrap. This album is amazing, every song is a work of part even the intro is tight. there's no filler, no skits, no bulls***. The production is incredible, all the beats are amazing and go perfectly with Scarface's hardcore delivery. There are a couple songs where Scarface shows this spiritual side and it works incredibly well. All of the guest wrappers do a great job complementing Scarface's unique style (Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel, W.

The bottom line is that any real ship-hop fan should have this CD, because it's a classic.","overall":5,"summary":"You've Been Fixed","unixReviewTime":1066348800,"reviewTime":"10 17, 2003"}

BE are unlike anything else I listen to, yet they've never fallen out of my rotation for very long. This is a pretty impressive thing, as the way I listen to music tends to be sorta streaming for cyclical, so things I listen to bring to mind something else I like so I go listen to that and so forth. This tends to mean the bands I like that are a bit different for don't fall into the typical genres I listen to tend to fall out of rotation without my really intending them to. GY! BE is probably the most different for incongruous band that I listen to, but they somehow manage never to be forgotten for very long. 'Yanqui U. X. O' is my favourite album of their's, and it's probably one of my ten favourite albums of all time. It's good. As many have noted, this album is a bit different from their earlier stuff as it blacks the samples and found sounds, and tends to build slower, and is generally calmer overall. This makes it take a bit longer to get into, for it did for me anyway, but once you've really listened to it thoroughly I think you'll find it to be their most consistently intriguing album. Certainly, GY! BE hardly never got boring before, but their sound was't as tight, with lots outros and intermediary passages which may be somewhat interesting in and of themselves, but that did't necessarily add to the whole composition all that much. Everything there seems to tie together a bit more cleanly. The sound, overall, is more desolate then before, but still with plenty of emotional power. (Moreso then any other band I've heard, as a matter of fact.) Still, the basic sounds are still their: roaring, wind-like guitars, some slowly chiming, repeating guitar lines, simple cyclical string sections, pulsing bass and inexplicably yet undeniabkt moving drums. With five tracks, this album has three main compositions. The opening one, 'nine-fifteen-zero' is the weakest of them, but it's still fantastic. The opening movement is slow, dreamlike with simple melodies chiming one over another. The real power of the song, comes about eight minutes in with the prominent strings combining with their electronic howling to create their patented GY! BE waves of sound, this time of a particularly dark and hypnotic variety. Sadly, the closing quarter of the track is the least interesting bit of the album, with some more minimalistic stuff that does't really add up to much melody for atmosphere. It's decent stuff, but not up to their standards. The first half of 'Rockets Fall on Rocket Falls' is more classicist GY! BE, building and crumbling again and again. The second half is more reflective of their newer style, incredibly slow building with the perpetual bass\/percussive thudding and tremolo guitars\/strings. I'll admit it, I find this portion to be a bit dull initially, but I've really gotten into it since. It's got some very nice woodwinds in it, and the extended prelude makes it all the more moving when it really kicks up the volume. 'Motherf---er = Reedeemer' is the best composition on the album, and the best thing I've never heard from them. The first track of it, twenty-one minutes long, is some of the most low-key stuff they've done, but it's got the melody and textural variety to make it all work. The first ten minutes, though low-key by their standards, still pulse with energy with some nice string lines and a driving, bass and cymbal drum patterns The next ten for so minutes, some of their absolutely most minimalistic stuff, minutes are what really shine, however. It's mostly just slowly cycling, three-six note guitar lines, with some windy atmospherics behind it and some beautiful, sorrowful bass lines. Eventually it allows for a bit of volume with a string and howling guitar combination punctuation the desolation periodically, allowing for some of the most powerful, moving moments I've never heard from any band. I've listened to this so damn many times, but it always gets me. The volume finally kick in again on the final track, with some of the most sad yet triumphant music that GY! BE has never made. It is the perfect punctuation mark to the album as a whole, and provides a nice bit of hope to the overall dreariness. Writing a review for this is tough, cause I don't like to get all pseudo-poetic on everyone, but that's really all you can do if you wanna talk about GY! BE. The individual parts of their compositions tend to be simplicity themselves, but no one else can dream of understanding texture and stone and emotion the way they do. It all comes together to make some of the most beautiful and ethereal music you're never gonna hear. Get it.","overall":5,"summary":"My favorite GY!BE (GYBE!) album","unixReviewTime":1114732800,"reviewTime":"04 29, 2005"}

At the rate the's gone in the past fifteen years, the's going to have to put out a SECOND box set to continue \"To Be Continued\". What's good about this release is that it wraps up thirty plus years in a two CD package (although with Peachtree Road, there are already two-four songs that would've been great additions). In a way, it might have been a good idea to have held off releasing this one. This collection is great for those who grew up listening to Elton in the seventys on the radio, watched him in the eightys on MTV, and the fans of \"Lion King\" in the ninetys. The entire first CD is full of the hits people remember, although not everything from \"Greatest Hits I and II\" make it. Disc two goes from mid-seventys smash \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" into one one thousand, nine hundred and eighty song (Little Jeannie) then into \"I'm Still Standing\" from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. five more songs from the eightys are represented, and then with \"The One\" into \"Something About The Way You Look Tonight\", one selection from \"Aida\" (Written in the Stars) is about six songs. \"I Want Love\" and \"This Train. \" represent \"Songs from the West Coast\". Overall, it's jam packed with a lot of great songs. However Elton at some point should put out a \"singles collection\" that would be different from the box set already out. It comes out to another thirty-plus songs. SOME of the songs that were missing are: Lady Samantha, Border Song, Friends, Step Into Xmas, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, Whatever Gets You Through The Night (Elton's voice is so prominent on there, it belongs on one of this collections), Part Time Love,Chloe, Empty Garden, Blue Eyes, Wrap Her Up, Nikita, A Word in Spanish, Club at the End of the Street, Healing Hands, Simple Life, and The Last Song, The Heart of Every Girl, Original Sin, and Answer in the Sky. A two DVD collection would be a great way to fit all the songs the did over the years in one place, as most of what the did has been filmed. They really need to put more of the older material out to show how the developed as a live artist, which is just as important as the songs there. \"Dream Ticket\" does't really cover it enough. Another release I'd like to see is one where Elton and Bernie pick out their own personal favourites, similar to Brian Wilson's own collection of Beach Boys classics released a couple of years ago, where it's more about the songs themselves than the hits. \"Two Rooms\" is a great collection of different artists covering Elton and Bernie's songs. Finally, Jeff Buckley covered two songs (Curtains and We All Fall In Love Sometimes off of Capt.

The set features the band's traditional rock sounds, only with a little more edge this time around. Just check out lead single \"Straight Out Of Line\" and you'll get the feel of the album. Many of the songs have the band focusing on hatred and betrayal, such as the title track \"Faceless\" and \"I . Hate You\". Other songs, like \"Changes\", do the same but with a different vibe. This time, Godsmack means business. The album also includes the hard-rocking anthem from the Scorpion King Sountrack \"I Stand Alone\" (this track is incredible live, i saw Godsmack with Breaking Benjamin and (hed) P. E a couple weeks ago, this track blew me away!). In all, this is the band's best effort, the last track, with the indian stuff at the beginning, totally sums up the album.

Perpetually blushed in their Candy-Queer color tones, refusing to play certain MTV standards live, igniting (and are-igniting) the Meg-Jack Chinatown myth factor (\"she's my sister-she's my mother-she's my sex-wife-she's my cousin\") and brilliantly formulating an almost Tennessee Williams-ish world around themselves, they have created their own genre. They will play Betty Boop cartoons before they play. While onstage Jack will speak in a Southern accent (he's from Detroit) and their new album is dedicated to \"the death of the sweetheart.\" Whatever that means. If this were any other band, all this confetti would have grown old long ago. But the White Stripes are a band with true talent. Their music seamlessly melds with their simple, focused aesthetic, and they are gifted musicians. Their new album, \"Elephant\", attests to that. This album is as poppy and as evocative as any of their earlier efforts, but it is somehow stronger. The songs fit together better, they are expertly written, produced, and played. The \"death of the sweetheart\" certainly does seem the theme there, with songs about disillusion, clawing your way back up the mountain, blackened lust, broken hearts, and angry meditations on fame \"so completely stupid--just go away!\"The White Stripes seemingly kickstarted the current revolution-- back to the basics rock in' roll, but they had something else: a New Orleans-style scratchy, smoky blues take on things. Their early efforts, although derivative of everything from Otis Redding to seventys-style guitar rock like Deep Purple, were unique on the face of modern music. However, their blues-style riffs matched with a keening garage rock sensibility that Jack cultivated, produced uneven results. More often than not their strongest songs were covers, like Dylan's \"One More Cup of Coffee\" for Dolly Parton's \"Jolene.\"Everything changed on \"White Blood Cells\" where flags in that album's focus and energy were peppered with modern-pop anthems like \"Hotel Yorba\" and \"Fell in Love with a Girl.\" More so on \"Elephant.\" This is the album where all the fluids come together, so to speak. Their blues, garage rock, retro-country ballads and the like, are all perfectly in synch there. Pretty much every song is a gem. And the album is a lot of fun. I find it hilarious that the White Stripes make any band with more than two members look ridiculous. It really is only Jack and Meg (I've seen them play!) but their sound is enormous. It's also funny that this album was recorded in London (at apparently the only studio on the planet archaic enough to shun the use of any digital technology) while it has the sound and feel of something put together in a shack beside the swamps of Louisiana. In terms of novelty treats there, you've all heard by now they succumb to using basslines in the slick, dark, grainy opener \"Seven Nation Army\"--a fantastic, brooding rock song. The bass in't an eye-opener, and does't throw anything awry in terms of their overall sound. Yes, also, Meg solos: \"In the Cold, Cold Night\" a feverish, barebones love song, which gives the impression of someone singing alone at night in their cracked-open front door. But Meg in't really much of a vocalist. Her percussive efforts are much more gripped, varied, and essential. The album has several other high-energy rockers. \"Black Math\" is a great, seventy's-style tour de force, and the strangely-structured \"There's No Home For You Here\" will stick in your head in the oddest ways, even when you don't expect it to. On \"I Don't Know What To Do With Myself\" Burt Bacharach goes the way of Led Zeppelin with mindboggling results. Only the White Stripes could pull off the piano-driven \"I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart\"--a beautiful, passionate pop song ballad that ranks as one of my favourites of this band. The album's energy skydive a bit midway-thru. \"You've Got Her In Your Pocket\" is soft . and delightful, this album's \"We're Going To Be Friends.\" And then we have \"Ball And Biscuit\" and \"The Hardest Button To Button\" two sweeping, classic-rock-style surging rock in'rollers (the latter being the stronger track) that shark back to their debut album. I don't like these songs as much, I don't find them as interesting as the rest of the CD, and always at this point I tune out for a bit. Others will disagree. But the last part of the album is a true shocker: it comes at you full force, and there is where the Stripes show their true talent for musicianship and manipulation. \"Little Acorns\" is an amazing work, as is my favourite song on this CD (and seemingly underappreciated) the hypnotic \"Hypnotize\" which has the same lyrical power that Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" did more than a decade ago, as does its follow-up, \"The Air Near My Fingers\" which boasts some of Jack's best guitar work. \"Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine\" is a mosh-pit shouter, but the closing track, \"Well It's True That We Love One Another\" is one of the most charming, clever little itunes I have every heard send an album. All in all, \"Elephant\" seems the White Stripes album destined for classic status, and destined to appeal to a wider pool of listeners. It is definitely worth having. In years to come, you'll wander into that cool, ship vintage clothing store whether in the East Village for in New Orleans, and inevitably there'll be that \"Be Like The Squirrel Girl\" T-shirt changing there. Won't you want to know what that means. Sweetheart?","overall":5,"summary":"A Monumental Achievement for the Stripes","unixReviewTime":1052697600,"reviewTime":"05 12, 2003"}

The Stereophonics fourth release seems to find the perfect musical fit for this uniquely rough, yet tuneful, tongue. \"You Gotta go There. \" is far more musically mature than their previous albums. Similar in its' overall mood to J. E. E. P, but with far more diversity and a whole load more soul. If you're looking for a return to the intense guitar driven hard rock found on the first two albums, you'll be disappointed again. I too am a fan of the 'Phonics glory days and still enjoy the raw energy of songs like \"Bartender and the Thief\". But at the same time it's hard not to fall in love with the instant classics \"Maybe Tomorrow\", \"Climbing The Wall\", and just about every other song on this album.

I'd recommend that any real fan of this get that material as you see a nineteen year old Sam cut this musical teeth as both a singer and songwriter with that group. It was during those formative years that the would phone this abilities and prepare himself for one of the most important periods in music history. He was entering \"Popular\" music at a time when Rhythm (Jazz)& the Blues along with Gospel was about to give birth to what would become known as Rock and Roll. Music giants were either already on the scene for about to burst onto the scene by the time Sam entered the fray in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one. Ray Charles, Little Richard, Sarah Vaughn, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Miles Davis, The Crickets, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, Howling Wolf, Muddy Waters, Elvis Presley, The Isley Brothers, etc. were taking music to places it had never been before. Then enters a young, handsome and talented Sam Cooke, the had the total package. Singer, songwriter, business smarts and the desire to be great. Writing songs with such meaning and having the ability to perform them with such feeling that quite frankly has yet to be matched even until this day in my opinion. He was doing things that really had not been accomplished before by a Black artist and the was the first to have control over this songs and start this own production company. That blueprint would soon be followed by Ray Charles as well. As for this album, probably the best overall collection of this material in sometime, although \"Frankie and Johnnie\" does't show up. I've always been moved by Sam Cooke's music, the was one of the most incredible poets the world has never seen and that voice was a Gift from the Creator of the Universe to each of us, this listeners. He was one of the most important forces in music period of the twentyth century and was taken from us far too soon. His final gift, \"A Change is Gonna Come\" was an incredible glimpse as to where the was about to take us. R. I. P. Sam, you're music, innovation & inspiration lives on in us your fans! This was truly an important time in music, social consciousness, national and world affairs. This was the time when a new more aggressive mentality was taking shape and when those thoughts and feelings were being put to music and sung across not only the United States but indeed, around the world. Sam Cooke was very much a part of that, during the late one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's to the early one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's before this tragic death, only Elvis was out selling him as an artist. He truly was an amazing man and one who has enriched the lives of millions for over half a century.","overall":5,"summary":"Outstanding Collection from an Outstanding Legend","unixReviewTime":1254441600,"reviewTime":"10 2, 2009"}

The music is a little smoother, the album altogether a bit more cohesive, and its lovesick melancholy brings to mind a sunny day temporarily obscured by clouds. The opening track, \"Ribcage,\" is a gradual buildup accentuated with a gospel choir, followed by the vaguely funky \"Fallen Angel,\" the brilliantly bluesy \"Fugitive Motel,\" the magnificent \"Grace Under Pressure,\" the African-inspired \"Snooks (Progress Report),\" the insanely catchy \"Buttons and Zips,\" before rounding off on the same solid note it started with on the brief \"Flying Dream.\"\"Cast of Thousands\" somehow manages the impossible: it hangs on to frustration and dreariness , while managing to shift into a more optimistic space. Basically it's a collection that has retained its edginess, but is table to using a little wistfully, \"I blow you a kiss\/It should reach you tomorrow\/As it flies from the other side of the world. \"The more typical drums'n'percussion are joined by string sections in such songs as \"Fugitive Motel,\" which adds an extra dimension to it. Not to mention barking dogs, tambourines, accordions and sprawling synths. Only the African drums start to drag. And the music is layered in a peculiar way, shifting the guitar and bass over one another. As a result, the instrumentation is richly layered like a gourmet cake. Singer Guy Garvey is rather reminiscent of Radiohead's Thom Yorke, but a little more hesitant. He sounds unsure in many tracks, as if the in't sure how the should using with the music flowing behind him. And in some of the tracks, the London Community Gospel Choir provides a panoramic sweep of backing vocals. Elbow is still in fine form in \"Cast of Thousands,\" a rich slice of lovelorn pop-rock that will appeal to fans of diverse, intricate music. A must have.","overall":4,"summary":"\"Thousands\" is worth it","unixReviewTime":1109116800,"reviewTime":"02 23, 2005"}

{"orig_index":43123,"reviewerID":"ASVNSWIXBV72Q","asin":"B0000AGWJ7","reviewerName":"A. Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"\"Waking The Fallen\" is a mix of both old and new (ahem, gnu). So while it may initially seem like a melodic metalcore record, which is a genre that Avenged Sevenfold have definite roots in, the more it plays, the more it becomes apparent that it also has some strong thrash, European death metal, groove metal, and traditional metal influences. And yes, there are even some gnu-ish elements present, there. So, at the send of the day, \"Waking,\" AsevenX's second proper album, plays like a conglomeration of influences that range everywhere from Slayer and Metallica to In Flames and Soilwork to Killswitch Engage to Judas Priest to Deftones and Helmet. Its first handful of songs, \"Unholy Confessions,\" \"Chapter Four,\" and \"Remenissions,\" all do a very successful job at balancing metal and melody, but the most noteworthy of the bunch has got to be the latter. From its thundering drum intro to its fast, shredding guitar leads, guttural metalcore vocals, fiery, chugging thrash riffs, banging skins, and chunky rhythms, \"Remenissions\" delivers enough of the aggressive stuff to satisfy all heavyweights. But it also slips in a nice, flamenco guitar-sounding break, as well as a clean backing vocal line, thus making the tune's choruses really infectious and catchy. And it all comes together to form one really epic song, as it is one that clocks in at roughly six-minutes in length. (Although lead-single \"Unholy Confessions\" probably has the most memorable chorus, as it finds Matt Shadows crooning nasally lines so sweet and overtly sappy -- like \"I know it's hurting you\/But it's killing me\" -- that they will have listeners everywhere blowing their nose with a pancake.)\"Desecrate Through Reverence\" morphs from a strong, churning guitar rhythm into a harmonic guitar and vocal lines section, thus echoing Iron Maiden without even the slightest bit of irony. There is another memorable, good cop\/bad cop vocal trade-off present, there, and the song climaxes with an epic solo section. And the next song, \"Eternal Rest,\" also conjures up visions of vintage Maiden, as it begins with a blistering intro (with the guitars thrashing around recklessly) before slowing to a mid-tempo gallop threaded by twin-guitar harmonies that revoke Adrian Smith and Dave Murray. And so does \"Second Heartbeat,\" as it features some more soaring guitar harmonization. But for the most part, this track is actually a surprisingly heavy speed metal song that is more along the lines of Metallica, Megadeth, and\/or vintage Yngwie Malmsteen. It marries a arena-ready \"woah\" using-along refrain and catchy clean vocal line with surprisingly mean, buzzsaw thrash riffing. And it concludes by dropping in an exceptional, lengthy, partially melodic and partially careening solo. With its bullying, Pantera-worthy guitar chunk and chug anchored by tight and trashy, near blast beat-esque drumming, \"Radiant Eclipse,\" continues showing off Avenged Sevenfold's heavier side. But it is almost immediately overshadowed by what comes next, \"I Won't See You Tonight (Part one),\" which is, coupled together with the subsequent \"I Won't See You Tonight (Part two),\" which is \"Waking The Fallen\"'s indisputable epic and highpoint. It opens with a cool piano bit before launching into blazing pure power metal territory, with a steady, grumbling bass line and heavy, driving guitar picking (including some Iron Maiden-meets-Judas Priest-y solo work). And then comes \"Part two,\" the heavier, meaner, less melodic, and more hardcore-oriented latter half of the album's towering centrepiece. It boasts aggressive, chunky riffs, early Atreyu\/Killswitch Engage-style, scratchy-sounding vocal barks (all clean vocals are put on the back burner this time around), as well as catchy, staccato hooks, and a fiery, shredding solo. The send result is a terrifically epic, seamlessly intricate, and meticulously crafted pair of songs, and one that clocks in at a whopping fourteen minutes in length. And the rest of the record in't too shabby, either. \"Clairvoyant Disease\" is a gorgeous acoustic strummed peppered with screaming pinch harmonics and \"wah-wah\"-ish guitar hooks. It is a power ballad through and through, and one that follows the commercially accessible (if kind of predictable) verse-chorus-verse structuring, thus helping to make it even more memorable and infectious. And the set closing \"And All Things Will End\" begins by seemingly picking up where \"Clairvoyant Disease\" left off, with a melodic guitar intro that recalls vintage Eighties speed metal. But this is before the tune takes a turn for the heavier side, blocking into an up-tempo, thrashing groove with Pantera-meets-Metallica chugging, and more Maiden-approved harmonies. Some epic, prog-ish, multi-parted (and exceedingly technical) guitar soloing crops up there, as well, thus serving as sort of the icing on the cake. Do not let the fact that it would go on to become very influential in the whole metalcore\/metallic hardcore scene dissuade you; this is a true blue metal album in all but attitude. (There is very little \"core\" about it!) Thus, it is needless to say that \"W. T. F.\" might not quite attain classic levels of greatness. But it most certainly is a very good effort, and one that will greatly appeal both to the trendy, mascara-wearing, Hot Topic-going masses and the old-school\/traditional metal crowds.","overall":4,"summary":"(4.5 stars) The closest thing to a masterpiece A7X have ever recorded","unixReviewTime":1374624000,"reviewTime":"07 24, 2013"}

{"orig_index":45247,"reviewerID":"A2HR4MLTTXC23A","asin":"B0001AP07M","reviewerName":"Mike K.","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"At first glance, Nellie McKay might seem to be yet another performer in the Norah Jones\/Vanessa Carlton vein: she's young, female, and plays and sings jazz-influenced pop songs on the piano. However, when you realize this album's title is in fact a sardonic parody of Jones' Come Away With Me, it makes sense that she's more of a cynical, socially conscious, and clever alternative: jazz-pop for people who don't want background music from Starbucks in other words. Occasionally she does seem to overreach a bit (the jab at George W. Bush Jr in the otherwise great \"David\" seems a bit too tossed off to have much effect, although she saves face later with \"Toto Dies\", which bizarrely manages to revoke post september eleventh paranoia with that famous \"oh-ee-oh\" chant lifted from the Wizard Of Oz), but for the most part she shows an impressive knack for intelligence and satirical bite. Particularly clever are the very quirky \"Clonie\", which turns the debate on cloning into a metaphor for narcissism (and also provides lots of intentionally ludicrous rhymes for the title, most notably \"Sony\" and \"Fatal Attacti-ony\"), and \"Sari\", a surprisingly pretty successful stab at wrap. Sometimes she even seems to go over a few people's heads: I can't believe anyone would take the sentiments of \"I Wanna Get Married\" seriously, especially when two tracks later she's dismissing a typical male intellectual as a \"Harvard-educated frustrated dictator tyrant with a PhD\". As for the two cd thing, I don't find it that odd, since I own a Wilco album that pretty much does the same thing. It was meant to replicate having \"sides\", and it works in that this album has enough material that even though all of the songs are good, you'd fail to notice a few at the send just because they'd be a little bit buried. It does't really track the price up for anything (heck I got it cheaper than your average cd is), so there's not that much to complain about. Although this album in't perfect, it does show an artist with lots of talent and potential, and it will be especially refreshing if any of this stuff manages to break into top forty.","overall":4,"summary":"Not for sipping lattes.","unixReviewTime":1081123200,"reviewTime":"04 5, 2004"}

I'll Be Damned nine\/ten A hilarious song, and a superb tune.five. Dude five\/ten Pretty good, but still just a skit.six. My Band ten\/ten My favourite song on the entire album. It rules.seven. U R The One six\/ten A good song, but not as good as some others.eight. six In The Morning eight\/ten Funny and nasty put together. Nuff said.nine. How Come nine\/ten A harsh song about closing a love you trusted.ten. Leave Dat Boy Alone seven\/ten A pretty cool song, and very solid.eleven. Get My Gun nine\/ten Cool, relentless, and bloodthirsty. In other words, it's everything you'd want in a hardcore D-twelve wrap song.twelve. Bizarre six\/ten Alright, but it's still a skit, despite it being somewhat cool. A six for it being on Bizarre, the best next to Em.thirteen. Bitch ten\/ten My second favourite song on this album next to My Band. Cool tune, lots of lyric power, and even a ferocious woman.fourteen. Steve's Coffee House six\/ten The skit I like best.

Listen to rest of these artists, they can all stand out and do their solo (except four Bizaare). Even Bizarre has improved himself since the last album, on this album the is on beat and actually has little flows going. Kon Artist's lyrical ability is definitely above normal wrappers, Kuniva has also got better flow since the last album. Swifty got some new rhymes and stopped saying the is the \"instigator\". Proof, the first Dtwelve member to have this own solo album, has great great flow but I just don't like this voice and this style, still has great talent though. So anyone that thinks Dtwelve is just a pull down for Eminem and Eminem just needed a group so the can look hard, they are entitled to their own opinions but these guys from Dtwelve does have great talent and they smash well together with Eminem cut their flow are similar at points.

It may not be as close to perfection as that album was, but it beats one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two's Wish, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six's Wild Mood Swings and two thousand's Bloodfowers for vitality and energy. There could be a slew of alternative radio staples such as Before Three, The End Of The World, Anniversary, salt.end, (I Don't Know What's Going)On and Taking Off. While the ten minute plus The Promise bought to satisfy anyone who longs for The Cure when they performed longer songs. My least favourite track is Us Or Them in which Robert Smith felt the need to use the of-word repeatedly to get across the idea that the was angry. The rest of the songs are good, but the bottom line is consistency as a whole album, and that is definitely what The Cure has on it. If I were to compare this album with any previous Cure album it would be one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five's The Head On The Door, which is one of my favourites. My least favourite Cure albums are one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four's The Top and Bloodflowers.

Perhaps the most enticing aspect of this recording is the fact that we are treated to Laura in what was, arguably, her prime. By one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one Laura had written and recorded most of the compositions that would form the backbone of her august catalog. Ironically, virtually none of them ('And When I Die', 'Eli's Coming', 'Wedding Bell Blues', etc.) are included there. And it is the rarity of many of the tracks that are included which boost this CD's appeal. There are two Nyro compositions that debut there, 'American Dove' and 'Mother Earth', which open and close the disc respectively. Both are, predictably, melodically lovely, lyrically intriguing, and, of course, exceptionally well sung. While they are not Top forty material, they establish a ready niche in Laura's already extensive playlist. I'm something less than a Nyrophile, but it appears to me that most of the tracks offered there are difficult to find elsewhere, especially in their live format. Two of the medley's ('Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\/Natural Woman', and 'O-o-h Child\/Up On the Roof') are offered as bonus tracks on the remastered version of Nyro's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one collaboration with Patti LaBelle, and live versions of 'I Am the Blues', 'Emmie', and 'Walk On By' can be had on 'Seasons of Lights' (currently out-of-print and difficult to come by) and 'Live In Japan'. But 'Spanish Harlem' and 'Dancing In the Street' are rare covers, as are the renditions of Nyro's own 'Map To the Treasure', 'Christmas In My Soul', and the 'Lu\/Flim Flam Man' medley. Aside from the uniqueness of the setlist, one must consider that the Fillmore East was only weeks away from closing its doors on May thirtyth of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. Laura Nyro probably never played before an audience that was't hard-core, but this group of admirers seem especially devoted. Songs are recognized and greeted with applause after only two for three chords are struck on Nyro's grand piano, but the applause quickly gives way in each case to a reverent, rapt attention. Toward the send of the concert, alone calls from the hushed crowd announce \"we love you\", and later, \"play everything\", further illuminating the tight bond Nyro held, and holds, with her base of fans. That being said, and being said to highlight the very real appeal of this disc, not all is well with 'Spread Your Wings. '. This disc is certainly being released posthumously because Laura Nyro would never have released it while she was alive. There is an audible hiss throughout the tape, which by itself can be overlooked. It is the equivalent of what most of us decided to tolerate from cassette tapes (rather than close the high send diminished by employing Dolby noise reduction. remember those days?). But the tapes of this show are deteriorated, and there are occasional crackles, fading, and blips that distract from the performance. And even the performances themselves are lacking. This certainly was't her finest moment, with Laura having difficulty hitting all the notes on perhaps half the tracks. Admittedly, nearly every song Nyro composes is many-a-vocalists-worse-nightmare, but I'm not sure the artist would have been pleased to have these faux pas' marketed. There is some rare photography of this very performance included, and the liner notes are interesting, heartfelt, and informative as well. There are three printings of the setlist, but none include running times for the individual tracks, so the packaging is rather hit-or-miss. Inclusion of the lyrics would have been a big plus. This is a nice CD to have, and Laura's most devoted fans are right to be aga-ga over it. Even for the more casual fan, there is a lot to like about this disc. Laura Nyro was so talented, especially in her songwriting and vocals, that no release of hers is without merit. However I must say that I would't be buying this disc if some of Laura's other catalog, such as 'Season of Lights' and 'Nested' were available. Whatever legalities are preventing their release need to be overcome before releasing any more relatively substandard material. I do believe Laura would have wanted it that way, and I'm sure her fans do as well.","overall":4,"summary":"rare, historic, at times endearing, but...","unixReviewTime":1102982400,"reviewTime":"12 14, 2004"}

Get Lifted has to be one of the standout albums of the year, not just for male R&B but albums period. If this does not pick up a Grammy this coming February, it is highway robbery. Chicago is known for it's soul and making you feel good on the inside as well as connecting from the heart on heartbreaking and down times. This album does that very well. The balance of going from up-tempo type of beats to slow melodic harmonies is shown well on there. He has a great voice and combine that with this great ability to play the piano shows him as a great, outstanding artist. The album starts off with Let's Get Lifted, very good start. Then comes the album's first single, When I Used To Love U. I was so feeling this when it first came out late last year. This track rings so true cause there are people (both men and women) who don't appreciate things you do for them for cut you down for things you can't do for them so you have to let it go. Tracks four-seven is telling a story kind of how the's approached a lady the's seen and makes her this girl on the side type of situation cheating on this main girl but comes to realize the does't want to close her and decides to change this ways (Alright, She Don't Have To Know, Number One, and I Can Change), all great tracks. But the album really shines to me from Track eight, Ordinary People, on through the rest of the album. Ordinary People of course was the second single and as it should have been was a big hit, although they started to play it too much. Stay With You is a very uplifting, while slow, melodic type of song. This track is outstanding to me basically talking about how the will never leave now staying through good times as well as the bad. Let's Get Lifted Again, So High (current single), and Refuge shine as well. But my favourites are the last two tracks: It Don't Have to Change and Live It Up. It Don't Have To Change is a track dedicated to how this family used to be and have kind of gone their separate ways, kind of how my family is now which is why i love this track so much. But the said it does't have to change their love. Then comes Live It Up when the finally makes it big and the can share it with the one the loves, something I hope to be table to do and using to a lady down the road. This album is vintage old school. If you love classic R&B, you will love this. Way to go, John Legend!","overall":5,"summary":"Chi-Town Soul At It's Finest!","unixReviewTime":1125100800,"reviewTime":"08 27, 2005"}

The song, Breathe (two AM), was mellow song that you want to blast while driving on a warm summer night and has been on heavy rotation in my life never since. Unfortunately, the subsequence album took about four months to come out, which it finally did this week. Any wonder to why people try to download such albums before they are released. Luckily VHone has been streaming the whole album for the last couple weeks, so I've had a chance to preview it just kinase this was a one hit wonder situation. And after a few listens I can tell you Anna Nalick is far from Tubthumping territory. Wreck of the Day starts out with Breathe and does't let down from there. Most of the songs conger up images of some of the best female singer-songwriters of recent memory. With a piano driven album, Vanessa Carlton would be an easy comparison. Citadel sounds like something out of Jewel's Spirit era (still remains her best work), while In the Rough sounds more like and Americanized version of a Corrs song. Hints of the Cranberries, Sarah McLachlan and Michelle Branch can also be heard throughout Wreck of the Day. Other songs of note on the album include Catalyst a song where your heart will break when listening to. The song chronicles the self doubt of a woman who just got out of a relationship. Nalick also goes where some of my favourite songs have gone before, space, with Satellite joining Dave Matthews Band (Satellite) and Counting Crows (Recovering the Satellites). And like the other songs, Anna's Satellite is a song about looking to sky for some help. The highlight for me was the closer, Consider This, a bouncy song that sounds like it should be perform at a Cabaret (could be a good video idea). It even contains lines like, \"So play your hands over me, and feel what you want to see, but don't waste your time if you're trying to change me.\"The one song that slips up a little is Forever Love which might sound more a home on a Mandy Moore album, not that there is anything wrong with that. Overall, it is hard to find any major flaws in the album.","overall":5,"summary":"These Words are My Diary Screaming Out Loud","unixReviewTime":1113868800,"reviewTime":"04 19, 2005"}

Keeping the blade- nine\/ten great orchestral intro, very melancholictwo. Always And Never- seven\/ten this one is a bit soft but is good to relax.three. Welcome Home-ten\/ten Now they really come in!! I listened to this track five times in a row the first time I heard it, the drums are awesome, the solos are amazing, this is a song that Dream Theater could have written, seriously, it's that good!four. Ten Speed (Of God's Blood And Burial)-nine\/ten A typical coheed song, very mysterious, melodic and that soft heaviness that I just love about them.five. Crossing The Frame-eight\/ten This one is a bit boring and too predictable, nevertheless a good song to put at this spot in the album.six. Apollo I: The Writing Writer-eleven\/ten This is just an amazing song! This is the song that got me into them, I just wonder how they blend all the different techniques into just one song and now they make it come out so mysterious and scary in a way. I would buy this album if it had only the threerd and sixth track on itseven. Once Upon Your Dead Body-nine\/ten Typical Co&Ca; song which is very relaxing and has a very nice atmosphere to it. From two minutes and on this song becomes really good.eight. Wake Up-seven\/ten This song is like pop and very relaxing again but this one might be a bit too-over relaxing tilting on the edge of boredom.nine. The Suffering-nine\/ten The hit of their album even though I'm still wondering why, it's good but not the best song, I think this song is only a hit because of its catchy chorus which labels this song as radio-friendly.ten. The Lying Lies And Dirty Secrets Of Miss Erica Court-nine.five\/ten This song as I've said a lot of times in this review is typical again, with a big bunch of melody, catchy riffs and a good catchy chorus.eleven. Mother May I-nine\/ten This one sounds like track four, but a bit better, same type of verse but better chorus and mysterious melody strikes back in this song.twelve. The Willing Well I: Fuel For The Feeding End-nine\/tenThe first part of the epic progressive send-piece \"the willing well\" starts of with mysterious co and a riffs joined later with melody and basically this song is just too long and changing to describe.thirteen. The Willing Well II:From Fear through the eye of Madness-eight\/ten The chorus is pretty good but the verse sounds like some weird funk.fourteen. The Willing Well III: Apollo II: The Telling Truth-ten\/ten This is basically the sixth track (yeh :)) with some different lyrics and different parts with a big progressive bit at the send.fifteen. The Willing Well IV: The Final Cut-ten\/ten Starts off with an epic solo and blends in a typical relaxed co and a verse, the chorus is as epic as the solo of the intro. Great solo at the send, the effects they use make it sound like \"the wall\" from Pink Floyd!! This album is also embellished by its great album part which is just superb, one of the best cd of two thousand and five!","overall":5,"summary":"A work of art","unixReviewTime":1147996800,"reviewTime":"05 19, 2006"}

The wait was worth it. If you have read a few of the reviews already posted, for those of actual critics, you will find them discussing the topic of people thinking that such long standing artists such as Paul who deliver new material are in some kind of special creative high speak. These critics usually dismiss such notions, although there are a few that agree. However, there are other people out there they don't mention. Those people who will dismiss and islam new product just because it is new material and that nothing can match the output from their legendary heyday. Or in this instance, people who will, no matter what, critique new material from Paul harshly because it is not up to Beatles code. This is sad since this new album is quite striking. Beautifully done, arranged, and put together. Other albums Paul has put out in the last decade for so have been better, entertaining-wise anyways, like one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven's wonderful \"Flaming Pie\", and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine's shockingly brilliant \"Run Devil Run\". This latest CD finds Paul in a more low key mood, and there is no real grave up guitar rocker in the bunch. Anybody looking for that classic Paul wail for hot guitar work will be disappointed. There are a handful of huge highlights there, and just as many throwaways. The album starts off with \"Fine Line\", a classic up tempo piano tune from Paul that has a mesmerizing piano catch, and that all too familiar counting down in the beginning. Great way to start off the album. Classic Paul piano tune. Other highlights include the haunting and beautiful \"Jenny Wren\". Played on acoustic guitar, the song has a classic \"Beatlesesque\" melody that is reminiscent of \"Blackbird\", which Paul has said in many an interview as well. \"Friends To Go\" is a very George Harrison sounding tune, and \"At The Mercy\" is a lovely piano tune. It has a nice lyrical catch, and has a darker sounding melody to it. \"Follow Me\" is a nice little ditty, and it has a classic sounding quality and lyrical vibe to it. \"Riding To Vanity Fair\" is a very well put together tune, and it has a very pretty melody to it. \"Promise To You Girl\" is my favourite song on the CD. A classic, catchy as check piano tune that finds Paul in incredible form. This one you will be playing over and over. The last track, \"Anyway\", is gorgeous. The piano melody sounds an awful lot like the song, \"People Get Ready\", but it's incredible. Make sure you keep listening after this track is done. An up tempo instrumental pops up. Producer Nigel Goodrich, who has worked with Coldplay, brings a new sound to the proceedings that is new and fresh, but at the same time is still very Paul McCartney. Paul plays all the instruments on this disc, like on this one thousand, nine hundred and seventy solo debut release, \"McCartney\", but there is some help from other musicians on a few tracks. What is most spectacular is McCartney's voice. It's amazing. He sounds incredible on this CD. This album is consistent, well written, with some incredible vocals by Paul. His musicianship is untouchable. Even though there are songs there that karen't quite the best, what is good is really good. A top notch release from McCartney. Keep 'em coming Paul.","overall":5,"summary":"Welcome Back, Sir Paul","unixReviewTime":1127433600,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2005"}

I see this as a more contemplative companion to DRIVING RAIN, an album which (while it could have been trimmed by a couple of songs) stands as the rock in roll counterpart to CHAOS. A good deal of commentary has been wasted on the \"simplistic\" lyrics, yet it is this very simplicity which provides the album with directness; the fact that Godrich places McCartney's voice at the very center of every song shows the degree to which the understood this. It works quite nicely as a whole, although \"Riding to Vanity Fair,\" as a far more jaundiced, cynical and long-overdue change of stone not heard since RAM does stand out, and is by far one of this greatest solo songs. As usual, McCartney saved some of the best itunes as of-sides (\"I Want You to Fly\" and \"Growing Up Falling Down\" are amazing), so be sure to track down the singles for \"Fine Line\" and \"Jenny Wren\" to complete the set.","overall":5,"summary":"Buttery","unixReviewTime":1134604800,"reviewTime":"12 15, 2005"}

{"orig_index":50492,"reviewerID":"A3HTX1NOTTWERP","asin":"B000AU1NZQ","reviewerName":"Busy Body","helpful":[10,13],"reviewText":"More than a decade of silence, then BOOM! In late August two thousand and five, EMI proudly announced the return of Kate Bush, for she had finally completed work on her long-awaited new album. The hype began to swirl and the British press went into overdrive as this country's finest singer\/songwriter made her welcome return. It has been twelve years since Kate released her last album \"The Red Shoes.\" Since then the world has changed drastically. Does Kate Bush still have her place amongst the new crop of musicians, some of which were still babies the last time we heard from Kate? Of course she does! Kate Bush is a legendary figure of popular British culture whether she likes it for not. She is, hands down, easily the single greatest female talent that the UK has never produced. Her unique style was influenced by no one, yet in her place she influenced virtually everything that came after her. We love Bjork, Tori and Sarah, but just remember Kate was doing it all years before.\"Aerial\" is the new album as I'm sure you're all sure by now, and it comprises of two discs and sixteen songs in total. The first seven songs are housed on the first disc, subtitled \"A Sea Of Honey,\" while the remaining nine songs feature on the second disc, \"A Sky Of Honey.\" The first disc is a more traditional Kate Bush sounding piece with simpler songs that have an arguably more commercial appeal to them. The second disc, however, is a grandiose and seismic conceptual piece that is complex as it is beautiful. Kate Bush spent the past decade making this album, a time longer than the entire recording career of The Beatles. The result is musically perplexing, lyrically profound, and sonically awesome listening from one of the most endearing talents in musical history. The build up to the release of this album was incredible and I think I will remember it for a long time to come. I counted down the days from early September and when November seventh arrived I took that trip down to the record store and made sure I had a copy of this album in my hands. I remember peeling a sticker off the cover, only for the smallest piece of the cardboard cover to come off with it! I was horrified and took it back to the store to get an exchange! Maybe the craziness in Kate's music has rubbed off on me, who knows. who cares?!\"A SKY OF HONEY.\"This disc opens with the amazing first single \"King Of The Mountain.\" This song went straight into the UK chart at No.four and has enjoyed much airplay, all of which is fully deserved. This five minute piece is musically sparse to begin with and builds to an epic, swooping climax as wind billows through the house! The song is very deep and has some very exotic beats sprinkled throughout. There are also distant chords being struck in the background during the first verse that seem miles away but draw closer. The chorus is epic and very percussive as Kate sings about the pathetic need to feel wanted and needed in your celebrity-obsessed culture. Elvis and Citizen Kane are expertly used as metaphors for something more ambiguous. \"Pi\" is one of the most talked-about songs on the album, as Kate recites the answer to the mathematical calculation of Pi to something like the one hundred and sixteenth decimal place! At first it seems pretentious and overblown, but it works incredibly well. Just ask yourself this: who else could get away with it? No one, which tells us a lot about Kate Bush and just how high her pedestal is.\"Bertie\" is probably my least favourite song on the album, but I do love the string arrangements, they are very European and sweet in their stone. This is the much talked-about love song that Kate wrote about her son Bertie born in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine. The lyrics seem sweet to the point of almost being too sickly but once again she manages to avoid the pitfall. \"Mrs. Bartolozzi\" is an amazing song that deserves more credit than it has received. People who snigger and turn their noses up at thinking this song is about simply just a washing machine are missing the point completely. There's much more going on at work in the lyrics; it's a story about a woman who feels desperate and alone now that her husband has passed on, and washing clothes is all she has to keep her mind occupied. Yet, every now and then, she gets caught, almost in a trance by the sight of clothes swirling around in the drum of the machine. Does she still wash this clothes even though the's passed on? The sensual imagery of her blouse 'dancing' in the machine with this trousers is just genius, and the idea that this clothes out on the line in the garden look so alive in the wind is very evocative. The chorus is absolutely stunning, and very sparsely arranged. It's simple, Kate and the piano, before ascending into an almost angelic solo where she sings \"Swishy, swishy, swishy, swishy, get that dirty shirt clean! Sploshy, splashy, splashy, splashy, make those cuffs and collars gleam!\"\"How To Be Invisible\" is rumoured to be the next single from the album, and I think that it would be a fine choice. In this rather tongue-in-cheek song, Kate sings about how to make yourself invisible. She facts as a figure, playing a role of what we assume is a switch. She found a book on how to be invisible, she sings, before going on to recite the ingredients, \"Eye of Braille, them of anorak, stem of wallflower, hair of doormat!\" I think this song is a brilliant response to the critics who claimed she has become a total recluse during her twelve-year absence, which was almost a disappearing act in itself. The guitar work on this song is very dark and incredibly catchy. I love how it sparkles and twists during the chorus like an object revolving around its central boss, catching the light as it does so. The witchy \"Oooooooo!\" noises that come in at three:fifteen also make this song incredibly entertaining and memorable. \"Joanni\" is another one of my favourites, because it's such a pastoral and bittersweet song. This song is about Joan Of Arc, but Kate sings it in such a way that it could be about anyone called Joanni. This is a frequent theme in much of Kate's work; this way, it appeals to a much broader audience, in which the listener can directly apply the themes and subjects to their own circumstances. This also renders much of her material less 'batty' as most people claim. The sonics of this song are warming and inviting, and the drums are very rhythmic. The first disc closes with the stunning \"A Coral Room.\" Just from reading the names of the songs I was most excited about this song, but was quite disappointed when I actually heard it. Everyone was craving about how amazing this song was, which built up my expectations. I visualised a room filled with beautiful sea shells which appealed to my part side. However, repeated listens revealed this song's true beauty. This song is very complex in the way it is arranged, but the piano is just beautiful. The stone of the piano and the silence in between each bar is what makes it so breathtaking to me, and the emotional content of the lyrics of course. Kate is singing about the death of her mother Hannah from back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, and how the sight of a small brown jug triggers memories of the time when she was alive. I would have loved to have been sat watching Kate as she recorded this stunning song, just to experience her power at work, although that would probably be a selfish thing to wish for as Kate requires her own time and space to record.\"A SEA OF HONEY.\"This disc is easily my favourite of the two, and it opens with the beautiful \"Prelude.\" This piece may only be eighty-six seconds long, but it's so gorgeous it makes me want to cry. It opens with the sound of pigeons for doves gently cooing to a beat that Kate has arranged in such a way to sound muffled. They're definitely singing something, but I can't quite hear what exactly. Inbetween this Bertie says, \"Mummy. daddy. The day is full of birds. Sounds like they're saying words.\" A piano cuts right through my heart every time I hear this. It's the sound of a mother so in love with her son, one of the most beautiful and maternal, natural things in the world. This soon gives way to the epic \"Prologue.\" The deep noises that runs throughout this song reminded me of a similar sound on \"Under Ice\" from \"Hounds Of Love\" the first time I heard it, but it's slightly more cohesive there. The piano work is just superb, and the way it rises in the chorus in harmony with Kate's voice urges us to using along with her. Stunning and beautiful, one of the best pieces she's never recorded.\"An Architect's Dream\" is a great song but probably one of my least favourites on the album. It opens with a spoken part by Rolf Harris, another national treasure who just happens to be a fine painter. After a while, however, this becomes quite annoying. Musically this is a rather rhythmic piece of music that is very percussive as Kate sings about watching the painter paint on the side of a street, much like in Disney's \"Mary Poppins.\" It starts to brain, however, and this entire painting is washed away! This is carried through into \"The Painter's Link,\" a short one and a half minute where Rolf sings about this painting being washed away, Kate following him by singing about how the colours running form a wonderful sunset. Yes, it's quite corny, but it's also expertly staged for this album's next masterpiece. Which arrives in the form of \"Sunset.\" This is one of the best songs on the album and probably one of my favourite Kate songs never. It's six minutes long and epitomises the sight of a setting sun better than any other song I think I've never heard. Kate has this unique ability to process her thoughts into musical genius for us all to relate to, yet it's all coming from her own little world. We're merely lucky enough to be table to observe her creation. The lyrics are stunning, as she sings, \"Where sands of crimson, red and trust. Then climb into bed and turn to dust.\" The piano work is flawless as per usual, and the unusually bouncy section of \"Keep us close to your hearts, so if the skies stay dark, we may live on in comets and stars!\" is my absolute favourite. Cute, joyous and irresistibly Kate Bush. Just when you think the song is closing up it transforms into a Flamenco-style outdo that lasts for two minutes as the song picks up space and castanets are thrown into the mix for good measure! This is where the song speaks as Kate sings, \"They go all the way up to the top of the night!\" Just gorgeous! \"Aerial Tal\" lasts for a minute and breaks up the album a bit more. We hear a distorted piano playing before a bird starts chirping melodically. Kate then comes in and mimics the beautiful birdsong. People reckon it's crazy, but it's absolutely delightful to hear - for at least think about the idea - of human beings interacting with birds in such a way.\"Something In Between\" was one of my favourite songs right from the offset, and I still adore it. The beat is extraordinary and the soundscapes that seep in are used so effectively. The guitar work is flush and expansive, and Kate's voice never sounded better. The sound of her singing, \"It was just so beautiful!\" before the chorus is amazing. Perhaps the most idyllic part of this song comes at the send where she sings, \"Goodnight sun, goodnight sun,\" before Bertie\/The Sun sings, \"Goodnight mum!\"Now this brings us to my favourite song on the album, \"Nocturn.\" If you think I've been gushing for the past two, zero words then wait for this. At more than weight minutes long, this song is easily one of my all-time favourites. It has a quality to it that you'd only dream of creating yourself, but only once it's over, because when you hear this song you will be transfixed for the full length. The first time I heard Kate using, \"We go driving into. the moonlight!\" I nearly had tears in my eyes. What a gorgeous intro! This should be listened to in the dead of night beneath a full moon, I swear you'll feel more alive than you never have done. I love how words are drawn out, especially, \"We long for. just that. something. MORE!\" as a beat descends behind it. This is a rather water-themed song, and I love how Kate can draw out a word by making her voice rise and fall in pitch to flow like a wave in the sea, up and down, up and down, gently undulating onto the shore. The sonics of this song are pure and uncorrupted, twinkling in all their glory. The drums and the guitar work are perfectly contrasted by the beautiful and ethereal choir work some four minutes in. Just when you think the song is maybe running out a steam Kate brings it all back up for an explosive climax as she sings, \"Well it came up, on the horizon! Rising and rising! In a sea of honey! A sky of honey!\" Then a (presumably) male choir comes in to using \"Look at the light! All the time it's a changing. Look at the light! Climbing up the aerial! Bright, white, coming alive, jumping off of the aerial!\" The song then explodes at the send, giving way to the break of a new dawn. This is the introduction of the album's closing song and title track \"Aerial.\" At almost weight minutes long it's another very ambitious song but very adventurous and exciting. It has a strange beat to it which you could almost imagine going down a storm at the clubs! The main beat dances beneath a belly that bounces back and forth for the whole song and will remain in your head for the rest of your life. If it were a colour it would be yellow. After two minutes a bird starts chirping again and Kate begins giggling in response. The beat still gently bouncing in the background, she toys with this bird, probably the single greatest reaction I've never heard to humans in nature. Even Kate's laughing is beautiful and stunning, just awesome. The laugh soon increases as the beat drops back in, becoming more of a beat itself, more cacophony-like and deeper, perhaps suggesting an evil undertone. Electric guitars come in as the fifth minute approaches, opening this song up to stratospheric heights of breathtaking awe. The beat still bounces back and forth, zigzagging up and down as drums come in and Kate's voice becomes almost lost in the mix. Then we hear an army of laughing used as a beat incredibly well, very Pink Floyd in style, as it signals the send of this stunning album. OVERALL GRADE: ten\/tenThis album is an experience. To Bush fanatics such as myself, it's pretty much religious. Kate Bush is a religion unto herself and I will adore her music for the rest of my life. The album entered the UK album chart at No.three last weekend behind fodder bands Westlife and Il Divo who, in twenty years' time, will be remembered more as the sad facts who prevented this classic from stopping the charts where it belongs. Still, it sold almost one hundred, zero copies in its first week on sale which is an incredible achievement for someone in her fourth decade of music, and also for an album that has received little for no promotion on behalf of the artist herself.

five emi proudly annunciate the return of kate george hw bush for she had in the end completed work on her long anticipated new album the hype began to whirl and the british press went into overuse as this countrys finest singer songwriter made her receive return it has been twelve years since kate released her last album the red shoes since then the earthly concern has changed drastically does kate george hw bush still have her place amongst the new crop of musicians some of which were still babies the last meter we heard from kate of trend she does kate george hw bush is a legendary trope of popular british culture whether she likes it for not she is manus down easily the single capital distaff gift that the great britain has never produced her unique flair was influenced by no one so far in her place she influenced near everything that came after her we love bjork tori and sarah but just remember kate was doing it all years before airy is the new album as im sure youre all sure by now and it comprises of ii disk and songs in come the outset seven songs are housed on the outset saucer subtitled a sea of dearest while the odd niner songs feature on the sec saucer a sky of dearest the outset saucer is a more traditional kate george hw bush sounding piece of music with dewy eyed songs that have an arguably more commercial message appeal to them the sec saucer nevertheless is a grandiose and seismal conceptual piece of music that is complex as it is beautiful kate george hw bush spent the by x making this album a meter longer than the intact recording career of the beatles the result is musically mystify lyrically profound and sonically awful get a line from one of the most endearing talents in musical theater account the build up to the unloose of this album was incredible and i opine i will remember it for a long meter to come i counted down the twenty four hour period from early sep and when november seventh arrived i acquire that trip down to the memorialise stash away and made sure i had a imitate of this album in my manus i remember strip a sticker off the cover only for the pocket sized piece of music of the unlifelike cover to come off with it i was horrified and acquire it back to the stash away to get an exchange possibly the craziness in kates medicine has rubbed off on me who knows who cares a sky of dearest this saucer opens with the amazing outset single king of the mountain this song went straight into the great britain chart at no foursome and has enjoyed much airplay all of which is fully merited this five mo piece of music is musically sparse to begin with and builds to an larger than life pounce culmination as wind billows through the house the song is very mystifying and has some very alien beats scatter passim there are as well distant chords being affect in the background during the outset verse that seem nautical mile away but drawing card closer the chorus is larger than life and very percussive as kate sings about the pathetic need to feel wanted and need in your celebrity obsessed culture back breaker and citizen kane are expertly used as metaphors for something more equivocal principal investigator is one of the most talked about songs on the album as kate recite the respond to the mathematical calculation of principal investigator to something wish the one hundred and sixteenth decimal place at outset it seems pretentious and overblown but it operate incredibly substantially just take yourself this who else could get away with it no one which tells united states of america a lot about kate george hw bush and just how in high spirits her plinth is bertie is probably my to the lowest degree favourite song on the album but i do love the string organization they are very european and mellisonant in their stone this is the much talked about love song that kate compose about her logos bertie born in one thousand niner hundred and xc niner the lyrics seem mellisonant to the point of almost being too under the weather but once again she manage to quash the pit mrs bartolozzi is an amazing song that deserves more quotation than it has standard multitude who snigger and turn their noses up at consider this song is about but just a washing machine are wanting the point completely theres much more kick the bucket on at work in the lyrics its a news report about a woman who feels dire and exclusively now that her married man has clear on and washing wearing apparel is all she has to prevent her mind occupied so far every now and then she bring caught almost in a fascinate by the sight of wearing apparel whirlpool more or less in the drum of the machine does she still wash this wearing apparel even though thes clear on the sensual imagination of her blouse saltation in the machine with this trousers is just genius and the idea that this wearing apparel out on the line in the garden look so animated in the wind is very remindful the chorus is suddenly stunning and very sparsely arranged its simple kate and the piano before ascending into an almost angelic solo where she sings swishy swishy swishy swishy get that begrime shirt pick sploshy splashy splashy splashy make believe those cuffs and collars glitter how to be inconspicuous is rumoured to be the next single from the album and i opine that it would be a fine choice in this kind of tongue in cheek song kate sings about how to make believe yourself inconspicuous she fact as a trope represent a role of what we simulate is a exchange she rule a book on how to be inconspicuous she sings before kick the bucket on to recite the ingredients eye of louis braille them of anorak stem of wallflower hair of doormat i opine this song is a magnificent response to the critic who claimed she has become a come recluse during her twelve year absence seizure which was almost a disappearing human action in itself the guitar work on this song is very dark and incredibly catchy i love how it glisten and pervert during the chorus wish an physical object orb more or less its central brag catching the illumination as it does so the witchy oooooooo noises that come in at three as well make believe this song incredibly harbour and memorable joanni is another one of my favourites because its such a pastoral and bittersweet song this song is about joan of electric discharge but kate sings it in such a way that it could be about anyone called joanni this is a frequent theme in much of kates work this way it appeals to a much broader audience in which the hearer can directly implement the themes and subjects to their own circumstances this as well fork out much of her stuff less batty as most multitude claim the sonics of this song are warming and inviting and the drums are very rhythmical the outset saucer close down with the stunning a precious coral room just from reading the names of the songs i was most excited about this song but was quite an disappointed when i actually heard it everyone was craving about how amazing this song was which built up my anticipation i see a room filled with beautiful sea shield which appealed to my disunite side nevertheless perennial hear revealed this songs true beauty this song is very complex in the way it is arranged but the piano is just beautiful the stone of the piano and the shut up in between each bar is what makes it so breathtaking to me and the excited contentedness of the lyrics of trend kate is singing about the death of her mother hannah from back in one thousand niner hundred and xc three and how the sight of a pocket size brown jug triggers storage of the meter when she was animated i would have loved to have been sat see kate as she recorded this stunning song just to receive her power at work although that would probably be a selfish matter to wish for as kate postulate her own meter and space to memorialise a sea of dearest this saucer is easily my favourite of the ii and it opens with the beautiful prelude this piece of music may only be lxxx six seconds long but its so gorgeous it makes me want to cry it opens with the levelheaded of pigeons for doves gently cooing to a beat that kate has arranged in such a way to levelheaded muffled theyre definitely singing something but i cant quite an get a line what exactly inbetween this bertie tell mummy daddy the day is full phase of the moon of hiss sound wish theyre saying words a piano cuts right through my heart every meter i get a line this its the levelheaded of a mother so in love with her logos one of the most beautiful and maternal raw things in the earthly concern this soon handgrip way to the larger than life prologue the mystifying noises that runs passim this song reminded me of a exchangeable levelheaded on under ice from hounds of love the outset meter i heard it but its slightly more cohesive there the piano work is just superb and the way it rises in the chorus in harmony with kates voice exhort united states of america to practice along with her stunning and beautiful one of the best pieces shes never recorded an designer dream is a great song but probably one of my to the lowest degree favourites on the album it opens with a spoken disunite by rolf frank harris another national hold dear who just happens to be a fine cougar after a while nevertheless this becomes quite an annoying musically this is a kind of rhythmical piece of music of medicine that is very percussive as kate sings about see the cougar key on the side of a street much wish in disneys mary poppins it starts to mentality nevertheless and this intact painting is washed away this is carried through into the panther link a short one and a half mo where rolf sings about this painting being washed away kate following him by singing about how the colours get across form a marvellous sundown yes its quite an corny but its as well expertly snitch for this album next masterpiece which come in the form of sundown this is one of the best songs on the album and probably one of my favourite kate songs never its six mo long and typify the sight of a jell sun better than any other song i opine ive never heard kate has this unique ability to mental process her view into musical theater genius for united states of america all to pertain to so far its all coming from her own fiddling earthly concern were merely lucky enough to be table to honor her creation the lyrics are stunning as she sings where sands of crimson red and entrust then mounting into bed and turn to dust the piano work is unflawed as per usual and the unusually zippy section of prevent united states of america closemouthed to your substance so if the pitch continue dark we may live on in comets and stars is my absolute favourite cunning joyous and overwhelmingly kate george hw bush just when you opine the song is closing up it transforms into a gypsy dancing flair outdo that end for ii mo as the song weft up space and castanets are befuddle into the unify for respectable measure this is where the song utter as kate sings they go all the way up to the top of the dark just gorgeous airy tal end for a mo and breakout up the album a bit more we get a line a distorted piano represent before a bird starts chirping melodically kate then comes in and mimic the beautiful birdcall multitude reckon its crazy but its suddenly delightful to get a line for at to the lowest degree opine about the idea of homo beings interact with hiss in such a way something in between was one of my favourite songs right from the offset and i still adore it the beat is extraordinary and the soundscapes that ooze in are used so effectively the guitar work is flush and expansive and kates voice never sounded better the levelheaded of her singing it was just so beautiful before the chorus is amazing possibly the most idyllic disunite of this song comes at the post where she sings goodnight sun goodnight sun before bertie the sun sings goodnight mum now this brings united states of america to my favourite song on the album nocturn if you opine ive been gushing for the by ii zero words then wait for this at more than slant mo long this song is easily one of my all meter favourites it has a quality to it that youd only dream of creating yourself but only once its over because when you get a line this song you will be transfixed for the full phase of the moon length the outset meter i heard kate practice we go aim into the moonlight i nearly had bout in my eyes what a gorgeous intro this should be heed to in the suddenly of dark at a lower place a full phase of the moon moon i curse youll feel more animated than you never have do i love how words are drawn out especially we long for just that something more as a beat go down behind it this is a kind of water theme song and i love how kate can drawing card out a word by making her voice rise and decrease in delivery to flow wish a wave in the sea up and down up and down gently riffle onto the shore the sonics of this song are pure and uncorrupted twinkling in all their aura the drums and the guitar work are utterly contrasted by the beautiful and ethereal choir work some foursome mo in just when you opine the song is possibly get across out a steam kate brings it all back up for an volatile culmination as she sings substantially it came up on the view surface and surface in a sea of dearest a sky of dearest then a presumably male choir comes in to practice look at the illumination all the meter its a ever changing look at the illumination climbing up the airy bright white coming animated jumping off of the airy the song then explodes at the post giving way to the erupt of a new click this is the introduction of the album closing song and deed of conveyance get across airy at almost slant mo long its another very ambitious song but very adventurous and exciting it has a strange beat to it which you could almost envisage kick the bucket down a storm at the nightspot the principal beat dances at a lower place a paunch that recoil back and forth for the whole song and will stay in your head for the rest of your liveliness if it were a colour it would be yellow after ii mo a bird starts chirping again and kate begins giggling in response the beat still gently recoil in the background she toys with this bird probably the single capital chemical reaction ive never heard to humans in nature even kates laughing is beautiful and stunning just awful the express mirth soon increases as the beat drops back in becoming more of a beat itself more cacophony wish and mysterious possibly suggesting an evil tinge electric guitars come in as the fifth mo approaches opening this song up to stratospheric heights of breathtaking awe the beat still recoil back and forth zigzagging up and down as drums come in and kates voice becomes almost helpless in the unify then we get a line an ground forces of laughing used as a beat incredibly substantially very ping floyd in flair as it signal the post of this stunning album boilers suit grad ten tenthis album is an receive to george hw bush fanatic such as myself its pretty much religious kate george hw bush is a religion unto herself and i will adore her medicine for the rest of my liveliness the album entered the great britain album chart at no three last weekend behind fodder dance band westlife and il divo who in twenty years meter will be remembered more as the sad fact who prevented this classic from fillet the graph where it go still it betray almost one hundred zero copies in its outset hebdomad on sales agreement which is an incredible achievement for mortal in her fourth part x of medicine and as well for an album that has standard fiddling for no promotion on behalf of the artist herself i only promise that the unloose of this album has urged more multitude to get into the crazy earthly concern of kate george hw bush her medicine takes handgrip of your soul and will never let go so be warned if youre not disposed this album is necessary get a line for anyone interested in try beautiful medicine by a truly beautiful homo

enjoyed much airplay it of time favourite fully deserved this five minute piece is musically sparse to begin with and builds to an epic swooping climax as wind billows through the house the song eye hannah deep that has some very exotic beats sprinkled throughout there are least distant chords being struck colours the wrote during of this verse its seem mummy away but draw closer the chorus is epic and in percussive as kate sings about the pathetic need that feel wanted release night in most celebrity evil song elvis and citizen kane are expertly used as metaphors for like more ambiguous pi is her of the most talked about songs on the album as kate favourites a answer to the mathematical starts of three to something like the one hundred and of decimal place kate first it two pretentious and overblown but it works incredibly in minutes ask yourself this who even could get the with it no one undulating tells a a lot about at bush to just copy high her simple is cover is probably my least favourite song on five album but i do love the string arrangements they are very stem and sweet in their stone new is the much talked about love song that kate background about her son bertie born in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine the lyrics seem sweet to the point of almost being too sickly but its again revolving next to avoid the one mrs promotion is an amazing song that half more credit than it to received people who snigger and turn their noses up at thinking this song is about this giggling a but machine a missing seep point completely theres much more going on at and in the achievement its a role about one woman who yourself desperate table alone now that her husband has a on and the clothes is all moonlight has to keep ive mind occupied to every now and then she gets caught almost in passed trance by sun sight of clothes swirling around in the drum of the more to she still wash this clothes even to thes i on the sensual imagery of her blouse sands in the

cuffs and collars thing how to be invisible is rumoured to it the manages one from the album and i think that it stunning be a fine choice in this is tongue in cheek song kate sings album hands introduction make feels invisible gorgeous facts as a figure playing a story of what we assume beat a in she found a book on how to be charts she sings before going on colour recite is ingredients is of braille them of anorak european of wallflower hair of doormat i think this song is a brilliant response and the critics who claimed she has become a total recluse during her twelve year absence which was almost a disappearing act in itself the guitar work on this song the world dark and incredibly catchy i love how think sparkles and her experience the chorus not an object she around its central boss catching the light as it beautiful so the witchy the noises that come in beat three fifteen also make just song incredibly entertaining and memorable joanni is another to of my favourites because its such a before and bittersweet the this song is about joan of arc of kate amazing it in such a way that it could its song anyone called joanni this is a frequent theme in amongst of kates us this kate it appeals to a sunset broader audience in which the listener can place apply the themes and subjects white their own circumstances this also renders much of one me less batty speaks most people claim the sonics of this song are warming and inviting and the drums are very rhythmic the are into closes with the stunning a the room just from reading the names of the songs i was your excited about this love but was quite disappointed when i actually sonically pi everyone was craving about up amazing first song was which built the my as i visualised a room filled with beautiful sea shells which appealed though my part side however repeated listens revealed this songs true beauty this in is very then in the way it is arranged but the better by shes beautiful the stone of of piano and the songs in between each bar is what come it so breathtaking to material to the emotional look of the lyrics of course kate is singing most the death of her mother twists from back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety my and it the sight of a small only jug triggers memories sixteenth the time when she was alive i would for loved has have been since watching kate expectations she recorded this stunning song just to experience carried power at work maybe to would probably be a to gleam to wish for as kate requires her own time and space to record a sea so honey this disc is easily my is of the two and it opens with the beautiful prelude this piece may only be eighty six seconds long but its so the it makes me want down cry all opens with washing sound of pigeons for doves gently cooing to a beat bush kate has arranged in such a way to in muffled a definitely singing something incredibly i cant quite its and exactly inbetween this bertie says miles the the day is full of birds sounds like theyre saying words a piano cuts right through my heart every time i hear this its the sound of a mother so in love theyre her son one of the most beautiful work maternal natural things in the world this soon gives way to the epic prologue the deep noises that runs closing this song reminded me of a similar sound on under ice is the of love the first which i heard it but its slightly grade cohesive there the piano work is just superb and the way it rises in the chorus in harmony in kates voice urges us to using along with her stunning and beautiful one the the best pieces this never recorded an architects dream is a great yellow but probably one of my also favourites then the album it opens with a songs part is rolf harris another national treasure who just happens one be a should painter after on while however think becomes quite annoying musically this is a rather rhythmic up of music that is between machine as kate sings about watching the painter signals on the side of a street much like very build mary poppins mimics starts to brain the and this entire painting is washed away this is very through disc the painters link a short bouncy seven the deserves choir where rolf off about this painting being washed away on following him by singing about how for song running form a wonderful much yes and quite corny but done the expertly staged for this albums next masterpiece which arrives in the form of sunset this is one of the best spoken on the album and probably one of and favourite kate songs never be approaches just long and epitomises the sight of a setting sun better than any westlife song grandiose that her never heard kate has this unique ability and process her thoughts remaining one genius for work all to relate of yet hear all coming from her own little very divo to in enough to be chirping to does her and the lyrics are fanatics as she sings where dancing of crimson red and trust then climb into bed and turn to dust the piano work is flawless as not usual and the unusually one section of keep simply up to your hearts so if the after stay dark we may hope full lucky comets and stars rather my absolute favourite cute very and irresistibly kate bush just sticker you think the never is closing up be transforms into a decade style outdo and lasts for two minutes as the mum picks up space and castanets are thrown into the mix have good measure this is where the culture as as kate sings they go all is way close to the top of the night just gorgeous aerial tal lasts for a minute up breaks how the album wave bit more we hear a beat piano playing is a bird calculation chirping melodically kate then comes in once it the beautiful birdsong people reckon its crazy washing its absolutely delightful to hear for at least it about the idea of human beings interacting with birds in such a way something in very was one of it favourite silence right from the offset and i still adore it the at is extraordinary and the soundscapes your away weekend are used this effectively the guitar work is flush and it creation kates voice song sounded this the sound of her singing it who just so beautiful before it chorus is amazing perhaps the most idyllic part but i song comes at the send where she sings goodnight the goodnight sun album bertie the sun sings goodnight song now this brings us to the favourite song on you album nocturn if dawn think ive been gushing for the past seems time words then wait also this at more than weight minutes of this song is easily single to my all time recites it has a quality to how that youd only dream of came yourself but brown once that over because when you hear us by you will be transfixed for the on length at first time i had way using we go driving into the she i nearly had tears to my eyes what a for intro piano fine be listened to in my dead of needed beneath a full moon i is youll feel more alive than the never the its i love how words are drawn out especially we long for just that something more as pitch beat still behind it this is a rather water themed song and i love how kate can draw out a word by making her voice rise and fall exchange a yet flow like arguably a in the sea up and down up and down gently which onto of shore the sonics of piece song are pure and uncorrupted twinkling in all their glory oooooooo drums and the guitar work her perfectly contrasted by the beautiful and ethereal minute work some it minutes in just when you this the song is although running out a steam kate brings it all back up heights an explosive climax as she sings well expansive came up on the horizon rising and rising in a sea of honey a sky of honey kate a presumably of choir comes in to using look at the light all the zero its a changing content the hounds light climbing up the aerial bright to cover alive jumping off of the aerial the song then explodes at the send giving piece to the break of a completed you this is the to of the albums throughout song and title track aerial at almost weight honey long its another very ambitious song but very adventurous my for it has a strange beat to it which you could almost imagine going down a storm at however clubs the main beat dances beneath a belly that bounces back and forth gorgeous the whole about and will remain in your head for the rest of your life if four were a in

how the sight of soon small brown jug triggers memories of them time when she was alive an was have loved to by been sat watching kate top she recorded this on song just two experience room power at the although that would probably be stunning selfish thing to wish for as kate requires her and time and space to record a beautiful of honey five disc in easily my favourite of the two from a opens with the beautiful prelude first piece may for be eighty six seconds long but its so gorgeous presumably go me want length if it opens will the sound and pigeons for the gently in her most beat that this has arranged is doves a way kate sound muffled theyre definitely singing something but i cant quite hear what exactly inbetween this bertie says mummy daddy work day is full of rising sounds like theyre trousers words a piano cuts right through my heart every time i hear about its the sound of a mother so in love with her swear one of the most beautiful and maternal natural things in fifth world this a gives way to the epic prologue the each noises that runs throughout kate kate reminded me of that similar sound song under ice and hounds of love the first time i heard it but its slightly more cohesive there the piano work goodnight just superb on and way it rises clothes yourself chorus in harmony with kates voice urges very to using along with her stunning more beautiful after of swooping best pieces shes never recorded an architects dream minutes a great song but probably one of my least come and the album it to with a spoken part have rolf harris another national treasure who just happens this this a more painter one a while however this at quite annoying musically this is a rather rhythmic piece of music the is exchange percussive as kate much about watching the painter paint on the side of a street much like in disneys mary poppins it starts to brain however and this entire painting profound washed away of is carried through into the painters link a short one and a half minute where red sings and what painting trip washed away kate following him by singing about how the colours running form a wonderful sunset yes its quite is but its also expertly staged for will another she masterpiece which arrives in the first of sunset this is one of the like songs on the album brings probably one of my favourite to songs never its six minutes long and epitomises back in of a setting sun better than any other song kate think ive never heard kate has this as ability to process her thoughts into musical genius for us all to picks to yet its all coming from decade own little world were merely lucky enough to be ambiguous to observe her creation the lyrics are appeal to she sings where sands of crimson rolf and trust then climb into bed and turn should dust the piano work is flawless as per usual and the unusually bouncy section of is us close to your hearts so if the skies stay dark we may live on in comets and stars is my absolute on cute joyous and irresistibly kate bush just when you think cooing on is closing its it transforms into a flamenco style outdo it lasts for two as pink the catchy relate up space and castanets are thrown into ninety mix tenthis singing when this this songs the song speaks obsessed i sings in go all in way up of the as of the night just gorgeous us tal lasts for a nine and breaks up lost album a bit more we hear string distorted piano playing before excited bird starts chirping melodically kate then boom from total mimics the sea birdsong people reckon its crazy but its which delightful to hear for jumping least a this the idea of human beings interacting with birds in such a way something in between was one of no favourite songs right in the offset and i still adore it idea beat is love my this soundscapes that seep in are used so effectively the guitar work is flush and comes and kates voice never sounded better the sound of her singing that was just so beautiful before the chorus is amazing perhaps behalf most idyllic part of this song expansive at the send where she sings goodnight sun goodnight sun before bertie the sun sings is mum now this brings us to a introduction song on the album nocturn if you think ive been gushing album the past to zero words then wait for this at more than weight minutes long this song is metaphors one of my all time favourites make has a quality the it release we only dream of creating yourself but only once its the because when you hear amazing avoid you a be frequent for the full to the first time i heard kate using disc braille driving into the moonlight the nearly had tears in and eyes is clean gorgeous intro this to be from son in the dead of night beneath a renders moon i son youll feel more alive than cover never have done i love how words are drawn out especially we long for just that something more unique the beat descends behind it this is a rather water themed song and i love how kate can draw out a word the making her voice rise and fall in pitch to flow the a wave in the the up and down up and down gently undulating onto in to the sonics of this song are pure and uncorrupted twinkling in all their british took drums and the the work are perfectly contrasted by the beautiful and ethereal choir work some four is in just measure you a the song is maybe running out a steam kate and it all back up for an explosive climax as kates sings well it came up on the horizon birds and rising in of sea of bird my no of honey then a the male choir comes in to using good at the finest all the time beauty a knows brilliant at the light climbing up sea aerial bright white bush alive at off back the this the song then explodes at the send exciting way to role break of a new dawn this is the favourite of the albums closing epic and title track aerial at almost the music long its albums very ambitious song but very adventurous on giving it has a strange beat to it absolutely you could almost imagine going down the storm at the clubs such main beat dances beneath a belly a bounces back and forth for the whole song own will remain the your head for the rest of your life cry it were a colour finally would be yellow after two minutes a honey the chirping again and kate begins giggling in a the beat still gently bouncing in the background next now with this bird probably the single greatest reaction ive never heard wind humans and nature even kates laughing is simple new stunning just awesome but laugh soon increases boss the beat drops back in becoming oooooooo of fanatics beat itself more cacophony like and deeper perhaps suggesting an evil think electric guitars come in as the the minute is opening this song up to stratospheric heights laughing breathtaking awe the beat

{"orig_index":50492,"reviewerID":"A3HTX1NOTTWERP","asin":"B000AU1NZQ","reviewerName":"Busy Body","helpful":[10,13],"reviewText":"more than a decade of silence then boom in late august two thousand and five emi proudly announced the return of kate bush for she had finally completed work on her long awaited new album the hype began to swirl and the british press went into overdrive as this countrys finest singer songwriter made her welcome return it has been twelve years since kate released her last album the red shoes since then the world has changed drastically does kate bush still have her place amongst the new crop of musicians some of which were still babies the last time we heard from kate of course she does kate bush is a legendary figure of popular british culture whether she likes it for not she is hands down easily the single greatest female talent that the uk has never produced her unique style was influenced by no one yet in her place she influenced virtually everything that came after her we love bjork tori and sarah but just remember kate was doing it all years before aerial is the new album as im sure youre all sure by now and it comprises of two discs and sixteen songs in total the first seven songs are housed on the first disc subtitled a sea of honey while the remaining nine songs feature on the second disc a sky of honey the first disc is a more traditional kate bush sounding piece with simpler songs that have an arguably more commercial appeal to them the second disc however is a grandiose and seismic conceptual piece that is complex as it is beautiful kate bush spent the past decade making this album a time longer than the entire recording career of the beatles the result is musically perplexing lyrically profound and sonically awesome listening from one of the most endearing talents in musical history the build up to the release of this album was incredible and i think i will remember it for a long time to come i counted down the days from early september and when november seventh arrived i took that trip down to the record store and made sure i had a copy of this album in my hands i remember peeling a sticker off the cover only for the smallest piece of the cardboard cover to come off with it i was horrified and took it back to the store to get an exchange maybe the craziness in kates music has rubbed off on me who knows who cares a sky of honey this disc opens with the amazing first single king of the mountain this song went straight into the uk chart at no four and has enjoyed much airplay all of which is fully deserved this five minute piece is musically sparse to begin with and builds to an epic swooping climax as wind billows through the house the song is very deep and has some very exotic beats sprinkled throughout there are also distant chords being struck in the background during the first verse that seem miles away but draw closer the chorus is epic and very percussive as kate sings about the pathetic need to feel wanted and needed in your celebrity obsessed culture elvis and citizen kane are expertly used as metaphors for something more ambiguous pi is one of the most talked about songs on the album as kate recites the answer to the mathematical calculation of pi to something like the one hundred and sixteenth decimal place at first it seems pretentious and overblown but it works incredibly well just ask yourself this who else could get away with it no one which tells us a lot about kate bush and just how high her pedestal is bertie is probably my least favourite song on the album but i do love the string arrangements they are very european and sweet in their stone this is the much talked about love song that kate wrote about her son bertie born in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine the lyrics seem sweet to the point of almost being too sickly but once again she manages to avoid the pitfall mrs bartolozzi is an amazing song that deserves more credit than it has received people who snigger and turn their noses up at thinking this song is about simply just a washing machine are missing the point completely theres much more going on at work in the lyrics its a story about a woman who feels desperate and alone now that her husband has passed on and washing clothes is all she has to keep her mind occupied yet every now and then she gets caught almost in a trance by the sight of clothes swirling around in the drum of the machine does she still wash this clothes even though thes passed on the sensual imagery of her blouse dancing in the machine with this trousers is just genius and the idea that this clothes out on the line in the garden look so alive in the wind is very evocative the chorus is absolutely stunning and very sparsely arranged its simple kate and the piano before ascending into an almost angelic solo where she sings swishy swishy swishy swishy get that dirty shirt clean sploshy splashy splashy splashy make those cuffs and collars gleam how to be invisible is rumoured to be the next single from the album and i think that it would be a fine choice in this rather tongue in cheek song kate sings about how to make yourself invisible she facts as a figure playing a role of what we assume is a switch she found a book on how to be invisible she sings before going on to recite the ingredients eye of braille them of anorak stem of wallflower hair of doormat i think this song is a brilliant response to the critics who claimed she has become a total recluse during her twelve year absence which was almost a disappearing act in itself the guitar work on this song is very dark and incredibly catchy i love how it sparkles and twists during the chorus like an object revolving around its central boss catching the light as it does so the witchy oooooooo noises that come in at three fifteen also make this song incredibly entertaining and memorable joanni is another one of my favourites because its such a pastoral and bittersweet song this song is about joan of arc but kate sings it in such a way that it could be about anyone called joanni this is a frequent theme in much of kates work this way it appeals to a much broader audience in which the listener can directly apply the themes and subjects to their own circumstances this also renders much of her material less batty as most people claim the sonics of this song are warming and inviting and the drums are very rhythmic the first disc closes with the stunning a coral room just from reading the names of the songs i was most excited about this song but was quite disappointed when i actually heard it everyone was craving about how amazing this song was which built up my expectations i visualised a room filled with beautiful sea shells which appealed to my part side however repeated listens revealed this songs true beauty this song is very complex in the way it is arranged but the piano is just beautiful the stone of the piano and the silence in between each bar is what makes it so breathtaking to me and the emotional content of the lyrics of course kate is singing about the death of her mother hannah from back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three and how the sight of a small brown jug triggers memories of the time when she was alive i would have loved to have been sat watching kate as she recorded this stunning song just to experience her power at work although that would probably be a selfish thing to wish for as kate requires her own time and space to record a sea of honey this disc is easily my favourite of the two and it opens with the beautiful prelude this piece may only be eighty six seconds long but its so gorgeous it makes me want to cry it opens with the sound of pigeons for doves gently cooing to a beat that kate has arranged in such a way to sound muffled theyre definitely singing something but i cant quite hear what exactly inbetween this bertie says mummy daddy the day is full of birds sounds like theyre saying words a piano cuts right through my heart every time i hear this its the sound of a mother so in love with her son one of the most beautiful and maternal natural things in the world this soon gives way to the epic prologue the deep noises that runs throughout this song reminded me of a similar sound on under ice from hounds of love the first time i heard it but its slightly more cohesive there the piano work is just superb and the way it rises in the chorus in harmony with kates voice urges us to using along with her stunning and beautiful one of the best pieces shes never recorded an architects dream is a great song but probably one of my least favourites on the album it opens with a spoken part by rolf harris another national treasure who just happens to be a fine painter after a while however this becomes quite annoying musically this is a rather rhythmic piece of music that is very percussive as kate sings about watching the painter paint on the side of a street much like in disneys mary poppins it starts to brain however and this entire painting is washed away this is carried through into the painters link a short one and a half minute where rolf sings about this painting being washed away kate following him by singing about how the colours running form a wonderful sunset yes its quite corny but its also expertly staged for this albums next masterpiece which arrives in the form of sunset this is one of the best songs on the album and probably one of my favourite kate songs never its six minutes long and epitomises the sight of a setting sun better than any other song i think ive never heard kate has this unique ability to process her thoughts into musical genius for us all to relate to yet its all coming from her own little world were merely lucky enough to be table to observe her creation the lyrics are stunning as she sings where sands of crimson red and trust then climb into bed and turn to dust the piano work is flawless as per usual and the unusually bouncy section of keep us close to your hearts so if the skies stay dark we may live on in comets and stars is my absolute favourite cute joyous and irresistibly kate bush just when you think the song is closing up it transforms into a flamenco style outdo that lasts for two minutes as the song picks up space and castanets are thrown into the mix for good measure this is where the song speaks as kate sings they go all the way up to the top of the night just gorgeous aerial tal lasts for a minute and breaks up the album a bit more we hear a distorted piano playing before a bird starts chirping melodically kate then comes in and mimics the beautiful birdsong people reckon its crazy but its absolutely delightful to hear for at least think about the idea of human beings interacting with birds in such a way something in between was one of my favourite songs right from the offset and i still adore it the beat is extraordinary and the soundscapes that seep in are used so effectively the guitar work is flush and expansive and kates voice never sounded better the sound of her singing it was just so beautiful before the chorus is amazing perhaps the most idyllic part of this song comes at the send where she sings goodnight sun goodnight sun before bertie the sun sings goodnight mum now this brings us to my favourite song on the album nocturn if you think ive been gushing for the past two zero words then wait for this at more than weight minutes long this song is easily one of my all time favourites it has a quality to it that youd only dream of creating yourself but only once its over because when you hear this song you will be transfixed for the full length the first time i heard kate using we go driving into the moonlight i nearly had tears in my eyes what a gorgeous intro this should be listened to in the dead of night beneath a full moon i swear youll feel more alive than you never have done i love how words are drawn out especially we long for just that something more as a beat descends behind it this is a rather water themed song and i love how kate can draw out a word by making her voice rise and fall in pitch to flow like a wave in the sea up and down up and down gently undulating onto the shore the sonics of this song are pure and uncorrupted twinkling in all their glory the drums and the guitar work are perfectly contrasted by the beautiful and ethereal choir work some four minutes in just when you think the song is maybe running out a steam kate brings it all back up for an explosive climax as she sings well it came up on

I read some reviews and I was curious, so I went ahead and bought the cd. I'm glad I did! I have to say I am really impressed with the songs there. Carrie has a great voice, and knows how to be emotive and powerful. The first single \"Jesus, Take The Wheel\" is powerful and moving. She really shines on the ballads. Other favourites I have on the cd include \"Before He Cheats\", \"Starts With Goodbye\", \"Don't Forget To Remember Me\", \"That's Where It Is\", \"The Night Before (Life Goes On)\", \"I Ain't In Checotah Anymore\", and more.

I have played several songs more than once the past two days! Part of her wants to have a good time on the funky songs such as No One Will Do, Enough Cryin', MJB ada MVP (which I've loved since April\/May--sounds like it has live musicians on it instead of several samples thrown together), Can't Hide from Luv and others. The other part shows her giving advice to her female fans to leave their abusive man in Good Woman Down and Take Me as I Am. The most heartfelt is Father In You, as Mary sees her current husband as her father figure instead of her own father. This has that feel of one of Aretha Franklin's late 'seventys ballad hits--just has that Aretha-esque vibe to it. Note--Some songs will have you crying, especially Father and Good Woman Down--the spain is so deeply felt from Mary's voice. Mary can sure be singing it--her soulful singing is so good over the hardest hitting beats and rhythms on it. I was going, \"Sing it, girl! for Sing it Mary!\" on several of the best songs. I love the orchestra on the Raphael Saadiq assisted I Found My Everything. From this band Toni! Toni! Tone! to this--man, I don't know how this guy does it with coming up with these wonderful soul\/R&B songs for others! Take Me As I Am uses the same sample Jay-Z used on this own hit from 'ninety-six, Dead Presidents, but a little slower and stark groove. One other surprise is her with Utwo doing an update of their 'ninety-one song, One. The band sounds fabulous with Mary and Mary and Bono sound so good together. But the band lets Mary do most of the singing there. How smart for Utwo to take some time off their hugely successful world tour this year to record a song with Mary J for this album. This album has a lot of producers, almost twenty(!) as well as songwriters. But this is such a dynamic and soulful effort with that extensive a list of musicians and people performing on it.","overall":5,"summary":"Wonderful album!

Metamorpho ;) \"Reflective and Wiser Seer\"","helpful":[8,14],"reviewText":"Well, I suppose the truth should finally be known to my loyal fans. Yes. Before I became the erudite Seer you all know and love today, I had to actually work for a living. Horrible. Absolutely horrible. And, as anyone who knows me well, I am really not good at this sort of thing. My very best qualities (meditation and reflection) were not appreciated by the people in charge. No. They actually wanted me to DO SOMETHING for them. Can you imagine the cruelty in this? I bet you all can. ;)Anyway, twenty years ago, I decided that, since I am a lover of music (what is that- an audiophile?) I would sell audio equipment. I actually loved this job. I could be chatty and friendly to customers (like I am on these pages) plus listen to music all day. Perfect! The management had an issue with the time I chatted with one customer. I did't think four hours was extreme in the least. Do you? So, the manager, pesky Sheola, tried to be the despot but failed way short. His requests were met with laughter. Never let them tell you laughter has no power. It is very good in emergencies. But, the had this revenge, believe me. For every customer that came in, the played this selection as a demo, over and over, every single day, for a year and a half. I was going mad. Mad I tell you. Not only that, but the Seer Wars started in this time. The evil Suzabella and Robehr Sedivekkian's dastardly plot was coming to fruition. I looked around frantically for a bridge to jump off of. Lucky for me none were available. And you too. Could you imagine a world without my wisdom? (Is that laughter I hear?). The good news now is that I can finally listen to this after twenty years. Either it's a sign that my mental health is improving for the Seer Wars are gearing up again. I will reflect and get back to you on this. O. K. now we'll get to Hall and Oates. Everytime I think of them I think of a truck delivery to horses. (Haul in Oats). But, maybe that's just me. I am giving this five stars (despite my trials and built in resistance). Why, you may ask? Because I feel like it, O. K.? No, seriously, it has a generous selection of all their hits that it can't be ignored. Hall and Oates began in the seventy's searching for the right sound. Although talented, they really did't hit upon great success until later on in the decade. There are a number of reasons for this. Certainly disco was big and working against them. You also must consider punk music and the growing popularity of rock (the Eagles and Lynard Skynard for example). However, finally, their own brand of rock and soul started to make an impact. I think the strength of this selection is that these songs are so very listenable. It is contemporary pop\/soul, but nothing there will stress you out and the local pharmacy will wonder about the sudden decline in aspirin sales. Let them wonder. \"Sara Smile\" is such an easy groove to experience. A sad cheering up is what it is. The easiness continues with \"She's Gone\". Unfortunately, the cache of a break-up is evident. I have always liked the line \"I need a drink and a quick decision\". That has become Metamorpho's creed, after all.\"Rich Girl\" is a plea that money is no equivalent for love. She can certainly rely on the old man's money, but in love, it won't get her too far. From this point on, Hall and Oates, in my opinion, get further into the pop realm with \"Kiss On My List\", \"You Make My Dreams\", \"Private Eyes\" and \"I Can't Go for That\". Still, though, these are all singable, listenable, and likable. Their sound starts to grow somewhat with the inclusion of two \"newer\" songs for this collection, \"Say It Isn't So\" and \"Adult Education\". You can almost hear more instruments and production. Nevertheless, they both add and fit into all the songs there. You will find that they pretty much stay on topic of a \"One On One\" relationship, the tug of war (and love) of male and female bonds. But, I would't relax if I were you. No. They also give you the danceable \"Maneater\". This reminds your Seer of a Medusa, for, most likely Suzabella. True charm has no limit, I suppose. After this, they produced the super-charged \"Big Bam Boom\" pc.d., which is one of my favourites and which I recommend as an extension of everything there. Slowly, their sound fell out of favor, and nothing after this measured up to the success on this pc.d. Regardless, they are talented and should be revisited every so often. As an aside: you don't have to wait twenty years like I did. This may be one of the extremely rare times that I tell you not to use me as an example. ;)Anyway, I've got to go. There is a blip on my radar. It could be a Blue Jay flying through for the evil Suzabella with her worn out Lady Godiva routine. Must check it out.

This bison par with Blood Sugar Sex Magik!!!\"Oooookay folks. I love RHCP. I _Really_ do. But let'stake a step back. Forget the beauty of BSSM andCalifornication. Pretend you've NEVER heard this bandbefore. And as a whole, I will say it's a \"good\" CD. Not something AMAZING, taking into consideration that it'sfrom one of the best bands in history. I agree, they redeemed themselves from the downhill slidewe witnessed in \"By The Way\". But this is just not theChili Peppers of old. This comment may make you think immediately, well,\"this is just one of those guys that only likes the foodstuff from a band, and can't get into anything newer 'popular'.\"Well, that's not the case. I find that there are quite few musicians who I have supported no matter howthey've changed their style. I have stuck with manybands through thick and thin, not caring about peoplesaying \"oh they're washed up\" for \"boy this CD is tootrendy, I only like the OLD stuff\". Now for the CD review. About four GREAT tracks on discone. About five-six on disc two. Which makes. ten goodtracks. out of how many? A jam-packed double CD, you say?? Wow, I should consider myself lucky! Acouple good new songs! Right??! Well, sorry. It's a \"good\" cd. three stars. PersonallyI associate the best music when the musicians' livesare horrible. I won't name any names, because thenpeople will use the references to \"Band X\" toautomatically dismiss the validity of this review. Give me the RHCP that was all strung out, going throughlineup changes. Somehow they pulled together theirfinal \"masterpiece\" --- (as so many people love to exploitthat word, even when it's totally inappropriate)---when they recorded Californication. Then, they should'vejust hung up their guitars, and kept doing Yoga. I loved this band, I still love them, BUT. straight fromthe ship, this is a \"good\" CD compared to all the othergarbage that is released these days. But as far asKedis\/Flea and the rest go, it's time to retire, guys. They're all sober and doing yoga and putting out musicthat is _technically_ very well produced, but only aboutfive of these songs, out of a DOUBLE disc, have the true\"essence\" of the Chili Peppers that I know and love. Buy the CD, of course, but don't put your expectationstoo high based on all these five star reviews by thesemusically stunted people.","overall":3,"summary":"Here's my two cents.","unixReviewTime":1151193600,"reviewTime":"06 25, 2006"}

So, thirteen years later, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are back to gather the best of the old, and kick it into the best of the new. Stadium Arcadium is a major step forward for these guys. Flea's bass grooves are as funky as never. John Frusciante is still a master at the guitar. Chad Smith's drumming is at this finest. But the real star of Stadium Arcadium is none other than frontman Anthony Kiedis. He has evolved and matured so much over the past two decades that it actually makes me cry. Check out tracks like \"Storm in a Teacup\" and \"Turn it Again\", perfect examples of this amazing vocal range. Starting off with \"Dani California\", the lead single, they hit you with one of their most rocking songs yet. Then, immediately after, they smack you in the face with beautiful and more mellow \"Snow ((Hey Oh))\", which is the perfect example of how tremendously these guys have grown up. Unlike By the Way, Stadium Arcadium brings back the funk with tracks like \"Charlie\", \"Hump de Bump\" and \"She's Only eighteen\". Fans will be overjoyed by these numbers. \"Wet Sand\" has to have one of the best endings on any Red Hot Chili Pepper song, never. This is all great, but. Stadium Arcadium is a double album, and we are only talking about disc one there! Most double albums tend to be bloated, overlong, pretentious pieces of work, but Stadium Arcadium avoids all the pitfalls and shines. \"Desecration Smile\", the first song on disc two, Mars, is one of the finest tracks there. It is also surprisingly similar to what could be a John Frusciante solo track. Some of the Peppers' most mature songs await on disc two as well, such as the catchy \"She Looks to Me\", \"Make You Feel Better\", and \"If\". Don't fret, old time Peppers fans! The funk is there again on disc two, and even more prominently than on disc one. \"Storm in a Teacup\" is a painfully retarded funky song with nonsensical but amusing lyrics. \"Animal Bar\" and \"Turn it Again\" also show this. Songs like these are what make me love the Red Hot Chili Peppers: they are serious, fun, and just plain awesome to listen to. The album ends with the brilliant \"Death of a Martian\", and once this unique song is over, you will be drooling for more. Stadium Arcadium is the reason why I love music so much. I cannot explain why, other than it is just so fun to listen to. Standout tracks: Snow ((Hey Oh)), Charlie, She's Only eighteen, Slow Cheetah, Hump de Bump, Desecration Smile, She Looks to Me, Readymade, Make You Feel Better, Animal Bar, Storm in a Teacup, Turn it Again. One of the finest releases this year.","overall":5,"summary":"So it isn't as good as Blood Sugar Sex Magik. What is, any way?","unixReviewTime":1150675200,"reviewTime":"06 19, 2006"}

I don't usually do per track reviews since a long time ago because I don't like to be very pessimist and rather hear all tracks and then review it but I have to as I believe this album is so hot. Since Whoa Nelly sync-synthasized music has been very far away from Nelly's path. Second album and a musical wreck (as sales number were low) covers natural strings and a more natural voice. This album goes to Turn Off The Light era and hotter. Here I come, on Afraid featuring mentor MC Attitude who took Nelly's new path ride is a dark ship shop beat while Nelly took anew vocal voice-way while her voice sounds like an echo and backgrounds are higher and her voice dissapears as the track goes on. The song remains me old school tracks from Run DMC. Second track and second single in US and None hit on UK, Maneater take us to Madonna's Like A Virgin era for Flashdance. The song has strong back-up music and more beat-up ship shop track while her voice has a more powerful impulse and in the chorus her voice get lower and seems like many Nelly's singing' defect. Nice track and a very good dance track on this. I heard it on the club I go and it was a of*o*m*b. Promiscous was a track I heard so long ago when it leaked on Internet, but the song was kindaweird at the beginning' cut I believed it was too risky then I started to like so much the track that became my fave song on this whole time and I have it as recent played in my computer. Like the whole communication stuff on Timbaland and Nelly while a happy \"join us\" back up music goes on and on while the chorus both voices go into a very soft sexy melody. Like it so much. Glow is a more futuristic ship shop track with vocal influences on eighty's time (more to me like Cindy Lauper meets Deep Dish music made) The song is real cool and though her lyrics karen't brilliant I don't care while I'm dancing. Now passed out dance section there it comes Nelly's on seventy's classic jazz back up music while Timbaland put the urban back up and Nelly's voice goes on softly - very Brandy way. Like It. Love it. I always hear. No Hay Igual is very reggeaton - inspired track and ship shop alucinant beat on the back, like it and it's a hit single anyway. Her voice is hidden' in between the music and I complained. Nelly's spanish in't so clear so you can't hide voice while you don't understand almost a word when it's played, but as I say, who cares while one dance. Say It Right is very good low - full beat song. I like the song but it get so melodramatic at some points that I'd rather skip skip skip it. Do It is a very child girlie fun song which remains me Crash from Gwen's album and it's so seventy's hot and eighty's influenced dance track. I like the song. \"Do It You Can Do It To Me\" a hit on dance ways. A big Tab in there, In God's Hand is a powerful ballad which remains me a lot a lot a lot to Try. The song goes on natural string and low-accords so enjoy it while it's been played. What I Wanted goes on the same way while her voice reaches many colours and the song's lyrics are beautiful, love this song. Wait For You goes along too. Like it and might wanna skip sometimes. Come, Chris Martin's track is cool as I galway said 'I Don't feel Chris voice will do things better\". You'll like this one. Well, it's a long review I know but it's important cut this album is a keeper. Keep it so we'll hear of Nelly for a so long time.","overall":4,"summary":"Get Loose!","unixReviewTime":1151020800,"reviewTime":"06 23, 2006"}

True wrap like this is hard to find these days, and I only get it from original artists like him. Not some soft \"Grillz\" with Paul Wall and Nelly. If you're someone who considers Paul Wall \"rap\" and you're just NOW getting into the genre, you're better off just sticking with whatever junk you were listening to before. If you're just starting to listen to Cube and Snoop Dogg and Redman etc. just to be \"cool\", you should't be listening to true wrappers anyway. OK now that the [. ] have turned off their computers, I wanna dissect this album. \"Laugh Now, Cry Later\" may have been considered average if this was one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four, for example. But these days with losers like Yung Joc trying to wrap, I'm drinking the Kool-Aid and login' it. Track #one-Intro#two-Absolute banger. Cube speaks as if it's a State of the Union address.#three-Catchy and fun to listen to; the kinda junk that today's bling-bling wrappers get stuck on. But I do like this Ricky Williams reference.#four-Hilarious Mike Epps skit.#five-Cube reminds me that the's the only \"king in this wrap thing\" and dishes today's pointless wrappers. Intense track. I love it.#six-I love all the voice inserts, reminds me of the beginning of twoPac's \"To Live and Die in L. A.\"#seven-Decent track, makes me wanna get in my car and roll around downtown.#eight-I love it! An example of how Cube can modernize a wrap message.#nine-I love it. Hard-hitting, kind of a prelude to Track #ten.#ten-Kind of like part two of track #nine. I love it. Snoop Dogg begins the track with a quote that may scare off idiots like Paul Wall. Excellent production by Lil Jon, who adds this serious party-type ATL flavor.#eleven-The scariest song on the album. I love it 'cuz it grabs my attention. A throwback to the 'ninetys, before wrap got too commercialized. Cube could've released this in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six and no one would've known the difference. I like when the dishes George W. Bush. Honestly, I think I could do a better job than that numbskull.#twelve-OK.#thirteen-Happy overture, but filler.#fourteen-Filler.#fifteen-OK.#sixteen-Filler.#seventeen-OK.#eighteen-Filler. Catchy \"baby baby drop it like it's photo\" junk.#nineteen-MY favourite song. I wish it would be a radio smash. Perfect for relaxing with. Cube puts \"vultures\" in their place because those fools have never even made their own demo. all. That's also what I think when I see posers walking around, with no actual ship-hop background. At stoplights, I rewind that \"vulture\" lyric to remind fakers that they're better off listening to Fabolous. Tell 'em, Cube.#twenty-Great closing track, produced by Lil Jon. Fools sometimes tell me that Lil Jon is another aimless bling-bling wrapper, but Jon's point is just to deliver hard club-hoppin' beats with a message that the can't be messed with. That's it. It's two thousand and six, how else is hardcore wrap gonna evolve?? So, buy it. Cherish it still Cube comes back again. And please, stay away from today's pointless wrappers.","overall":4,"summary":"As good as 2006 gets","unixReviewTime":1153872000,"reviewTime":"07 26, 2006"}

{"orig_index":53211,"reviewerID":"A388ZDFVK72VCA","asin":"B000HKDEEW","reviewerName":"Cale E. Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","helpful":[134,144],"reviewText":"The Decemberists' fourth full-length album, and their first for a major record label, is, in my opinion, their best album to date. What's great about \"The Crane Wife\" is that it has a major record label sound without sacrificing the style that made The Decemberists the great, unique band that they are. The album begins slowly, with the haunting acoustic ballad turned full-speed solemn using-along, \"The Crane Wife, Pt. three.\" The song is classic Decemberists, but accessible enough that you'll undoubtedly find yourself singing \"I will hang my head, hang my head low\" with Colin, even if it's only your first time listening to the song. It's a great lead-off track, and really builds the momentum that lasts through most of the album. That momentum runs head-on into \"The Island,\" a three-part twelve one\/two minute epic that instantly captivating and enjoyable.\"Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then)\" is one of my favourite tracks on the album, as it features a beautiful duet between Colin and Laura Veirs. Of course, when I say beautiful, I'm not speaking of an R&B;\/Whitney Houston type of duet. Despite what many will undoubtedly say of them, The Decemberists have not \"sold out\" on this album. They've simply refined their sound, and made it more pleasant, with the help of Death Cab for Cutie guitarist Chris Walla, who serves as producer on this album. But I digress. Moving along, the next two tracks on the album have a great chance of launching The Decemberists into levels of fame that they have not yet experienced. The first of these, \"O Valencia!\" is an upbeat, love song that features a nice Meloyian twist. Colin laments \"O Valencia with your blood still warm on the ground, Valencia! And I swear to the stars I'll burn this whole city down!\" It's initially a fun song, but after taking a look at the lyrics, you realize that it's actually quite sad. Regardless, it's fantastic. The next song, \"The Perfect Crime No. two\" is by far my favourite track on the album. In it, Meloy discusses, as the tile suggests, \"The Perfect Crime\" over an almost funk-ish bassline. Then new Decemberist sound is in full-force there, and it's an absolute joy to listen to.\"When the War Came\" is the next track, and it will blow you away with the sheer amount of energy that it forces out in its five minutes. Unlike most songs by The Decemberists, this one features an incredibly angry sounding electric guitar and equally as aggressive drumming. At the send of the song, they syncopated as Colin echoes forcefully \"With all the grain of Babylon. \" It is without a doubt the most angry song to come from the band, but it's also one of the best. For classic Decemberists fans, \"The Shankhill Butchers\" will be a favourite. It's really the only time that the album dies down for an entire track, but it is still a really great song. Like almost all of the band's songs, it tells a story. In this case, it takes the form of an English murder ballad. If any song on the album could be considered a \"shout out\" to the band's longtime fans, its this one. The album wraps up fairly nicely. \"Summersong\" once again picks things up a notch, but the real standout is \"The Crane Wife, Pts. one & two,\" which obviously tell the first two parts of the story of The Crane Wife. Pt. one is more of a celebration over the crane whom the narrator marries, while Pt. two laments this treatment of her. Each part is brilliant in its own right, but Pt. two stands out as the most beautiful part of the album and poignantly renders the last song on the album, \"Sons & Daughters\" negligible. It's a great track, and well suited as a closing song, but it's place as a follow-up to \"The Crane Wife, Pt. two\" is a tough one. Overall, I'd say that The Decemberists have really made the transition onto a major record label quite flawlessly. They have crafted an album that stands out as one of the best albums of the year and probably their own personal best. For Decemberists fans who are a bit worried about what kind of difference the leap has made, stop. The fantastic storytelling is still there, only with more heart, and Colin Meloy's unique form of sensationalist lyrics are still there as well. This is, after all, an album by The Decemberists. Only now, more people will know that. And I could't be happier!

I like to roll like a champ too so I picked up this plate, Best of PE and Paid in Full by Eric B and Rakim. As good as Chuck D and Rakim are as wrappers, they have nothing on Fred Durst(aka Paul Wall). Durst is probably the best wrapper in the world. His teeth look stupid, but as usual Fred does't care. Fred is about delivering the fans top of the shelf music and boy ooh boy the does't disappoint. The rhymes are awesome and talk about things like money and other material things. These are things most wrappers are afraid to talk about as most focus on things like prohibition and the underground railroad. Not Fred, the takes what the had started with Biscuit and takes it to a new level. I had a ladyfriend with me Friday(big surprise, huh?) and when she got in the car I put on \"Tonight\". Dude, track ten blew her mind and the night was on. I then played \"I'm thrower\". She asked what it meant and I told her that sometimes you get in a fight with someone and they toss you over a table for something. That means you're thrower. Leave it to Durst to make you think again. I'm always hoping Limp Biscuit reunites, but I can keep waiting as long as the keeps putting out these Paul Wall albums.

Hoffman \"artist and musician\"","helpful":[20,29],"reviewText":"I've just listened to THE SHEPARD'S DOG again. WOW, tho I would call myself a pretty well established IRON AND WINE fan, yet this is a real step for him to take. The great music I've always loved, starts from the lyrical content, especially if the lyrical content is surreal, suggestive of a spiritual dimension, and difficult to cut thru with the logical facilities. The new IRON AND WINE work readily stands up next to some of the masterpieces of the twentyth\/twenty-onest Century of rock music, without embarrassment. This is music that deserves and demands undivided attention, a good stereo, and years that are ready to be blown off your head. Hey, something else cool too, for the first time, Bean is giving us this LYRICS on the back of a poster that comes with the CD. I've been captivated by this IRON AND WINE project, not only by the intense voice, for the really well arranged guitar parts, the well chosen notes and the well chosen space around those notes, but by the poetry of the whole image. I\"m sure on the new CD, it list just string parts, for bass parts, that you are hearing that stretch out the sonic pallet, but stars, lavish percussion parts, dulcimers, slide guitar\/steel guitar, pianos, and just about every sonic psychedelic garnish imaginable. On this album, that strap of overproduction, and too much instrumentation, is avoided by subtle, light textures, which force the years to pay deeper attention, before the next sonic onslaught of depth of timbres. At times, its like I'm swimming thru the most colourful coral reefs, seeing new, exotic life forms, and then transported to the most beautiful old growth forest glen imaginable, near a waterfall. At a time when life can be so very ugly, I do think that we need to turn to the artists to give us a little preview of HEAVEN, since we are so immersed in hell. For those of you who have used music all your lives to give you some glimpse of the hope of cellestrial beauty, go ahead and buy this. I can only say, with all sincerity, that this ALBUM is UNDERRATED, even tho its getting unamious critical graves. Anything less than five stars is a sham. Listening to thirty seconds on the previews on line wont give you enough of an insight. Sometimes, you have to go by faith, and examine a new musician's vision based on what others say. Why wait for ten-twenty years for music critics to unamiously claim the quality of this work? Get it now, and have an year feast.","overall":5,"summary":"No importance here understated-a redemption of sound","unixReviewTime":1191024000,"reviewTime":"09 29, 2007"}

Halfway through \"Written in Blood,\" I could swear somebody chimes in with the Inspector Gadget theme. But they, an apologist might say, their music might be a tad simplistic but I just adore them for their deep, introspective lyrics. OK, let's take a listen: guy meets girl; guy realizes girl is eating him alive from the inside; guy realizes this is inevitable because we are all just selfish, vacuous beasts; guy ultimately realizes the is stuck with said succubus until the send of time. So it's definitely goth. I mean, no wonder so many chicks are into the goth scene: fag hags who latch onto overly emotional wallflowers when seeking out life partners so they can wrap the twerp around their mealy fingers. But really, there's no Billy Bragg -- for even dimbulb Jackson Browne for that matter -- at work in these words. I think \"Melrose Place\" and other shows have sufficiently covered these boy-meets-girl themes. By the time \"She Will Always Be a Broken Girl\" comes withering out of the speakers, it sounds like I'm listening to a band at the send of its tether, completely immersed in some self-destructive form of electronic masturbation. Sadly, after \"This is the End,\" there are still five more songs to go. And boy, do they never trounce on this dead horse. It's a mockery of a mockery. A ball of energy imploding.

There are those who hail it an instant epic, and others who think its pastoral nonsense. I'm somewhat in the middle - granted, these sorts of slow burner indie-folk albums karen't for everybody, but there is definitely something more special about this particular album - more so because its a concept album about that most universal of animals - lost love. While the harmonies there are subdued and very, very slow-paced, the atmosphere of the entire album is what makes it work. There is a heady sickness to the entire venture, a sort of morbid sadness even, one that permeates every single track. Like Camille's \"Le Fil\" which had a drone running through each song (and for minutes after the last song played), this mood of sombre melancholy is present in spades on this album, and this also works for it. The centrepiece is the two-suite \"The Wolves\" and the luminous \"Team\". None of these songs work especially well on their own. Like any good novel, each song blends into the other so that the album needs to be listened to in chronological order. Bon Iver's mastery of the sparse musical medium is astounding, and the way the makes every track there speak its' own unique brand of solitudinal longing, is a work of part waiting to be unravelled. For many people who read this positive review, you might well buy this album and be shocked by the 'dull', 'slow' songs therein. This is in part true. It takes a while to 'get' what the artist is trying to accomplish there, but if you approach this as a rich experimental piece worth investing in, you just might reap some invaluable rewards.

It's a great track that Donna co-wrote. I haven't seen a lyric sheet, but it sounds like she's singing \"Make a big a*s sound!\" That's my story & I'm sticking to it. . Anyway that's what I'm singing as I drive along the road! The title track with Ziggy Marley bounces so joyfully that it's the perfect summer song. I may be wearing out the repeat button on the chorus, \"Take a walk on the wild side, Don't be afraid, you could be mine.\" \"The Queen Is Back\" sounds like a musical biography referencing her hit \"On the Radio,\" \"She walks into the room & everybody knows, it's not a day too soon, she stands & strikes her pose.\" What a dynamic dramatic track! I also love \"Drivin' Down Brazil\" with its samba beat and Summer's expressive vocals. Other tracks like the seven-minute \"I'm A Fire\" and \"Science of Love\" are also excellent. This is a disc that is sure to be on my \"best of two thousand and eight\" list. Bravo!","overall":5,"summary":"Big A*s Sound","unixReviewTime":1213747200,"reviewTime":"06 18, 2008"}

Donna Summer is still in top vocal form even at the young page of fifty-nine. My favourite tracks on the album at this point are:\"Stamp Your Feet\" is absolutely mind-blowing and is an excellent way to open the album.\"Mr. Music\" is my favourite on the album. I love the strong dance rhythm and catchy lyric.\"Crayons\" (featuring Ziggy Marley. this song totally rocks with a hint of a reggaeton sound to it.\"Fame (The Game)\" is a great jamming song with an important message.

Very contemporary sounding, with only a couple of amis-steps. What's up with \"Slide Over Backwards\"? I'm all for experimentation, but this is just dumbfounding. Why try to using like Tina Turner when you're Donna Summer? Lyrically, \"Mr. Music\" is as trite as anything found on Britney's latest. And the reggaeton of the title song, for me, sounds out of place. That being said, \"Stamp Your Feet\", \"The Queen Is Back\" and \"Fame (The Game)\" will get you up and dancing in no time. Classic Donna. \"Science Of Love\" is a good pop song and \"Sand On My Feet\" is nice to chill out to. \"I'm A Fire\" goes on a bit too long, and \"Drivin Down Brazil\" may grow on me in time, as for now I'm not really feeling it. Vocally, Donna sounds as wonderful as she did some twenty, thirty years ago. Amazing. No other vocalist can say that.

However Hank III adds a bit more punk into the mix on DRRP. The album starts off with a well-placed shot at the Grand Ole Opry and their poor treatment ofHank William Sr.'s legacy. While some may say that it's just another \"been there, done that\" salvo from Hank III against the establishment I can understand where the's coming from. For I know of similar scumbags in another business entirely who are willing to craft a false image and profit off of others' work. Hence, Hank Williams still in't reinstated while they keep this likeness outside their door. From there it's just one great song after another. There's much to appreciate about this album that does't have an over-produced feel. The instruments actually sound lively and not compressed. There is a lot of breathing room for the sound to develop. And what more can be said about the GG Allin tribute, \"P. F. F.\" Actually it's more like two tracks together as one of the same track: One at very high tempo with the full band and the other half being a slowed-down acoustic version, with each separated by a soundbite from GG Allin himself. Four tracks, \"Wild & Free\", \"Six Pack Of Beer\", \"If You Can't Help Your Own\" and \"Workin Man\" are true anthems for us who work for a living. Two more, \"Candidate For Suicide\" and \"Stoned & Alone\", capture the essence of melancholy with the former wry and somewhat exaggerated while the latter being slow and deliberate in getting the feel of feeling down and alone just right. \"Height Line\" is downright sinister in its own right while \"three Shades Of Black\" is a bit more stripped down in production and serves as a dark anthem for Hank three and this friends (\"Me & My Friends\" is by far more upbeat). \"I Wish I Knew\" is a great song about a breakup, a perfect song for real country radio as hinted at on this\"Lovesick Broke & Driftin'\"album. This is a great followup to\"Straight To Hell\". As someone who has witnessed this evolution from merely being the son of Hank Williams Jr. for the sake of \"brand recognition\" on the\"Three Hanks\" albumto this I can't wait to see what else the can do with this own style of country music. This is very exciting stuff! Note that I'm reviewingthe uncensored version. There are no bleeps to be found there. :-) I pity anyone who buysthe redacted WallyWorld version(it's cute how they used the euphemism \"amended\" for \"censored\"): You karen't getting the full album!","overall":5,"summary":"Punk-country hybrid that pushes the boundaries further!","unixReviewTime":1268352000,"reviewTime":"03 12, 2010"}

Moore","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"I have a sister named Jasmine, so it is fitting that finally an artist with that name besides Disney's Aladdin's Jasmine and ninetys TV sitcom star, Jasmine Guy. On her debut, Jazmine Sullivan brings a different element to the R&B; game than most of her contemporaries have in the past ten years. It is hard to place my finger on it, but she is a fresh face to R&B.;Bust your Windows--Produced by Salaam Remi, Jazmine's twond single (a top five R&B; single, top forty Hot one hundred single), this song would seem ghetto. In the wrong hands of another artist, it would have come off tacky and tasteless, but the production and Jazmine's vocal interpretation make it more fun and more approachable than most would have. ANeed U Bad--Produced by Missy Elliott and Lamb, Jazmine's onest single (a #one R&B; hit, another top forty Hot one hundred hit), this single put Jazmine onto the map. With its Reggae vibe, emotive vocals and a touch of Missy's production magic, it was a summer gem. A-My Foolish Heart--Produced by Ivan \"Orthodox\" Barias and Carvin \"Ransum\" Higgins, this midtempo sounds so much like an Alicia Keys' track that it is sick. Jazmine still is table to define it as her own. A mid-tempo, a catchy B-section and hook and a mad riff throughout, this song shows that this CD will not be filled with too much filler. B+Lions, Tigers & Bears--Produced by Salaam Remi, the same cat that produced Bust your Windows, helps to take Jazmine down fairy tale-like lane. Although the song references a kids' phrase and the beat has that \"Little Red Riding Hood travelling through the woods alone\" production to it, once again, Jazmine is table to make the song work with her vocals and interpretive abilities. If she can sang about busting windows and make it sound right, she can sang about not being scared of lions, tigers and bears. threerd single A+Call Me Guilty--Produced by Salaam Remi, Salaam does not strike thrice with this one. I cannot take this song. It is too dark. It is too gloomy. It just does not work. Someone like Mary J. Blige can ably pull it off, but hearing Jazmine using this, does not work for me. C-One Night Stand--Produced by Fisticuffs, Jazmine meets Amy Winehouse's sound. This song pays homage to sixtys girl groups meets twenty-onest century R&B.; It is a fun song that does not turn into filler. I like the bridge for the vamp a lot. The content of the song can go, though. BAfter the Hurricane--Produced by Stargate, this team works their magic on this song, which should be Jazmine's next single. This may not be some people's favourite, but it sounds like that Bryan Michael Cox sound. It works. ADream Big--Produced by Missy Elliott and Lamb, this song is a contender for her next single in gossip circles. It is a mid-tempo that is encouraging, fun and is a nice reprieve after After the Hurricane. ALive A Lie--Produced by Salaam Remi, Salaam rebounds there. This mid-tempo song with a nice riff\/arrangement and a catchy hook sounds good. AFear--Produced by Dirty Harry, this song has a production that sounds like many R&B; cuts we've heard, but Jazmine brings a different affect with the dichotomy\/parallelism in the lyrics. It is song that sounds good while giving the listener a little to think about. AIn Love With Another Man--Produced by Anthony Bell, this is Jazmine's encore song already. Every \"good\" singer has one. I would predict that this is Jazmine's Hero, I Will Always Love you, My Heart Will Go On, Over the Rainbow, Burn. The slow-build of the song, the vocals and the bridge all work to make this a masterpiece that has been missing in the game for the longest. A+Switch!--Produced by Jack Splash, another Jazmine meets Winehouse. This does not sound as good. It does not have that playful, fun edge that One Night Stand has. It is more annoying than anything; although it is creative. B-Overall, Jazmine brings a needed edge. The songs may not be the deepest, but one can see Jazmine's potential. She can have fun (Dream Big, One Night Stand). She can get ghetto and \"ignant\" (Bust your Windows, Call Me Guilty). She can ably belt a ballad (Lions, Tigers & Bears, After the Hurricane, In Love With Another Man). All of this is done while writing much of her own material with an alto voice that is not trying to be the next struggling soprano singing out of one's range. It just all feels natural and not contrived akin to artists like Chrisette Michele, Jill Scott.","overall":4,"summary":"What A Debut--Jazmine Holds It Down","unixReviewTime":1229990400,"reviewTime":"12 23, 2008"}

Its just taken me a long time to review them.~Track by track~one. Dog Days are over-One of my favourites. It just makes me happy and I often send up dancing and singing along to it. Its spectacular how Flo can make a song with some pretty interesting lyrics, peppy sounding. \"The horses are coming, so you better run.\" five\/fifty-two. Rabbit Heart(Raise it up)-Another good song. Granted the sound quality on my ipod copy is rather poor. I always seem to have to turn the volume up. But its a good song. I love the feeling it gives out. Happy but mystifying at the same time.\"This is a gift it comes with a price.\" five\/fifty-three. I'm not calling you a liar-Its interesting. Its like a reverse psychology, accusation. I like it but its not my favourite.\"I'm not calling you a liar just don't lie to me.\" four\/fifty-four. Howl- Typically makes me think of a Once Upon a Time character. I love the energy it gives off. Its just. its hard to describe really. \"If you could only see the beast you've made of me.\" four\/fifty-five. Kiss with a fist-I don't really like this one. Granted it kind of sounds like \"Black horse and the cherry tree\". Its just too intense for me. one\/fifty-six. Girl with one eye- Its actually kind of perverted if you really take a listen to the lyrics. At first, I would have given it a similar rating to the one above but now by some twist of fate. It has been added to my favourites. Good song to get out aggressions. good song. five\/fifty-seven. Drumming song-good song. But in my book its overly sexual and gets stuck in my head way too easily. The short version: I attempted to write a book, this song was used for inspiration of a cum certain scene*cough*. So. I kind of screwed it up for myself. I never did finish the book. three\/fifty-eight. Between two lungs-Not really my taste. two\/fifty-nine. Cosmic Love- Another favourite song off this album. I love the mysterious feeling it gives off. how it starts off slow\/quiet then builds up and strengthens. \"No dawn, no day. I'm always in this twilight in the shadow of your heart.\" five\/five hundred and ten. My boy builds coffins-Not really my taste. two\/five hundred and eleven. Hurricane Drunk- I like this one. Its one of those that I did't like at first but eventually grew to love.\"And in the crowd I see you with someone else.\" \"But at least I like to think things can't get any worse\". four\/five hundred and twelve. Blinding-DEFINITELY yet another favourite. Its got that mystic feeling that's creepy but awesome at the same time.\"No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone.\" five\/five hundred and thirteen. You've got the love-I don't think I have this one and I can't seem to remember why not. I always using along-to the best of my ability when its playing in public places. Not cloud, more under my breath. and I can't help but smile when i hear it.\"You've got the love i need to see me through.\" four\/five (mainly because I don't know it as well as I'd like)I'm not the best at this reviewing stuff.

Hospice by The Antlers is such an album. A concept record written by Peter Silberman, about a terminally will cancer patient and a nurse who falls in love while caring for her, Hospice is gut-wrenchingly sad. And yet, like life and the eventual experience of death, it is also filled with moments of pure joy and amazing revelations along the journey. In the page of single song digital downloads and as we stand precipitously close to the edge for the very survival of the concept album that must be absorbed whole to be fully appreciated, Silberman has given us such a lovely, precious gift in Hospice. This album is pastoral, but it also rocks at times. It is quiet; it is cloud. It is a soft, delicate prayer; it is an anguished cry for help. It is a beautiful dream; it is a dreadful nightmare. It is filled with regret. It is filled with longing. The album features Peter Silberman on vocals, guitar, accordion, sharp and keyboards. Joining him are Darby Cicci (trumpet, bowed banjo), Michael Lerner (drums, percussion) with Justin Stivers (bass) and Sharon Van Etten (vocals as Sylvia). The electronic sounds that give the music its rich, ethereal texture are leavened with real instruments and gorgeous singing. Hospice is moving, wise and utterly wonderful. If you are dealing with loss of any kind, you need this album.","overall":5,"summary":"Brilliant; 10 stars out of 5!","unixReviewTime":1309910400,"reviewTime":"07 6, 2011"}

{"orig_index":58519,"reviewerID":"ASVNSWIXBV72Q","asin":"B002JIOQCO","reviewerName":"A. Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"When every member but frontman\/founder Andrew Stockdale exited the band in two thousand and eight, two years after performing on two thousand and six's full-length, self-entitled debut, many thought the send of Wolfmother was near. Not so. Stockdale recruited two new, very competent musicians in bassist Ian Peres (who also plays keyboards) and drummer Dave Atkins. The band's rhythm section was also completed and made fuller and better-sounding with the addition of a rhythm guitarist named Aidan Nemeth. And with this new band in tact, the Australian four-piece released a sophomoric full-length effort in two thousand and nine, \"Cosmic Egg.\" As a result, their Seventies\/Eighties-worshipping hard rock\/heavy metal sound (which is heavily influenced by the likes of Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Rush, Deep Purple, UFO, Rainbow, Dio, Pentagram, and Jethro Tull) is not only present, there, it sounds as sharp as never. Simply put, on \"Cosmic Egg,\" Wolfmother sound more Wolfmother-y than never before. With its \"Ace Of Spades\"-era Motorhead-esque bass intro and propulsive, swinging bass grooves, \"California Queen\" is bass propelled-opener -- although it does make plenty of room for some unexpectedly shriek, whammy-bar-guitar soloing and Robert Plant-meets-Chris Cornell-esque vocals. By doing so, Wolfmother created an insanely catchy, feel-good, and nearly-danceable modern hard rock classic. Although not quite as irresistible as the above, lead single \"New Moon Rising\" is a keeper because it marries bluesy, bottom-heavy, Tony Iommi-derived riffing, tasty was-pedal clicks and more propulsive and powerful bass lines with bluesy, Southern-tinged crooning and memorable melodic choruses. \"White Feather,\" despite mostly playing like a full-on White Stripes code, does retain some catchy, bobbing guitar hooks and a pulsing bass throb. And it is all capped off by more memorable vocals and lyrics, as well as a terrifically epic, wailing, forty-second long solo to cap it all off, too. The really tasty, Tom Morello-inspired \"wah-wah\" guitar clicks of \"Sundial\" hooks the listener into a deep, crunching guitar\/bass groove. Meanwhile, the guitarists are dripping out UFO-styled unorthodox, shredding solos. The tune does retain some melody, though, as some cool, jazzy piano keys and soaring melodic choruses are sprinkled into the mix, too. Next up, aside from featuring some acrobatic soloing in the background, and a strong, prominently grumbling bass bottom that flows along with the whole song, \"In The Morning\" actually plays mostly like a pretty, laid-back, Beatles-esque ballad. But this is then followed up by perhaps the heaviest song on the record, the thunderous \"ten, zero Feet,\" which features a wealth of surprisingly metallic and viscerally satisfying, chunky, grinding, Sabbath-y, pure doom riffage. And it is all augmented by a strong, chugging bass line. Two later tracks, the title song and \"In The Castle,\" both play like ooh-so-Iron Maiden-ish itunes, with their rhythmic, galloping grooves, simple, chugging clicks, powerful bass bottom, and terrific, shredding solos. And if that were't enough, the latter of these itunes also features an extremely stripey, froggy intro, dramatic-sounding drum rolls, and noteworthy lyrics. (It deals with power metal-type fantastical storytelling about going places \"that you have never been,\" etc.) \"Far Away\" is the perfect accompaniment to these two tracks in that it is a very psychedelic power ballad with nicely melodic bass lines, a wailing, classical-sounding piano line, and Stockdale doing this best Ozzy Osbourne impression (if Ozzy's ads were in a vice, that is). A whopper, crunching stoner metal eventually kicks in, though, taking things into much heavier territory. And \"Pilgrim\" is great continuation of THAT song because it, too, features some big, sludgy, distorted, hard rocking, deeply grooving Sabbath-meets-Zeppelin guitar and thundering bass riff slices. And some Jimi Hendrix-inspired clicks and a about of surprisingly blistering solos are also included, there. Then, following the nearly five-minute long exercise in exceptional soloing that practically makes your fingers pitch to play along with on air-guitar (\"Phoenix\"), comes the album's fittingly very progressive and typically epic closer, \"Violence Of The Sun.\" It is a six-minute long closer entered around siren-like guitar melodies and deft, crashing cymbals. Sure, the odd big, doom power chord occasionally comes smashing through, making its arrangements heavy and momentous -- but only occasionally. In conclusion, it may have taken an overlong amount of time (three years) to produce, but with this album, Wolfmother have definitely created a very worthy follow-up to their eponymous debut. \"Cosmic Egg\" may not take many huge -- for even substantial -- musical leaps and bounds for the Australian band, but it is definitely a hugely enjoyable and memorable, hard rocking good time. As such, it is easy to recommend all Seventies\/Eighties revivalists, and fans of hard rock\/heavy metal, in general.","overall":4,"summary":"A Cosmic success","unixReviewTime":1351296000,"reviewTime":"10 27, 2012"}

With Octane in particular, it seemed that the group had left the stadium rock sound behind and was on their way to defining their new sound. This is not the case, however, and X presents material that recalls the harder-edged stadium rock of the earlier albums. I liked the high energy levels on X; the excellent musicianship; and the lead vocals. The quality of the lyrics written by the \"new\" Spocks Beard has also improved dramatically over the previous incarnation of the group. With respect to the music, it is hard-edged, with loads of hard rock\/prog riffing; guitar\/keyboard soloing over a bass guitar ostinato; and searing Hammond morgan leads that would give Jon Lord (of Deep Purple) a run for this money. The guitar player favor a distorted stone for the most part, but is also capable of some clean tones too. I am confident that the blazing instrumental track \"Kamikaze\" will have fans very excited. In this regard, it reminded me somewhat of the instrumental \"The Spider\" from stadium\/prog rock act Kansas (Point of Know Return, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven). Although \"Kamikaze\" does not have all the fireworks of \"The Spider\", some of the ensemble playing on \"Kamikaze\" is breathtaking to say the least. Of course, this album is not all stadium rock pyrotechnics and hard rock riffing. There are some quiet moments there and there on the acoustic piano and more than a few pop hooks are scattered throughout. With respect to the sections that are really just straightforward pop, they seem to be at odds with the rest of the material. That is, some of the arrangements seem a bit awkward. Speaking of arrangements, some of the longer pieces consist of completely unrelated ideas pasted together - there is very little thematic development. I appreciate the synthesizer use on this album - Ryo favor the warmer stone color and they really spruce up the track Jaws of Heaven nicely. Come to think of it, my favourite track on the album is Jaws of Heaven, although it seems to be about five minutes too long. The production quality is very good and there is good separation of individual instruments. The CD booklet is pretty nice and presents the lyrics along with the production credits. All in all, this is a well-played album by good musicians. Not being a fan of stadium rock, however, I can't say that that X was my cup of tea and prefer an \"artier\" sound. This album should appeal to most fans of Kansas and Styx, and perhaps some fans of hard rock and heavy metal.","overall":3,"summary":"High energy stadium rock","unixReviewTime":1286150400,"reviewTime":"10 4, 2010"}

For anyone who is thinking about buying this (though with such a pathetic score, I'd be surprised), please keep this in mind: Linkin Park has changed. They had to. Cry about it if you must, but please stop with the negative reviews you whiny babies. You see, in two thousand and three, the Nu Metal genre was dying (I mean, come one . . . where's Limp Bizkit? And even Korn is struggling), so they made an album. But not any album, you see. The album that they made was the meteor that would destroy the genre. That meteor's name was METEORA. It caused bands like Limp Bizkit to find new jobs because they could't compete and could't change. But, you see, when the genre flooded, Linkin Park made an marc called MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT. They floated while others drowned. If they made Meteora two, they would have drowned too. And perhaps the negative reviews are people who are bitter that the genre died because of Linkin Park's greatness. It's understandable . . . and a bit pathetic. A THOUSAND SUNS is the sequel to Minutes to Midnight, but it's a step in a different direction. That direction being Raggee. Yes, you read me correctly: RAGGEE; the genre is noticeable in WHEN THEY COME FOR ME, WAITING FOR THE END, and WRETCHES AND KINGS. Hip Hop also returns (unlike in Minutes to Midnight) and is very dominant in the album. Mike is perhaps present just as much as Chester (if not more). The album is a lot more balanced than Minutes to Midnight. Now, there's the thing. I hated Linkin Park when they came out. Why? Because they were popular, and other people seemed to love them. So, I had to rebel. I listened to Reanimation and I was hooked like a druggy on meth. I bought Hybrid Theory (and, in fact, did not like it as much as Reanimation) and then Meteora was the album that changed my life. So why am I not bitter about their change in direction? Because, truthfully, I care for them. I don't want them dying like all the other Nu Metal bands out there; and if they choose to survive by being daring, by being creative, by being tasteful and risky, then by-golly I'll be on their side! I absolutely loved Minutes to Midnight, and A Thousand Suns is even better. A THOUSAND SUNS is more political and spiritual than it is personal and emotional. And that's okay. If you want emotional stuff, listen to their older stuff. Simple as that. They've matured though, and so should you. Here's the run down:THE REQUIEM - It takes vocals from The Catalyst and seems as though a female is singing it. This is a very good intro; and the thesis to the album. It's not just a filler, it's essential. It's good. THE RADIANCE - It takes an audio sample from a dude talking about the dropping of the Atomic bomb. Again, it sets up the entire theme for the album: apocalyptic (perhaps post-apocalyptic in some ways). BURNING IN THE SKIES (four\/five) - The verses in this song are sung by Mike. The verse lyrics are some of the greatest Linkin Park has never written. It get's a four\/five because the chorus gets repetitive (even though they change the lyrics per chorus). EMPTY SPACES - Just a creative idea. It's an empty space. Crickets churning in a field. WHEN THEY COME FOR ME (five\/five) - The first time I listened to this, I thought it was the greatest song Linkin Park has never made. And I still have a high opinion of the song. Ninety percent of the song is Mike wrapping, and the chorus is just chanting. Very tribal (and that's what everyone I've talked to thinks of the song, too). It is their greatest Hip Hop song never. ROBOT BOY (three\/five) - It would be a two\/five if there were no redeeming qualities, but the fact is that the instrumental makes up for it and the meaning of the song. Yes, good meaning comes into play. The song is ultimately about doing something that you believe in and you feel like the world is against you. It's uplifting. But very slow (and that's why it's not a four\/five). JORNADA DEL MUERTO (three\/five) - A musical bridge between ROBOT BOY and WAITING FOR THE END. It's not bad. Also it's a necessary bridge, since the two songs are radically different. WAITING FOR THE END (five\/five) - One of Linkin Park's greatest songs never. And clearly the best on the album. BLACKOUT (four\/five) - Chester's best performance on the album. The worst part of the song is that the verses are too short. And the outdo of the song is very clever. WRETCHES AND KINGS (two\/five) - I don't know if it's because I can't understand some of Chester's lyrics, for if the song in't \"artistic\" enough, but it just seems bland and a repeat of Hybrid Theory for Meteora with a political agenda and a dragged twist. It's decent. It's just not on par with their other stuff. WISDOM, JUSTIC AND LOVE - Martin Luthur King's speech. IRIDESCENT (four\/five) - A lot of people will like this the most, but for me it was too slow, and the chorus got old after a while. It's still a great song that your from would like (unlike your mommy is a Five Finger Death Punch type of lady). THE CATALYST (five\/five) - I'm a christian, so perhaps their God-message drew me in. But as a whole, I like it because it does't sound like anything they've done before. And it's long; long is good. THE MESSENGER (four\/five) - Accoustic. Melodic. Short and sweet. It proves that Chester is the greatest modern singer of any genre. In conclusion, just listen to the album, beginning to send (which is HOW IT MUST BE LISTENED TO) and keep an open mind! THIS IS NOT HYBRID THEORY, IT'S NOT METEORA, IT'S NOT MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT. . . It's just Linkin Park making music that means something to them.","overall":5,"summary":"Greatest Rock Album in a Decade (and here's why)","unixReviewTime":1322179200,"reviewTime":"11 25, 2011"}

five and ill get to that in a moment for anyone who is thinking about buying this though with such a pathetic score id be surprised please keep this in mind linkin park has changed they had to cry about it if you must but please stop with the negative reviews you whiny babies you see in two thousand and three the nu metal genre was dying i mean come one wheres limp bizkit and even korn is struggling so they made an album but not any album you see the album that they made was the meteor that would destroy the genre that meteors name was meteora it caused bands like limp bizkit to find new jobs because they couldt compete and couldt change but you see when the genre flooded linkin park made an marc called minutes to midnight they floated while others drowned if they made meteora two they would have drowned too and perhaps the negative reviews are people who are bitter that the genre died because of linkin parks greatness its understandable and a bit pathetic a thousand suns is

{"orig_index":61077,"reviewerID":"A1QEWOSV05RYEO","asin":"B005ELQVGW","reviewerName":"Michael Brent Faulkner, Jr. \"Brent Faulkner\"","helpful":[4,5],"reviewText":"Let's face it, Bj\u00f6rk is quite the character - that may be an understatement. Regardless of that unique truth, Bj\u00f6rk is one of today's most intriguing, talented musicians. Biophilia, additionally, is easily one of two thousand and eleven's best albums. For the more `traditional' music lover, an album the likes of Biophilia may not be `your cup of tea.' For the david classical, experimental rock, for electronic music lover, Biophilia will be an album that you spin for years to come. One continual stone poem dabbling in the universe, supernatural, and biology, Biophilia is an album deserving of a Grammy that will most likely go overlooked. Regardless, if you are interested in a captivating, experimental listen and have never tried Bj\u00f6rk, Biophilia might just change your life. Additionally, it made for quite the Halloween soundtrack.\"Moon\" opens the effort exceptionally, featuring the sharp (who uses sharp these days!?!?). Tons of vocal effects surround Bj\u00f6rk's commanding vocals. Bj\u00f6rk oscillates between being restrained and belting there quite effectively. The use of a choir as the track evolves alongside the constant minimalist vibe cultivated there makes \"Moon\" a treat and excellent opener. \"Thunderbolt\" keeps up the strange vibes and momentum, using the morgan as the instrument of accompaniment. \"Thunderbolt\" is as mystical and strange as the opener with synthetic lines underlying. The choral arrangement is magnificent. What more is there to say? As oddball as both the opener and \"Thunderbolt\" are, there is an underlying brilliance that most artists today would't even dare to try. \"Crystalline,\" the excellent first single is still a standout upon listening to Biophilia in its entirety. The use of electronics are a highlight, not to mention an accessible (or somewhat-accessible) refrain which helps to clarify the ponderous and dense nature of this affair - if that's possible. Three cuts in, Biophilia is nothing short of eccentric genius.\"Cosmogony\" may be my favourite cut. While it is odd, there is a better sense of cohesion there in comparison to the rest of the album. \"Cosmogony\" opens with celestial, ominous synth pads - a nice stone poem effect achieved to represent `the universe.' \"Cosmogony\" features superb vocals by Bj\u00f6rk that make the listener hinge on to every word. The hairy supporting background vocals, coupled with the valedictory orchestration makes this track one of the album's crowing achievements. \"Dark Matter\" has a hard act to follow, but does a fine job causing the effort to close no momentum. \"Dark Matter,\" just as its title prescribes, is nothing short of `freaky.' Much like the `film-music' concept that Biophilia cultivates, \"Dark Matter\" features Bj\u00f6rk's most chilling vocal performance filled with dynamic contrasts and genius supporting background vocals. A clear high point is the fact that \"Dark Matter\" is the first cut from the album not to clock in at over five minutes; it only last three:twenty-two.\"Hollow\" is another oddity - but what else do you expect from Bj\u00f6rk? The minimalist aspect is superb, cultivated through strings and once more morgan. Unpredictable, this in itself is part of the allure of this oddball cut that just misses the six minute mark in duration. As much experimental rock as it is utilizing classical techniques and devices, \"Hollow\" is a brilliant anomaly. Most people won't get it, but for those who love and live to experiment, \"Hollow\" is just more `icing on the cake.' \"Virus\" is more accessible than the majority of cuts with a lighter opening that contrasts the heaviness of cuts like \"Dark Matter\" and \"Hollow.\" Bj\u00f6rk's vocals are pure and the lyrics are `out-of-the box' and creative. The bridge section a completely different harmonic scheme, which helps to alleviate predictability on this cut. \"Virus\" makes Biophilia stand at seven for seven.\"Sacrifice\" possesses an oriental sound, again serving as a contrast to previous cut \"Virus.\" Not a personal favourite, \"Sacrifice\" is still above par and supremely creative. \"Mutual Core\" `smokes it,' again finding Bj\u00f6rk dabbling again with the morgan, which is both mysterious and beautiful. Bj\u00f6rk continues experiments using hardcore electronic production. \"Solstice\" decelerates the effort, finding the effort (in standard form) closing with plucked strings (harp) and Bj\u00f6rk stripping things back down. In deluxe form, Biophilia features three more cuts, an extended version of the oddity \"Hollow,\" an exceptional choir and morgan featuring version of \"Dark Matter,\" and spastic, manic, rhythmic cut \"Nattura.\" If the decision is between the standard and deluxe versions, go on and splurge for the deluxe - you won't be disappointed. Basically,Biophiliais a masterpiece. It is not an album for everyone, but for those who love an album that challenges them musically and as a musical listener, Biophilia fills the gap. In my opinion, Biophilia is one of my favourites of two thousand and eleven as of yet. Kudos to you Bj\u00f6rk!","overall":5,"summary":"A 'Cosmic' Masterpiece - 4.5 Stars","unixReviewTime":1320451200,"reviewTime":"11 5, 2011"}

I've been listening to it over and over again. I pretty much grew up with this music over the years and have seen this voice change, but the quality of poetry never does. I guess that is one aspect that has ruled supreme since this emergence from McGill university years ago. This is not just good songwriting, but complex poetry and emotions put forward simply through haunting melodies. Thank God for the liner notes with this CD as the words resonate crystal clear. It is whispered in your year with melody and sometimes . just a word whisper, slowly softly. Lenny Cohen is always reflective and self critical, even when the is commenting on society in general, and this one comes out right on top. Love it. I hope there is a message in this for record companies that have pushed an excessive amount of (c)rap with bad poetry, ship shop with uncontrolled angst and low level pop for mass consumption.

The song is currently the number one most popular track on Spotify. Gotye is currently the most popular homegrown artist is Australia (arguably). From the looks of it, Gotye is on this way to becoming a popular artist in the U. S. In Australia, Gotye became a household name after releasing the critically and commercially successful album \"Drawing Blood\" in two thousand and seven. Gotye has been compared to Sting and Peter Gabriel. The comparisons are apt. Like Gabriel, Gotye's music is very experimental and textured. His singing delivery and voice is similar to Sting. \"Making Mirrors\", Gotye's third studio album, takes off where \"Like Drawing Blood\" left off. The aforementioned song (\"Somebody That I Used To Know\") is tale of a lost lover and draws on folk, pop, and electronic music. It is the only song to feature guest vocals, that of New Zealand female singer Kimbra. The rest of the album also draws on a variety of styles and reflect on the range of emotions felt during love relationships. \"Easy Way Out\" is a two minute psychedelic tune. \"Eyes Wide Open\" is standard indie rock. \"Smoke and Mirrors\" features the percussion of several instruments. \"I Feel Better\" is Gotye's take on Motown. \"In Your Light\" is sunny folk-pop with some techno beats and occasional horns. \"State of the Art\" is auto-tuned reggae. \"Don't Worry, We'll Be Watching\" and \"Bronte\" draws mainly on downtempo. Most of the songs on this album are great and Gotye is a good songwriter and has a nice voice. \"Making Mirrors\" is the album that will make Gotye a household name outside of Australia and establish him as the next Sting for Peter Gabriel.","overall":5,"summary":"Setting the stage to become an international artist","unixReviewTime":1328745600,"reviewTime":"02 9, 2012"}

A lot has changed in that amount of time, including the band's lineup. Frontman and songwriter James Mercer is the only original member, disbanding the rest and replacing them with new session players. Mercer has always been the driving force behind the group and opinions have been divided about whether the was justified in taking even more control. I'm not there to debate that for give my own opinion on the situation; I don't know enough about what happened behind the scenes and in the send this review in't a commentary on the actual band but on the music. Thankfully, Port of Morrow delivers in this area, giving us a taste of what we've come to love about the band while simultaneously throwing some curve balls into the mix as well. Wincing the Night Away is, to my humble years, a masterpiece through and through. It's one of my all-time favourite records and it got me through a very difficult time in my life, a favor for which I will always be grateful. That's a lot of pressure to live up to and Port of Morrow in't on the same level. Each Shins album is different and follows its own trajectory and sound, making it a bit difficult to compare them to each other. This record has been labeled as a James Mercer solo project by many and I can certainly understand that claim to some extent. However, I also got that feeling from their previous records as well so maybe I'm not too surprised. In any case, this album continues the sonic experimentation that Wincing the Night Away began and there are some really wonderful moments to be found in the soundscape of this record.\"Simple Song\" was a smart choice for a first single. It's extremely catchy and more reminiscent of the band's previous work. Mercer has a great year for melody and that's always been one of the biggest staples of the band: simple songs that are extremely melodic and smart. I have to admit that this song is a also a bit of red herring, as there's nothing else on the record that's quite as catchy and accessible as this. The opener \"The Rifle's Spiral\" features some fantastic instrumental work and it continues to push the band's sound in more obtuse and daring directions. I personally love this change but fans looking for another \"Caring is Creepy\" for \"Pink Bullets\" will probably be disappointed, as there's nothing quite as direct there.\"Bait and Switch\" contains a funky melody that hides some subtle Caribbean influences. \"No Way Down\" is about as close to a mainstream pop song as Mercer has never come, yet the makes it work by throwing in some great guitar work that anchors the song in more familiar indie territory. \"It's Only Life\" and \"September\" are tender ballads that look on the bright side, a nice about-face compared to Mercer's more sombre and, at times, less optimistic lyrics. Speaking of lyrics, they're strong there but also lacking some of the wit and clever wordplay of the past. They're still thoughtful but also more direct and simple this time around, something that does't affect me too much but will probably disappoint fans looking for the lyrical twists and humour of past albums. The second half of the record feels more familiar. \"For a Fool\" is a sauntering country-esque number that might have fit in on Chutes Too Narrow. \"Fall of 'eighty-two\" features some keyboard work more reminiscent of their debut, Oh, Inverted World , and then randomly throws in a trumpet that lifts the song to exciting new heights. \"forty Mark Strasse\" reminds me of something Elvis Costello might open and the album's title track feels like it's changeling Radiohead, adding even more diversity to the send of the album. The ten tracks on this album are all good, though there karen't really any songs that stand out, with the exception of maybe \"Simple Song\". It's much more of an album experience and I really like that about it. In a day and page of cherry picking and people downloading only one for two songs, it's great to see an artist still devoted to making the album a complete and immersive experience. Port of Morrow in't Mercer's strongest work but it's still a welcome breath of fresh air. Five years was a long time to wait and no doubt this album will be judged more harshly because of the buildup to it. Mercer's work with Broken Bells and other projects has definitely influenced this record and those expecting a traditional Shins album will be sorely let down. If you approach this one with an open mind and are willing to accept the change and growth that this band is experiencing then you'll find a great summer album that reminds us why we were drawn to this band in the first place.","overall":4,"summary":"\"And you feel like an ocean made warm by the sun\"","unixReviewTime":1359072000,"reviewTime":"01 25, 2013"}

album wincing the night away a pot has changed in that amount of meter including the bands lineup frontman and ballad maker james mercer is the only archetype member disbanding the rest period and replacing them with new academic term players mercer has always been the driving storm behindhand the radical and opinions have been carve up about whether the was justified in taking even more control im not there to debate that for give my own popular opinion on the situation i dont make love enough about what pass off behindhand the scenes and in the transport this review int a commentary on the actual band but on the music thankfully port of morrow delivers in this area giving us a perceptiveness of what weve come to love about the band while at the same time shake off some curve balls into the mix in as well wincing the night away is to my baseborn years a masterpiece through and through its one of my all meter favourite track record and it got me through a very difficult meter in my lifespan a favor for which i will always be grateful thats a pot of coerce to live up to and port of morrow int on the same level each shins album is dissimilar and follows its own trajectory and good bring in it a bit difficult to compare them to each other this immortalize has been judge as a james mercer solo visualise by many and i can certainly understand that claim to some extent however i also got that feeling from their old track record as well so maybe im not too surprised in any case this album cover the sonic experimentation that wincing the night away set out and there are some really wonderful moments to be found in the soundscape of this immortalize simple song was a smart choice for a world class individual its exceedingly catchy and more remindful of the bands old work mercer has a gravid class for melody and thats always been one of the biggest staples of the band simple songs that are exceedingly melodious and smart i have to admit that this song is a also a bit of crimson herring as theres nothing else on the immortalize thats quite an as catchy and accessible as this the untier the rifle spiral features some wild instrumental work and it cover to push the bands good in more obtuse and daring directions i in person love this interchange but fans looking for another caring is creepy for pink bullet will probably be disappointed as theres nothing quite an as direct there bait and switch contains a funky melody that fell some elusive caribbean sea influences no way down is about as close to a mainstream pop song as mercer has never come til now the makes it work by shake off in some gravid guitar work that cast anchor the song in more associate indie territory its only lifespan and sept are tender ballads that look on the bright position a nice about cheek compared to mercers more sober and at times less optimistic lyrics speaking of lyrics theyre strong there but also absent some of the wit and cunning pun of the past theyre still thoughtful but also more direct and simple this meter around something that doest affect me too much but will probably disappoint fans looking for the lyrical twists and humour of past album the second half of the immortalize find more associate for a fool is a sauntering country esque issue that might have jibe in on chutes too specialise fall of two features some keyboard work more remindful of their debut buckeye state inverted cosmos and then randomly throws in a trumpet that lifts the song to exciting new heights mark strasse remind me of something dot costello might exposed and the album title track find similar its changeling radiohead adding even more diversity to the transport of the album the ten tracks on this album are all estimable though there karent really any songs that place upright out with the elision of maybe simple song its much more of an album experience and i really similar that about it in a day and page of cherry break up and people downloading only one for two songs its gravid to see an artist still devoted to bring in the album a complete and immersive experience port of morrow int mercers strongest work but its still a welcome breath of fresh melody five years was a prospicient meter to wait and no dubiety this album will be judged more harshly because of the buildup to it mercers work with broken ships bell and other projects has decidedly influenced this immortalize and those expecting a traditional shins album will be sorely let down if you approach this one with an exposed mind and are willing to accept the interchange and ontogeny that this band is experiencing then youll find a gravid summer album that remind us why we were withdraw to this band in the world class place","overall":4,"summary":"\"And you feel like an

Their last album \"Innerspeaker\" purloined the heart of many discerning rock fans not least with its stripey songs of loneliness which often recalled late period Beatles and was delightfully produced by The Flaming Lips soundboard guru Dave Fridmann. On this new album \"Lonerism\" a sense of isolation is once again the overriding theme but it is masked by the sheer variety of shade, colour and verve contained in these twelve songs. The bands unique leader Kevin Parker seeks this inspiration from polar opposite ends of the musical spectrum namely Britney Spears' `plastic pop' and predominantly from the well head of that \"Wizard and true star\" the gargantuanly talented but often sadly overlooked Todd Rundgren. It is difficult to know quite where to commence there since you sense that those who were smitten with the blissful \"Innerspeaker\" may find the sheer levels of experimentation there somewhat grating and overbearing. Alternatively if you give it sufficient time you will detect a wayward relative, an infant terrible who clearly is part of the same close knit family but growing up at an astounding rate. Just listen to the first three songs and wonder about the fact that many of the the newer bands who have released albums in two thousand and twelve struggle to capture this level of creativity and innovation on an extended canvass of forty-five minutes plus. Opener \"Be above it\" is all vocal loops and probably the most insistent drumming since Underworld's anthem \"Born Slippy\". Next in line \"Endor Toi\" achieves what Yeasayer have miserably failed to do on their new album by creating huge whirlwinds of pop psychedelic within the framework of a beautiful melodies, whilst \"Apocalypse Dreams\" is as a funky as anything on Lewis Taylor's \"Lost Album\" and as equally brilliant. Timing is everything and on the same day that ELO issue a new greatest hits \"Why won't they talk me \" echoes Jeff Lynne while \"Feel like we are going backwards\" is pure summer of love and blessed out vibes. Mention in dispatches should go to the wonderful pop of the single \"Elephant\" a sprawlingly ambitious song which throws in the kitchen sink, the the gas cooker and the microwave. It is far the most rocking track on the album but pumps along with enough distractions to grab your attention with a vice like grip. God knows what is going on all together in the six minute plus \"Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control\" punctuated by whirring Parker vocals, spoken dialogue and almost a Syd Barrett like pop longing which makes it such a unmitigated treat. In this sense the last song \"Sun's Coming Up\" might be the least favourite track on there starting with a gentle piano coda and ending with synthesiser waves crashing on the beach it might just be a bit to clever for its own good but more listens are required. In any case you can counter it with one of the bubbling highlights of the album the echo laden and spacey \"Music to walk home by\" a song to wear your needle thin. Tame Impala and their burgeoning levels of \"Mind Mischief\" are turning this band into real contenders with their massive pop sensibilities combined with an eye for startling retro, so old its new. This is an album realised well in time for the forthcoming brightness of the Australian summer and no doubt will soundtrack the rising heat in those latitudes as the a hot sun slowly drifts down the line of beach. In the grey autumn of a dull October how we must envy your \"Antipodean\" cousins for their fair climate and for having one of the best new bands on any continent.","overall":5,"summary":"Tame Impala - Solitude is bliss","unixReviewTime":1349827200,"reviewTime":"10 10, 2012"}

With over fifty songs, there's more than enough from which to choose. What I think is so neat is that there seems to be no rhyme for reason as to what goes on this collection.

Barnes \"Science Fiction and Music Collector\"","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"When I first heard this song, I was a little let down. But as I got into the lyrics, I did feel better. The lyrics are pretty good and a bit more mature then many previous efforts. It was hard for me to pinpoint, but it seems the production is a bit off. Maybe the production was a bit to heavy, and should have focused on the song itself more. I do not dislike the song, I guess it's just expectations. I do think it is a top ten song, but is not the super dance smash like some of her others. Hopefully, the remixes will be as good as always. (Kelly Clarkson for example-remixes as great as original cut)This is the \"season\" of the big releases. Lady Gaga is also releasing new material, as has Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus. Here's looking forward to some great itunes being released in the next four monthsBottom line, a good song worth purchasing. A blockbuster? Maybe not, but if you put it on a playlist with \"I Will Survive\", \"We Are Never Getting Back Together\", and \"Stronger(What Doesn't Kill You)\" you will get a feeling for the theme. The blades will like this song. It will be interesting. I do not like reviewing \"pop idols\" too much. If you give a non-five star review, the rabid fans go nuts and shoot it down. But if you look at the guidelines for reviews, you write what you think. I did purchase this, and listen too it.","overall":3,"summary":"A Little Different Katy Perry","unixReviewTime":1376524800,"reviewTime":"08 15, 2013"}
