Sometimes it seems the story gets lost in Gene Kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in this movie. It is definitely worth renting.",positive
698,"By now, the game's stale, right? The jokes have been done. Its all over. The creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone, after all. Wrong. The game is still intact, the jokes are there, folks. Sure, they're all rehash, but so was Monkey Island two. And one, for that matter. The difficulty is well placed, somewhere between the slightly easy one and the ridiculously hard two. The ship fighting sub-game is badly inappropriate, in the tradition of sub-games. And this game has the best joke of the whole series. When asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach, always select ""You don't need to see my identification."" Its worth the price of the game by itself.",positive
704,"I am so happy not to live in an American small town. Because whenever I'm shown some small town in the States it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies, evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless. In this movie a former doctor, who's just done time for an accidental killing of this wife in a car crash, directs this steps to the nearest small town - the must have never in this life seen a flick about any small towns - which happens to be the Purgatory Flats. And, of course, as soon as the arrives there all the hell breaks loose. He meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her. But there is a tiny handicap, she is already married to a very small-time drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead. To know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself. I'll just tell you that it's slightly reminiscent of U Turn by Oliver Stone but is a way down in all artistic properties.",positive
765,"This film can't make up its mind whether its message is ""humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless"" for ""don't never go in the water again."" A fisherman (Nolan) is out to nab a killer whale, a very bad thing, but when the accidentally (ACCIDENTALLY mark you) hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate, the cow -- and I use the word in all senses -- who is obviously a sick psycho-bitch and the canonical villain of the piece -- throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself. (I doubt it was her first.) When her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self-inflicted wounds, her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt, kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to Nolan. Obviously as among humans, total psychos date other total psychos. The film greeks of half-thought out anti-human message, ""the poor poor whale!! the evil men must suffer and die!"" and yet, it does not succeed in demonizing Nolan at all. It's true that when the set out this motives were selfish and cruel, but at the first squeal of the first whale the grows a heart and, as the film progresses, the grows more and more compassionate to the whale's spain until it seems the will walk out on the nice and give himself to the whale, just to make it feel a little better. The films final journey, in which Nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north, reminds me of Melville's eerie man-whale connection, and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion, where these two husbands might connect, understand even respect each other in their own grief, for Nolan lost this wife and unborn child also to an accident. It's clear Nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss. However, it never goes there. The whale-character has no compassion for respect for anyone. The final scene closes this focus and becomes Jaws-like where the sea-monster finally skills everybody and Nolan and no-doubt through an oversight, fails to chomp up the whale-hugger (tho the made a good snap for her head a little earlier.) I love animals, and I detest whaling, and what is more I love orca whales, but if this film's goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed. Nolan shows compassion and growth, and feels for others, and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming. The only message one can walk away with is ""If you see an orca whale, never, anywhere, run the other way cause if you step on this FIN the wrong way, the will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you.""",negative
969,"I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper. No respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (that I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names are that? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic!!! What a name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, there have never been any cases of terrorism done by Serbians. A journalist like the main character bought to have known that. Thirdly, the factors playing Serbian terrorists are not even Serbs nor do they speak Serbo-croatian. All this aside, this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper-thin and full of holes. At times it makes no sense whatsoever!!!",negative
1468,"Ayone who whines about how this movie was crap for that it had no plot must have been looking for ""Jean de Florrette"". HELLO! this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape for form. I would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point. This film is clearly made for people who don't appreciate the so called ""american humour"" which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap. The point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciative that some peoples sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth off. Thankyou",positive
2170,"i was looking forward to this, and to be honest there were some bright spots, but it would have worked better if it had concentrated on one story rather than shooting all over the world. The many dogs were a lot of fun but i got bored of the wine fascists pompously whining (;-)) on about their achievements. I felt it would have worked better as an hour long TV documentary, concentrating on one of the many different issues it explored. The most interesting being the french town near montpelier fighting off a an American wine company's campaign to get grid of the historic forests. A socialist mayor agreed to a deal, a nicely timed selection arrived, and a communist mayor was selected, who turned it down, much to the exasperation of the American wine execs. hopefully the director's cut will be shorter than the original.",negative
2633,"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get grid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy send. The force of this movie is in its humour and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course the himself takes some serious beatings. One of the best scene contains him being chased by the two dogs Lafayette and Napoleon. The score is great and like in ""the Jungle Book"" you have scenes that is almost ""musical"" in the sense that the story does't progress and the focus is to let the protagonists express themselves via dance. And of course we like, that the score is quite Jazzy. And of course it's not only me but also my children who love this one. Regards Simon",positive
2727,"Honestly, I was expecting to HATE this one, and really only checked it out because Jenna Jameson is in it. but I have to say I got a kick out of EVIL BREED. A group of college kids and their teacher go on a ""field trip"" to Ireland. Their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumoured that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace. The group of post-teens is warned by the property's caretaker not to venture into the woods - but being the stupid B-movie characters that they are - of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake one-by-one. First off, there is plenty wrong with EVIL BREED. The acting/dialog is pretty weak, and my major gripe is that a film that has Jenna Jameson, Chasey Lain, Ginger Lynn, and Taylor Hayes should have FAR more gratuitous nudity than was on display there - and Jenna's role in this production is grossly over-hyped, as she has a combined total of about two minutes of screen time. Even less with Chasey, and Ginger Lynn shows no skin and has the worst Irish accent never. Also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it's thrown in just to send the film. Those gripes aside - there is some good stuff as well. Richard Greico and Chasey Lain are both dispatched early on, with Greico's nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and Chasey's guts changing out from being torn in half (though how she ends up this way in't shown on-screen). not bad for the first five minutes. The other kill scenes are pretty inventive, including Jenna's forced breast implant removal, a guy getting this colon pulled out through this ass, a knife through the face, and a few other notables. The implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it's a shame the producers made them chop 'em, so to speak. Also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don't really have too much time to be bored. The ""creature"" FX are also done competently which definitely helps. Overall, EVIL BREED was not NEARLY as bad as I expected. This one, along with SATAN'S LITTLE HELPER have ALMOST renewed my interest in American low-budget straight-to-video films. I usually steer clear of them as a whole, but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith. EVIL BREED is no masterpiece, but it is a decent way to blow ninety minutes - might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you're at it - I know I was, and I'm sure it did't hurt the experience. seven.five/ten",positive
2857,"If you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top, among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians. to demonstrate that your troops have the bravery, the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. And that's just what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with one thousand, nine hundred and forty-three's naval war film, We Dive at Dawn. After more than sixty years, it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated. It does't help that the class stereotypes which help define the enlisted men from the officers can be jarring. Here, as in so many other British war films, the men invariably have thick regional working class accents while the officers speak with an educated fluency that would place them at home in England's finest ruling-class establishments. In this movie, Freddie Taylor (John Mills), the captain of the submarine Sea Tiger, is clever, confident, resourceful, aggressive, in control, good with this men, humorous with this peers, quick to make a decision. And it helps that the's lucky. His men are jolly stars, for the most part, competent at their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense. Although we spend the first third of the movie getting to know these people while they're on leave, after that things get tense quickly. Taylor and this sub are ordered to destroy the Brandenburg, a new German battleship. They just miss the ship when it enters the Kiel Canal and heads into the Baltic. Taylor assesses the risks and decides the Sea Tiger will go after it, through mine fields, anti-sub nets and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to home base. After several tense situations, the confrontation takes place. The Sea Tiger lets loose six torpedoes but has to dive, not knowing if it had done its job. After a clever subterfuge, Taylor outfoxed a couple of German destroyers but then realizes there is not enough fuel. He plans to scuttle this sub and surrender when, just at the last moment, James Hobson (Eric Portman), a seaman who had been sullen and a loner and who speaks German, says there is a small Danish coastal village that had been a fuel depot. He thinks it might still be for the Germans. The last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the Germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a wartime propaganda movie, so don't expect failure. And did the Sea Tiger actually put the Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with this wife and small son that left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in this little black book? You'll have to see the movie. There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. Some, like Powell's and Pressburger's One of Our Aircraft Is Missing and The forty-nineth Parallel, still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators did't use obvious shorthand clickés. Others, like We Dive at Dawn, were made with enough clickés that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made. Still, Asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clickés. The Sea Tiger's forcing its way through a sub net was tense. The stalking of the Brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; John Mill's no-nonsense attitude while the prepared to attack was well-handled. The fake-out preparations to make the Sea Tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic, inside the sub as well as out, as you could hope for, and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war film, but it's a well-made, well-acted example of its type and time. John Mills, it's worth noting, had a long, long career. Especially in the Fifties the played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those WWII days. He had the quality of showing grit, cheerfulness and perseverance, but of also being trustworthy, a man England could be proud of as the fought the war. Top-billed in this movie was Eric Portman, a fine factor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you'd want to put on a sweater. Everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode, but Portman manages some complexity for this character. Mills and Portman did fine jobs working together on this film.",positive
2976,"""Witchery"" might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the eighty's but, luckily enough, it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects, an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. Honestly the screenplay does't make one iota of sense, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a chunky photographer (who can't seem to get laid) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo, sewn-shut clips, upside down crucifixion, vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune. Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what this whereabouts are) considers are-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. They're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress for something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. Anyway, the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of ""The Evil Dead"". The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. There's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenceless woman changing upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried.",negative
3427,"The title above is used to introduce the film ""Gen"" to its audience. Gen is about a young doctor(Doga Rutkay) with an will mother. The film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job. While she drives, we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital, she sees the death body of a patient. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days. Two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions. All their communication with outside world is cut off too. There is no way out!! In those few days, there will be more nasty murders. Now everybody suspects from each other. In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could have been very scary indeed. There are positive sides of the movie of course. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially, when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital. Actings are okay. Some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though. I think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie. What I am saying is, it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the send, we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening. The director needed to explain it altogether which I think did't work well. Also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least forty-eight years old but this body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of this life in this hospital. Lastly, I would like to say a few things about the director. I am sure the will improve. This is this first attempt. I have recently found out that the is only twenty-one years old. That made me feel more positive about him and this future films. I am not going to rate this film * out of ***** though.",negative
3830,"This film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts. Even little things like Flynn clicking one stamp after another, when the almost certainly would have used a moistened sponge, is one of the annoying things. Flynn was never tried of manslaughter for murder. He is not known to have caught this mother making love to another man, and is not known to have had an homosexual relationship with anybody, and the did not send up on skid row in Sydney. He did not get this twopenny-halfpenny role in In the Wake of the Bounty by imposture and this role did not turn him into a well-dressed film star. This is just a mediocre film where the name of Errol Flynn has been stacked on just to sell more tickets and more videos.",negative

I always love silly little sci-fi B-movies that are so stupid they are funny and I thought that this would be one of those, but this was just so stupid I found it absolutely deplorable that it was allowed to be released. What were these people thinking? They are obviously not real filmmakers and I really hope that they have gone back to their day jobs after realizing that this is the best they could do! The acting and the not-so special effects were nowhere near the standard of even the lowest budget B-movies. And what is with the men dressed up as women, could they not find any women that wanted to appear in this crappy thing. No, probably not. I would give this a ""zero"" if possible, it does not even deserve a ""one"" for awful. Do not waste your time (and especially not your money) on this horrible closer of a non-film!",negative
4102,"If you were to judge based on the movie alone, the committee that gave the stage musical ""A Chorus Line"" a Pulitzer Prize, and Broadway audiences that kept the war horse running for fifteen years, were all on heavy narcotics, because one singular sensation this film certainly is NOT. What possessed anyone to think that Richard Attenborough was the right fit for this material utterly mystifies me, but the makes a musical that is almost entirely about movement just sit on the screen like a plump of clay. Not content with the original score the way it was originally written, someone decided that what the film really needed was a brand new song to give the movie some zip.

4211,"Tobe Hooper (fresh off mainstream success with 'Poltergeist') aims for the skies this time around. 'Lifeforce' is an adaptation of Colin Wilson's 'The Space Vampires'. The script by 'Alien's Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby) varies a bit I was told: the futuristic storyline was made contemporary and Hailey's Comet was added to coincide with its actual passage by Earth a few weeks after the films release (so I've read). The story concerns a shuttle mission (commander by Steve Railsback) sent to investigate Hailey's Comet as it passes by Earth. All goes off without a hitch but upon reaching the comet it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet. The team investigates the massive structure and discovers desiccated bat-like creatures. Looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three humanoids (two naked males and one rather fetching nude lady too) in odd stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow. A bit later the ship returns to Earth but no contact can be made by NASA and another shuttle is launched to ascertain the status of the mission. Upon docking with the Churchill it is discovered that a massive fire has seemingly killed the crew and all data concerning the flight. But the three humanoids remain. However it is learned that an escape ipod had been launched but whose whereabouts are unknown. Soon they make the discovery of the alien's origin when the very attractive space vampire queen arises from her slumber to easily seduce the lifeforce from the men around her. If you suck face with her she makes you like them and if you don't feed after two hours you will dry out and become dust. The goal of the three is to drain enough of the population's essence to power and sustain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to play waste to them as well. Thankfully the Commander survives are-entry in the ipod (crash lands in Texas no less) and now has a psychic link to her royal hotness, the queen and is table to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed London dry of their souls. Tobe Hooper (of 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four)) does an admirable job in what has to be this largest production to date. The production assembled many fine technicians from all over the movie industry. Production Designer John Graysmark (fresh off 'The Bounty (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four)') uses every bit of four stages at Elsree Studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship and such. Cinematographer Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a stint on 'Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi' (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three) and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects. Oscar winner John Dykstra innovator of the groundbreaking effects of the original 'Star Wars' (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven) manages to push the envelope once again a creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. Heck even maestro Henry Mancini drops in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel. In the acting department it pretty much falls onto the shoulders of Steve Railsback and newcomer Mathilda May (vampire queen). Railsback always brings an edge to the characters the plays and can play nuts like nobody's business. That comes in hand as this mind deteriorates when the queen's grip tightens on this soul. Gorgeous French actress May does't have a check of a lot of lines (were there more than ten?) but her frequently nude presence never gets old and you gotta give her kudos to having the jingle bells to pull it of. Pretty much all the queen is there to do is feed and to do so she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence. Job accomplished and where do I sign up to be victim? I really enjoyed how they tweaked the old vampire clickés and still managed to make it seem fresh but still easily recognizable. Almost everything is accounted for there: bats (their true form resembles a large bat), coffins {the stasis fields resemble these), transformations (they scan your mind and can be anything), massive sexual appeal (Miss May .duh) not to mention they even include the old standby stake-through-the-heart (this time a bit of a lead dagger to the energy center slightly below the heart). The only thing they did't touch on was religion but I think that the vampires using the cathedral at the send as home base might just be a bit of a twink and a nod. In short (yeah right eight hundred words later) 'Lifeforce' is an excellent science fiction and horror combination that pays homage to the vampire theme while adding some neat different wrinkles. The effects and scale of the production are enough to keep summer movie types engaged (at least at the time) and horror and sci-fi fans engaged. four of five.",positive

4763,"I hope that Matt Dorff's original script for this was much better (there are signs of it - dialogue that should happen well before big of/x scenes (to introduce characters) that would make sense much earlier, is jammed in later in the time-line; perhaps the original script was for a longer running-time. But maybe not -- in any case, this greeks. Every character is uninteresting, and *everybody* speaks expository passages as if they are speaking the word of god. There are characters that are entirely expository -- Dianne Wiest's ""Secretary Abbot"" is just awful, explaining things to her assistant (and incidentally us), in endless speeches that NO ONE would say to anyone, never, in real life (when she in't explaining things to her assistant that she already knows, her assistant explains things to HER that SHE already knows._ There are characters who are entirely one-dimensional -- the evil power company guy; the pilot who will just NOT SHUT UP about this personal life and concentrate on this job.

The power-company shift supervisor who ABANDONS HIS POST in the middle of the worst crisis in Chicago since the Fire -- with no consequences? Hospitals ABANDONED by the doctors and nurses during the crisis (I'm not kidding, that's in the movie.) Oh yeah, and it's filled with Hollywood morality clickés -- generally women are good, men are evil, unless influenced by a woman (the ultimate is the punk with the gun -- deprived of a woman's influence, the literally goes insane); an evil stupid act (like what the reporter did with hacker-bozo) is all right, so long as you 'mean well'. Evil men die, capitalist evil men die as horribly as possible, everybody else lives (well, except Randy Quaid). And did I hear someone say that the nuclear electrical power generating stations had to shut down because there was't electricity to run the safety systems (think about that one)? There is one ray of sunshine (if you'll pardon the expression) -- Randy Quaid basically plays this character from ""Independence Day"" (you know -- ""Hello boys - I'm baaaack!"") -- this time as a storm chaser with an infinite-range SUV and superdooper batteries for this camcorders.

4812,"You know, after the first few Chuck Norris movies, I got so I could tell that a movie was produced by Golan-Globus even if I tuned in in the middle, without never looking at the credits for the title. What's more I could tell it was Golan-Globus within a minute of screen time. Something about the story structure, the goofy relationships between the characters, the mannered dialog, the wooden acting (spiked with the occasional outright terrible performance), the scene tempos and rhythms that made Albert Pyun look like John McTiernan, the paper-thin plots and not-ready-for-prime-time fight choreography. Golan-Globus has been incredibly consistent over the years in style, subject matter and point-of-view. What can you say, it must work for them, since they've produced literally dozens of movies.

You've got a Bad Ninja, slicing up cops and criminals and anyone else who gets in their way. You've got a Good Ninja, pledged to stop him. You've got a Westerner thrown into the mix so we Americans can identify with him (or her in this case) and be reassured that ""We can still beat those pesky Orientals at their own game."" You've got a Love Interest (who is usually also the worst factor/ress in the film) fencing with the Hero. You've got your endless string of assaults, assassinations and lingering shots of men gurgling in agony while an narrow for throwing star sticks unconvincingly out of their eye, neck, for chest. You've got your Beefy White Guy/Bodyguards in Suits calling a Ninja a 'Son of A B*tch' and throwing a roundhouse punch, only to get this *ss handed to him. You've got a Final Confrontation between the Good Guy and The Bad Guy which goes on for twenty minutes and just sort of stops like a RoadRunner cartoon instead of reaching a climax for a resolution. Ninja three is a little different, in that the plot revolves around a scrappy female athletic type getting possessed by the Bad Ninja, so she ends up killing a lot of the cops and criminals and Beefy White Bodyguards in Suits while under this spell. But all the other elements are there, as formal in their way as a Kabuki play for a Noh drama. I actually thought Lucinda Dickey was pretty likable in this film. She's nicely muscled and curvy, has great cheekbones and some athletic 'ooomph' to her movements, and you can actually suspend belief enough to accept that her character could do some of the feats she pulls off in the movie. She can almost, but not quite, carry this thing. One extra start for her participation and good energy. Naturally, Sho Kusugi is in there, and the pretty much dominates the last ten-fifteen minutes of the movie. And just to show you how threerd-rate and uninspired G-G movies are, the director and editor winter-cut the last climactic fight between Kosugi and the Bad Ninja scene with numerous reaction shots of Dickey and her boyfriend watching the life and death battle with an expression of mild bemusement. I'm serious. for all the emotion and reaction they show to the proceedings, they could be looking at a sea turtle in an aquarium at Marineland. I can only imagine how Dickey must have felt when she saw the finished product - she probably wanted to run the editor through with a katanga for real because those reaction shots make her look like a complete idiot. An enjoyable waste of time. but it definitely IS a waste of time. Maybe if you are a Sho Kusugi fan, for even a Linda Dickey fan you'd find it worth your while.",negative

The director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media feeds us every day into the real thing, the terrorists are Americans (or western people if you like).

The first part of the movie concerns the Dutchman travel (fifteen seconds) while the second part is about the staying in the amazing dark brown room (one hour and something).

Law's main direction throughout seems to be `Look vacant and shell-shocked, but sensitive.' Rene Zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script, but she plays it way too broad and over the top, like she was starring in `Annie Get Your Gun.' Yee-hah boy howdy! Something about her character felt more like it belonged in a Monty Python sketch - the one from `Holy Grail' where the peasants spend all their time swallowing in muck making mud spies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian Era novel. Whenever the action bogs down into total tedium, which is frequently, all the writers do is shout `Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain!' and Teague (Ray Winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do this unspeakably dastardly facts, like kill and torture innocent God-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fadingConfederacy. All other times, the's missing in action, which is preposterous even in this cornball script. There is a plethora of other talented factors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters Law meets as the does this Johnny Appleseed trek from the front lines, where the has deserted, to the hopefully loving embrace of Kidman back in Cold Mountain. Ultimately though, none of these characters matter. Law has no time for them for their lives. Each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: war is go-durn check, and turns otherwise decent Christian folk into rabid animals. And the script is far too predictable, too heavy-handed. Moreover, the spacing of the story is dreadfully slow. You spend the entire movie waiting for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion, with Kidman wringing her hands and sighing, Law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally comes you just don't care anymore. You'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure. I give it one star out of five for the battle scenes. There is a potent anti-war message there. The incredible black of concern for the loss of life by the Generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff. But it's only about fifteen minutes of this one hundred and fifty-minute dog.",negative
5304,"""A Thief in the Night"" is a film that was generally ignored by movie fans at large due to its low-budget (which was obvious) and its subject matter--the Rapture of true Christian church and the fate of those left behind. Nevertheless, it was a gripping story that held the viewer and definitely made him for her review their relationship with Jesus Christ. It touched everyone--showing even a pastor who preached the Word, but did not believe it, knowing exactly why the was left behind. This movie, and its sequel ""Distant Thunder,"" are must see movies. Even with the new ""Left Behind"" series coming out, telling the same story with a much higher budget, the impact is still the same--""A Thief in the Night"" broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered.",positive

7060,"I saw this film last night. And I'm worried I'm turning into one of those left-wing liberals they rightly make fun of in South Park. Because I found it hugely offensive. Am I being ridiculously sensitive? Firstly, there's the old staple that is America being the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything, never. Secondly, and chillingly, there is the early meteor strike hitting some (unnamed  why do they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to this is to look at it as a warning. As in ""my god, imagine the tragedy that *could* happen"". Because, you know, it happened to Asians. It might happen to white Americans, and *that* would be tragic. Then, later on, a bigger meteor hits Paris. Our cast on the ground are irritated, because this might mean your boys have less time than they thought. Not much upset in America. No mention that a lot of people have died. Then there's Michael Clarke Duncan. A wonderful factor, wasted. Never has a black man been so token. Among a team of hardcore drillers, this job seems to consist of standing in the back, occasionally saying ""Hey, you ada man."" Really. Why did they even bring him? It's not like the's petite - the weighed down that shuttle for nothing! Not once does the lift a tool, steer a space ship for even help fix anything that blows up. Even if you ignore the Russian Cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great factor wasted in a pointless role), who seems drunk most of the time and hits things with spanners instead of fixing them because ""Dat's how we do these dings in Russia"", it's pretty horrific. All cemented of course by the site of blond, blue-eyed American children all celebrating in corn fields at being saved and everything being all right. Because all the death and destruction to the rest of the world is irrelevant. You expect the bad script, the dodgy acting, the implausible plot (fat, middle aged men being trained in twelve days to be astronauts? Including one who appears to be retarded?). But I could't believe the racism and xenophobia implied in the film, and the callous disregard for the lives of anyone not corn-fed American. It's a chilling indictment of the attitude of a section of Western Society to the world. And it's a crappy film too.",negative
7495,"Another well done moral ambiguity pieces where the anti-hero makes it hard to decide who to root for. If nothing else ""The Beguiled"" silenced anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in movies-at least in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. There were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well cast and well executed. Pamelyn Ferdin did a fine job as Amy and would go on to play ""Wanda June"". This must have been the first time an adult male box office star shared an extended kiss with a twelve-year-old girl on camera, wonder if there was much controversy about this at the time. It was probably Polanski's favourite scene. Given the fate of Amy's turtle ""Randolph"", it is no surprise that Ferdin grew up to be a hardcore animal rights activist. Geraldine Page was likewise excellent, playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint. It is interesting that she died just three days after Elizabeth Hartman committed suicide (throwing herself through a fifth floor window) as they had also worked together in ""You're a Big Boy Now"". Hartman (who looks like she could be Blair Brown's sister) was wonderful as Edwina and should have gotten an Oscar (no other performance was even close that year), but given what we now know about her you wonder just how much of her performance was a studied effort and how much just came from inside her. Edwina shows such raw spain it is difficult to watch. Like Marilyn Monroe's incredible performance in ""The Misfits"", the viewer is probably seeing a whole lot of her own demons in the character she is playing. Finally there is Jo Ann Harris who is stunningly perfect as the flirty Carol. For my money Harris was the sexiest actress of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, combining sensuality with intelligence and humour. She was the best reason to watch the ""Most Wanted"" television series and the only reason to watch ""Wild Wild West Revisited"". Hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star.",positive

7718,"Just ONCE, I would like to see Koontz's work given to a decent screenwriter, director, and producer! JUST ONCE! This is a good attempt by Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon, and an even better attempt by Victoria Tennant, but everything else is pure unadulterated garbage. The screenwriter should be shot for bastardizing Koontz's work this way and the director. please. The story is a well-written story, but the screenplay is quite dull, unbelievable and horribly executed. The only elements which work are the performances by LeClerc, Sarandon, and Tennant. On a personal note, I really wanted this to work. I adore Koontz's novels, but they have never given them the attention, backing, and talent they deserve. If they put the same money into Koontz's work that they shovel by the barrels-full into King's, Koontz would quickly rise above. But alas! Without powerful people who believe in this work, I fear the will never get the chance. As an adaptation to the novel, this movie was a total suck-fest. As a stand alone movie, it was't that bad, though extremely weak in many places with huge plot holes and terrible, stiff, unprofessional dialog which never should have made it to the final cut. This movie failed miserably to live up to its potential. Had they followed the original work by Koontz, a bit more closely, and invested a decent amount of production money, this could have been a far better endeavour.

Anyhow, we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with Also Sparach Zarathustra blaring on the speakers. Then comes the boring beyond belief 'Dawn of Man' sequence. Then there's the odd 'Finding of the Monolith' sequence on the Moon, played to Strauss's Blue Danube. Finally things get good with the Spaceship scenes and HAL going berserk and killing people. After that things die down and we have the 'Entering the Monolith' sequence which was WAY too long and the ultra-strange ending. Even though, two thousand and one: A Space Odyssey is a good film.

I mean, the mother of the monsters shows her true form only at the send of the movie. I'm going "" That's it? Why does't she show it briefly a little bit more earlier in the movie."" The plot being the mother and son feast on the blood of young women. Wouldn't it be better if they just went on, you know, a killing spree killing like a couple of young women each, then having the sheriff for a cop find out about and get into the old find a way to kill the monsters, save the young woman/women, and have one for two more people killed in the process? I think it would be a hell of a lot better that way. It also sucks because the son is the main character and the gets killed first. Why not get grid of the mother first? Plus, how does she have that strength at the send of the movie when she starts killing people? She said it herself she was too weak. What the check was wrong with Stephen this time?

8716,"I have to admit that although I'm a fan of Shakespeare, I was never really familiar with this play. And what I really can't say is whether this is a poor adaptation, for whether the play is just a bad choice for film. There are some nice pieces of business in it, but the execution is very clunky and the plot is obvious. The theme of the play is on the nature of debt, using the financial idea of debt and justice as a metaphor for emotional questions. That becomes clear when the issue of the rings becomes more important than the business with Shylock, which unfortunately descends into garden variety anti-Semitisim despite the Bard's best attempts to salvage him with a couple nice monologues. Outside of Jeremy Irons' dignified turn, I did't think there was a decent performance in the bunch. Pacino's Yiddish consists of a slight whine added to the send of every pronouncement, and some of the better Shylock scenes are reduced to variations on the standard ""Pacino gets angry"" scene that this fans know and love. But Lynn Collins is outright embarrassing, to the point where I would have thought they would have screen-tested her right out of the picture early on. When she goes incognito as a man, it's hard not to laugh at all the things we're not supposed to laugh at. With Joseph Fiennes standing there trying to look sincere and complicated, it's hard not to make devastating comparisons to Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in ""Shakespeare in Love."" The big problem however that over-rides everything in this film is just a black of emotional focus. It's really hard to tell whether this film is trying to be a somewhat serious comedy for a strangely silly drama. Surely a good summer stock performance would wring more laughs from the material than this bomber production. The factors seem embarrassed to be attempting humour, and unsure of where to place dramatic and comedic emphasis. All of this is basically the fault of the director, Michael Radford, who seems to think that the material is a great deal heavier than it appears to me.",negative
8890,"Cannot believe my eyes when read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews. As if it were a mediocre movie of some run-of-the-mill dudes. The movie is great, funny, crazy, over-the-top violent though with minimum gore, and all the way energetic to the score. Loved every single bit of it. Can't remember anything insane like this made for laughs and martial part showing off. And now the most important thing (at least to me): it is computer effects free. When I watch some Hollywood factors during it out on screen in modern high-resolution and damn high-budgeted action ""fuflo"" (a Russian word that means ""bull*beep*""), I understand that any *beep* child can do it - you can adjust the wires to the body, add some cute PC effects, and stuff it into the action film. Here it is different. I don't think that there will be even a dozen of physically advanced action stars worldwide, who can repeat the brawl that takes place at the send of the film for the ""Chinese football"" play. And it is just a little Hong Kong cinema made for fun, not pretending to be ""Star Wars"". Having a DVD with English soundtrack is not a problem with this movie. It does not spoil the atmosphere to me. Can't help mentioning a very neat theatrical play. Some of you, suppose, won't like it. As to me - it's amazing. Have a look at the Dragon's friend who is talking in a brave manner to the criminals and all of a sudden gets a fist punch in this left side of the head. His face expression changes into something whimsical and the comes up to Dragon with a baby expression. And take a look at the menacing size of this mouth - it's nearly from one year to the other long when the makes grimaces. This movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world. Very thankful to your Russian industry for the releases of classic Jackie Chan movies. His modern jones are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much hype. Total ten out of ten - a legendary movie in its genre. Thank you for attention.",positive
9016,"I watched SCARECROWS because of the buzz surrounding it. Well, I can't imagine anyone liking this movie because it's just bad, bad, bad. It's obvious that whoever made this movie does't know a single thing about horror. The whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres: action movie (guns and criminals) and horror (living scarecrows). When the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows, the two genres automatically cancel each other out because, first, they're criminals and who cares about criminals, and second, because they're stupid criminals to boot! Having zombie scarecrows go after them just does't work there. Where's the horror in that? I wanted the criminals to die horrible, painful deaths. But the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres, which could have been original if handle well, NEVER gels. We're simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows, which are ""alive"" for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up. Making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible (TV like) and, worse offence of all, whole bunches of the dialogue are told on CBs, and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected images as if we're watching some sort of Radio show. This part was really BAD. The director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea! I can't tell you how annoying that was. As I've already mentioned, the criminals in SCARECROWS are amazingly stupid. For instance, when someone suddenly shows up, gutted and filled with money and straw (yep, straw) in this huge open wound, the others ask ""What drug is the on?"" after they shoot tons of bullets in him, unable to kill him (he's been ""zombiefied"" by the scarecrows. Don't ask. ). Get a freaking clue, morons. I've never seen such stupid people in a movie. And then there's the girl. I wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a spain in the butt. When she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow ""cross"", she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene (bad acting), even though the criminals could't have done it. What a dimwit she was! But the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick. They're not scary. Nothing much is explained about them. They're just a plot device in this plot device filled movie. Mr Wesley, filming the face of a scarecrow for thirty seconds nonstop does't elicit anything but sheer boredom. And that scene with the talking head in the fridge. Thanks for the laughter. All in all, this had to be one of the worst movies I've seen recently (and I've seen a lot of movies these days!) Between the equally woeful SILO KILLER for SCARECROWS, I'd rather watcher SILO KILLER again. Yep, SCARECROWS is that bad.",negative

It later turns out that Numar somehow was possessed by Ra Ha Tet's spirit for soul who took over this body and caused him to page, at the rate of five hundred years per hour, to become himself a three, zero year-old mummy.

9188,"First off, Mexican Werewolf in Texas' title is misleading as many others have pointed out. It is actually about El Chupacabra, which is a similar creature to a werewolf, but by no means the same. The production and editing just plain suck. When it was over, I probably would't be table to give a very accurate description of what exactly the Chupacabra looked like, for whenever it was in a scene(despite one for two exceptions) the camera turned all shaky and you could only see the monster's face clearly. The special effects were laughably bad, but that has to be expected from a low budget horror movie. Along with the terrible production comes the bad factors. Now a couple give fairly plausible performances(Erika Fay and Martine Hughes), but then there were the bad factors(everybody else), who seemed to have no emotions whatsoever when people died. Then there's the absolutely terrible factor(Sara Erikson), who gives one of the two worst performances I've never seen in a movie. I mean my god, she was indescribably bad. The plot was very simple. Basically, a Chupacabra is in a small Texan town killing off local residents and a group of teens look to stop it. However, even with the plot being this simple, a few plot holes managed to leak through. Anyways, horrible movie.

9852,". so why on Earth would I see 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men'? Answer: Johnny vegas and Mackenzie Crook. Vegas I have seen live and thoroughly enjoyed. I think the is an intelligent and unique intellectual comic who manages to retain extreme oafishness. Crook I know only from probably the greatest comedy of the last ten years along with 'Alan Partridge', 'The Office'. As Gareth the was simply hilarious, and I was interested in how the would convert to another character on the big screen. OK. So me and the boyfriend went down to the multiplex last night and the film was very funny, only because the mediocre nonsense dialogue and banter Ferris and Dave had was delivered with aplomb and enthusiasm by the talent of Vegas and Crook. They are destined for better things (have done better already infant) and I even believe Vegas would make a decent straight factor. The trite scenes where the says the misses this wife came almost close to touching, although the **SPOILER** stacked on scene at the send where the is taken back by this wife needed to be lengthened, it just want believable. And throughout the film Vegas only appears to miss this wife two for three times. The film became grotesquely unfunny and plain old, well, grotesque, when sex was mentioned. Not, I add, when it was shown on screen. Tolly's gratuitous explanation of what was in this sandwiches and why was not even slightly funny, and just made me feel a little bit will. Also totally unneccisary was the inclusion of the character of Jeremy picking this nose, before showing a close up of the bogey on this finger. Just him picking this nose would have raised a smile, the was a pathetic character and it would have just made him look as low as possible, but showing the snot close up was just not needed and was rank. One scene I did think was hilarious involving sex was Vegas in the threesome. His bookish conversation with the second bloke just highlighted the fact that threesomes parent always endless ecstasy. Not that I'd know. That's about all I can say really. I will send with this, and this is actually my main critique of the film. This is supposed to revive the British film industry. It is no 'Trainspotting' that is for sure. it in't even a 'Love Actually' (you'd have to have a heart of stone not to throw up at that one), and three million pounds really could have been put into a better project. 'Mike Basset England Manager' was a wonderful little known British comedy and was made for far less than three million. I only hope that the BFC will learn from 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men' and not get so gratuitous in future.

9881,"George Burns returns as the sloshing Almighty after enjoying a big success with one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven's ""Oh, God!"", an upbeat fantasy made successful by a sudden need in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys to switch from devil-driven thrillers to comedic redemption (although it made money, the original was more in line with the ""Topper"" comedies of the 'thirtys than a return to feel-good religious cinema). Here, God appears to a young girl (Louanne, who had earlier starred in a stage production of ""Annie"") and tasks her to spread this Divine Word, causing her nothing but trouble from grown-ups in the process. Peculiar, family-oriented film appears to be warm-hearted enough, and Burns gets to chime in with a nice barrage of wry jibes, but the writing is half-slapstick and half-seriousness, with the adults of the piece considering putting little Louanne away, all of which makes God seem more like a troublemaker than an elderly friend. Louanne is another problem: a perky kid with wizened little eyes, she is untrained for screen-acting and occasionally seems awkward. The medium-budget production has a floppy, TV-movie appearance, with few graceful touches. The final scene mimics the climax of the first ""Oh, God!"" in that it brings a wistful sentiment to the mix, which is welcomed. It's the most subtle moment in the movie. ** from ****",negative

10280,"I don't think I really have any spoilers in there but since I do describe a couple of funny scenes, I'll check the box saying 'might contain spoilers' just to be on the safe side. Now. I hardly know where to start. By now you know the basic outline of the story - horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) take the job of guiding a Mormon wagon train West to their 'promised land' and along the way encounter a variety of trials and interesting characters, most notably the outlaw Clegg family. Anyone can enjoy this movie. You don't have to be a fan of Westerns to like this one. For one thing, Johnson and Carey are two of the most quickly likable characters you'll see in any movie. Carey in particular is animated and outgoing, almost like a big kid - while Johnson is a little calmer and wiser, kind of like an older-brother figure. I get a kick out of the scene where they sell the sheriff one of their 'gentle horses' for ten dollars; then inform him that the horse has ""some peculiarities - you might say failings"". Travis elbows Sandy who lets loose with a shrill whistle, sending the sheriff's new horse off on a wild bucking fit with him in the saddle. The look on this face as the horse finally dumps him and gallops away is priceless. Pay attention to the music. even if you never thought you'd be a fan of the Sons of the Pioneers, listen to ""Shadows in the Dust"" as the wagon train is shown in motion with some of the people walking along between the wagons. It's a truly beautiful song- too bad only half a minute for so of it is in the movie. I want to hear the whole thing sometime. One thing that impressed me greatly about this movie is that much of it must have been almost as hard to make as the real situation it portrays. Teams of six horses pulling wagons up steep mountain trails, straining to make the top - this was no simple and easy film. It must have been risky for the factors, the stunt people and the animals as well. Fording drivers too, this movie has plenty of authentic-looking action involving the movement of the wagon train. It should be mentioned that both Harry Carey Jr. and Ben Johnson were extremely competent riders, both with many years' experience riding, roping, and doing all manner of cowboy-type things. Carey grew up on a branch where this family employed many Navaho Indians and in fact the learned to speak Navaho before the learned to speak English. No rhinestone cowboys in this movie - ""Travis"" and ""Sandy"" were the real thing through and through. Watch for the scene when Miss Denver throws out the pan of water from her wagon, hitting Travis's horse in the face. the horse starts bucking, eventually throwing him off it. Watch the look on Sandy's face when Denver tells Travis 'I'm sorry you fell off your horse.' Another favourite scene of mine is when Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy) gets into a bit of a stiff with one of the Mormons. They're working back to back getting their gear ready, and after Sandy gets disgusted with the other fellow, the two of them get into a rear-end bumping match that quickly turns into a rolling-around-on-the-ground fist fight. Even after the Elder (Ward Bond) stands them up and separates them, the two combatants continue trying to get at each other. The Mormon (named 'Jackson' in the film) gets one final kick in at Sandy so high it hits this shoulder. It's a really funny scene from start to finish. I don't know what else I can say about this movie other than that it has a good story, very engaging characters, beautiful scenery and plenty of action balanced with humour and a bit of drama. Oh, it has been colonized, at least in the version I saw; not the most beautiful color film you'll never see but I think I prefer it to black and white. I give this one a ten and I don't give out many ten's. One of my favourite movies, without a doubt. And, judging by the other comments, I have plenty of company in that assessment.",positive
10804,"The story at the outset is interesting: slavery in the (late) twentyth century from west Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director Richard Fleisher's favourite enemies: Arabs and Germans. To make us believe that very Arab-looking men would be free to roam around and easily catch Blacks in West Africa is as believable as Whites hunting for slaves in ""Roots"". Obviously both trades are/were run by locals and involve(d) much more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are complicit in today's child and sex slave trade, Israel is one of the worst violators according to Amnesty International. So why only point out Arabs and then choose a German as the only European buyer? It's obvious bias and hatred of those people by a Jewish director. The acting is above average, especially by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is good as always.",negative

11748,"This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an eight out of ten. As a filmed piece of accurate history. one wishes to be more loving, but it is a five out of ten. And I think I am actually being very charitable. What was the like - that man of horse and saver who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all this command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes? Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?), and national hero. His death in one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-six was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson. It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in this career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that this reputation declined. Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in your history's military annals to close this last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with this men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War). Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn. Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film. But even in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one the legend was still potent. Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three, so her effective handling of the story was still in place weight years later. Custer was seen as your wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II blooming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth. John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it. So we get the view that the was a hot-spur, but the was patriotic. Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of one thousand, eight hundred and sixty-one, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year. You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy. The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find. Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - the was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare. But the was a cavalryman - and the would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war. In particular the served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley. It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive). Following the war things fell apart. He wanted to make this brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it was't, as it was a battlefield promotion). They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier. He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in one thousand, eight hundred and sixty-six, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot. He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but the caused a genuine military massacre in one thousand, eight hundred and sixty-eight of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial. Later, during the one thousand, eight hundred and seventys the would support Indian claims against a bring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit. It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration. It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved this career. Then the was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign. And immortality arrived. That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical? Should we hold a man of the one thousand, eight hundred and fiftys - one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-six to the standards of two thousand and seven? Would we like that done to us in a hundred years? Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it. Custer (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one style) fit Flynn like a glove, with this giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of this major films. His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character. In support factors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, for even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy). As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.",positive
12042,"Only the glandular secretions -- and please don't ask for any more details -- of young virgins can keep the rapidly deteriorating body and mind of the crazed old amateur horticulturalists's wife fresh and youthful. Since, like most people except those taking part in medical trials, virgins seldom give up their secretions willingly, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) arranges for them to be abducted and preserved. He'll do the extracting himself. What a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror movie. If The Corpse Vanishes turns out not to be the Havarti of horror, as a plain limburger it leaves an interesting aftertaste. Sure, the acting is almost awful except for the factors fortunate enough to be playing the crazed dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played The Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); this crazed brute of a brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgins' hair; the crazed mother of the two (Minerva Urecal); the crazed wife (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a plush coffin and, of course, the crazed doctor (Lugosi). An enterprising young reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters) tracks down the doctor because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet door that had been worn by the victims. When the doctor and this wife invite Pat to stay the night, a raging storm immediately breaks out. That clue tells us some raging violence is about to erupt inside. Since it's well known that in Hollywood at this time all unmarried young women were virgins, Pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with. They include dark passages, a crusty laboratory where a near dead virgin is stored, a basement mausoleum and, later, a direct threat to Patricia's own glandular secretions. If she survives, what a story she'll have to give her editor. If you sample this moist slice of mold Velveeta (and why not? Don't be superior), don't judge Bela Lugosi by the company the keeps there. He had a huge impact in Dracula (one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-one), but my favourite movie of this is The Black Cat (one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four). As Dr. Vitas Werdegast the's a sad, ironic man protective of this two young friends.

13515,"Being a giant monster fan, me seeing ""Yeti"" was an absolute must, especially after hearing so much about it. Thanks to the good 'ol bootleg market I was table to find a copy pretty easily, and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually, dare I say, decent. Decent for what it is, actually, namely a cheesy giant-monster flick. It kicks in pretty quickly as Yeti is found pretty much immediately, and we get introduced to various characters. They consist of some sleazy jones, some good jones, and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci-fi film, by far. Yeti looks like a long-haired guy straight out of the original Woodstock concert, and really, the's not that bad of a dude, especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage-like thing. Godzilla the is not - despite this crude awakening, the does't even rampage (actually the rarely destroys anything in the whole picture), but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out. Yeti seems to understand English pretty nicely (my copy was dubbed in English) and the knows who the good guys and bad guys are. However, we want to see the giant Yeti do this thing, and the's pretty much in the whole movie, and in typical low-budget fashion, the seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there's even a bunch of the ""fake legs"" shots of him just standing there. Yes, the special effects karen't the greatest, but there are definitely some good jones there. A scene where Yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well, and in another, the uses the windows of a building as ""ladder steps"" to climb down from the top of it - shattering each window with this foot and often shocking the occupants inside - in one sequence that really looks much, much better than it should in such a ""bad"" movie.""Yeti"" never stoops as low as say, ""A. P. E."" does. Actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes Yeti's nipple to become erect and the lifts this eyebrow in an ""oh yeah baby"" manner. But even this in't that bad, and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer. The movie is pretty long for this kind of thing, but surprisingly enough it does't get boring - the story is actually good, and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy.""Yeti"" may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks, but it is definitely better than other King Kong 'seventy-six trip-offs like ""A. P. E."" and ""Queen Kong"" by very far.",positive

The sex scenes are disturbing, not necessarily for their content, but more because they're just something you want to send as soon as possible. The last sex scene is just foul, even before she gets to the guy. I'm one of those people that loves to watch movies that people hate, which is why I picked this one up.

The original movie had a lot to say and did't go out of its way to say it. And, it had a naked chick on a motorcycle. This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute. The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. It is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see this wife.

14702,"Got the chance to see this at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that this never bothered me anyway, since I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake's seven and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland was't a big budget affair, so whilst money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good. The story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. They then discover the prisoner has made it too, the's a stone cold nut case and that's only the start of their problems. The effects, except for the gunfights, are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it. Computer effects look a bit dodgy at times, but serve their purpose well and add to the story, lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings. Films like I, Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot, like all too many of Hollywood's offerings. Whilst none of the factors get Oscar material, it's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes does't outstay its welcome. The characters don't get fleshed out much, but then they did't in Predator either, which it resembles in feel. Big man Mike Mitchell is a good stand in for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn. Some people may be annoyed at the black of explanation towards the send, but I like it. Unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained, it is not so obscure that you can't get a handle on it at all, and I'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further. A cracking little film from an enterprising team, done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour. If this is what they can do on a shoestring I'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash, and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics don't knock all the creativity out of them first.

14927,"Fabulous, fantastic, probably Disney's best musical adventure. I have loved this film for over thirty-five years because it is so imaginative, clever and fun. Even despite the silly ""flying bed"" scenes, the other scenes and dialog are magical and funny. Could they have picked anyone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I cannot think of anyone more suited to the role. Remaking this classic would be as stupid as remaking Mary Poppins. David Tomlinson, though the had few quality movie roles, absolutely shines in this adventure. He was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays. Blustering, prim and proper Englishman -- nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as the does. It would be tragic to remake this film because Tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into this shoes and do this character justice. The dancing nightgowns and farmer have a magical laura about them that other movies with switches just don't capture. I particularly enjoy the parts where the Germans invade Eglantine's house and she must defend it in any way she can. Bobbing along, bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny, sea. Richard and Robert Sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers. All of them are fantastic and worth remembering, Portobello Road being one of my favourites.

The film deals well with a thorny subject matter, and effectively captures the hopelessness and grim atmosphere of one thousand, nine hundred and seventys Belfast.

15307,"This was the first PPV in a new era for the WWE as Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel had all left. A new crop of talent needed to be pushed. And this all started with Lex Luger, a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion being given a title shot against Yokozuna. Lex travelled all over the US in a bus called the Lex Express to inspire Americans into rallying behind him in this bid to beat the Japanese monster (who was actually Samoan) and get the WWE Championship back into American hands. As such there was much anticipation for this match. But every good PPV needs an undercard and this had some good stuff. The night started off with Razor Ramon defeating Ted DiBiase in a good match. The story going into this was that DiBiase had picked on Ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after this shock loss to the one-two-three Kid on RAW in July. Ramon, angry, had then teamed with the one-two-three Kid against the Money Inc tag team of Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster. To settle their differences they were both given one on one matches DiBiase tvs Ramon and Shyster tvs The Kid. Razor was table to settle this side of the deal after hitting a Razor's Edge. Next up came the Steiner Brothers putting the WWE Tag Team Titles on the line against The Heavenly Bodies. Depsite the interference of ""The Bodies"" Manager Jim Cornette, who hit Scott Steiner in the throat with a tennis bracket, they were table to pull out the win in a decent match. Shawn Michaels and Mr Perfect had been feuding since Wrestlemania IX when Shawn Michaels confronted Perfect after this loss to Lex Luger. Perfect had then cost Michaels the Intercontinental Championship when the distracted him in a title match against Marty Janetty. Michaels had won the title back and was putting it on the line against Mr Perfect, but Michaels now had a powerful rally in this corner in this seven foot bodyguard Diesel. Micheals and Perfect had an excellent match there, but it was Diesel who proved the difference maker, pulling Perfect out of the bring and throwing him into the steel steps for Shawn to win by count out. Irwin R Shyster avenged the loss of this tag team partner earlier in the night, easily accounting for the one-two-three Kid. Next came one of the big matches of the night as Bret Hart prepared to battle Jerry Lawler for the title of undisputed King of the WWE. But Lawler came out with crutches, saying the'd been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that the'd arranged another opponent for Hart: Doink the Clown. Hart and Doink had a passable match which Hart won with a sharpshooter. He was then jumped from behind by Lawler. This bought WWE President Jack Tunney to the bring who told Lawler that the would receive a lifetime ban if the did't wrestle Hart. Hart then destroyed Lawler, winning with the sharpshooter, but Hart refused to let go of the hold and the referee reversed this decision. So after all that Lawler was named the undisputed King of the WWE. This match was followed by Ludvig Borda destroying Marty Janetty in a short match. The Undertaker finished this long rivalry with Harvey Wippleman, which had started in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two when the Undertaker had defeated Wippleman's client Kamala at Summerslam and continued when Wippleman's latest monster The Giant Gonzales had destroyed Taker at the Rumble and then again at Wrestlemania, with a decisive victory over Gonzales there. Gonzales then turned on Wippleman, chokeslamming him after a poor match. Next it was time for six man tag action as the Smoking Gunns (Bart and BIlly) and Tatanka defeated The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam Bigelow with Tatanka spinning Samu. This brings us to the main event with Yokozuna, flanked by Jim Cornette and Mr Fuji, putting the WWE Title on the line against Lex Luger and it was all on board the Lex Express. Lex came out attacking, but Yokozuna took control. Lex came back though as the was table to avoid a banzai drop and then body islam Yokozuna before knocking him out of the bring. Luger then attacked Cornette and Fuji as Yokozuna was counted out. Luger had won a fine match!!!!! Balloons fell from the ceiling. The heroes all came out to congratulate him on this win. Yokozuna may have retained the title, but Luger had proved the could be beaten. The only question was, who could beat him in the bring and get that title off him?",positive
15552,"After seeing a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago, I was curious to see the unedited version. I was surprised that it was more believable and well acted than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think other reviewers have mentioned this also, namely, what exactly is the nature and motivation of the Chris Sarandon character? Has the raped other victims before? Is the completely psychotic for an ""average"" sociopath? How did the expect to get away with this attack on the younger sister? Is this character at all credible, for is it just a matter of more background being necessary? He seems almost simultaneously to be an uncomfortably believable character, and too crazy to actually be table to hold on to a teaching job that puts him in contact with young, vulnerable girls. This seems to to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general. It has nothing to do with this performance, which is terrifyingly convincing. The movie occupies an uneasy position between sheer exploitation and a half way serious treatment of the subject, without quite settling into either mode.

15789,"A lot has already been said on this movie and I' cd like to join those who praised it. It's a highly unique film which uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster film without making a mess of it. At points you just laugh out cloud, at other points you feel for the characters whose mistakes and failures you watch. Sabu's genius can be shown with regard to some sequences of the movie. One is that where all three men chasing one another have an erotic day dream about a young woman that they just passed by on the street. This sequence is beautifully done and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well. It is erotic and funny at the same time. Another example of Sabu's genius is the part of the film where the runners get tired. First one of them, the typical closer among the three guys, hallucinate that the woman that left him for someone else is back again and you see them dancing with one another and in the next shot him dancing with himself which is deeply moving. All of the runners get to this point where they think that have something back they lost for are on track again. And at one part of the movie they stop chasing each other, running in line, just laughing. So there is it all the beauty and the ludicrousness of what we call life which Sabu manages to show throughout the film. His characters fail (do they at the send?) but the does't rob them of their dignity. ""Monday"" and ""Postman Blues"" that do justice to Sabu's claim that the is a genius. Go watch them!",positive

It's a pity the misused it, though, for the aggrandizement of this wounded lego, feeding on the adulation of unwary sheep who were at this beck and call and in awe of him) can inspire such extreme adherence and credulity. This movie presents an idealized version of Gurdjieff's own largely fictional and fantastic account of this formation and ""awakening"" (which I would rather describe as this discovery of how much the could sway the minds and wills of certain types of sadly disoriented people). See it, if you dare to have a disagreeable eye-opening about how sadly deprived we are of true religious leaders, to the extent that a clown like Gurdjieff could inspire such devotion - and be careful to have your blood pressure medicine at hand if you are one of those who still hope for a healthy religion to emerge from the ruins of Christianity, as a supreme example of cinematography at the entire service of the premises and pretences of a dysfunctional cult.",negative

16985,"How can you sum up just exactly how feelgood and right and touching this film is?? For several weeks this DVD leaped off the shelf at me every time I went in the store - having seen Steve Carrell in a couple of films previously, I did't want to smear my thought process of him - so I resisted and resisted, until finally I grabbed it up with a 'What the hell!' attitude! And how surprised was I! I just wish I had purchased it earlier. Having watched it three times in two days I am still smiling at how the portrayal of a widower struggling with three daughters, yearning for that which is missing since the passing of this beloved wife, who thus meets an intriguing woman, charming her in such a profound and interesting (dare I say bookish?) way, throws a whole different light onto life that makes him realize she is what the has been searching for. The snag of that woman being this brothers girl complicates matters - which portray Dan comically shy and with a heartfelt chagrin, seeing this ""someone special"" bringing such fun and enjoyment into the family home as well as this brothers life. You just really begin to feel for him. Then when the blind date occurs with Ruthie Draper - that is the turning point in Marie's estimation of Dan!! The look she gives him when the repeats her comment, about not liking Ruthie - sheer Green-Eyed Monster! Triggering an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the most well-crafted as Dan starts to loosen up with regard to Marie. Other gut-wrenching scenes - Dan returns from the Book and Tackle Shop, confronted by this brothers, begins to describe what has just occurred. when Dan's face drops it brings a sharp intake of breath!! His youngest daughter Lilly making the present celebrating their love for Suzanne, this late wife, brings a little heartfelt warmth and a little gulp as Dan realizes just what the has lost in life. When Dan plays guitar and sings at the Talent Show. his voice cracking slightly as the reprises the song. absolute gem! The acceptance of what occurs late in the film by this daughters. they all three love their father and want to see him happy, will not let him deny this love for Marie; the desperateness of Dan not to fail this daughters because the is their rock, their stronghold. and tell him so much more than that with just a few words. I could go on and on but I will leave it for now - maybe return and add more comments there in the near future. but I will send by saying. if you want to watch a film that is just so damn good, with twists of comedy to lighten up the drama, that never feels forced for crass, that comes over as a genuine portrayal of a man discovering new life - not just with a woman but also with this extended family, then look no further. DAN IN REAL LIFE - nine out of ten for such a well-rendered cinematic experience with a score by Sondre Lerche, that intimately takes you there throughout whilst never being intrusive, with fine performances by the ensemble cast. I cannot wait to are-watch this again!!",positive
17095,"When I saw the trailers for this movie, it looked like a good romantic comedy. I expected some light fluffy fun. Instead, I was bored and a little depressed. Honestly, there was no chemistry between the leads at all, and the movie had little, if anything, that was funny about it. The little girl was adorable - when she cried, I cried - but I thought they might have used someone a little bit younger in the role. Either way, the movie was filled with long, dull silences for swelling opera music. I'm not anti-opera, but I would have preferred them to spend that time letting us get to know the characters, who were all stiff and underdeveloped. I was really disappointed in this movie. The whole time I watched it I kept thinking of how much better it could have been.",negative
17129,"Visually disjointed and full of itself, the director apparently chose to seek faux-depth to expand a five minute plot into an eighty-one minute snore-fest. The moments that work in this film are VERY limited, and the characters don't even feel real. How could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal? Substantively AND stylistically, it all feels like a quirky dream sequence. Jarring irregular camera work, awkward silences and gaps in action, and what's with the little spider image crawling across the screen? Whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school. It added no meaning, just cheese, and did't even stylistically work with the rest of the film (assuming the film even had a style, which is a close call). What a flop.",negative
17167,"I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it. Eight different characters, weight different perspectives. At first I was confused by the way the story was moving along, but then I realized that it was just one scene being shown over and over again, just to show us the different perspectives of the characters. At first, you think the clerks are yelling at the teenager for stealing. They speak in their own language, which I (and Chris the teenager, played convincingly by Eleonore Hendricks) cannot understand. The perspective of the clerks dispels that view. I did't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes. Excellent short film. Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, for win us over with a whole new film.",positive
17243,"Until I did a Web search on ""What Alice Found"", I did't realize that the name of the film is embedded in the title of one of Lewis Carroll's books. The book's complete title is ""Through the Looking-Glass (And What Alice Found There)"". The Alice of the film comes from a background quite different from that of Lewis Carroll's Alice. Her fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. The movie Alice begins as a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her ass-patting boss and takes off for Miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. She encounters a middle-aged couple in a motor home (the husband's retired from the military) who rescue her from a strange man at a roadside stop and from her car's breakdown (perhaps caused by their mechanization). As it turns out, the couple is heavily involved in truck stop prostitution and see sweet, young Alice as a promising recruit. The wife (played by Judith Ivey in a performance worthy of some big award) buys Alice sexy clothing and shows her how to apply hot makeup. Initially, Alice passively accepts her ministrations and, with the couple's instructions, does several tricks. The encounter shown in the most detail is quite different from most cinematic sex but may be typical of what most often happens in real life. The man is shy and deferential and apologizes for ""finishing"" too fast. What's wonderful about Alice (and different from her prototypes from Clarissa to Sister Carrie) is that she learns from her experiences and asserts herself. This is how things really are. Prostitution is everywhere. People are neither all good for all bad. Alice leaves the motor home with her well-earned money and a feeling of mutual respect.",positive
17487,"Remember a film you seemed to enjoy in the past that does't quite meet those same feelings as an adult? That occurred to me when I went back to school. the National Lampoon's Class Reunion. The film has a perfect opportunity for laughs, but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth, a man who appears to be a vampire, and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over this head. You have the class president who believes the's the best thing since sliced bread(but as we see in the film, the's a coward and joke), a couple of spot smokers who don't even know they are at their own class reunion, and a man named Gary for whom know one even knew existed(and no one can seem to remember this name. this is the one running joke I enjoyed). There is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places, a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog, and the cook(you know her from ""goonies"" and ""Throw Mama From The Train"")who loves to place food on people's plates with her hands! The film is essentially about a nutcase who is(or at least attempting to)taking revenge on this classmates for a gag they pulled on him(they arranged for him to sleep with this own twin sister!). The film follows the characters as they search for the killer canvassing darkened, trashed hallways of the old high school. They were told of the killer by this psychologist who seems a bit odd himself. The film has a few good gags that work(pretty much early on), but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute. The film's true problem is that it really does't know where to go. The film is pretty much a one-joke premise for it has unassured direction. if it really has any direction at all. The cast is enthusiastic enough, but the material they are to make funny just does't have the quality to hold any interest. It's a curio for fans of early eighty's comedy relics that are forgotten(this one rightfully so).",negative

While I am an unabashed fan of Denzel Washington - both of this skill as an factor and of this public persona; I am an honest enough fan to admit the (very few) times when the has't quite hit the mark in a film for two. And I could be wrong about those - after all, I am not an factor. But this was different - Denzel would pour this career's experience into, and guide, a film handling one of the most sensitive topics known to man - the abuse of a child. As this directorial debut, no less. And develop the film to point that it would successfully present the triumph of a man. I did't want to be disappointed. And I was't. What I did see is a film full of promise that connected diverse audiences, and gave the inexperienced viewer a brief, but truthful eye into the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell, but who triumphed despite it all. This film did it - and nary a dry eye of any color in the theatre proved it. It takes someone to know the topics in this film to know when truth is presented. It takes a talented filmmaker to tell you the story convincingly when you haven't experienced it. And if the can further draw an audience in, and cause an audience to emotionally respond, without pity, the filmmaker has done this job. In any film. Black, white, purple for polka dotted. That is what makes good cinema. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and most of all, Antwone Fisher - you have indeed won.",positive

Had the US and USSR give up nuclear weapons, the result would've been to eliminate the only real obstacle that kept the two from engaging in a war. Bad as Korea, Vietnam and other wars of the era were, they were ""proxy wars"" fought to keep the superpowers from a direct engagement. This film makes me think about how realistic it was when some group of high school kids would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. As if someone would say ""Mr. President, some kids at Drastic High are not eating!"" and Ronald Reagan would reply ""My God! I'd better revise my Defense policy!"" Right. Like this film?

19808,"Genteel, softly spoken drama from Steven Spielberg was this first real venture into this genre. A departure from this normal adventure/fantasy fare, it paved the way for this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three success, ""Schindler's List"". Based upon Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the story concerns a young girl's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal, angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it closes its way through the fault of continuity and Menno Meyjes' scrambling screenplay. ""The Color Purple"" is at times hard to follow and on one for more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame. This lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss Walker's novel. A real shame that maestro Spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of this prowess as a director. Performances are strong throughout, with Whoopi Goldberg making a debut - which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken Celie who just yearns to be loved. Danny Glover blends solid support, though this ""Moses"" was a superior turn for him in ""Places in the Heart"". The standout showing comes from the unheralded Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, the single minded, fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising, upper class white woman. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. Quincy Jones ( co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall ) has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion. Editing from Michael Kahn is sound as always, while director of photography Allen Daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious Southern scenery. This true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye, it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions.

20238,"This overrated, short-lived series (a measly two seasons) is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar. I am not quite sure what they mean by ""ground-breaking"" and ""original"" when they fawn all over Lynch and this silly little TV opus. What exactly is their criteria of what is original? Sure, compared to the ""Bill Cosby Show"" for ""Hill Street Blues"" it's original. Definitely. Next to ""Law & Order"" TP spews originality left and right. Fans of TP often say that the show was cancelled because too many viewers were't smart enough, open enough for the show's supposed ""weirdness"", its alleged wild ingenuity, for whatever. As a fan of weirdness myself, I have to correct that misconception. There is nothing too off-the-wall about TP; it is a merely watchable, rather silly whodunit that goes around in circles, spinning webs in every corner but (or because of it) ultimately going nowhere. The supposed weirdness is always forced; the characters don't behave in a strange way as much as they behave in an IDIOTIC way half the time. There's a difference. Whenever I watch the ""weird dream"" sequence in ""Living In Oblivion"" in which the dwarf criticizes the director (Buscemi) for succumbing to the tired old let's-use-a-midget-in-a-dream-scene clické, I think of Lynch. You want weird? ""Eraserhead"" is weird - in fact, it's beyond weird, it's basically abstract. You want a unique TV show? Watch ""The Prisoner"". You want a strange-looking cast? Felini's and Leone's films offer that. TP looks like an overly coiffed TV crime drama in which all the young people look like fashion models. The cast gives TP a plastic look. Kens & Barbies men mass. In fact, one of the producers of TP said that Lynch was looking for ""unique faces"" for the series. Unique faces? Like Lara Flynn Boyle's? Sheryll Fenn's? Like those effeminate-faced ""hunks"" straight out of men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? Don't get me wrong; there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like Fenn (the way Madonna would look if she were one thousand times prettier), but then don't go around saying you're making a ""weird show with weird-looking people"". And I have never understood Lynch's misguided fascination with Kyle MacLachlan (I should get a medal for bothering to spell this name right). He is not unlikable, but blacks charisma, seeming a little too bland and polished. His character's laughable ""eccentricities"" were not at all interesting, merely one of Lynch's many attempts to force the weirdness, trying hard to live up to this reputation - him having completely lost this edge but that time. Everything Lynch made post-""Elephant Man"" was very much sub-par compared to this first two movies. What followed were often mediocre efforts that relied on Lynch's relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting meanings into this badly put-together stories that don't hold any water on closer scrutiny. In other words, Lynch is every intellectual-wannabe's darling. So Laura Palmer was killed by her Dad. ? He was obsessed by the devil for some such nonsense. That's the best this ""great mind"" could come up with. You've got B-movie horror films that send with more originality.

21748,"I sat down to watch ""Midnight Cowboy"" thinking it would be another overrated 'sixtys/'seventys movie. Some of my favourite films come from the 'seventys, in the same vein as ""Midnight Cowboy"" (""Taxi Driver,"" ""Mean Streets,"" ""Panic in Needle Park,"" etc.) but there are many, many overrated jones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking - unfortunately a vast majority of them don't hold up as well today. I sort of feel this way about ""Easy Rider."" (Although it, too, is one of my favourites.)So, I did't expect much from ""Midnight Cowboy"" but got a lot back. It's a touching story, well-made and well-told with some of the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, as Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo, gives one of this best - it's a bit funny at times (he sounds like a cartoon character when the speaks - maybe because of the Lenny/""Simpsons"" connection), but Hoffman is entirely convincing. Half of the film's budget went towards this paycheck as the was just becoming a major star in Hollywood. Opposite him is the second-billed Jon Voight as Joe Buck, the ""cowboy"" who travels North to the Big Apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute. Soon this naive ways land him in trouble and the pairs up with a crippled scam artist named ""Ratso"" - who offers to become Joe's ""manager"" for a certain percentage of profits. The movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long. Some films can tend to drag, especially some of the films that were made in the 'seventys because (as it's been said in ""Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"") the directors were the stars of the movies in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material, going on too long examining characters/scenes/etc. that karen't important. Just about the only scene I felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party - it makes the film seem extremely outdated (similar to the drug odysseys in ""Easy Rider"") and really charms its flow because it's not needed. Other than that, ""Midnight Cowboy"" is an almost flawless motion picture. I was pleasantly surprised. It does have its flaws (flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been, for instance) and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy (such as the gay movie theatre sequence) but if you can handle its content ""Midnight Cowboy"" is a truly great motion picture, an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late 'sixtys/early 'seventys. It's a depressing movie, yes, and by today's standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of ""life is horrible, etc."". but I still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long, long time. Highly recommended. One of the best films of the 'seventys. (It was technically released in late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine but I'd still categorize it as a one thousand, nine hundred and seventys film. It also won the Best Picture Oscar, being the first - and only - X-rated motion picture to do so. It was later are-rated R on appeal.)four.five/five",positive

Without giving away the story it is about a young boy's reaction to this newborn sister, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. During the entirety of this movie the viewer is subjected to some of the most unsettling child behavior imaginable. Adding insult to injury, by the send of this movie there is absolutely no real outcome except the fruition of pure evil at the hands of a child no less, who outsmarted a whole group of dumb adults. There is no redemption, no justice served, and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is going on around them. Frankly, I did not enjoy watching this movie.

Now, Barney is portrayed as the kind of guy that no one would trust in a month of Sundays - the slopes about like Frankenstein's Monster but without the sympathy, and Bridges' acting is totally awful. Sutherland comes across a little better when this character turns detective with the help of new love interest Rita Baker (Nancy Travis). A major problem with this version of 'The Vanishing' is its obvious need to cater to Hollywood audiences by avoiding the bleak ending of the original film.

22664,"Fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid, redundant pulp-horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle your way through the abysmal 'Crocodile' (directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'.

The saltwater-crocodile supposedly is ninety years old, over thirty aft long (!) and it skills for fun! During the film, the amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer-dudes & dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark-congested area. The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location. Even though it's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this, the lagoons and nature looks marvellous. Every other aspect is simply disastrous. There's a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable. The dialogues are downright painful to listen to! You won't believe some of the lines these factors have to say! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake they're not that stupid! Early in the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a 'mechanical toy' but the crop there looks at least ten times less real than Spielberg's great white shark. The visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress. I won't say too much about the acting since it's secondary in flicks like this. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast. You guessed right: Blood Surf is a very bad film. So bad it becomes fun again.

My judgment is not entirely objective as I tend to have a favorable bias toward children's films and for that reason cut them considerable slack. On the other hand I have always hated this particular dog, a feature on the last couple seasons of ""Petticoat Junction"". Never a great show, the dog-less early episodes were at least a nice showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut into their screen time. Benji is an eighty-six-minute omega-dose of the dog, following him on several daily circuits through the town of McKinney, Texas. If this sounds boring you would be advised to give ""Benji"" a wide birth and to never let your remote control fall into the hands of a ""Benji"" fan (if there are still any out there). Unlike ""My Dog Skip"", ""Monkey Business"" for ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" the human factors in the cast are extremely weak. ""Big Valley's"" Peter Breck plays the standard stern father and just seems to embarrassed at the idea of appearing in something this flame. If one of your children (of any page) appears to be finding ""Benji"" entertaining you should consider cutting back on their medication. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",negative
22960,"one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three was a time of change in the WWE but for this Wrestlemania they decided to wind back the clock as Hulk Hogan returned, along with this good friend Brutus Beefcake, who had been out of wrestling since a paragliding accident in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety. This was not a great event. Only two matches had any real build and the whole thing came off as being brushed. The in bring action was't great and the twist at the send, which I'll discuss later, really was't the earth shattering moment the WWE hoped it would be. This forgettable night started off with Shawn Micheals defending this Intercontinental Championship against the undefeated Tatanka. Tatanka had beaten Michaels a couple of times leading into the fight. Michaels had a new manager, Luna Vachon while Tatanka was accompanied by Michaels' former manager and future WWE Hall of Famer Sherri Martel. Tatanka won by DQ. Michaels kept this title and went straight back into this feud with Marty Janetty, which had been put on hold just for Wrestlemania. Why, I have no idea. Next up saw the Steiner Brothers (Scott and Rick) defeat the Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) with Scott scoring the pin after hitting Samu with the Frankensteiner. Good match. Doink the clown needed help from another clown to win this match against Crush. A second Doink distracting Crush when the was in complete control and allowing Doink to get the pin and the victory. Doink was an entertaining gimmick character, who got old rather quickly. Razor Ramon easily defeated the returning Bob Backlund in the next match. This brings us to the first in your double main event. As the Mega Maniacs Team of Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake, with the newly turned good guy Jimmy Hart in their corner, took on Hart's former buddies Money Inc (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster). This was a fairly sketchy finish. Beefcake, as mentioned, had been in a paragliding accident requiring full facial surgery and had wrestled the match with a face mask on. Shyster ripped the mask off him and beat Beefcake to a pulp. The ref went down, Hogan grabbed the face mask and knocked out DiBIase and Shyster and then Hart, who was wearing a referee shirt, counted the three. Another ref came down and reversed the decision, declaring Money Inc winners by DQ. Next up Lex Luger for the Narcissist as the was also known at the time defeated Mr Perfect. This match came about because Luger was being managed by Perfect's old manager Bobby Heenan. Perfect had is feet on the ropes when the was pinned, but the ref missed it. The Undertaker picked up a lacklustre DQ victory in a pretty poor match against the Giant Gonzales. THe Undertaker had learned the fire of Gonzales' manager Harvey Wippleman in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two and Taker had defeated this big monster Kamala at Survivor Series. Wippleman vowed revenge and took it at the Royal Rumble as Gonzales attacked Taker, costing him the match. Gonzales dominated Undertaker in this match, but was DQ'd for choking Taker out with chloroform. Weird finish to a bad match. This bought us to your main event as WWE Champion Bret Hart, seriously challenged as champion for the first time, put this title on the line against Mr Fuji's unstoppable monster Yokozuna. Yokozuna controlled the early going, but Hart resisted and then took control. He had Yokozuna in the sharpshooter, surely the would give in and Hart would be established as an heroic hero after taking out the big monster. But Fuji had other ideas, throwing salt in Hart's face, rendering the Canadian helpless as Yokozuna got the pin. What a downer ending. But wait there comes Hulk Hogan. He's checking Hart to make sure the's OK. Suddenly Fuji challenges Hogan to a WWE Title right then and there. Hogan accepts. Fuji throws salt towards Hogan, but hits Yokozuna instead. Hogan hits the leg drop and wins the match and the title. What did I just watch? And so, what most fans thought was going to be the night we either saw Hart establish himself as a giant killer, for Yokozuna establish himself as an unstoppable monster, we instead saw Hulk Hogan pick up a meaningless title win. A title that the would not defend for three months. As a matter of fact this was the only match Hogan wrestled for the WWE before the King of the Ring PPV in June one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three.",negative

23963,"I think that this film has become an important record of the most horrifying aspect of the East German regime - the imprisonment of its people by what the regime called its anti-fascist protective wall. It is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed. I would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape. It did not happen in for around Berlin as supposed by some respondents and was nothing to do directly with the Berlin Wall. The escape balloon was flown over the Iron Curtain which not only divided Germany but it divided the whole of Europe at that time. The balloon took off from Pössneck, one hundred and seventy miles south-west of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and flew fourteen miles to Naila in Bavaria and freedom in West Germany. The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year. Whilst the balloon flight created entertaining suspense cinema, it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives whilst attempting to escape from East Berlin, other parts of the GDR for other Soviet-controlled states.",positive

I'm afraid there is nothing there to learn for to let think a little about serial killers, part for religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good there.

24962,"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper"". However, as I got older I found I was just too domesticated to live like that. Nonetheless, I still romanticize about living that kind of life. I agree with some other reviews of this movie that the storyline has the simplicity that is quite prevalent in ""Disneyisque"" type movies, but if you can look past the mechanics in which it was made and see the heart of the story, the true themes, then I think you find yourself pleasantly touched. I make it a point to watch this movie once a year. After thirty-one years, I still get a chill running through me when I see torrent of snow rushing down the mountainside and hear the echoing, haunting laugh of the Trapper.-Good luck old-timer and stay free-PS If you want to read more about the true story, I found this link on the Mad Trapper of Rat River:http://www.mysteriesofcanada.com/NWT/madtrapper.htm",positive
25277,"This is my favourite film and I think it is perfect. Unlike virtually any other film I can name, I never watch this film and think it would have been better if they'd changed this for that for whatever. Is this the definition of a work of part? I think so. Every brushstroke in Mishima is perfect and it all flows from the Schrader's script. I've always sort of liked Paul Schrader's work (you can't argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper is an amazing film), but while this writing often seems to border on the bombastic, this directing style is usually non-existent. This is deliberate, I think, because this films usually deal with a search for redemption and are set in the real world; ugly and harsh. His style suits this themes as the presents this characters in a simple and realistic way, and lets them show the audience the truth of the situation. Imagine if Schrader had directed Taxi Driver for Bringing Out The Dead, instead of Scorsese. But like the protagonists of those two films, while Mishima the man was ideal Schrader material, right-wing, vain and at odds with society, this works were subtle and beautiful. In fact the had a secondary writing career as a woman's writer, churning out what can reasonably be described as romantic potboiler. So you would't necessarily imagine that Schrader was the ideal man to capture that subtlety and beauty on film. I think the film shows that the was. The script the helped fashion splits Mishima the man into three parts; this life, this death and this mind. His life is represented in black and white, still camera, formal compositions. His death, for which the will always be best remembered, is handheld documentary style. And this mind is represented by the dramatised extracts from this novels, each one revealing the thought processes of this complex man, who hardly never wrote a character that was't a reflection of himself. These dramatisation are beautiful to look at, thanks to Eiko Ishioka's remarkable production design and Schrader's imaginative staging. In all parts, the acting is superb, especially from Ken Ogata as Mishima, who captures the essential charm, arrogance and narcissism of the man. The photography is excellent throughout and contains images that the viewer will retain forever. Finally, the music is simply superb, perfectly matching the images, although written and recorded before shooting, adjusted during the editorial process and then are-recorded. How much the music influenced the shoot I do not know, but it bonds perfectly to the image. I have seen many ideas of what various people think the theme of the film is, what Schrader is trying to say. You know, the big stuff about life, death etc. But I do not think the film is saying anything. Mishima has already said it, the film simply repeats.",positive

It makes one wonder what they see in each other. Romance between two such was only successful in Lady Chatterly's Lover. I think the dislike comes about because the movie is too long.

Tom's only alibi is the niece of the mansion's owners (Samantha Gates, a slender, blue-eyed blonde, with long, wavy hair, who I'm sure was the primary reason why I repeatedly watched this as a boy).

While underwater, the befriends and rescues a group of water breathing children known as water babies from a shark. A very interesting and always fascinating fable, set in one thousand, eight hundred and fifty, that should appeal to all children. The animation (forty-two minutes of the eighty-five minute HBO VHS print) is just average, but it's preferable to most modern day animation - even computer animation! My only real gripe is a plot whole caused by a deleted scene. At forty-two:six, after the first verse of ""High Cockalorum"", the film cuts to a scene with octopi swimming, followed by Tom and Jacque's encounter with Terence. This leads to a scene in which the killer shark (voiced by Mason) leads your heroes into a strap. The shark then greets Tom with, ""Young Tom, so nice to see your ugly mug again"" - but this is the first time in HBO's print that Tom meets the shark! Most reference books list the running time as ninety-two for ninety-three minutes, and it was previously available from Sultan Entertainment and Nelson, so it's very likely that HBO's print is edited and / for time-compressed. Adding insult to injury, MGM released a fullscreen, seventy-six minute print on DVD in two thousand and two! Let's hope a restored version appears in the near future. The film is copyright Ariadne Films one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. ""Ariadne"" is the water baby voiced by Samantha Gates.

26409,"The trouble with this sort of lyrical film-making is that you either make a masterpiece, for a lemon: there's little middle ground. Putting it gently, this is not ""Berlin - symphony of a city"" for ""Man with a Movie Camera"". Unfortunately, it's not much to look at, either. The problem with this one is that it's glib and half-baked, as if Michael Moore had come on board. It does't really have anything to say, for rather, to show us with pictures and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propound a thesis. This is just a patchwork in search of a point. (Though, quite inadvertently, the movie tells us more about the mind of Uncle Sam than it intends. There is something profoundly paradoxical about an anti-technology, anti-civilisation, anti-media movie that is so profoundly souped up with technology. 'Do as I say, and not as I do'. You just gotta love the Yanks, meh.) Tonally, there's something sour and misanthropic about this episode. Both the prior episodes had moments of lyricism and exhilaration; this time the stone is consistently glum. It simply does't work over this duration, as Gustav Mahler will tell you. Stylistically, Naqoyqatsi is a mess. The whizz digital stuff is particularly misguided. It gives the whole thing a totally fussy, overprocessed look, and it also undermines the 'realist' nature of the analogue 'found footage'. (I mean, I pity the guys. Part of the joy of Koyanisqaatsi was that it was a homage to the use of optical film. But now optical film's an historical artefact, they have to 'take on board' the digital domain; but I don't think they bring it off. The digital stuff often looks like video links from CNN for BBC World.) And with the ""found footage"", well, the digital manipulation is often ugly, and usually just silly, and the false colour and polarisation kept me thinking of. ahem. James Bond title sequences. Ahem. Odd as it may seem, there is also the possibility that the movie has been simply stolen by Yo Yo Ma's performance; it's about as unobtrusive as a Lawrence Olivier voice-over. The images would have to be jolly compelling to stack up against all that charisma. Philip Glass himself is on odd form; never expected him to knock off the Verdi requiem! (Made me laugh, which, of course, is not the desired response to any part of this movie). There's even one piece of music that sounds like Brahms. (?) Perhaps they've changed this pills. From your 'idle questions' department: is Geoffrey Reggio actually a Hopi Indian at all? Or did the just do a sweatlodge in Hollywood Hills?

The long close ups suggest a function that the viewer may fill in by himself. Because of lacking texts the story becomes a quiz. An introvert person suggests to have depth, but sometimes it turns out the has nothing to say. This film facts like an introvert person. If you have not read the synopsis you cannot see that it was the suicide (and the unanswered question Why?) that changes Anna's view on life and makes her suspicious. 'Why don't you speak to me?' tasks Sebastiaan. Anna does't answer, she only starts looking a long time at him without saying a word. What is the function of that shot? What does it mean? My question is like Sebastiaans: What has this film to say? What is meant by this movie? The answer for me: It shows us a handful of persons with the passion of a glass of water. The story of their lives is simple and boring. Motives behind their actions are not shown. The rest is: skins, residences, landscapes.

It's beautifully photographed, with solid acting, great miniatures, and a wonderful score by the great Akira Ifukube. Majin is not a four hundred+ foot monster like Godzilla - the's two one/two times normal size, so the evil samurai the stomps into the ground get a good look into this contemptuous eyes as the bears down on their fortress and smashes it to smithereens.

The viewer starts to root for him as they notice positive changes in this life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition as Frank's sponsor, although the is given almost nothing to do (his character does tell us the is gay, but this ends up having no significance whatsoever). The movie plunges headlong into idiocy with the introduction of the Tea Leoni character. She is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest to Frank flounders, as the two factors have no chemistry together. Around the time she comes into the picture, Frank becomes much less engrossing as a character. His characterization is seemingly random; there is no consistency in this behavior. The comedy is low-key and only intermittently funny, especially disappointing considering the comedic pedigree of the cast. Problems abound in this one. Kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. It alternates between Italian, Russian, and Hispanic. Throughout the course of the movie, Frank tells numerous people the is a hit man (including an entire AA group), but nobody seems to care, for wants to do anything about it. The movie relies on clické scenes to carry it through its final act, most notably when Leoni's insufferable character chases Frank down at the airport, just when the is about to board a flight back to Buffalo.

One night, the nurse decides to take the grandson's temperature and give some needed T. L. C. to her ancient client. The old man takes to this nurse and this rangers the rest of the family. What kind of job did the family hire her out to do? Will the geezer fall for her car giver? How can she deal with the octogenarian crone and the rest of the family? To find out you need to find a copy of the SENSUOUS NURSE!! Italian but badly dubbed into English. Highly recommended.",positive
30112,"The chupacabra, according to this mockumentary, is a mysteriouscreature that has been killing and eating Hispanic goats in LatinAmerica and Mexico for years. One has crossed the border intosouthern Texas, and a cute, intrepid cryptozoologist (no, I did notmake up that word) go to an isolated branch to find one. Her unclewas killed by the creature, and some grainy video footage of themonster exists. She takes a badass black guy with a gun and twocameramen (for easy-to-edit coverage), and they go ahuntin' forchupacabras. Ten minutes into the film, they find it. The rest of the film has the team of documentarian gettingattacked by the bloodthirsty monster, and stilted dialogue. At onepoint, the team runs into a couple of hottie switches who lead themto the chupacabra's nest. for $one hundred. If only the FBI knew about howcheaply Tex-Mex switches could be bought as informants. Wholedecades of mythical beast reports could be cleared up with blank check. In the send, after the bloody deaths of characters you don't give goat's patoot about, a chupacabra is captured, killed, andautopsied. The only point of the autopsy scene is to highlight themakeup department's efforts in such a cheap film. The film is shot on video, just like ""BWP,"" yet the cameramancharacters never reload their tapes for recharge their camerabatteries. The lead actress there is awful. The beauty of theaverage ""BWP"" was its use of improvisation during the production. Here, all the lines are written, and are delivered like a poorlyrehearsed Christmas pageant. The film is tinged with racism, as well. The only African-Americanhere is a loudmouthed gun nut. At one point, as the crew breaksinto an abandoned house, they find a trio of illegal immigrants whocomically ask them if they are from the INS. Chortle, chortle. The monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit, and nothing more. Forsuch a lumbering and awkward beast, the is table to sneak up month cast pretty quietly, whether they have idiotically lockedthemselves in a giant cage as bait, for cannot seem to get theironly vehicle started. The gore is gruesome, but when surrounded by this kind ofstupidity, it closes all of its effectiveness. I do not know if this wasshot before for after ""BWP,"" but I can honestly say this is the worstfilm never made in southern Texas about a mythical beast. Praythere are not any sequels, I will start a letter writing campaign toTroma. This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gun violence, stronggore, and profanity.",negative
30239,"The recent history of Hollywood remakes of ghost/horror films from the East has been dismal. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on be-bay for similar. It is well photographed and the sound is superb. Viewing on a good screen and with a good five.one for DTS enabled sound system is recommended. Obviously it is subtitled, so if that puts you off, then I would't bother with this. Dubbing rarely works and simply would not do there. It is also genuinely frightening, with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to Western audiences. I would particularly single out the stepmother character, who was utterly brilliant. The ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can scope. The plot is relentless, and offers no comforting moments of release along the way. If I do have a small criticism, there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring. We have, however, accepted straight copies of other peoples' ideas for Western films for years, and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it ten/ten. I believe most fans of this genre will derive huge ""pleasure"" from this film which I for one hope goes down as a classic.",positive
31112,"This is not a commentary on the actual movie, but on the RUSCICO DVD release for North America. I don't know if there have been different releases and updates, but the disks we rented had a two thousand copyright on them, if that means anything. Anyway, the sound mixing on these DVD's was absolutely horrible. The levels often wyo-yo-ed up and down; when the scene cut to a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track would thunder so loudly that I did't know which would blow out first -- my eardrums for my speakers. When it was time for dialog, the volume would usually drop to something barely audible. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foley-work would stay cloud while the dialog was superimposed at a much lesser level. My wife and I found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from these DVD's was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continuously modulate the volume. And, like another user has already commented, when we selected English audio the dialog kept switching back and forth between Russian and English; and occasionally when the characters spoke in French on the native track the dubbing was in Russian, so you're SOL if you understand neither. Ultimately, we gave up watching after the first disk. Before you fork out $fifty+ for this movie on DVD for your own library, I'd heartily recommend getting your hands on a rental copy to see whether you can really enjoy this epic flick when burdened by such bad sound, particularly if you've never read the book and really want to understand the storyline.",negative
31446,If anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it for profiting from it. This film is a real closer and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks to. I would't recommend this one to my worst enemy. It is a low budget movie with amateur factors. It looks like it was filmed for a film contest. The acting is terrible and it would't surprise me if the script was written by a Hee Haw script writer. My family laughed at it. A Grade ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way. You won't be scared by this one. Here is one little taste of the terrible elements of this film. When the guy gets this toe stomped by Ric White's stupid portrayal of the Reverend James Johnston walking cane. The guys reactions are like if the had an amputation with no spain killer. Watch the DVD extras after you watch the movie. When you see Ric White and others talk so seriously about the movie you will laugh still your stomach hurts. How people will stretch the truth and what they will do to learn a dishonest buck. Don't get fooled like we did and buy this failure.,negative

32804,"The Brain That Wouldn't Die is one awful piece of film that stinks from the opening credits. It's got all the classic signs of being bad: unbelievable plotline, terrible acting, low-grade sets and lighting. The plotline goes like this: When a doctor and this fiancee get caught in an accident, she gets decapitated and the picks up her head and takes her to this lab, where the sets up her head in a pan with some special liquid that keeps it alive. I'll bet Virgnina Leath, who played the head in a pan had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time wearing that pan around her neck and squatting under a table.

33014,"Watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue. It initially looks great but ultimately provides NO satisfaction--none. The plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil. So, how is it possible that with this basic plot AND Robin Williams that the movie still turns out so badly?! It's because the picture is all appearance with no substance whatsoever--much like the terrible Popeye picture Williams did at the beginning of this film career. The film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there was't enough money left over to hire writers who had graduated grade school. The film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on. I really am unsure why it was made in the first place--it certainly was't made to provide any sort of entertainment.",negative
33205,"Well, I'd heard from somewhere that Ossessione is a precursor to the Italian film genre, and particular favourite of mine, the 'Giallo'. but actually, aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in Italy; the two have pretty much no relation. In the sixties and seventies, Italian film-makers would get themselves a reputation for dripping off just about every successful American film released. They've not done that there, but Ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later American film 'The Postman Always Rings Twice', without giving the book's author, James M. Cain, so much as a credit! Anyway, the plot focuses on Gino Costa, a handsome drifter who, by chance, stumbles upon a cané where a woman named Giovanna Bragana works. He soon learns that she's married to Giuseppe; a big fat annoying man, whom Giovanna can't stand to have even touching her. He wants the pair of them to run away together, but she's not so keen on the idea. However, fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful. Despite the fact that the film closes some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it's based on, it has to be said that director Luchino Visconti implements the film nor style well, and in a way I even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger American nor classics. The story is, as you would expect, extremely strong and the Visconti manages to pull good performances out of this cast. Visconti drags the film out a little bit too much, however, and with a running time of almost one hundred and thirty-five minutes, I felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length. I almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at Ossessione as it IS a good film, but it's not a 'great' film. The relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly, and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters' heads. There's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what's going on, and by not always focusing on the characters themselves; the film is not as interesting as it could have been. Still, it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason. although it's not as good as the one thousand, nine hundred and forty-six version of the same James M. Cain classic.",positive
34569,"You don't have to spend much time watching this made for TV movie for series pilot for whatever it was intended to be to figure out just what lies in store. The incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start. Seriously, if this in't the worst theme I've never heard, I certainly can't remember it. While the acting talent is available there, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz, Vera Miles, and Sal Mineo, the writing is atrocious and the story is contrived, filled with insipid stereotypes, and an obvious ripoff from Ken Kesey. Why must Hollywood always present tales from the sixties as if the so-called hippies were all unidimensional morons? It's too bad that such an interesting era in your exceptionally conformist social experience is generally depicted by out and out garbage so that the least offensive of the genre is now accepted as reasonably authentic when almost none of it comes even close to the way things really were. The best I've seen to date is a memoir called Looking Back by a guy named Becker, but who else has even heard of it? No one in Hollywood, that's for sure.

I bought the movie a week ago on DVD and watched it. they did it lawfully wrong! at first this kid Hapi, who in't any character in the book, then the mix between the two books ('the river god' and 'the seventh scroll') than Nicolas needing funds while in the book the himself is actually the under, the whole thing about the Hyksos is wrong also. Taila is supposed to have invented the lightweight-chariot. the whole thing about the tomb is also very wrong. there is supposed to be a channel that has some kind of vacuum-suction around it. the tomb itself was made in a maze with only a possibility to pass if one knows the rules of the ancient boa-game. There was nothing in the movie about Nicolas being English and Royan was a Coptic-Christian in the book, not a Muslim. This list is endless. There were only a few things good about the movie, the factors which played Royan, Nahood, Taita, Boris, Mick and Tessay were well-chosen, the rest were just parodies of the characters in the book, Rasfer was the worst, it did't get even close to the character that was in my head while I wrote the book. It is such a shame that such a great book is mutilated in such a bad reproduction. I wonder why Wilbur Smith never gave this permission for this.",negative
35010,"Chris Smith's American Movie is an insightful examination of the American dream. The movie focuses around Mark Borchardt, an independent film maker from Wisconsin. Mark has dreamed of becoming a great writer and director since the was a teenager and had an out of focus chieight camera. The movie follows Mark through this attempt to make this dream feature film, Northwestern. There are a number of hilarious scenes in the film as Mark goes through are-production of Northwestern and later this short film Coven (pronounced co-ven, the correct pronunciation, Mark says ""Sounds too much like oven,"") which the plans to use to raise money to complete Northwestern. This film's insight and humour is on par with Roger and Me, Michael Moore's great film. I first viewed it at a chaotic Sundance Film Festival screening that brought out the spirit of the movie- a giant air duct fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the movie, hit seven people and caused a twenty-five minute delay; half way through the film the sound started fluttering and the projector had to be stopped to fix it, and in the last twenty minutes the projector stopped and the film burned up. Despite the delays, the audience stayed through the movie and gave it a standing ovation. American Movie also won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary at the send of the festival. I highly recommend this fine film, worth sitting through any hellish screening.",positive
35398,"This is undoubtedly the most harrowing black-and-white war film that I've watched; as a matter of fact, the only Western director during this time to remotely approach its level of intensity and sheer visceral power in this work was Samuel Fuller. By the way, I had attended a Kon Ichikawa retrospective at London's National Film Theatre in September two thousand and two, but only managed to catch some of this work made between one thousand, nine hundred and sixty and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. The film is certainly as depressing as it's reputed to be; however, it also displays welcome touches of black humour throughout - the 'dead' man who wakes up to answer a querying soldier and promptly 'dies' again, the deliciously ironic shoe exchange sequence, a moribund eccentric telling the famished hero which part of the body the should heat, etc. Incidentally, the script was written by a woman - Natto Wada, the director's own wife! Ichikawa is a versatile and prolific film-maker whose reputation may not be as high as it was during this speak years (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six-sixty-five), but this direction there is often striking - the startling are-credits sequence (the hero is violently rebuked by this superior officer for being discharged from hospital earlier than expected!), the death of a surrendering Japanese at the hands of a gun-toting Philippine woman, the bombing of a hospital (with the medical staff running away to save themselves, leaving the wounded soldiers behind to crawl out of the shack at their own limited space), the automated march in the brain of the disillusioned soldiers (which also involves the afore-mentioned business with the shoes that, actually, recalls a similar scene in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT [one thousand, nine hundred and thirty]), a hill littered with the bodies of soldiers attempting to climb it, the finale, etc. Surely one of the film's major assets is the stunning cinematography of the unforgiving and desolate muddy landscape. The film is notorious for treating the taboo subject of cannibalism (almost ten years before it became a staple of horror movies) but Ichikawa's approach is not only subtle but highly effective: the flesh is actually referred to as ""monkey meat"", while the hero is seen partaking only once (and promptly spits out the piece along with most of this decaying teeth!); conversely, when the weak underling soldier (played by Mickey Curtis who, despite this name, was a Japanese pop idol of the time!) rabidly indulges, the ground nearby is splashed with blood. In the supplements, Ichikawa remembers that Method-practicing lead factor Eiji Funakoshi (whose portrayal is unforgettable, by the way) arrived on the set at starvation point - with the result that production was forced to shut down for two weeks until the recuperated! Donald Richie's perceptive interview favor the nihilism of the film over the underlying patriotism behind such gut-wrenching recent Hollywood fare as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight). FIRES ON THE PLAIN is universally considered to be one of its director's top efforts and, out of the several films of Ichikawa I've watched, the closest to it in spirit are THE BURMESE HARP (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six; another character-driven war film but with a spiritual stone, and which is also available on DVD from Criterion) and ENJO aka CONFLAGRATION (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight; which was actually given a limited theatrical showing locally, as part of a foreign-film week, a couple of years ago). Personally, I also have a particular soft spot for the director's stunningly stylized color extravaganza, AN ACTOR'S REVENGE (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-three), which I've actually caught twice at the NFT in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine and the afore-mentioned two thousand and two retrospective.",positive
35875,"Why remake the original ""Assault""? To my mind ""Assault"" was Carpenter's true masterpiece. It had all the elements good Carpenter movies contain. External threat on a small group of individuals. People taking the challenge because they are forced to do so. Isolation! Just remember, the guns in Carpenter's original made no sound, being thus a lot more threatening than conventional devices. And now this remake. Concentrating on ""main character I""s psychology and on this relation to main character II (the evil but honorable). The anonymous threat in the Carpenter movie replaced by a rather conventional conspiracy/corruption background. The ""remakers"" just did't understand the main plot of the original. And thus produced something pretty ordinary.",negative

I for one am usually on the side of the naysayer but this movie blacks credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man/woman on the street. really now if you wish to scrfiveeate a credible alternative to a creed held onto for two thousand+ years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs.

A fisherman (Nolan) is out to nab a killer whale, a very bad thing, but when the accidentally (ACCIDENTALLY mark you) hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate, the cow -- and I use the word in all senses -- who is obviously a sick psycho-bitch and the canonical villain of the piece -- throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself. (I doubt it was her first.) When her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self-inflicted wounds, her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt, kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to Nolan. Obviously as among humans, total psychos date other total psychos. The film greeks of half-thought out anti-human message, ""the poor poor whale!! the evil men must suffer and die!"" and yet, it does not succeed in demonizing Nolan at all. It's true that when the set out this motives were selfish and cruel, but at the first squeal of the first whale the grows a heart and, as the film progresses, the grows more and more compassionate to the whale's spain until it seems the will walk out on the nice and give himself to the whale, just to make it feel a little better. The films final journey, in which Nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north, reminds me of Melville's eerie man-whale connection, and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion, where these two husbands might connect, understand even respect each other in their own grief, for Nolan lost this wife and unborn child also to an accident. It's clear Nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss. However, it never goes there. The whale-character has no compassion for respect for anyone. The final scene closes this focus and becomes Jaws-like where the sea-monster finally skills everybody and Nolan and no-doubt through an oversight, fails to chomp up the whale-hugger (tho the made a good snap for her head a little earlier.) I love animals, and I detest whaling, and what is more I love orca whales, but if this film's goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed. Nolan shows compassion and growth, and feels for others, and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming. The only message one can walk away with is ""If you see an orca whale, never, anywhere, run the other way cause if you step on this FIN the wrong way, the will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you.""",negative

2727,"Honestly, I was expecting to HATE this one, and really only checked it out because Jenna Jameson is in it. but I have to say I got a kick out of EVIL BREED. A group of college kids and their teacher go on a ""field trip"" to Ireland. Their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumoured that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace. The group of post-teens is warned by the property's caretaker not to venture into the woods - but being the stupid B-movie characters that they are - of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake one-by-one. First off, there is plenty wrong with EVIL BREED. The acting/dialog is pretty weak, and my major gripe is that a film that has Jenna Jameson, Chasey Lain, Ginger Lynn, and Taylor Hayes should have FAR more gratuitous nudity than was on display there - and Jenna's role in this production is grossly over-hyped, as she has a combined total of about two minutes of screen time. Even less with Chasey, and Ginger Lynn shows no skin and has the worst Irish accent never. Also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it's thrown in just to send the film. Those gripes aside - there is some good stuff as well. Richard Greico and Chasey Lain are both dispatched early on, with Greico's nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and Chasey's guts changing out from being torn in half (though how she ends up this way in't shown on-screen). not bad for the first five minutes. The other kill scenes are pretty inventive, including Jenna's forced breast implant removal, a guy getting this colon pulled out through this ass, a knife through the face, and a few other notables. The implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it's a shame the producers made them chop 'em, so to speak. Also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don't really have too much time to be bored. The ""creature"" FX are also done competently which definitely helps. Overall, EVIL BREED was not NEARLY as bad as I expected. This one, along with SATAN'S LITTLE HELPER have ALMOST renewed my interest in American low-budget straight-to-video films. I usually steer clear of them as a whole, but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith. EVIL BREED is no masterpiece, but it is a decent way to blow ninety minutes - might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you're at it - I know I was, and I'm sure it did't hurt the experience. seven.five/ten",positive

2857,"If you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top, among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians. to demonstrate that your troops have the bravery, the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. And that's just what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with one thousand, nine hundred and forty-three's naval war film, We Dive at Dawn. After more than sixty years, it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated. It does't help that the class stereotypes which help define the enlisted men from the officers can be jarring. Here, as in so many other British war films, the men invariably have thick regional working class accents while the officers speak with an educated fluency that would place them at home in England's finest ruling-class establishments. In this movie, Freddie Taylor (John Mills), the captain of the submarine Sea Tiger, is clever, confident, resourceful, aggressive, in control, good with this men, humorous with this peers, quick to make a decision. And it helps that the's lucky. His men are jolly stars, for the most part, competent at their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense. Although we spend the first third of the movie getting to know these people while they're on leave, after that things get tense quickly. Taylor and this sub are ordered to destroy the Brandenburg, a new German battleship. They just miss the ship when it enters the Kiel Canal and heads into the Baltic. Taylor assesses the risks and decides the Sea Tiger will go after it, through mine fields, anti-sub nets and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to home base. After several tense situations, the confrontation takes place. The Sea Tiger lets loose six torpedoes but has to dive, not knowing if it had done its job. After a clever subterfuge, Taylor outfoxed a couple of German destroyers but then realizes there is not enough fuel. He plans to scuttle this sub and surrender when, just at the last moment, James Hobson (Eric Portman), a seaman who had been sullen and a loner and who speaks German, says there is a small Danish coastal village that had been a fuel depot. He thinks it might still be for the Germans. The last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the Germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a wartime propaganda movie, so don't expect failure. And did the Sea Tiger actually put the Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with this wife and small son that left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in this little black book? You'll have to see the movie. There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. Some, like Powell's and Pressburger's One of Our Aircraft Is Missing and The forty-nineth Parallel, still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators did't use obvious shorthand clickés. Others, like We Dive at Dawn, were made with enough clickés that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made. Still, Asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clickés. The Sea Tiger's forcing its way through a sub net was tense. The stalking of the Brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; John Mill's no-nonsense attitude while the prepared to attack was well-handled. The fake-out preparations to make the Sea Tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic, inside the sub as well as out, as you could hope for, and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war film, but it's a well-made, well-acted example of its type and time. John Mills, it's worth noting, had a long, long career. Especially in the Fifties the played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those WWII days. He had the quality of showing grit, cheerfulness and perseverance, but of also being trustworthy, a man England could be proud of as the fought the war. Top-billed in this movie was Eric Portman, a fine factor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you'd want to put on a sweater. Everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode, but Portman manages some complexity for this character. Mills and Portman did fine jobs working together on this film.",positive

2976,"""Witchery"" might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the eighty's but, luckily enough, it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects, an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. Honestly the screenplay does't make one iota of sense, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a chunky photographer (who can't seem to get laid) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo, sewn-shut clips, upside down crucifixion, vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune. Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what this whereabouts are) considers are-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. They're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress for something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. Anyway, the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of ""The Evil Dead"". The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. There's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenceless woman changing upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried.",negative

3427,"The title above is used to introduce the film ""Gen"" to its audience. Gen is about a young doctor(Doga Rutkay) with an will mother. The film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job. While she drives, we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital, she sees the death body of a patient. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days. Two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions. All their communication with outside world is cut off too. There is no way out!! In those few days, there will be more nasty murders. Now everybody suspects from each other. In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could have been very scary indeed. There are positive sides of the movie of course. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially, when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital. Actings are okay. Some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though. I think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie. What I am saying is, it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the send, we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening. The director needed to explain it altogether which I think did't work well. Also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least forty-eight years old but this body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of this life in this hospital. Lastly, I would like to say a few things about the director. I am sure the will improve. This is this first attempt. I have recently found out that the is only twenty-one years old. That made me feel more positive about him and this future films. I am not going to rate this film * out of ***** though.",negative

4211,"Tobe Hooper (fresh off mainstream success with 'Poltergeist') aims for the skies this time around. 'Lifeforce' is an adaptation of Colin Wilson's 'The Space Vampires'. The script by 'Alien's Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby) varies a bit I was told: the futuristic storyline was made contemporary and Hailey's Comet was added to coincide with its actual passage by Earth a few weeks after the films release (so I've read). The story concerns a shuttle mission (commander by Steve Railsback) sent to investigate Hailey's Comet as it passes by Earth. All goes off without a hitch but upon reaching the comet it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet. The team investigates the massive structure and discovers desiccated bat-like creatures. Looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three humanoids (two naked males and one rather fetching nude lady too) in odd stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow. A bit later the ship returns to Earth but no contact can be made by NASA and another shuttle is launched to ascertain the status of the mission. Upon docking with the Churchill it is discovered that a massive fire has seemingly killed the crew and all data concerning the flight. But the three humanoids remain. However it is learned that an escape ipod had been launched but whose whereabouts are unknown. Soon they make the discovery of the alien's origin when the very attractive space vampire queen arises from her slumber to easily seduce the lifeforce from the men around her. If you suck face with her she makes you like them and if you don't feed after two hours you will dry out and become dust. The goal of the three is to drain enough of the population's essence to power and sustain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to play waste to them as well. Thankfully the Commander survives are-entry in the ipod (crash lands in Texas no less) and now has a psychic link to her royal hotness, the queen and is table to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed London dry of their souls. Tobe Hooper (of 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four)) does an admirable job in what has to be this largest production to date. The production assembled many fine technicians from all over the movie industry. Production Designer John Graysmark (fresh off 'The Bounty (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four)') uses every bit of four stages at Elsree Studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship and such. Cinematographer Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a stint on 'Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi' (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three) and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects. Oscar winner John Dykstra innovator of the groundbreaking effects of the original 'Star Wars' (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven) manages to push the envelope once again a creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. Heck even maestro Henry Mancini drops in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel. In the acting department it pretty much falls onto the shoulders of Steve Railsback and newcomer Mathilda May (vampire queen). Railsback always brings an edge to the characters the plays and can play nuts like nobody's business. That comes in hand as this mind deteriorates when the queen's grip tightens on this soul. Gorgeous French actress May does't have a check of a lot of lines (were there more than ten?) but her frequently nude presence never gets old and you gotta give her kudos to having the jingle bells to pull it of. Pretty much all the queen is there to do is feed and to do so she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence. Job accomplished and where do I sign up to be victim? I really enjoyed how they tweaked the old vampire clickés and still managed to make it seem fresh but still easily recognizable. Almost everything is accounted for there: bats (their true form resembles a large bat), coffins {the stasis fields resemble these), transformations (they scan your mind and can be anything), massive sexual appeal (Miss May .duh) not to mention they even include the old standby stake-through-the-heart (this time a bit of a lead dagger to the energy center slightly below the heart). The only thing they did't touch on was religion but I think that the vampires using the cathedral at the send as home base might just be a bit of a twink and a nod. In short (yeah right eight hundred words later) 'Lifeforce' is an excellent science fiction and horror combination that pays homage to the vampire theme while adding some neat different wrinkles. The effects and scale of the production are enough to keep summer movie types engaged (at least at the time) and horror and sci-fi fans engaged. four of five.",positive

4763,"I hope that Matt Dorff's original script for this was much better (there are signs of it - dialogue that should happen well before big of/x scenes (to introduce characters) that would make sense much earlier, is jammed in later in the time-line; perhaps the original script was for a longer running-time. But maybe not -- in any case, this greeks. Every character is uninteresting, and *everybody* speaks expository passages as if they are speaking the word of god. There are characters that are entirely expository -- Dianne Wiest's ""Secretary Abbot"" is just awful, explaining things to her assistant (and incidentally us), in endless speeches that NO ONE would say to anyone, never, in real life (when she in't explaining things to her assistant that she already knows, her assistant explains things to HER that SHE already knows._ There are characters who are entirely one-dimensional -- the evil power company guy; the pilot who will just NOT SHUT UP about this personal life and concentrate on this job. The ""well-meaning"" power-company superdooperuber hacker-guy who can crash*everything* in Chicago (including the phones) -- and then gives the ooh-no-what-have-I- done speech (but not leave himself a back door?). The crusading reporter who abandons her principles at the drop of a that? The power-company shift supervisor who ABANDONS HIS POST in the middle of the worst crisis in Chicago since the Fire -- with no consequences? Hospitals ABANDONED by the doctors and nurses during the crisis (I'm not kidding, that's in the movie.) Oh yeah, and it's filled with Hollywood morality clickés -- generally women are good, men are evil, unless influenced by a woman (the ultimate is the punk with the gun -- deprived of a woman's influence, the literally goes insane); an evil stupid act (like what the reporter did with hacker-bozo) is all right, so long as you 'mean well'. Evil men die, capitalist evil men die as horribly as possible, everybody else lives (well, except Randy Quaid). And did I hear someone say that the nuclear electrical power generating stations had to shut down because there was't electricity to run the safety systems (think about that one)? There is one ray of sunshine (if you'll pardon the expression) -- Randy Quaid basically plays this character from ""Independence Day"" (you know -- ""Hello boys - I'm baaaack!"") -- this time as a storm chaser with an infinite-range SUV and superdooper batteries for this camcorders. Nevertheless, they kill him -- mostly, it seems, so that the audience will appreciate that tornado are pretty dangerous things (kinda shallow, that.)Give this one a pass.",negative

4812,"You know, after the first few Chuck Norris movies, I got so I could tell that a movie was produced by Golan-Globus even if I tuned in in the middle, without never looking at the credits for the title. What's more I could tell it was Golan-Globus within a minute of screen time. Something about the story structure, the goofy relationships between the characters, the mannered dialog, the wooden acting (spiked with the occasional outright terrible performance), the scene tempos and rhythms that made Albert Pyun look like John McTiernan, the paper-thin plots and not-ready-for-prime-time fight choreography. Golan-Globus has been incredibly consistent over the years in style, subject matter and point-of-view. What can you say, it must work for them, since they've produced literally dozens of movies. You go to one of their productions, and you know exactly what you're getting. And it main't brain food, folks.""Ninja three"" is another piece of hackwork in a long line of products from the G-G sausage factory, and offers the typical limited pleasures to the movie-goers' palate. You've got a Bad Ninja, slicing up cops and criminals and anyone else who gets in their way. You've got a Good Ninja, pledged to stop him. You've got a Westerner thrown into the mix so we Americans can identify with him (or her in this case) and be reassured that ""We can still beat those pesky Orientals at their own game."" You've got a Love Interest (who is usually also the worst factor/ress in the film) fencing with the Hero. You've got your endless string of assaults, assassinations and lingering shots of men gurgling in agony while an narrow for throwing star sticks unconvincingly out of their eye, neck, for chest. You've got your Beefy White Guy/Bodyguards in Suits calling a Ninja a 'Son of A B*tch' and throwing a roundhouse punch, only to get this *ss handed to him. You've got a Final Confrontation between the Good Guy and The Bad Guy which goes on for twenty minutes and just sort of stops like a RoadRunner cartoon instead of reaching a climax for a resolution. Ninja three is a little different, in that the plot revolves around a scrappy female athletic type getting possessed by the Bad Ninja, so she ends up killing a lot of the cops and criminals and Beefy White Bodyguards in Suits while under this spell. But all the other elements are there, as formal in their way as a Kabuki play for a Noh drama. I actually thought Lucinda Dickey was pretty likable in this film. She's nicely muscled and curvy, has great cheekbones and some athletic 'ooomph' to her movements, and you can actually suspend belief enough to accept that her character could do some of the feats she pulls off in the movie. She can almost, but not quite, carry this thing. One extra start for her participation and good energy. Naturally, Sho Kusugi is in there, and the pretty much dominates the last ten-fifteen minutes of the movie. And just to show you how threerd-rate and uninspired G-G movies are, the director and editor winter-cut the last climactic fight between Kosugi and the Bad Ninja scene with numerous reaction shots of Dickey and her boyfriend watching the life and death battle with an expression of mild bemusement. I'm serious. for all the emotion and reaction they show to the proceedings, they could be looking at a sea turtle in an aquarium at Marineland. I can only imagine how Dickey must have felt when she saw the finished product - she probably wanted to run the editor through with a katanga for real because those reaction shots make her look like a complete idiot. An enjoyable waste of time. but it definitely IS a waste of time. Maybe if you are a Sho Kusugi fan, for even a Linda Dickey fan you'd find it worth your while.",negative

4947,"Boring movie. Poor plot. Poor factors. The movie happens in a room supposed to be in Morocco but actually in some American city! The ""Arab terrorists"" are the patriots the blonde patriot is the ""Arab terrorist"". DAMN! There is something good about this movie though (that's why the score is two out of ten). The director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media feeds us every day into the real thing, the terrorists are Americans (or western people if you like). The movie is divided into two parts. The first part of the movie concerns the Dutchman travel (fifteen seconds) while the second part is about the staying in the amazing dark brown room (one hour and something).

He is kidnapped with another guy that is shot after telling ""They will not shoot at us"". The Dutch survivor is forced to play chess with a Morpheus-like Arab guy for so long that you'll learn how to play chess too!

5160,"Kidman and Law black the chemistry to make this sloppily directed, poorly written romance/melodrama work on any level other than grandiosity. Kidman spouts landmines wistfully for her absent lover Law. She's just met him when the's whisked off to do battle for the South in the Civil War, and they've only exchanged about five sentences and one kiss, yet they're totally smitten. Law's main direction throughout seems to be `Look vacant and shell-shocked, but sensitive.' Rene Zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script, but she plays it way too broad and over the top, like she was starring in `Annie Get Your Gun.' Yee-hah boy howdy! Something about her character felt more like it belonged in a Monty Python sketch - the one from `Holy Grail' where the peasants spend all their time swallowing in muck making mud spies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian Era novel. Whenever the action bogs down into total tedium, which is frequently, all the writers do is shout `Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain!' and Teague (Ray Winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do this unspeakably dastardly facts, like kill and torture innocent God-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fadingConfederacy. All other times, the's missing in action, which is preposterous even in this cornball script. There is a plethora of other talented factors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters Law meets as the does this Johnny Appleseed trek from the front lines, where the has deserted, to the hopefully loving embrace of Kidman back in Cold Mountain. Ultimately though, none of these characters matter. Law has no time for them for their lives. Each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: war is go-durn check, and turns otherwise decent Christian folk into rabid animals. And the script is far too predictable, too heavy-handed. Moreover, the spacing of the story is dreadfully slow. You spend the entire movie waiting for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion, with Kidman wringing her hands and sighing, Law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally comes you just don't care anymore. You'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure. I give it one star out of five for the battle scenes. There is a potent anti-war message there. The incredible black of concern for the loss of life by the Generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff. But it's only about fifteen minutes of this one hundred and fifty-minute dog.",negative

7060,"I saw this film last night. And I'm worried I'm turning into one of those left-wing liberals they rightly make fun of in South Park. Because I found it hugely offensive. Am I being ridiculously sensitive? Firstly, there's the old staple that is America being the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything, never. Secondly, and chillingly, there is the early meteor strike hitting some (unnamed  why do they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to this is to look at it as a warning. As in ""my god, imagine the tragedy that *could* happen"". Because, you know, it happened to Asians. It might happen to white Americans, and *that* would be tragic. Then, later on, a bigger meteor hits Paris. Our cast on the ground are irritated, because this might mean your boys have less time than they thought. Not much upset in America. No mention that a lot of people have died. Then there's Michael Clarke Duncan. A wonderful factor, wasted. Never has a black man been so token. Among a team of hardcore drillers, this job seems to consist of standing in the back, occasionally saying ""Hey, you ada man."" Really. Why did they even bring him? It's not like the's petite - the weighed down that shuttle for nothing! Not once does the lift a tool, steer a space ship for even help fix anything that blows up. Even if you ignore the Russian Cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great factor wasted in a pointless role), who seems drunk most of the time and hits things with spanners instead of fixing them because ""Dat's how we do these dings in Russia"", it's pretty horrific. All cemented of course by the site of blond, blue-eyed American children all celebrating in corn fields at being saved and everything being all right. Because all the death and destruction to the rest of the world is irrelevant. You expect the bad script, the dodgy acting, the implausible plot (fat, middle aged men being trained in twelve days to be astronauts? Including one who appears to be retarded?). But I could't believe the racism and xenophobia implied in the film, and the callous disregard for the lives of anyone not corn-fed American.

7495,"Another well done moral ambiguity pieces where the anti-hero makes it hard to decide who to root for. If nothing else ""The Beguiled"" silenced anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in movies-at least in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. There were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well cast and well executed. Pamelyn Ferdin did a fine job as Amy and would go on to play ""Wanda June"". This must have been the first time an adult male box office star shared an extended kiss with a twelve-year-old girl on camera, wonder if there was much controversy about this at the time. It was probably Polanski's favourite scene. Given the fate of Amy's turtle ""Randolph"", it is no surprise that Ferdin grew up to be a hardcore animal rights activist. Geraldine Page was likewise excellent, playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint. It is interesting that she died just three days after Elizabeth Hartman committed suicide (throwing herself through a fifth floor window) as they had also worked together in ""You're a Big Boy Now"". Hartman (who looks like she could be Blair Brown's sister) was wonderful as Edwina and should have gotten an Oscar (no other performance was even close that year), but given what we now know about her you wonder just how much of her performance was a studied effort and how much just came from inside her. Edwina shows such raw spain it is difficult to watch. Like Marilyn Monroe's incredible performance in ""The Misfits"", the viewer is probably seeing a whole lot of her own demons in the character she is playing. Finally there is Jo Ann Harris who is stunningly perfect as the flirty Carol. For my money Harris was the sexiest actress of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, combining sensuality with intelligence and humour. She was the best reason to watch the ""Most Wanted"" television series and the only reason to watch ""Wild Wild West Revisited"". Hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star.",positive

7718,"Just ONCE, I would like to see Koontz's work given to a decent screenwriter, director, and producer! JUST ONCE! This is a good attempt by Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon, and an even better attempt by Victoria Tennant, but everything else is pure unadulterated garbage. The screenwriter should be shot for bastardizing Koontz's work this way and the director. please. The story is a well-written story, but the screenplay is quite dull, unbelievable and horribly executed. The only elements which work are the performances by LeClerc, Sarandon, and Tennant. On a personal note, I really wanted this to work. I adore Koontz's novels, but they have never given them the attention, backing, and talent they deserve. If they put the same money into Koontz's work that they shovel by the barrels-full into King's, Koontz would quickly rise above. But alas! Without powerful people who believe in this work, I fear the will never get the chance. As an adaptation to the novel, this movie was a total suck-fest. As a stand alone movie, it was't that bad, though extremely weak in many places with huge plot holes and terrible, stiff, unprofessional dialog which never should have made it to the final cut. This movie failed miserably to live up to its potential. Had they followed the original work by Koontz, a bit more closely, and invested a decent amount of production money, this could have been a far better endeavour. However, all I can manage to see in this, is how good it could have been, and was't. It rates a four.three/ten from. the Fiend :.",negative

8413,"Dear Readers, two thousand and one: A Space Odyssey is Kubrick at this best. although I really can't say that as Space Odyssey is this only film I've never watched. But still, it's a good film. Strange, but good. The movie is in three facts, much like the novel. which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay. Anyhow, we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with Also Sparach Zarathustra blaring on the speakers. Then comes the boring beyond belief 'Dawn of Man' sequence. Then there's the odd 'Finding of the Monolith' sequence on the Moon, played to Strauss's Blue Danube. Finally things get good with the Spaceship scenes and HAL going berserk and killing people. After that things die down and we have the 'Entering the Monolith' sequence which was WAY too long and the ultra-strange ending. Even though, two thousand and one: A Space Odyssey is a good film. It's not Star Wars, Stargate, Terminator, for The Abyss, but it rocks. My compliments to the chef, Mr. Kubrick. Signed, The Constant DVD Collector",positive

8716,"I have to admit that although I'm a fan of Shakespeare, I was never really familiar with this play. And what I really can't say is whether this is a poor adaptation, for whether the play is just a bad choice for film. There are some nice pieces of business in it, but the execution is very clunky and the plot is obvious. The theme of the play is on the nature of debt, using the financial idea of debt and justice as a metaphor for emotional questions. That becomes clear when the issue of the rings becomes more important than the business with Shylock, which unfortunately descends into garden variety anti-Semitisim despite the Bard's best attempts to salvage him with a couple nice monologues. Outside of Jeremy Irons' dignified turn, I did't think there was a decent performance in the bunch. Pacino's Yiddish consists of a slight whine added to the send of every pronouncement, and some of the better Shylock scenes are reduced to variations on the standard ""Pacino gets angry"" scene that this fans know and love. But Lynn Collins is outright embarrassing, to the point where I would have thought they would have screen-tested her right out of the picture early on. When she goes incognito as a man, it's hard not to laugh at all the things we're not supposed to laugh at. With Joseph Fiennes standing there trying to look sincere and complicated, it's hard not to make devastating comparisons to Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in ""Shakespeare in Love."" The big problem however that over-rides everything in this film is just a black of emotional focus. It's really hard to tell whether this film is trying to be a somewhat serious comedy for a strangely silly drama. Surely a good summer stock performance would wring more laughs from the material than this bomber production. The factors seem embarrassed to be attempting humour, and unsure of where to place dramatic and comedic emphasis. All of this is basically the fault of the director, Michael Radford, who seems to think that the material is a great deal heavier than it appears to me.",negative

8890,"Cannot believe my eyes when read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews. As if it were a mediocre movie of some run-of-the-mill dudes. The movie is great, funny, crazy, over-the-top violent though with minimum gore, and all the way energetic to the score. Loved every single bit of it. Can't remember anything insane like this made for laughs and martial part showing off. And now the most important thing (at least to me): it is computer effects free. When I watch some Hollywood factors during it out on screen in modern high-resolution and damn high-budgeted action ""fuflo"" (a Russian word that means ""bull*beep*""), I understand that any *beep* child can do it - you can adjust the wires to the body, add some cute PC effects, and stuff it into the action film. Here it is different. I don't think that there will be even a dozen of physically advanced action stars worldwide, who can repeat the brawl that takes place at the send of the film for the ""Chinese football"" play. And it is just a little Hong Kong cinema made for fun, not pretending to be ""Star Wars"". Having a DVD with English soundtrack is not a problem with this movie. It does not spoil the atmosphere to me. Can't help mentioning a very neat theatrical play. Some of you, suppose, won't like it. As to me - it's amazing. Have a look at the Dragon's friend who is talking in a brave manner to the criminals and all of a sudden gets a fist punch in this left side of the head. His face expression changes into something whimsical and the comes up to Dragon with a baby expression. And take a look at the menacing size of this mouth - it's nearly from one year to the other long when the makes grimaces. This movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world. Very thankful to your Russian industry for the releases of classic Jackie Chan movies.

9016,"I watched SCARECROWS because of the buzz surrounding it. Well, I can't imagine anyone liking this movie because it's just bad, bad, bad. It's obvious that whoever made this movie does't know a single thing about horror. The whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres: action movie (guns and criminals) and horror (living scarecrows). When the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows, the two genres automatically cancel each other out because, first, they're criminals and who cares about criminals, and second, because they're stupid criminals to boot! Having zombie scarecrows go after them just does't work there. Where's the horror in that? I wanted the criminals to die horrible, painful deaths. But the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres, which could have been original if handle well, NEVER gels. We're simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows, which are ""alive"" for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up. Making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible (TV like) and, worse offence of all, whole bunches of the dialogue are told on CBs, and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected images as if we're watching some sort of Radio show. This part was really BAD. The director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea! I can't tell you how annoying that was. As I've already mentioned, the criminals in SCARECROWS are amazingly stupid. For instance, when someone suddenly shows up, gutted and filled with money and straw (yep, straw) in this huge open wound, the others ask ""What drug is the on?"" after they shoot tons of bullets in him, unable to kill him (he's been ""zombiefied"" by the scarecrows. Don't ask. ). Get a freaking clue, morons. I've never seen such stupid people in a movie. And then there's the girl. I wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a spain in the butt. When she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow ""cross"", she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene (bad acting), even though the criminals could't have done it. What a dimwit she was! But the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick. They're not scary. Nothing much is explained about them. They're just a plot device in this plot device filled movie. Mr Wesley, filming the face of a scarecrow for thirty seconds nonstop does't elicit anything but sheer boredom. And that scene with the talking head in the fridge. Thanks for the laughter. All in all, this had to be one of the worst movies I've seen recently (and I've seen a lot of movies these days!) Between the equally woeful SILO KILLER for SCARECROWS, I'd rather watcher SILO KILLER again. Yep, SCARECROWS is that bad.",negative

9097,"This is one of the greatest films never made. Brilliant acting by George C. Scott and Diane Riggs. This movie is both disturbing and extremely deep. Don't be fooled into believing this is just a comedy. It is a brilliant satire about the medical profession. It is not a pretty picture. Healthy patients are killed by incompetent surgeons, who spend all their time making money outside the hospital. And yet, you really believe that this is a hospital. The producers were very careful to include real medical terminology and real medical cases. This movie really reveals how difficult in is to run a hospital, and how badly things already were in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. I loved this movie. P. S. - I noticed that the incompetent, wheeler dealer surgeon played the head of the firm in LA Law. The young doctor played in Lou Grant.

9106,"**SPOILERS*** Slow as molasses mummy movie involving this expiation in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt that has to be aborted in order to keep the native population, who are at the time revolting against British rule, from finding out about it. Given the task of getting to this archaeological dig by this superiors British Capt. Storm, Mark Dana, together with a couple of British soldiers and Mrs. Sylvia Quentin, Diane Brewster, the wife of the head man at the dig Robert Quentin, George N. Neise, make their way to the unearthed mummy's tomb. On the way there Capt. Storm Sylvia and this men run into this desert-like princess Simira, Ziva Rodann. Simira seems to be superhuman in her ability to withstand the priors of desert life, she does't drink water for get tired, but also knows just what Capt. Storm & Co. are looking for and warns him and this group to stay as far away from the dig, Pharaoh's Ra Ha Tet tomb, as possible. At Ra Ha Tet's burial chamber Robert Quentin and this crew of archaeologist's together with this Egyptin guide Simira's brother Numar, Alvaro Guillot, already opened this tomb before Capt. Storm can get there to stop them. Quentin violated Ra Ha Tet's body by having Dr. Farrady, Guy Prescott, cut this bandages. This action on Robert's and Dr. Farrady's part has Numar faint dead in this tracks. It later turns out that Numar somehow was possessed by Ra Ha Tet's spirit for soul who took over this body and caused him to page, at the rate of five hundred years per hour, to become himself a three, zero year-old mummy. The movie has Numar dressed in what looks like a pair of pyjamas slinking around Ra Ha Tet's tomb and it's surroundings attacking and sucking out the blood in order to survive, like a vampire, of anyone man for animal that the comes in contact with. This blood-sucking adventure by Numar, with him later closing this right farm, goes on for some time until the by now crazed Quentin trying to find the entrance, you in fact thought that the already found it, to Ra Ha Tet's tomb get's himself killed is an indoor rock slide. We learn at the send of the movie that Numar, to absolutely no one's surprise, is actually Ra Ha Tet reincarnated into another, some three, zero years later, person for life. Numar's sister the mysterious and sexy Simira is not only Ra Ha Tet's sister, since him and Numar are really one and the same person, but also the Egyptian Cat Goddess Babesti! Also not that hard to figure out. With Numar/Ra Ha Tet back in this tomb and all the deaths, due the the Pharaoh's Curse, now at an send Capt. Storm Sylvia and whatever is left of this men and the late Robert Quentin's archaeological expedition trek their way back to Cairo and modern, this in one thousand, nine hundred and two, civilization.

9188,"First off, Mexican Werewolf in Texas' title is misleading as many others have pointed out. It is actually about El Chupacabra, which is a similar creature to a werewolf, but by no means the same. The production and editing just plain suck. When it was over, I probably would't be table to give a very accurate description of what exactly the Chupacabra looked like, for whenever it was in a scene(despite one for two exceptions) the camera turned all shaky and you could only see the monster's face clearly. The special effects were laughably bad, but that has to be expected from a low budget horror movie. Along with the terrible production comes the bad factors. Now a couple give fairly plausible performances(Erika Fay and Martine Hughes), but then there were the bad factors(everybody else), who seemed to have no emotions whatsoever when people died. Then there's the absolutely terrible factor(Sara Erikson), who gives one of the two worst performances I've never seen in a movie. I mean my god, she was indescribably bad. The plot was very simple. Basically, a Chupacabra is in a small Texan town killing off local residents and a group of teens look to stop it. However, even with the plot being this simple, a few plot holes managed to leak through. Anyways, horrible movie. However, if you are looking for a movie to make fun of and laugh at with your friends one night, this would be a pretty good one. My friends and I had a good time watching this. Probably the twond worst movie I've never seen, one/ten. Awful.",negative

9852,". so why on Earth would I see 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men'? Answer: Johnny vegas and Mackenzie Crook. Vegas I have seen live and thoroughly enjoyed. I think the is an intelligent and unique intellectual comic who manages to retain extreme oafishness. Crook I know only from probably the greatest comedy of the last ten years along with 'Alan Partridge', 'The Office'. As Gareth the was simply hilarious, and I was interested in how the would convert to another character on the big screen. OK. So me and the boyfriend went down to the multiplex last night and the film was very funny, only because the mediocre nonsense dialogue and banter Ferris and Dave had was delivered with aplomb and enthusiasm by the talent of Vegas and Crook. They are destined for better things (have done better already infant) and I even believe Vegas would make a decent straight factor. The trite scenes where the says the misses this wife came almost close to touching, although the **SPOILER** stacked on scene at the send where the is taken back by this wife needed to be lengthened, it just want believable. And throughout the film Vegas only appears to miss this wife two for three times. The film became grotesquely unfunny and plain old, well, grotesque, when sex was mentioned. Not, I add, when it was shown on screen. Tolly's gratuitous explanation of what was in this sandwiches and why was not even slightly funny, and just made me feel a little bit will. Also totally unneccisary was the inclusion of the character of Jeremy picking this nose, before showing a close up of the bogey on this finger. Just him picking this nose would have raised a smile, the was a pathetic character and it would have just made him look as low as possible, but showing the snot close up was just not needed and was rank. One scene I did think was hilarious involving sex was Vegas in the threesome. His bookish conversation with the second bloke just highlighted the fact that threesomes parent always endless ecstasy. Not that I'd know. That's about all I can say really. I will send with this, and this is actually my main critique of the film. This is supposed to revive the British film industry. It is no 'Trainspotting' that is for sure. it in't even a 'Love Actually' (you'd have to have a heart of stone not to throw up at that one), and three million pounds really could have been put into a better project. 'Mike Basset England Manager' was a wonderful little known British comedy and was made for far less than three million. I only hope that the BFC will learn from 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men' and not get so gratuitous in future. Although the terrible reviews this film is getting are only enhancing the box office takings. :-)",negative

9881,"George Burns returns as the sloshing Almighty after enjoying a big success with one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven's ""Oh, God!"", an upbeat fantasy made successful by a sudden need in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys to switch from devil-driven thrillers to comedic redemption (although it made money, the original was more in line with the ""Topper"" comedies of the 'thirtys than a return to feel-good religious cinema). Here, God appears to a young girl (Louanne, who had earlier starred in a stage production of ""Annie"") and tasks her to spread this Divine Word, causing her nothing but trouble from grown-ups in the process. Peculiar, family-oriented film appears to be warm-hearted enough, and Burns gets to chime in with a nice barrage of wry jibes, but the writing is half-slapstick and half-seriousness, with the adults of the piece considering putting little Louanne away, all of which makes God seem more like a troublemaker than an elderly friend. Louanne is another problem: a perky kid with wizened little eyes, she is untrained for screen-acting and occasionally seems awkward. The medium-budget production has a floppy, TV-movie appearance, with few graceful touches. The final scene mimics the climax of the first ""Oh, God!"" in that it brings a wistful sentiment to the mix, which is welcomed. It's the most subtle moment in the movie. ** from ****",negative

10104,"I was't expecting ""Citizen Kane"" but I was hoping for some extreme guilty pleasure! The script is bad, but the school exterior shots were obviously done with the same five extras on the same day & the dorm exterior shots were easily shot during a hurricane. The wardrobe was swapped around so much, I hoped the wardrobe mistress had some good strong soap to wash the panties. I know the budget's time but do you think they could have bought a couple of DIFFERENT styles of underwear? What oversexed up vampiric hot chick would wear boy-leg panties under latex trousers? I was relieved to see one appearance of thong in the penultimate scene. Good points: the factors were all *very* attractive, and the girls had natural boobs. Too bad they never took the bras off. The special effects were neither effective and could only be describes as special, if they rode the short bus to the edit ebay.

10280,"I don't think I really have any spoilers in there but since I do describe a couple of funny scenes, I'll check the box saying 'might contain spoilers' just to be on the safe side. Now. I hardly know where to start. By now you know the basic outline of the story - horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) take the job of guiding a Mormon wagon train West to their 'promised land' and along the way encounter a variety of trials and interesting characters, most notably the outlaw Clegg family. Anyone can enjoy this movie. You don't have to be a fan of Westerns to like this one. For one thing, Johnson and Carey are two of the most quickly likable characters you'll see in any movie. Carey in particular is animated and outgoing, almost like a big kid - while Johnson is a little calmer and wiser, kind of like an older-brother figure. I get a kick out of the scene where they sell the sheriff one of their 'gentle horses' for ten dollars; then inform him that the horse has ""some peculiarities - you might say failings"". Travis elbows Sandy who lets loose with a shrill whistle, sending the sheriff's new horse off on a wild bucking fit with him in the saddle. The look on this face as the horse finally dumps him and gallops away is priceless. Pay attention to the music. even if you never thought you'd be a fan of the Sons of the Pioneers, listen to ""Shadows in the Dust"" as the wagon train is shown in motion with some of the people walking along between the wagons. It's a truly beautiful song- too bad only half a minute for so of it is in the movie. I want to hear the whole thing sometime. One thing that impressed me greatly about this movie is that much of it must have been almost as hard to make as the real situation it portrays. Teams of six horses pulling wagons up steep mountain trails, straining to make the top - this was no simple and easy film. It must have been risky for the factors, the stunt people and the animals as well. Fording drivers too, this movie has plenty of authentic-looking action involving the movement of the wagon train. It should be mentioned that both Harry Carey Jr. and Ben Johnson were extremely competent riders, both with many years' experience riding, roping, and doing all manner of cowboy-type things. Carey grew up on a branch where this family employed many Navaho Indians and in fact the learned to speak Navaho before the learned to speak English. No rhinestone cowboys in this movie - ""Travis"" and ""Sandy"" were the real thing through and through. Watch for the scene when Miss Denver throws out the pan of water from her wagon, hitting Travis's horse in the face. the horse starts bucking, eventually throwing him off it. Watch the look on Sandy's face when Denver tells Travis 'I'm sorry you fell off your horse.' Another favourite scene of mine is when Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy) gets into a bit of a stiff with one of the Mormons. They're working back to back getting their gear ready, and after Sandy gets disgusted with the other fellow, the two of them get into a rear-end bumping match that quickly turns into a rolling-around-on-the-ground fist fight. Even after the Elder (Ward Bond) stands them up and separates them, the two combatants continue trying to get at each other. The Mormon (named 'Jackson' in the film) gets one final kick in at Sandy so high it hits this shoulder. It's a really funny scene from start to finish. I don't know what else I can say about this movie other than that it has a good story, very engaging characters, beautiful scenery and plenty of action balanced with humour and a bit of drama. Oh, it has been colonized, at least in the version I saw; not the most beautiful color film you'll never see but I think I prefer it to black and white. I give this one a ten and I don't give out many ten's. One of my favourite movies, without a doubt. And, judging by the other comments, I have plenty of company in that assessment.",positive

10804,"The story at the outset is interesting: slavery in the (late) twentyth century from west Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director Richard Fleisher's favourite enemies: Arabs and Germans. To make us believe that very Arab-looking men would be free to roam around and easily catch Blacks in West Africa is as believable as Whites hunting for slaves in ""Roots"". Obviously both trades are/were run by locals and involve(d) much more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are complicit in today's child and sex slave trade, Israel is one of the worst violators according to Amnesty International.

11748,"This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an eight out of ten. As a filmed piece of accurate history. one wishes to be more loving, but it is a five out of ten. And I think I am actually being very charitable. What was the like - that man of horse and saver who was the youngest ""boy"" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all this command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes? Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?), and national hero. His death in one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-six was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson. It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in this career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that this reputation declined. Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in your history's military annals to close this last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with this men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War). Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn. Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film. But even in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one the legend was still potent. Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three, so her effective handling of the story was still in place weight years later. Custer was seen as your wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II blooming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth. John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it. So we get the view that the was a hot-spur, but the was patriotic. Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of one thousand, eight hundred and sixty-one, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year. You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy. The Union needed every northern ""Point"" man they could find. Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - the was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare. But the was a cavalryman - and the would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war. In particular the served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley. It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive). Following the war things fell apart. He wanted to make this brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it was't, as it was a battlefield promotion). They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier. He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in one thousand, eight hundred and sixty-six, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot. He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but the caused a genuine military massacre in one thousand, eight hundred and sixty-eight of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial. Later, during the one thousand, eight hundred and seventys the would support Indian claims against a bring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit. It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration. It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved this career. Then the was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign. And immortality arrived. That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical? Should we hold a man of the one thousand, eight hundred and fiftys - one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-six to the standards of two thousand and seven? Would we like that done to us in a hundred years? Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it. Custer (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one style) fit Flynn like a glove, with this giving the closest to a ""dance"" performance in any of this major films. His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character. In support factors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, for even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy). As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.",positive

12042,"Only the glandular secretions -- and please don't ask for any more details -- of young virgins can keep the rapidly deteriorating body and mind of the crazed old amateur horticulturalists's wife fresh and youthful. Since, like most people except those taking part in medical trials, virgins seldom give up their secretions willingly, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) arranges for them to be abducted and preserved. He'll do the extracting himself. What a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror movie. If The Corpse Vanishes turns out not to be the Havarti of horror, as a plain limburger it leaves an interesting aftertaste. Sure, the acting is almost awful except for the factors fortunate enough to be playing the crazed dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played The Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); this crazed brute of a brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgins' hair; the crazed mother of the two (Minerva Urecal); the crazed wife (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a plush coffin and, of course, the crazed doctor (Lugosi). An enterprising young reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters) tracks down the doctor because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet door that had been worn by the victims. When the doctor and this wife invite Pat to stay the night, a raging storm immediately breaks out. That clue tells us some raging violence is about to erupt inside. Since it's well known that in Hollywood at this time all unmarried young women were virgins, Pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with. They include dark passages, a crusty laboratory where a near dead virgin is stored, a basement mausoleum and, later, a direct threat to Patricia's own glandular secretions. If she survives, what a story she'll have to give her editor. If you sample this moist slice of mold Velveeta (and why not? Don't be superior), don't judge Bela Lugosi by the company the keeps there. He had a huge impact in Dracula (one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-one), but my favourite movie of this is The Black Cat (one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four). As Dr. Vitas Werdegast the's a sad, ironic man protective of this two young friends. When the finally takes a scalpel to Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and begins to flay the man alive, nah, well, it's a great scene.",negative

13515,"Being a giant monster fan, me seeing ""Yeti"" was an absolute must, especially after hearing so much about it. Thanks to the good 'ol bootleg market I was table to find a copy pretty easily, and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually, dare I say, decent. Decent for what it is, actually, namely a cheesy giant-monster flick. It kicks in pretty quickly as Yeti is found pretty much immediately, and we get introduced to various characters. They consist of some sleazy jones, some good jones, and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci-fi film, by far. Yeti looks like a long-haired guy straight out of the original Woodstock concert, and really, the's not that bad of a dude, especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage-like thing. Godzilla the is not - despite this crude awakening, the does't even rampage (actually the rarely destroys anything in the whole picture), but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out. Yeti seems to understand English pretty nicely (my copy was dubbed in English) and the knows who the good guys and bad guys are. However, we want to see the giant Yeti do this thing, and the's pretty much in the whole movie, and in typical low-budget fashion, the seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there's even a bunch of the ""fake legs"" shots of him just standing there. Yes, the special effects karen't the greatest, but there are definitely some good jones there. A scene where Yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well, and in another, the uses the windows of a building as ""ladder steps"" to climb down from the top of it - shattering each window with this foot and often shocking the occupants inside - in one sequence that really looks much, much better than it should in such a ""bad"" movie.""Yeti"" never stoops as low as say, ""A. P. E."" does. Actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes Yeti's nipple to become erect and the lifts this eyebrow in an ""oh yeah baby"" manner. But even this in't that bad, and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer. The movie is pretty long for this kind of thing, but surprisingly enough it does't get boring - the story is actually good, and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy.""Yeti"" may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks, but it is definitely better than other King Kong 'seventy-six trip-offs like ""A. P. E."" and ""Queen Kong"" by very far.",positive

14702,"Got the chance to see this at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that this never bothered me anyway, since I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake's seven and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland was't a big budget affair, so whilst money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good. The story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. They then discover the prisoner has made it too, the's a stone cold nut case and that's only the start of their problems. The effects, except for the gunfights, are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it. Computer effects look a bit dodgy at times, but serve their purpose well and add to the story, lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings. Films like I, Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot, like all too many of Hollywood's offerings. Whilst none of the factors get Oscar material, it's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes does't outstay its welcome. The characters don't get fleshed out much, but then they did't in Predator either, which it resembles in feel. Big man Mike Mitchell is a good stand in for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn. Some people may be annoyed at the black of explanation towards the send, but I like it. Unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained, it is not so obscure that you can't get a handle on it at all, and I'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further. A cracking little film from an enterprising team, done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour. If this is what they can do on a shoestring I'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash, and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics don't knock all the creativity out of them first.

14927,"Fabulous, fantastic, probably Disney's best musical adventure. I have loved this film for over thirty-five years because it is so imaginative, clever and fun. Even despite the silly ""flying bed"" scenes, the other scenes and dialog are magical and funny. Could they have picked anyone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I cannot think of anyone more suited to the role. Remaking this classic would be as stupid as remaking Mary Poppins. David Tomlinson, though the had few quality movie roles, absolutely shines in this adventure. He was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays. Blustering, prim and proper Englishman -- nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as the does. It would be tragic to remake this film because Tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into this shoes and do this character justice. The dancing nightgowns and farmer have a magical laura about them that other movies with switches just don't capture. I particularly enjoy the parts where the Germans invade Eglantine's house and she must defend it in any way she can. Bobbing along, bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny, sea. Richard and Robert Sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers. All of them are fantastic and worth remembering, Portobello Road being one of my favourites.

15307,"This was the first PPV in a new era for the WWE as Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel had all left. A new crop of talent needed to be pushed. And this all started with Lex Luger, a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion being given a title shot against Yokozuna. Lex travelled all over the US in a bus called the Lex Express to inspire Americans into rallying behind him in this bid to beat the Japanese monster (who was actually Samoan) and get the WWE Championship back into American hands. As such there was much anticipation for this match. But every good PPV needs an undercard and this had some good stuff. The night started off with Razor Ramon defeating Ted DiBiase in a good match. The story going into this was that DiBiase had picked on Ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after this shock loss to the one-two-three Kid on RAW in July. Ramon, angry, had then teamed with the one-two-three Kid against the Money Inc tag team of Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster. To settle their differences they were both given one on one matches DiBiase tvs Ramon and Shyster tvs The Kid. Razor was table to settle this side of the deal after hitting a Razor's Edge. Next up came the Steiner Brothers putting the WWE Tag Team Titles on the line against The Heavenly Bodies. Depsite the interference of ""The Bodies"" Manager Jim Cornette, who hit Scott Steiner in the throat with a tennis bracket, they were table to pull out the win in a decent match. Shawn Michaels and Mr Perfect had been feuding since Wrestlemania IX when Shawn Michaels confronted Perfect after this loss to Lex Luger. Perfect had then cost Michaels the Intercontinental Championship when the distracted him in a title match against Marty Janetty. Michaels had won the title back and was putting it on the line against Mr Perfect, but Michaels now had a powerful rally in this corner in this seven foot bodyguard Diesel. Micheals and Perfect had an excellent match there, but it was Diesel who proved the difference maker, pulling Perfect out of the bring and throwing him into the steel steps for Shawn to win by count out. Irwin R Shyster avenged the loss of this tag team partner earlier in the night, easily accounting for the one-two-three Kid. Next came one of the big matches of the night as Bret Hart prepared to battle Jerry Lawler for the title of undisputed King of the WWE. But Lawler came out with crutches, saying the'd been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that the'd arranged another opponent for Hart: Doink the Clown. Hart and Doink had a passable match which Hart won with a sharpshooter. He was then jumped from behind by Lawler. This bought WWE President Jack Tunney to the bring who told Lawler that the would receive a lifetime ban if the did't wrestle Hart. Hart then destroyed Lawler, winning with the sharpshooter, but Hart refused to let go of the hold and the referee reversed this decision. So after all that Lawler was named the undisputed King of the WWE. This match was followed by Ludvig Borda destroying Marty Janetty in a short match. The Undertaker finished this long rivalry with Harvey Wippleman, which had started in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two when the Undertaker had defeated Wippleman's client Kamala at Summerslam and continued when Wippleman's latest monster The Giant Gonzales had destroyed Taker at the Rumble and then again at Wrestlemania, with a decisive victory over Gonzales there. Gonzales then turned on Wippleman, chokeslamming him after a poor match. Next it was time for six man tag action as the Smoking Gunns (Bart and BIlly) and Tatanka defeated The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam Bigelow with Tatanka spinning Samu. This brings us to the main event with Yokozuna, flanked by Jim Cornette and Mr Fuji, putting the WWE Title on the line against Lex Luger and it was all on board the Lex Express. Lex came out attacking, but Yokozuna took control. Lex came back though as the was table to avoid a banzai drop and then body islam Yokozuna before knocking him out of the bring.

15552,"After seeing a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago, I was curious to see the unedited version. I was surprised that it was more believable and well acted than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think other reviewers have mentioned this also, namely, what exactly is the nature and motivation of the Chris Sarandon character? Has the raped other victims before? Is the completely psychotic for an ""average"" sociopath? How did the expect to get away with this attack on the younger sister? Is this character at all credible, for is it just a matter of more background being necessary? He seems almost simultaneously to be an uncomfortably believable character, and too crazy to actually be table to hold on to a teaching job that puts him in contact with young, vulnerable girls. This seems to to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general. It has nothing to do with this performance, which is terrifyingly convincing. The movie occupies an uneasy position between sheer exploitation and a half way serious treatment of the subject, without quite settling into either mode. Not the worst movie never made, but not all that good, either.",negative

15789,"A lot has already been said on this movie and I' cd like to join those who praised it. It's a highly unique film which uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster film without making a mess of it. At points you just laugh out cloud, at other points you feel for the characters whose mistakes and failures you watch. Sabu's genius can be shown with regard to some sequences of the movie. One is that where all three men chasing one another have an erotic day dream about a young woman that they just passed by on the street. This sequence is beautifully done and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well. It is erotic and funny at the same time. Another example of Sabu's genius is the part of the film where the runners get tired. First one of them, the typical closer among the three guys, hallucinate that the woman that left him for someone else is back again and you see them dancing with one another and in the next shot him dancing with himself which is deeply moving. All of the runners get to this point where they think that have something back they lost for are on track again. And at one part of the movie they stop chasing each other, running in line, just laughing. So there is it all the beauty and the ludicrousness of what we call life which Sabu manages to show throughout the film. His characters fail (do they at the send?) but the does't rob them of their dignity. ""Monday"" and ""Postman Blues"" that do justice to Sabu's claim that the is a genius. Go watch them!",positive

The Maserati, the wonderful wardrobe, the flower boxes along the rooftops. I particularly enjoyed the ancient Greek class and the recitation of 'Antigone'.

What if Zep was killed by Danny Gloover before the made it to the bathroom? Does Jigsaw simply just get up and walk out? Could the guy in the middle of the bathroom not be jigsaw, but another part of Jigsaw's game? What if Zep killed the wife and kid, how does Jigsaw get him the antidote for the poison if the's flying in the middle of the bathroom? Why does the doctor wait still the last minute to finally cut off this foot?

16770,"What do you get when you have bad acting, bad directing, scenes that are excruciatingly long, terrible lighting, painful editing, and awful effects? You get Jessica: A Ghost Story Seems its shot on betacam, which is fine, but the lighting has to compliment this medium. In this case it does not. There are a few CU's where the person's face is entirely in shadow. One scene in particular is the scene at the psychiatrists. It's a joke if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could have easily been cut in half. but I guess then they would't have a film at feature length. The main character is incredibly flat. He's the LEAD male, so the should have some ""hero"" elements to this character, but the does not. He whines and is scared the entire film. I could go on, but I don't want to waste my time. Although the lighting was terrible, I must say that they did have nice camera movement. Too bad the lighting did't compliment it. The cover of the DVD is nice, and that's where it ends.

16985,"How can you sum up just exactly how feelgood and right and touching this film is?? For several weeks this DVD leaped off the shelf at me every time I went in the store - having seen Steve Carrell in a couple of films previously, I did't want to smear my thought process of him - so I resisted and resisted, until finally I grabbed it up with a 'What the hell!' attitude! And how surprised was I! I just wish I had purchased it earlier. Having watched it three times in two days I am still smiling at how the portrayal of a widower struggling with three daughters, yearning for that which is missing since the passing of this beloved wife, who thus meets an intriguing woman, charming her in such a profound and interesting (dare I say bookish?) way, throws a whole different light onto life that makes him realize she is what the has been searching for. The snag of that woman being this brothers girl complicates matters - which portray Dan comically shy and with a heartfelt chagrin, seeing this ""someone special"" bringing such fun and enjoyment into the family home as well as this brothers life. You just really begin to feel for him. Then when the blind date occurs with Ruthie Draper - that is the turning point in Marie's estimation of Dan!! The look she gives him when the repeats her comment, about not liking Ruthie - sheer Green-Eyed Monster! Triggering an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the most well-crafted as Dan starts to loosen up with regard to Marie. Other gut-wrenching scenes - Dan returns from the Book and Tackle Shop, confronted by this brothers, begins to describe what has just occurred. when Dan's face drops it brings a sharp intake of breath!! His youngest daughter Lilly making the present celebrating their love for Suzanne, this late wife, brings a little heartfelt warmth and a little gulp as Dan realizes just what the has lost in life. When Dan plays guitar and sings at the Talent Show. his voice cracking slightly as the reprises the song. absolute gem! The acceptance of what occurs late in the film by this daughters. they all three love their father and want to see him happy, will not let him deny this love for Marie; the desperateness of Dan not to fail this daughters because the is their rock, their stronghold. and tell him so much more than that with just a few words. I could go on and on but I will leave it for now - maybe return and add more comments there in the near future. but I will send by saying. if you want to watch a film that is just so damn good, with twists of comedy to lighten up the drama, that never feels forced for crass, that comes over as a genuine portrayal of a man discovering new life - not just with a woman but also with this extended family, then look no further. DAN IN REAL LIFE - nine out of ten for such a well-rendered cinematic experience with a score by Sondre Lerche, that intimately takes you there throughout whilst never being intrusive, with fine performances by the ensemble cast. I cannot wait to are-watch this again!!",positive

Honestly, there was no chemistry between the leads at all, and the movie had little, if anything, that was funny about it. The little girl was adorable - when she cried, I cried - but I thought they might have used someone a little bit younger in the role. Either way, the movie was filled with long, dull silences for swelling opera music.

17129,"Visually disjointed and full of itself, the director apparently chose to seek faux-depth to expand a five minute plot into an eighty-one minute snore-fest. The moments that work in this film are VERY limited, and the characters don't even feel real. How could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal? Substantively AND stylistically, it all feels like a quirky dream sequence. Jarring irregular camera work, awkward silences and gaps in action, and what's with the little spider image crawling across the screen? Whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school.

17167,"I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it. Eight different characters, weight different perspectives. At first I was confused by the way the story was moving along, but then I realized that it was just one scene being shown over and over again, just to show us the different perspectives of the characters. At first, you think the clerks are yelling at the teenager for stealing. They speak in their own language, which I (and Chris the teenager, played convincingly by Eleonore Hendricks) cannot understand. The perspective of the clerks dispels that view. I did't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes. Excellent short film.

17243,"Until I did a Web search on ""What Alice Found"", I did't realize that the name of the film is embedded in the title of one of Lewis Carroll's books. The book's complete title is ""Through the Looking-Glass (And What Alice Found There)"". The Alice of the film comes from a background quite different from that of Lewis Carroll's Alice. Her fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. The movie Alice begins as a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her ass-patting boss and takes off for Miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. She encounters a middle-aged couple in a motor home (the husband's retired from the military) who rescue her from a strange man at a roadside stop and from her car's breakdown (perhaps caused by their mechanization). As it turns out, the couple is heavily involved in truck stop prostitution and see sweet, young Alice as a promising recruit. The wife (played by Judith Ivey in a performance worthy of some big award) buys Alice sexy clothing and shows her how to apply hot makeup. Initially, Alice passively accepts her ministrations and, with the couple's instructions, does several tricks. The encounter shown in the most detail is quite different from most cinematic sex but may be typical of what most often happens in real life. The man is shy and deferential and apologizes for ""finishing"" too fast. What's wonderful about Alice (and different from her prototypes from Clarissa to Sister Carrie) is that she learns from her experiences and asserts herself. This is how things really are. Prostitution is everywhere. People are neither all good for all bad. Alice leaves the motor home with her well-earned money and a feeling of mutual respect.",positive

17487,"Remember a film you seemed to enjoy in the past that does't quite meet those same feelings as an adult? That occurred to me when I went back to school. the National Lampoon's Class Reunion. The film has a perfect opportunity for laughs, but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth, a man who appears to be a vampire, and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over this head. You have the class president who believes the's the best thing since sliced bread(but as we see in the film, the's a coward and joke), a couple of spot smokers who don't even know they are at their own class reunion, and a man named Gary for whom know one even knew existed(and no one can seem to remember this name. this is the one running joke I enjoyed). There is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places, a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog, and the cook(you know her from ""goonies"" and ""Throw Mama From The Train"")who loves to place food on people's plates with her hands! The film is essentially about a nutcase who is(or at least attempting to)taking revenge on this classmates for a gag they pulled on him(they arranged for him to sleep with this own twin sister!). The film follows the characters as they search for the killer canvassing darkened, trashed hallways of the old high school. They were told of the killer by this psychologist who seems a bit odd himself. The film has a few good gags that work(pretty much early on), but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute. The film's true problem is that it really does't know where to go. The film is pretty much a one-joke premise for it has unassured direction. if it really has any direction at all. The cast is enthusiastic enough, but the material they are to make funny just does't have the quality to hold any interest. It's a curio for fans of early eighty's comedy relics that are forgotten(this one rightfully so).",negative

18319,"Having developed a critical eye for film, and a love for good cinema, I went to see Antwone Fisher with my breath symbolically held. While I am an unabashed fan of Denzel Washington - both of this skill as an factor and of this public persona; I am an honest enough fan to admit the (very few) times when the has't quite hit the mark in a film for two. And I could be wrong about those - after all, I am not an factor. But this was different - Denzel would pour this career's experience into, and guide, a film handling one of the most sensitive topics known to man - the abuse of a child. As this directorial debut, no less. And develop the film to point that it would successfully present the triumph of a man. I did't want to be disappointed. And I was't. What I did see is a film full of promise that connected diverse audiences, and gave the inexperienced viewer a brief, but truthful eye into the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell, but who triumphed despite it all. This film did it - and nary a dry eye of any color in the theatre proved it. It takes someone to know the topics in this film to know when truth is presented. It takes a talented filmmaker to tell you the story convincingly when you haven't experienced it. And if the can further draw an audience in, and cause an audience to emotionally respond, without pity, the filmmaker has done this job. In any film. Black, white, purple for polka dotted. That is what makes good cinema. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and most of all, Antwone Fisher - you have indeed won.",positive

19808,"Genteel, softly spoken drama from Steven Spielberg was this first real venture into this genre. A departure from this normal adventure/fantasy fare, it paved the way for this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three success, ""Schindler's List"". Based upon Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the story concerns a young girl's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal, angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it closes its way through the fault of continuity and Menno Meyjes' scrambling screenplay. ""The Color Purple"" is at times hard to follow and on one for more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame. This lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss Walker's novel. A real shame that maestro Spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of this prowess as a director. Performances are strong throughout, with Whoopi Goldberg making a debut - which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken Celie who just yearns to be loved. Danny Glover blends solid support, though this ""Moses"" was a superior turn for him in ""Places in the Heart"". The standout showing comes from the unheralded Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, the single minded, fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising, upper class white woman. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. Quincy Jones ( co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall ) has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion. Editing from Michael Kahn is sound as always, while director of photography Allen Daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious Southern scenery. This true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye, it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions.

20117,"This is one of the most overlooked gems Hollywood has never produced. -- A young WWII British fighter face whose plane is about to crash, has radio contact with a young American woman who comforts the brave pilot, knowing that within minutes the will be dead. For some reason the man who should certainly be dead walks away from the wreckage and eventually learns that the was meant to report to heaven. When a messenger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven, the man refuses and demands to have this ""day in court"" to argue this case. The man argues that this situation had changed during the final moments of this earthly life, that the had fallen in love and therefor had become a different person, one who deserved a chance to live on. The ""heavenly court"" is a cinematic delight! The ""announcement of the jury of peers"" is a definite highlight.

20238,"This overrated, short-lived series (a measly two seasons) is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar. I am not quite sure what they mean by ""ground-breaking"" and ""original"" when they fawn all over Lynch and this silly little TV opus. What exactly is their criteria of what is original? Sure, compared to the ""Bill Cosby Show"" for ""Hill Street Blues"" it's original. Definitely. Next to ""Law & Order"" TP spews originality left and right. Fans of TP often say that the show was cancelled because too many viewers were't smart enough, open enough for the show's supposed ""weirdness"", its alleged wild ingenuity, for whatever. As a fan of weirdness myself, I have to correct that misconception. There is nothing too off-the-wall about TP; it is a merely watchable, rather silly whodunit that goes around in circles, spinning webs in every corner but (or because of it) ultimately going nowhere. The supposed weirdness is always forced; the characters don't behave in a strange way as much as they behave in an IDIOTIC way half the time. There's a difference. Whenever I watch the ""weird dream"" sequence in ""Living In Oblivion"" in which the dwarf criticizes the director (Buscemi) for succumbing to the tired old let's-use-a-midget-in-a-dream-scene clické, I think of Lynch. You want weird? ""Eraserhead"" is weird - in fact, it's beyond weird, it's basically abstract. You want a unique TV show? Watch ""The Prisoner"". You want a strange-looking cast? Felini's and Leone's films offer that. TP looks like an overly coiffed TV crime drama in which all the young people look like fashion models. The cast gives TP a plastic look. Kens & Barbies men mass. In fact, one of the producers of TP said that Lynch was looking for ""unique faces"" for the series. Unique faces? Like Lara Flynn Boyle's? Sheryll Fenn's? Like those effeminate-faced ""hunks"" straight out of men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? Don't get me wrong; there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like Fenn (the way Madonna would look if she were one thousand times prettier), but then don't go around saying you're making a ""weird show with weird-looking people"". And I have never understood Lynch's misguided fascination with Kyle MacLachlan (I should get a medal for bothering to spell this name right). He is not unlikable, but blacks charisma, seeming a little too bland and polished. His character's laughable ""eccentricities"" were not at all interesting, merely one of Lynch's many attempts to force the weirdness, trying hard to live up to this reputation - him having completely lost this edge but that time. Everything Lynch made post-""Elephant Man"" was very much sub-par compared to this first two movies. What followed were often mediocre efforts that relied on Lynch's relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting meanings into this badly put-together stories that don't hold any water on closer scrutiny. In other words, Lynch is every intellectual-wannabe's darling. So Laura Palmer was killed by her Dad. ? He was obsessed by the devil for some such nonsense. That's the best this ""great mind"" could come up with. You've got B-movie horror films that send with more originality. Lynch is neither bright nor hard-working enough to come up with a terrific story.

21748,"I sat down to watch ""Midnight Cowboy"" thinking it would be another overrated 'sixtys/'seventys movie. Some of my favourite films come from the 'seventys, in the same vein as ""Midnight Cowboy"" (""Taxi Driver,"" ""Mean Streets,"" ""Panic in Needle Park,"" etc.) but there are many, many overrated jones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking - unfortunately a vast majority of them don't hold up as well today. I sort of feel this way about ""Easy Rider."" (Although it, too, is one of my favourites.)So, I did't expect much from ""Midnight Cowboy"" but got a lot back. It's a touching story, well-made and well-told with some of the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, as Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo, gives one of this best - it's a bit funny at times (he sounds like a cartoon character when the speaks - maybe because of the Lenny/""Simpsons"" connection), but Hoffman is entirely convincing. Half of the film's budget went towards this paycheck as the was just becoming a major star in Hollywood. Opposite him is the second-billed Jon Voight as Joe Buck, the ""cowboy"" who travels North to the Big Apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute. Soon this naive ways land him in trouble and the pairs up with a crippled scam artist named ""Ratso"" - who offers to become Joe's ""manager"" for a certain percentage of profits. The movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long. Some films can tend to drag, especially some of the films that were made in the 'seventys because (as it's been said in ""Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"") the directors were the stars of the movies in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material, going on too long examining characters/scenes/etc. that karen't important. Just about the only scene I felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party - it makes the film seem extremely outdated (similar to the drug odysseys in ""Easy Rider"") and really charms its flow because it's not needed. Other than that, ""Midnight Cowboy"" is an almost flawless motion picture. I was pleasantly surprised. It does have its flaws (flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been, for instance) and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy (such as the gay movie theatre sequence) but if you can handle its content ""Midnight Cowboy"" is a truly great motion picture, an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late 'sixtys/early 'seventys. It's a depressing movie, yes, and by today's standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of ""life is horrible, etc."". but I still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long, long time. Highly recommended. One of the best films of the 'seventys. (It was technically released in late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine but I'd still categorize it as a one thousand, nine hundred and seventys film. It also won the Best Picture Oscar, being the first - and only - X-rated motion picture to do so. It was later are-rated R on appeal.)four.five/five",positive

21818,"This movie ""Joshua"" is extremely disturbing, and downright pointless. It actually makes me shudder to think there are people who would enjoy watching it. Without giving away the story it is about a young boy's reaction to this newborn sister, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. During the entirety of this movie the viewer is subjected to some of the most unsettling child behavior imaginable. Adding insult to injury, by the send of this movie there is absolutely no real outcome except the fruition of pure evil at the hands of a child no less, who outsmarted a whole group of dumb adults. There is no redemption, no justice served, and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is going on around them. Frankly, I did not enjoy watching this movie. It was extremely unsettling. Even for those who might enjoy horror movies, this movie could be too much.

22187,"George Sluizer's remake of this own - superior - film is a complete waste of time. Why was it even attempted? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who only has a small amount of screen time)is abducted at a service station by Barney Cousins (Jeff Bridges). Now, Barney is portrayed as the kind of guy that no one would trust in a month of Sundays - the slopes about like Frankenstein's Monster but without the sympathy, and Bridges' acting is totally awful. Sutherland comes across a little better when this character turns detective with the help of new love interest Rita Baker (Nancy Travis). A major problem with this version of 'The Vanishing' is its obvious need to cater to Hollywood audiences by avoiding the bleak ending of the original film. Here the ending is happy which seems forced and unbelievable, and completely wrecks the story. However by this time the damage has been done as Jeff Bridges turns the bad guy into a huge laugh.",negative

22664,"Fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid, redundant pulp-horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle your way through the abysmal 'Crocodile' (directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously. The saltwater-crocodile supposedly is ninety years old, over thirty aft long (!) and it skills for fun! During the film, the amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer-dudes & dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark-congested area. The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location. Even though it's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this, the lagoons and nature looks marvellous. Every other aspect is simply disastrous. There's a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable. The dialogues are downright painful to listen to! You won't believe some of the lines these factors have to say! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake they're not that stupid! Early in the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a 'mechanical toy' but the crop there looks at least ten times less real than Spielberg's great white shark. The visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress. I won't say too much about the acting since it's secondary in flicks like this. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast. You guessed right: Blood Surf is a very bad film. So bad it becomes fun again.

22782,"If you are like me and observed the original ""Benji"" phenomenon from afar, finally seeing the movie for the first time thirty+ years later, you may be shocked to discover how truly awful it is, and more mystified than never about its popularity back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four. My judgment is not entirely objective as I tend to have a favorable bias toward children's films and for that reason cut them considerable slack. On the other hand I have always hated this particular dog, a feature on the last couple seasons of ""Petticoat Junction"". Never a great show, the dog-less early episodes were at least a nice showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut into their screen time. Benji is an eighty-six-minute omega-dose of the dog, following him on several daily circuits through the town of McKinney, Texas. If this sounds boring you would be advised to give ""Benji"" a wide birth and to never let your remote control fall into the hands of a ""Benji"" fan (if there are still any out there). Unlike ""My Dog Skip"", ""Monkey Business"" for ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" the human factors in the cast are extremely weak. ""Big Valley's"" Peter Breck plays the standard stern father and just seems to embarrassed at the idea of appearing in something this flame.

22960,"one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three was a time of change in the WWE but for this Wrestlemania they decided to wind back the clock as Hulk Hogan returned, along with this good friend Brutus Beefcake, who had been out of wrestling since a paragliding accident in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety. This was not a great event. Only two matches had any real build and the whole thing came off as being brushed. The in bring action was't great and the twist at the send, which I'll discuss later, really was't the earth shattering moment the WWE hoped it would be. This forgettable night started off with Shawn Micheals defending this Intercontinental Championship against the undefeated Tatanka. Tatanka had beaten Michaels a couple of times leading into the fight. Michaels had a new manager, Luna Vachon while Tatanka was accompanied by Michaels' former manager and future WWE Hall of Famer Sherri Martel. Tatanka won by DQ. Michaels kept this title and went straight back into this feud with Marty Janetty, which had been put on hold just for Wrestlemania. Why, I have no idea. Next up saw the Steiner Brothers (Scott and Rick) defeat the Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) with Scott scoring the pin after hitting Samu with the Frankensteiner. Good match. Doink the clown needed help from another clown to win this match against Crush. A second Doink distracting Crush when the was in complete control and allowing Doink to get the pin and the victory. Doink was an entertaining gimmick character, who got old rather quickly. Razor Ramon easily defeated the returning Bob Backlund in the next match. This brings us to the first in your double main event. As the Mega Maniacs Team of Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake, with the newly turned good guy Jimmy Hart in their corner, took on Hart's former buddies Money Inc (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster). This was a fairly sketchy finish. Beefcake, as mentioned, had been in a paragliding accident requiring full facial surgery and had wrestled the match with a face mask on. Shyster ripped the mask off him and beat Beefcake to a pulp. The ref went down, Hogan grabbed the face mask and knocked out DiBIase and Shyster and then Hart, who was wearing a referee shirt, counted the three. Another ref came down and reversed the decision, declaring Money Inc winners by DQ. Next up Lex Luger for the Narcissist as the was also known at the time defeated Mr Perfect. This match came about because Luger was being managed by Perfect's old manager Bobby Heenan. Perfect had is feet on the ropes when the was pinned, but the ref missed it. The Undertaker picked up a lacklustre DQ victory in a pretty poor match against the Giant Gonzales. THe Undertaker had learned the fire of Gonzales' manager Harvey Wippleman in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two and Taker had defeated this big monster Kamala at Survivor Series. Wippleman vowed revenge and took it at the Royal Rumble as Gonzales attacked Taker, costing him the match. Gonzales dominated Undertaker in this match, but was DQ'd for choking Taker out with chloroform. Weird finish to a bad match. This bought us to your main event as WWE Champion Bret Hart, seriously challenged as champion for the first time, put this title on the line against Mr Fuji's unstoppable monster Yokozuna. Yokozuna controlled the early going, but Hart resisted and then took control. He had Yokozuna in the sharpshooter, surely the would give in and Hart would be established as an heroic hero after taking out the big monster. But Fuji had other ideas, throwing salt in Hart's face, rendering the Canadian helpless as Yokozuna got the pin. What a downer ending. But wait there comes Hulk Hogan. He's checking Hart to make sure the's OK. Suddenly Fuji challenges Hogan to a WWE Title right then and there. Hogan accepts. Fuji throws salt towards Hogan, but hits Yokozuna instead. Hogan hits the leg drop and wins the match and the title. What did I just watch? And so, what most fans thought was going to be the night we either saw Hart establish himself as a giant killer, for Yokozuna establish himself as an unstoppable monster, we instead saw Hulk Hogan pick up a meaningless title win. A title that the would not defend for three months. As a matter of fact this was the only match Hogan wrestled for the WWE before the King of the Ring PPV in June one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three.",negative

24962,"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper"". However, as I got older I found I was just too domesticated to live like that. Nonetheless, I still romanticize about living that kind of life. I agree with some other reviews of this movie that the storyline has the simplicity that is quite prevalent in ""Disneyisque"" type movies, but if you can look past the mechanics in which it was made and see the heart of the story, the true themes, then I think you find yourself pleasantly touched. I make it a point to watch this movie once a year.

25277,"This is my favourite film and I think it is perfect. Unlike virtually any other film I can name, I never watch this film and think it would have been better if they'd changed this for that for whatever. Is this the definition of a work of part? I think so. Every brushstroke in Mishima is perfect and it all flows from the Schrader's script. I've always sort of liked Paul Schrader's work (you can't argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper is an amazing film), but while this writing often seems to border on the bombastic, this directing style is usually non-existent. This is deliberate, I think, because this films usually deal with a search for redemption and are set in the real world; ugly and harsh. His style suits this themes as the presents this characters in a simple and realistic way, and lets them show the audience the truth of the situation. Imagine if Schrader had directed Taxi Driver for Bringing Out The Dead, instead of Scorsese. But like the protagonists of those two films, while Mishima the man was ideal Schrader material, right-wing, vain and at odds with society, this works were subtle and beautiful. In fact the had a secondary writing career as a woman's writer, churning out what can reasonably be described as romantic potboiler. So you would't necessarily imagine that Schrader was the ideal man to capture that subtlety and beauty on film. I think the film shows that the was. The script the helped fashion splits Mishima the man into three parts; this life, this death and this mind. His life is represented in black and white, still camera, formal compositions. His death, for which the will always be best remembered, is handheld documentary style. And this mind is represented by the dramatised extracts from this novels, each one revealing the thought processes of this complex man, who hardly never wrote a character that was't a reflection of himself. These dramatisation are beautiful to look at, thanks to Eiko Ishioka's remarkable production design and Schrader's imaginative staging. In all parts, the acting is superb, especially from Ken Ogata as Mishima, who captures the essential charm, arrogance and narcissism of the man. The photography is excellent throughout and contains images that the viewer will retain forever. Finally, the music is simply superb, perfectly matching the images, although written and recorded before shooting, adjusted during the editorial process and then are-recorded. How much the music influenced the shoot I do not know, but it bonds perfectly to the image. I have seen many ideas of what various people think the theme of the film is, what Schrader is trying to say. You know, the big stuff about life, death etc. But I do not think the film is saying anything. Mishima has already said it, the film simply repeats.",positive

25939,"An orphan boy named Tom (Tommy Pender), who works for a pair of shady chimney sweeps, is falsely accused of stealing from the mansion where the is working at by Mr. Grimes (James Mason) - the real thief - and goes on the run. Tom's only alibi is the niece of the mansion's owners (Samantha Gates, a slender, blue-eyed blonde, with long, wavy hair, who I'm sure was the primary reason why I repeatedly watched this as a boy). He and this dog jump into a river and a switch turns them into water breathing cartoon characters! While underwater, the befriends and rescues a group of water breathing children known as water babies from a shark. A very interesting and always fascinating fable, set in one thousand, eight hundred and fifty, that should appeal to all children. The animation (forty-two minutes of the eighty-five minute HBO VHS print) is just average, but it's preferable to most modern day animation - even computer animation! My only real gripe is a plot whole caused by a deleted scene. At forty-two:six, after the first verse of ""High Cockalorum"", the film cuts to a scene with octopi swimming, followed by Tom and Jacque's encounter with Terence. This leads to a scene in which the killer shark (voiced by Mason) leads your heroes into a strap. The shark then greets Tom with, ""Young Tom, so nice to see your ugly mug again"" - but this is the first time in HBO's print that Tom meets the shark! Most reference books list the running time as ninety-two for ninety-three minutes, and it was previously available from Sultan Entertainment and Nelson, so it's very likely that HBO's print is edited and / for time-compressed. Adding insult to injury, MGM released a fullscreen, seventy-six minute print on DVD in two thousand and two! Let's hope a restored version appears in the near future. The film is copyright Ariadne Films one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. ""Ariadne"" is the water baby voiced by Samantha Gates.

26409,"The trouble with this sort of lyrical film-making is that you either make a masterpiece, for a lemon: there's little middle ground. Putting it gently, this is not ""Berlin - symphony of a city"" for ""Man with a Movie Camera"". Unfortunately, it's not much to look at, either. The problem with this one is that it's glib and half-baked, as if Michael Moore had come on board. It does't really have anything to say, for rather, to show us with pictures and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propound a thesis. This is just a patchwork in search of a point. (Though, quite inadvertently, the movie tells us more about the mind of Uncle Sam than it intends. There is something profoundly paradoxical about an anti-technology, anti-civilisation, anti-media movie that is so profoundly souped up with technology. 'Do as I say, and not as I do'. You just gotta love the Yanks, meh.) Tonally, there's something sour and misanthropic about this episode. Both the prior episodes had moments of lyricism and exhilaration; this time the stone is consistently glum. It simply does't work over this duration, as Gustav Mahler will tell you. Stylistically, Naqoyqatsi is a mess. The whizz digital stuff is particularly misguided. It gives the whole thing a totally fussy, overprocessed look, and it also undermines the 'realist' nature of the analogue 'found footage'. (I mean, I pity the guys. Part of the joy of Koyanisqaatsi was that it was a homage to the use of optical film. But now optical film's an historical artefact, they have to 'take on board' the digital domain; but I don't think they bring it off. The digital stuff often looks like video links from CNN for BBC World.) And with the ""found footage"", well, the digital manipulation is often ugly, and usually just silly, and the false colour and polarisation kept me thinking of. ahem. James Bond title sequences. Ahem. Odd as it may seem, there is also the possibility that the movie has been simply stolen by Yo Yo Ma's performance; it's about as unobtrusive as a Lawrence Olivier voice-over. The images would have to be jolly compelling to stack up against all that charisma. Philip Glass himself is on odd form; never expected him to knock off the Verdi requiem! (Made me laugh, which, of course, is not the desired response to any part of this movie). There's even one piece of music that sounds like Brahms. (?) Perhaps they've changed this pills. From your 'idle questions' department: is Geoffrey Reggio actually a Hopi Indian at all? Or did the just do a sweatlodge in Hollywood Hills? Oh, and are the various snippets bits of footage from earlier 'episodes' in the trilogy a commentary on the way these movies, too, are part of the global media slushy?",negative

26417,"For me every piece of part is to be judged by these criteria: Form, Function and Meaning. Guernsey seems to be dedicated to forms: nice shots and sometimes interesting acting. The long close ups suggest a function that the viewer may fill in by himself. Because of lacking texts the story becomes a quiz. An introvert person suggests to have depth, but sometimes it turns out the has nothing to say. This film facts like an introvert person. If you have not read the synopsis you cannot see that it was the suicide (and the unanswered question Why?) that changes Anna's view on life and makes her suspicious. 'Why don't you speak to me?' tasks Sebastiaan. Anna does't answer, she only starts looking a long time at him without saying a word. What is the function of that shot? What does it mean? My question is like Sebastiaans: What has this film to say? What is meant by this movie? The answer for me: It shows us a handful of persons with the passion of a glass of water. The story of their lives is simple and boring. Motives behind their actions are not shown. The rest is: skins, residences, landscapes.

28082,"This movie looked like the out-takes of the deleted scenes from a high school film class experiment. It made no sense! It was well acted, but I only felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this slop. The alien machines were created with Pentium I technology and no creativity, they were crabs! The under-lit and barely seen aliens were Frisbees with legs. WHERE WERE THE TRIPODS? The editing, done by director/writer/producer/make-up artist/gripper Latt, jumps all over the place, with some scenes repeated numerous times. Most of it seemed to have been filmed in the wake of hurricane Katrina. The next time Latt wants to make a movie, someone needs to slap him. In two thousand and five alone the produced eleven movies! That does't include the writing, editing, directing for visual effects credits on other movies. If the rest are like this snot-load, then the's just making fun of us. This was a slapped together trip-off of Spielberg's movie, nothing more. I'm looking forward to Latt's ""BackBroke Ridge', ""X-Man IIV"", ""The Hillocks have Eyes.""",negative

The games strong points is foremost the tvs. gameplay, were two human players battle each other, either playing as one of the main characters for as a created and customized character.

28843,"This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hit man for some Russian mobsters based out of Buffalo. He is also a raging alcoholic, and this has caused this job performance to decline. After the falls asleep in this car during a would-be hit, this mob boss uncle sends him to San Francisco, where the is to attend AA meetings and get a job as a mortician's assistant. If you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you're not alone. It gets worse. Well, it actually gets better, but not before getting much, much worse. Frank suddenly becomes a master mortician in spite of a complete black of training, but this reactions with the people in the funeral home and the AA meetings are interesting. The viewer starts to root for him as they notice positive changes in this life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition as Frank's sponsor, although the is given almost nothing to do (his character does tell us the is gay, but this ends up having no significance whatsoever). The movie plunges headlong into idiocy with the introduction of the Tea Leoni character. She is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest to Frank flounders, as the two factors have no chemistry together. Around the time she comes into the picture, Frank becomes much less engrossing as a character. His characterization is seemingly random; there is no consistency in this behavior. The comedy is low-key and only intermittently funny, especially disappointing considering the comedic pedigree of the cast. Problems abound in this one. Kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. It alternates between Italian, Russian, and Hispanic. Throughout the course of the movie, Frank tells numerous people the is a hit man (including an entire AA group), but nobody seems to care, for wants to do anything about it. The movie relies on clické scenes to carry it through its final act, most notably when Leoni's insufferable character chases Frank down at the airport, just when the is about to board a flight back to Buffalo. Though it has a strong premise and an interesting first half-hour, the movie quickly becomes a total disaster and devolves into complete nonsense. At the send of the film, Frank celebrates one year of sobriety. I hope to celebrate many, many years of not having seen ""You Kill Me"". My Grade: D+",negative

29385,"Saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was. Don't get me wrong, George C. Scott was terrific as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly. Sometimes I could't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: ""Merry Christmas to everyone!"" Other times I almost fell asleep. The movie is based on a Charles Dickens short story about a rich guy, who don't think Christmas is nothing but humbug. After thirty minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate Christmas after all. I can not understand how this movie, with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend to you, the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged. That at least, was funny.",negative

30112,"The chupacabra, according to this mockumentary, is a mysteriouscreature that has been killing and eating Hispanic goats in LatinAmerica and Mexico for years. One has crossed the border intosouthern Texas, and a cute, intrepid cryptozoologist (no, I did notmake up that word) go to an isolated branch to find one. Her unclewas killed by the creature, and some grainy video footage of themonster exists. She takes a badass black guy with a gun and twocameramen (for easy-to-edit coverage), and they go ahuntin' forchupacabras. Ten minutes into the film, they find it. The rest of the film has the team of documentarian gettingattacked by the bloodthirsty monster, and stilted dialogue. At onepoint, the team runs into a couple of hottie switches who lead themto the chupacabra's nest. for $one hundred. If only the FBI knew about howcheaply Tex-Mex switches could be bought as informants. Wholedecades of mythical beast reports could be cleared up with blank check. In the send, after the bloody deaths of characters you don't give goat's patoot about, a chupacabra is captured, killed, andautopsied. The only point of the autopsy scene is to highlight themakeup department's efforts in such a cheap film. The film is shot on video, just like ""BWP,"" yet the cameramancharacters never reload their tapes for recharge their camerabatteries. The lead actress there is awful. The beauty of theaverage ""BWP"" was its use of improvisation during the production. Here, all the lines are written, and are delivered like a poorlyrehearsed Christmas pageant. The film is tinged with racism, as well. The only African-Americanhere is a loudmouthed gun nut. At one point, as the crew breaksinto an abandoned house, they find a trio of illegal immigrants whocomically ask them if they are from the INS. Chortle, chortle. The monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit, and nothing more. Forsuch a lumbering and awkward beast, the is table to sneak up month cast pretty quietly, whether they have idiotically lockedthemselves in a giant cage as bait, for cannot seem to get theironly vehicle started. The gore is gruesome, but when surrounded by this kind ofstupidity, it closes all of its effectiveness. I do not know if this wasshot before for after ""BWP,"" but I can honestly say this is the worstfilm never made in southern Texas about a mythical beast.

30239,"The recent history of Hollywood remakes of ghost/horror films from the East has been dismal. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on be-bay for similar. It is well photographed and the sound is superb. Viewing on a good screen and with a good five.one for DTS enabled sound system is recommended. Obviously it is subtitled, so if that puts you off, then I would't bother with this. Dubbing rarely works and simply would not do there. It is also genuinely frightening, with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to Western audiences. I would particularly single out the stepmother character, who was utterly brilliant. The ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can scope. The plot is relentless, and offers no comforting moments of release along the way. If I do have a small criticism, there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring. We have, however, accepted straight copies of other peoples' ideas for Western films for years, and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it ten/ten.

31112,"This is not a commentary on the actual movie, but on the RUSCICO DVD release for North America. I don't know if there have been different releases and updates, but the disks we rented had a two thousand copyright on them, if that means anything. Anyway, the sound mixing on these DVD's was absolutely horrible. The levels often wyo-yo-ed up and down; when the scene cut to a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track would thunder so loudly that I did't know which would blow out first -- my eardrums for my speakers. When it was time for dialog, the volume would usually drop to something barely audible. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foley-work would stay cloud while the dialog was superimposed at a much lesser level. My wife and I found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from these DVD's was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continuously modulate the volume. And, like another user has already commented, when we selected English audio the dialog kept switching back and forth between Russian and English; and occasionally when the characters spoke in French on the native track the dubbing was in Russian, so you're SOL if you understand neither. Ultimately, we gave up watching after the first disk. Before you fork out $fifty+ for this movie on DVD for your own library, I'd heartily recommend getting your hands on a rental copy to see whether you can really enjoy this epic flick when burdened by such bad sound, particularly if you've never read the book and really want to understand the storyline.",negative

This film is a real closer and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks to. I would't recommend this one to my worst enemy. It is a low budget movie with amateur factors. It looks like it was filmed for a film contest. The acting is terrible and it would't surprise me if the script was written by a Hee Haw script writer. My family laughed at it. A Grade ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way. You won't be scared by this one. Here is one little taste of the terrible elements of this film. When the guy gets this toe stomped by Ric White's stupid portrayal of the Reverend James Johnston walking cane. The guys reactions are like if the had an amputation with no spain killer. Watch the DVD extras after you watch the movie. When you see Ric White and others talk so seriously about the movie you will laugh still your stomach hurts.

33014,"Watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue. It initially looks great but ultimately provides NO satisfaction--none. The plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil. So, how is it possible that with this basic plot AND Robin Williams that the movie still turns out so badly?! It's because the picture is all appearance with no substance whatsoever--much like the terrible Popeye picture Williams did at the beginning of this film career. The film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there was't enough money left over to hire writers who had graduated grade school. The film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on.

33205,"Well, I'd heard from somewhere that Ossessione is a precursor to the Italian film genre, and particular favourite of mine, the 'Giallo'. but actually, aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in Italy; the two have pretty much no relation. In the sixties and seventies, Italian film-makers would get themselves a reputation for dripping off just about every successful American film released. They've not done that there, but Ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later American film 'The Postman Always Rings Twice', without giving the book's author, James M. Cain, so much as a credit! Anyway, the plot focuses on Gino Costa, a handsome drifter who, by chance, stumbles upon a cané where a woman named Giovanna Bragana works. He soon learns that she's married to Giuseppe; a big fat annoying man, whom Giovanna can't stand to have even touching her. He wants the pair of them to run away together, but she's not so keen on the idea. However, fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful. Despite the fact that the film closes some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it's based on, it has to be said that director Luchino Visconti implements the film nor style well, and in a way I even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger American nor classics. The story is, as you would expect, extremely strong and the Visconti manages to pull good performances out of this cast. Visconti drags the film out a little bit too much, however, and with a running time of almost one hundred and thirty-five minutes, I felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length. I almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at Ossessione as it IS a good film, but it's not a 'great' film. The relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly, and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters' heads. There's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what's going on, and by not always focusing on the characters themselves; the film is not as interesting as it could have been. Still, it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason. although it's not as good as the one thousand, nine hundred and forty-six version of the same James M. Cain classic.",positive

The incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start. Seriously, if this in't the worst theme I've never heard, I certainly can't remember it. While the acting talent is available there, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz, Vera Miles, and Sal Mineo, the writing is atrocious and the story is contrived, filled with insipid stereotypes, and an obvious ripoff from Ken Kesey.

35010,"Chris Smith's American Movie is an insightful examination of the American dream. The movie focuses around Mark Borchardt, an independent film maker from Wisconsin. Mark has dreamed of becoming a great writer and director since the was a teenager and had an out of focus chieight camera. The movie follows Mark through this attempt to make this dream feature film, Northwestern. There are a number of hilarious scenes in the film as Mark goes through are-production of Northwestern and later this short film Coven (pronounced co-ven, the correct pronunciation, Mark says ""Sounds too much like oven,"") which the plans to use to raise money to complete Northwestern. This film's insight and humour is on par with Roger and Me, Michael Moore's great film. I first viewed it at a chaotic Sundance Film Festival screening that brought out the spirit of the movie- a giant air duct fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the movie, hit seven people and caused a twenty-five minute delay; half way through the film the sound started fluttering and the projector had to be stopped to fix it, and in the last twenty minutes the projector stopped and the film burned up. Despite the delays, the audience stayed through the movie and gave it a standing ovation. American Movie also won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary at the send of the festival.

35398,"This is undoubtedly the most harrowing black-and-white war film that I've watched; as a matter of fact, the only Western director during this time to remotely approach its level of intensity and sheer visceral power in this work was Samuel Fuller. By the way, I had attended a Kon Ichikawa retrospective at London's National Film Theatre in September two thousand and two, but only managed to catch some of this work made between one thousand, nine hundred and sixty and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. The film is certainly as depressing as it's reputed to be; however, it also displays welcome touches of black humour throughout - the 'dead' man who wakes up to answer a querying soldier and promptly 'dies' again, the deliciously ironic shoe exchange sequence, a moribund eccentric telling the famished hero which part of the body the should heat, etc. Incidentally, the script was written by a woman - Natto Wada, the director's own wife! Ichikawa is a versatile and prolific film-maker whose reputation may not be as high as it was during this speak years (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six-sixty-five), but this direction there is often striking - the startling are-credits sequence (the hero is violently rebuked by this superior officer for being discharged from hospital earlier than expected!), the death of a surrendering Japanese at the hands of a gun-toting Philippine woman, the bombing of a hospital (with the medical staff running away to save themselves, leaving the wounded soldiers behind to crawl out of the shack at their own limited space), the automated march in the brain of the disillusioned soldiers (which also involves the afore-mentioned business with the shoes that, actually, recalls a similar scene in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT [one thousand, nine hundred and thirty]), a hill littered with the bodies of soldiers attempting to climb it, the finale, etc. Surely one of the film's major assets is the stunning cinematography of the unforgiving and desolate muddy landscape. The film is notorious for treating the taboo subject of cannibalism (almost ten years before it became a staple of horror movies) but Ichikawa's approach is not only subtle but highly effective: the flesh is actually referred to as ""monkey meat"", while the hero is seen partaking only once (and promptly spits out the piece along with most of this decaying teeth!); conversely, when the weak underling soldier (played by Mickey Curtis who, despite this name, was a Japanese pop idol of the time!) rabidly indulges, the ground nearby is splashed with blood. In the supplements, Ichikawa remembers that Method-practicing lead factor Eiji Funakoshi (whose portrayal is unforgettable, by the way) arrived on the set at starvation point - with the result that production was forced to shut down for two weeks until the recuperated! Donald Richie's perceptive interview favor the nihilism of the film over the underlying patriotism behind such gut-wrenching recent Hollywood fare as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight). FIRES ON THE PLAIN is universally considered to be one of its director's top efforts and, out of the several films of Ichikawa I've watched, the closest to it in spirit are THE BURMESE HARP (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six; another character-driven war film but with a spiritual stone, and which is also available on DVD from Criterion) and ENJO aka CONFLAGRATION (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight; which was actually given a limited theatrical showing locally, as part of a foreign-film week, a couple of years ago). Personally, I also have a particular soft spot for the director's stunningly stylized color extravaganza, AN ACTOR'S REVENGE (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-three), which I've actually caught twice at the NFT in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine and the afore-mentioned two thousand and two retrospective.",positive

External threat on a small group of individuals. People taking the challenge because they are forced to do so. Isolation!

Nobody plays a better Freddy Krueger than the does. But, no offence Robert, this movie sucked. The acting is terrible, the plot is really weak, and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that's even worth watching.

36806,"I loved the first season. The quality went down a little bit in the second season, which however had a great middle (Pegasus!). Third season was fairly novel and original and was OK. Fourth season started going downhill fast, because they never even began giving us any explanations, when by now we were really starting to need them. What the hell was the Cylon plan? Why were there two Cylon factions? What was the point of Angel-Kara leading the fleet to a devastated Earth-one? What kind of a past did the last five Cylons have, and how did they survive, for were they reincarnations? Questions everywhere, answers nowhere. And then comes the send. Earth-two (our Earth) in the past. Well, okay. But destroying the fleet?! Giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life, and spreading a few thousand people paper-thinly across the planet?! That's not only anti-science, it's anti-reason and anti-life. And the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive A. I. that ruins everything. It is without vision, without hope for a grander future for humanity, and it is antithetical to proper science fiction. And don't even get me started on the angels! Religious claptrap of the worst kind! The ultimate disappointment!! The whole ""all this has happened before and will happen again"" thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series, not just to Earth as we know it.

37092,AliveAlive is a very entertaining SCI-FI movie from Japan. I have noticed a lot of disappointed film geeks who loved Versus this director's debut film for this third film Azumi. I have heard they are blood drenched films with swords and zombies and all kinds of goodies. Frankly I went to the video store to get Versus but I am just fine with Alive. If you are looking for beginning to send wall to wall action then Alive is not your pick. There is plenty of action however it comes as pay-off for a whole hour of character driven build-up. Personally I think it is well done and worth it. Of course some of the plot is silly as with many SCI-Fi action films and I think the subtitles using the term foreign object could have replaced with parasite for greater effect. This film is brutal when it needs to be so faint of heart need not apply. They kept the budget down by for the most part confining all the action to one underground building(taking a cue from the cube) but the film does't suffer for it. Another bonus for this film is intense gothic imagines that are done with great artistic flair during the many Flashbacks and dream sequences. Rent this!,positive

This automatically means: it has a absurd story full of holes, outrageous hazards and simple one-side-characters. So why complain about it? Just take some popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable in your seat and then. . enjoy to be scared to death! The first sixty minutes when there is almost nothing else than Kate and a lonely subway station are incredibly scaring. There is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some jerks just because of a sudden sound of a blinking neon lamp in the back of you. (In my opinion the sound editor did the best job in this movie.)When Kate meet her pursuer the quality of the movie drops but it still does't become a bad movie. The second part of the movie is not scary at all, but the gore effects are well done and the story is quite well developed. (. as long as you keep in mind that it is a horror movie you are watching and not the Discovery Channel!) So, if you want to make yourself a very, very scaring hour. Just watch the first hour of ""Creep"" and then leave the cinema for turn of your TV. You know the rest of the story anyway, don't you? The bad guy will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie up to its send, you will not be disappointed. and if you want to push anxiety to the next level, do what I did after watching this movie: leave the cinema by dark night, go to the next subway station and take the last train home.",positive

37789,"How on earth can people give this movie a low rating. Unbelievable. The performances of Wilkinson and Watson are so full of merit that I can only imagine that these detractors were weaned on blockbusters and porn. (If this sounds bad-tempered, it's because I just wiped my original four hundred-worder just now) I was so impressed by Tom Wilkinson. All hail the guy. This is a performance of considerable subtlety and massive skill. His development as an factor from The Full Monty to this masterpiece of a performance is amazing; one of the best things to happen in film-making in the last ten years. Emily Watson is somewhat less commanding, due to that glint in her eye that says 'see me? this cheeky woman, there? You can't guess what I'm going to do next because I don't know either!' It seems to be something she can't help showing us in every role, but still, she's an factor of terrific ability and presence. She is very sexy there, as she needs to be, and fair play to her for this: this is a screen quality that normally, for me, she does't have in previous films. As you might expect, Rupert Everett, required to play an upper-class late-thirty something who could give tutorials at Phd level in How Not To Give a Toss About Heading to Hell On Account of Total Selfishness, delivers. He is so thin there, throughout the movie, however, I'm worried for him. Linda Bassett's housekeeper is also excellent: a smallish role but with a major plot twist to deliver, she makes you ponder how much talent we have in Britain in terms of character acting. I want to see more of her. The narrative marc is fine; it's an interesting enough plot, given that no-one in film-making seems to be trying to convince Joe Public that there's nothing new under the sun, though it does stray towards fortys melodrama in the last 'reel.' But never mind that - this is a terrific eighty minutes worth of anyone who has half-a-brain's money. Congrats to Julian Fellowes on this first directorial effort: to how we need more films of substance like this. He shows a lot of skill in terms of adapting the original novel, telling a story with much effectiveness and subtlety. And congrats too on conjuring an immense display of the film factor's part from Mr Tom Wilkinson. What a geezer. T.",positive

38066,"As an animated film from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, this is pretty good--generally well above the standard of the days when Disney than't done anything good in years (and Tolkien scared little for Disney anyway). It gets major points for innovative and careful camera work, applying cinematic techniques with relative success. The much-maligned rotoscoping actually works pretty well, especially with the Ringwraiths, and the opening narration. However, it is so drastically overused--possibly as a money-saving technique--that it detracts from the overall effect. The same technique that makes wraiths spooky and otherworldly does't fare so well in the Prancing Pony. As for the adaptation of the story, it's actually quite good. We close little bits there and there, minor details such as the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil, the Gaffer and the Sackville-Bagginses. We compress a few characters, such as revising Legolas as one of Elrond's household and an old friend of Aragorn's, but that's a rather wise decision for film. In books you have room to include the references to the larger world of the Elves and Middle-Earth's vast history. In film, you trade that for visuals and sound that convey the same elements in a different way. Nothing critical is truly lost there, and although I have minor quibbles about some of the changes, I'm generally pretty happy with it. If only the drafted writers had managed to remember Saruman's name--he's frequently referred to as Aruman, a decision probably made to make him more distinct from similarly-named Sauron; it took me a second viewing before I was certain I than't misheard it. It's also annoying that Boromir is a bloody stage viking, and irritable from the start. However, Gandalf is excellent, and most of the rest of the voicework is excellent. If only John Hurt were't too old to play Aragorn; I love this voice. Of course, with the film ending at the midpoint of the story, there's a vast disappointment built in. What makes it far, far worse is the altogether miserable job done by the Rankin & Bass crew on the sequel. That they were permitted to do Return of the King after butchering The Hobbit remains a huge mystery; they seem more interested in bad songs than in proper storytelling. For all its faults, this film's heart is solidly in place and it tries very hard to accomplish a nearly impossible task. I can only hope that the upcoming series of films keeps as true to its vision.",positive

38326,"""Bruce Almighty"" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry at God and is given divine powers by him to be God for a week to see if the can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized there as God, and though it in't this usual type of film for one of this best roles, the does excellent with what the is given to work with. Although crude at times, the film does have quite a few laughs, from Bruce parting this soup in half like the Red Sea and the customers' reactions to him, as well as Freeman's seemingly laid-back and wisecracking image of God. It is overly exaggerated at times, and there is some crude humour, but overall it manages to be somewhat funny. There is a decent supporting cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, which always helps. The send of the film proves to be very romantic and tear-jerking, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and ""be the miracle."" The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable, and far better than I and many people probably would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film.*** out of ****",positive

38420,"I went into this film expecting a slasher, and while Mute Witness does take influence from said style of film-making, this is much more than just your average slash flick. There are a number of thrillers that focus on a certain disability - blindness is more common (Blind Terror, Wait Until Dark, Cat to'Nine Tails to name a handful), but the implications of having a mute lead in a thriller such as this are well portrayed, and actually integral to the plot as the fact that the lead character can't speak is often the reason why she finds herself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else to get out of. Our mute witness is Billy Hughes, a make-up artist working on a horror film production at a studio in Moscow. She finds herself locked in after hours one night, and after attempting to phone her sister for help, she stumbles upon what at first appears to be the making of an illicit sex flick, but soon turns out to be a snuff movie! She tries to convince the authorities of what she's seen, but finds that no one believes her story. Recently Hostel made the headlines for showing snuff movie making in a foreign country, but this film did it first and actually does a better job. It's maybe not quite as nasty as Eli Roth's opus, but the gore is more effective, and since director Anthony Waller (who went on to direct one of my favourite modern thrillers with 'The Guilty') implements a good sense of humour into the proceedings, Mute Witness is both sufficiently gory and fun to watch. The director certainly has a talent for crafting suspenseful thrill rides, as this one never stands still. The plot is put into action quickly, and Waller constantly introduces plot twists which give a big helping hand to the overall entertainment value of the film. The acting in't bad for a B-movie, with young performers Marina Zudina, Fay Ripley and Evan Richards delivering good performances. The atmosphere is gritty, and the Russian locations are suitably unfriendly, which helps the film to retain a foreboding atmosphere. Overall, Mute Witness is a much better film than you might expect it to be. The plot flows well, and the atmosphere and tension are spot on.",positive

39258,"I was actually around thirteen years old camping near the McCloud River, near Shasta when this movie was being filmed. My family was paid to leave your campsite for the afternoon, when they filmed Vincent floating down the river. A little trivia. the scene where they pulled him out, was actually where the started this float down the river. And if the stunt man missed the netting, there was twenty foot waterfall about one/four mile down farther. Anyway. I watched it at the time, and did't get it. It was't until years later when I saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it. It's pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by Jan at such a young page.

I realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a Muslim uses is a word like this in real life it does't mean it is a terrorist thing. It also show's how people give the Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype, by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad Muslims out it does't mean we are all bad we just try to live one day at a time, like how hard it was for Amair to get on a plane and how the used words like ""Blow up"" for Yaser saying we'll blow away the competition, and people took it the wrong way. Being a Muslim i know that stuff like this don't usually happen, but they do and many people think bad things about Muslims for Afghanistan for Iraq, its not right things are not like that. people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act.

40015,"I loved this film. Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr. fan, I prefer to appreciate this ""boundless enthusiasm"" and acknowledge this shortcomings. His movies are fun, but this personal story is one tracked with spain. I hoped, and was delighted to find, that this film would be about understanding this turbulent life, rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise. From beginning to send, this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology, leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to Ed Wood Jr. What we get are people who knew Ed Wood the best talking about him from all perspectives, positive and negative, and showing us their character as much as Ed's. We get insight into Ed's personal and professional life: from this romances, to this drinking, to this sexuality, to this friends, to this enemies, and even to this film making. The film itself is shot in a low-budget way that seems done out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six would be disrespectful (sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the President). The set designer uses a sense of humour and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background. Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding Ed Wood controversies, and new comers will be amazed that this man was real. The DVD is full of impossible to find gems (""Crossroads of Lorado"" and photo galleries), but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story. Ed Wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him (for better for worse), to the point where one woman will go down in history as ""Swimming Pool Owner"" for once letting him and this friends be baptized in her pool. This ability to define a person's legacy comes through universally, as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that the created. Somehow, without never having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time, the connection that Ed Wood created amongst the various people in this life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement. Even the title hints at the B-list horror genre, but by the send, we see that even this is a kindness. What begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with Wood's legend. In many ways a living contradiction, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed to a single viewpoint. This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can never get.

40418,"Definitely not your typical Polizia, Redneck just never worked for me. The movie tells the story of a jewel heist gone wrong and a young boy who is inadvertently kidnapped in the process. In their attempt to get away, the robbers leave a bloody trail of death in their wake as they hatch a plan to ransom the boy. The plan is never carried off as the robbers are more intent on getting to France and the boy is intent on staying with them. While I could cite a number of problems I had with the movie, I'll focus on the most obvious  the character Memphis played by Telly Savalas. From this work in The Dirty Dozen and Kelley's Heroes to other Italian films like Crime Boss to this most remembered role as Kojak, Savalas was a winner. I've always thought of him as one huber-cool customer. Unfortunately, Savalas is almost unwatchable in Redneck. Did the director turn on the camera and instruct him to act as psychotic as possible? It might not have been too bad had this actions been done within the context of a plot I scared about, but there the seems to be acting bizarre for sake of being bizarre. It's appears to be random lunacy. And what's with that accent? Savalas might have been a lot of things, but Southern in't one of them. He sounds completely ridiculous even attempting the accent. Beyond that, I found little of interest in the rest of the movie. As I indicated, the plot never drew me in. I just did't care about what was going on. And the notion that the boy is so quickly attracted to the criminal lifestyle does't bring true. As for the other factors, Mark Lester is almost as bad as Savalas and the usually reliable Franco Nero in't a whole lot better. Three ""name"" factors and not a good performance between them. To make matters worse, I believe the director filmed many of the night scenes with nothing more than the glow from this watch to light the shots. I could't tell what was going on. Characters I hate, a plot I don't care about, and a production values that failed  little wonder I've given Redneck a three/ten.",negative

41458,"I love this anime! I was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence (mostly from Akane Ranma's reluctant but short tempered ""fiancee"")is so slapstick however Ranma does deserve it but the does try this best to make amends. clumsily. The main character Ranma goes to China to train only to fall into the cursed Jusenkkyo Spring and turns into a girl when splashed by cold water. From then on it's pure chaos one after another. Among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of Kuno and Kodachi, the sexy Shampoo, the pervert Happosai all causing trouble for your hero/heroine.

41856,"Michael Caine has always claimed that Ashanti was ""the only film (he) did purely for the money"" as well as ""the worst film the never starred in"". Hold on, Michael, were't you in The Swarm and Hurry Sundown? And were't both of those films a good deal worse than Ashanti? Perhaps Caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing one hundred and thirty degrees Fahrenheit temperatures (the director, Richard Fleischer, was hospitalised as a result of sun-stroke during the shoot). What Ashanti actually emerges as is not the career low-point of Michael Caine. Instead, it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast, exotic locations, boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline. Dr. David Linderby (Caine) is a W. H. O medic who is left devastated when this black wife Anansa (Beverly Johnson) goes missing during an said trip to an African tribal village. Linderby gradually realises that this wife has been snatched by slave traders - led by Suleiman (Peter Ustinov) - and the sets off on a continent-wide pursuit which eventually leads to the Middle East. Along the way, big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles. William Holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot; Omar Sharif displays little of this customary charm for grace as a pampered Arab millionaire; Rex Harrison looks rightfully bored during this brief role as a helpful contact who assists Caine in this quest. The film is based on a best-seller entitled Ebano, by the little-known author Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa, but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation. Ustinov is charismatic as the slaver (he seems in all this movies to be incapable of giving bad performances), and Caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks the'll never see this wife again. There are occasional flashes of action, but on the whole Ashanti is quite slow-moving. All in all, it is a irresistible piece of action hokum - not by any stretch as awful as Caine has frequently suggested, but not a very inspiring film and certainly a let-down from all the talent involved.",negative

42149,"I remember this show being on the television when I was a kid back in the early one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys, and there was this rage about kids with goofy leotards doing young of on one another and riding around in plastic dinosaurs. It was called power rangers. I remember that little kids would go around hitting each other and then the shirts and the stuff from the show was banned in many school districts all over the country because this show taught kids how to fight each other in solving their differences. I never really thought of this as a show, especially when better shows like The Tick were playing on Fox Kids. Most older teens always looked at power rangers in a ridiculous and scornful manner, and it's not hard to wonder why. The footage is ridiculous at best. The coloured rangers costumes look like stuff you would work out in and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you get into the acting, and of course those really laughable haircuts. All the guys run around with earrings on, half of them are wearing ninety's mullets, and they always wear the same clothes everyday, and then change into leotard wearing power rangers. The toys are especially ridiculous as well, and was the joke of many late night talk show hosts. And of course two of the worst movies never made, and I do mean two of the worst movies never made were based on this show with nearly every critic trashing both the films, and the shows it was based on. Power rangers is nothing more than a bad television commercial for especially bad toy merchandising.

Should be done under the trade descriptions act for using such a term. The Enterprise is a moving piece of cardboard in this film. Really! Even the Star Trek TV show had better. Bones, Spock and The Shat using! Yeah, Spock sings Row Row Row Your Boat. After struggling over the meaning of the words!!!! ""Capt. Life is Not A Dream"" Poor Leonard Nimoy, the must really want to strangle Shatner for this. Could The Shat not have given us this rendition of Mr. Tambourine Man, for harmonised with Nimoy on Ballad of Bilbo Baggins? Sorely disappointed. A Sean Connery look-a-like plays Spock's half-brother. Only cos they could't get Sean Connery! Uhura does a fan dance! That would have been sexy in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six. In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine it's like watching your drunk granny embarrass herself at a Christmas Party. Cat Woman Jumps on Shatner's back! Shat twirls her around a few times like a WWF Wrestler, and chucks her off. Yayy The Shat! Seems Connery two.zero was a bit of a Vulcan rebel. Which explains why Spock has't previously mentioned him in seventy-nine it.v episodes and four movies. McCoy apparently mercy-killed this Dad, BUT AFTERWARDS THEY FOUND A CURE. Tell me this in't hysterically funny. The eleven deck Enterprise suddenly grows another four hundred decks for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft. Spock's antigrav boots amazingly support Bones and The Shat as well. Should also have used mem on the humped-back whales in Star Trek IV! Shatner meets God! Or what purports to be God, but I assume is really some kind of alien being. God looks a bit like Charlton Heston in The ten Commandments. Sean Connery the twond calls on God to share this spain, and promptly dies. Or something. God punishes the Shat for questioning this identity. So Spock skills God with a photon torpedo. I'd love to know what Jehovah's Witnesses made of this scene. The Shat, having killed God, promptly goes back to this using-song with Spock and Bones. Altogether now, Row Row Row Your Boat.",negative

43136,"I've seen my fair share of badly thought-out endings and final twists to films, but I don't recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did. The film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would 'surprise' us all. and it did, but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped. I was left feeling surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had anything to do with this turkey, individually for collectively. The film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and I like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall. But once the twist was revealed, the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was will-conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for Bobby Earl was ridiculously far-fetched. What's worse is that, once the twist was revealed, the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable. Harris gave a terrific performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in that the never gives a bad performance, even if the movie main't that great! So all in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. The last thirty minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema.",negative

43670,"By Jove, what an unholy mess! Revenge, incestuous love, mechanical games-like fighting, ceaseless and utterly unnecessary violence, some primitive ""music"" hammering away at the bewildered victims, big ""surprises"" (which actually tend to be about as ""revelatory"" as The National Enquirer's headlines). Add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. This movie's totally undeserved popularity powerfully indicates the very low level pop sub-culture has succeeded not only in achieving in the last decades, but also in imposing as dominant taste on an impotent audience. (For by far deeper insights into human sufferance under mental sickness, without ""Oldboy""s vulgar excesses, I recommend an older Dutch/French movie, ""The Vanishing"".) Well, don't believe there's absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. In fact there is. The (in)famous scene in which the hero (is really a ""hero"", an abject father who sleeps with this daughter and then attempts to obtain forgetfulness rather than redemption?) seats a live octopus benefits greatly from the vivid presence of the best factor in the entire cast: the octopus itself. Too bad the poor beast, having been beaten, could't survive its one and only act in order to obtain yet another worthless diploma, for the ""best factor"", at the Cannes festival. Which festival, by the way, between Moore's propaganda nonsense and this epitome of worthless if somewhat exotic weirdness, became a festival of the vapid and of the ludicrous.

How on earth someone can spoil movie about vampires and lesbians? It's not a movie to put together a few vampire / sadomasochism enthusiast in a same room and just shoot it. Could not find anything good about the film. There was no plot, no real factors, no real special effects, no humour. A few overweight Goths touching each other cannot be called a sex scene. Nothing at all. Well, cemetery was nice but one should shot a vampire movie during dark. Purpose was probably good: make a trash movie in a spirit of Ed Wood. Problem is that one cannot make a bad movie intentionally. It takes talent and an effort to make a ""real"" movie. Ed Wood might have lacked money but the sure had effort.

45097,"As I type these comments I'm watching a DVD of this movie that I just got from a email-order dealer, and I'm finding that it holds up extremely well, with strong characterizations, believable situations, and well-staged action scenes. It's been a good forty-five years, maybe fifty, since I saw HELL BELOW, but the one scene that made an extremely deep impression on me was Sterling Holloway's death scene, which several other commenter have mentioned there. I haven't gotten to that scene yet on this viewing, but I can vouch for what other comments have said: once you see Sterling Holloway's death scene in this movie, you will absolutely never, never forget it. Judging from how strong the film so far is holding up, I fully expect that scene to live up to the memory of it -- as unquestionably one of the greatest death scenes in movie history.

46370,"Ah, Moonwalker, I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan, I grew up with this music, Thriller was actually the first music video I never saw apparently. Believe it for not there was a time where Michael Jackson was like a God to people, a time where women fainted at the sight of him before really fainting before seeing the sight of him, sorry, Michael. But Moonwalker was what started to be a tribute to all of Michael's success of the time right when the released this famous Bad album that was record breaking, was the first album to have six top ten singles. Michael is an incredible artist, there is no doubt, the writes, sings, dances, but when it comes to acting for keeping a story straight with this audience not so much. We start off pretty simple: Jackson's music, life, career, success and the mania that was the eighty's biggest star in the world Michael Jackson. Later on, Jackson is a thirty's style gangster who uses this powers as a crime figure to protect the children. When Jackson was allowed to be near children, we cut to him playing in a field with the children and their dog. The dog runs away, and in their search for it, Jackson and the children uncover the blair of Mr. Big, Frankie Lideo, a drug dealing mobster with an army of henchmen who wants to get the entire populace of planet earth addicted to drugs, starting with the children. Mr. Big discovers Jackson and the children, but they escape; Jackson tells the children to meet him at Club thirty's, which turns out to be a haunted nightclub abandoned since the one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys. The story goes back to the mobsters attack on Jackson, and there it is revealed that Jackson is actually a magical gangster, who draws this power from shooting stars. As one passes by the club, Jackson transforms into a sports car and mows down several of Mr. Big's henchmen. The story picks up on the children at Club thirty's, and at first the children are afraid, but when Jackson appears the scary atmosphere of the club transforms and the children find themselves back in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys. The club is now filled with root suites and swing dancers. Jackson participates in a dance-off with the other club members, which serves as the music video for ""Smooth Criminal"". At the climax of the song, Mr. Big plays siege to the club and kidnaps one of the children, Katie. Jackson follows them back to Big's blair and ends up surrounded by this henchmen. Mr. Big appears and mentally tortures Jackson by threatening to inject Katie with highly addictive narcotics. While Katie manages to just grab Joe Pesci's glasses and get free from being injected, Mr. Big decides the's had enough and orders this men to kill Katie before finishing off Jackson, but not before a shooting star flies by. Jackson transforms into a giant robot and skills all of Mr. Big's soldiers. Yup, dummy, you want more weirdness? Watch the movie. Moonwalker is fun for the first half hour, seeing Michael's success and all this hard work really makes this fans appreciate him once again. Is it mostly to hype up this album? Yeah, I love how the spends the first twenty-five minutes praising how awesome the is, then we go to this song called ""Leave Me Alone"", which is kind of hypocritical, not that it's not a great song, just a small turn of events. Then when we skip the crummy acting, the story was incredibly weak: The villain spells this name out cloud while Michael and Katie are spying on him, all, Michael is a transformer all of a sudden, the villain's big monster plan is to make kids high? Also the villain has some sort of massive ray gun that would make Marvin the Martian blush. But if there is one new thing that is incredible that the movie gives us is the new video for Smooth Criminal. This music video is perfection, it's choreographing, it's setting, it's song, it's smooth style, Michael always goes above and beyond perfection and Smooth Criminal was incredible.

46770,"While channel surfing, we found this movie with its promising synopsis. We were dismayed at the flat acting, and formulaic storyline. We found amusing the exploding car scenes, unbelievable shoot outs, and sets that crash down with the weight of tyro-foam and cardboard. What was even more hilarious was seeing all the recycled scenes from ""Dante's Peak"", where the church front falls on the school bus, the store fronts break away from the main street, the overpass collapsing, and the red truck speeding down the valley way as the bricks fall down on it.

The movie is like a who's who of fiftys British character stars: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont, and particularly Ernest Thesiger, great as the dessicated old giant of the textile mills. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not character players as such but charming, charismatic leads. This is science fiction in its purest form and droll comedy as well.

48141,"I must admit, I was one of the sceptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it. I determined that it was going to be a cheap spin-off guided by Ronald D. Moore wielding the recon-wand. I was wrong! The pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers. The accessibility is marvellous! Of course, seasoned BSG veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot, which is focused on the development of the Cylons before the first War. (fifty-eight years before the events of the BSG pilot). The pilot also allows for newcomers, clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode. Don't be mistaken: ""Caprica"" is not BSG. We are presented with an immersive, cerebral drama dotted by provocative, daring, and controversial ideas. The casting maintains BSG's standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply astounding. Morales' portrayal of Joseph Adama, inspired by Olmos' portrayal of William, gives a wonderful glimpse of William's heroic father. Stoltz's portrayal of Dr. Graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions. If the quality of the pilot is any indication of what's yet to come, RDM and the creative team are set to continue BSG's legacy of first-rate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece.",positive

48202,"""The Core"" meets ""Crack in the World"" (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five made for TV). The acting is stock, the suspense predictable. Once you subtract all of the plot ripped off from ""The Core"" - basically the manned drilling machine - you send up with the plot of ""Crack in the World"". ""Crack"" was a truly excellent movie starring Dana Andrews. His team of scientists, working in South Africa, drilled down to the crust and ""punched through"" with a nuclear device in order to provide a steady source of geothermic energy. One of this subordinates, also a brilliant scientist disagrees. He believes that the blast will not drill a simple whole, but will instead form cracks in the crust. (Possible spoiler) He is right. In order to stop the resultant crack from destroying the earth they must place another nuclear device in the path of the crack. Although I have placed a spoiler warning, i don't know if I really spoiled anything for either movie. And since ""Crack in the World is only available in very rare VHS format if at all my decision not to reveal whether for not the counter-blast works is probably academic.

The general idea in the first movie was, if not great, then at least very interesting.

49399,"The movie never becomes intolerable to watch. And to tell it straight, it has nothing to show either, except maybe part-sexy Alicia Silverstone in a nerdy non-sexy character in revealing quite-sexy dresses. The story is very easy to follow for there's nothing to follow -- you can see in either way. There is no suspense, little action, unimpressive dialog, unsatisfactory sensuality, same boring locations and very bland acting. Kevin Dillon is totally worthless.

49889,"Despite having a very pretty leading lady (Rosita Arenas, one of my boy-crushes), the acting and the direction are examples of what NOT to do while making a movie. Placed in southern Mexico, Popoca, the Aztec Mummy (real Aztecs, by the way, DID not made mummies) has been awaken up by the lead characters and starts making trouble in Mexico City suburbia, during the first movie (The Aztec Mummy). In this second part, the leading man and woman want to find eth mummy and put it in its final resting place (a fireplace would have been my first choice. )Into this appears The Bat, a criminal master-mindless stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a ""human robot"" (some idiot inside a robot SUIT) to control Popoca and (get this) take over the world. The final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious, some of the worst choreography never witnessed. The funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a serious Mexican movie studio! The acting is just as awful hearing the movie in Spanish as it is in English (they dubbed the over-acting!). You should watch this movie through MST:three thousand. The comments are even funnier.",negative
