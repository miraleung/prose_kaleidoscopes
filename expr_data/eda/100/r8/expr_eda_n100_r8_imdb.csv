219,"Ed Wood rides again. The fact that this movie was made should give any youngaspiring film maker hope. Any screenplay you might have thought of using hotline a letterbox for a birdcage should now not seem that bad. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol for Rolaids. Watching thismovie made me realize that Boa tvs. Python was not that bad after all. It probably would have been better to do this movie in Claymation as at least that way no factor would have had to take credit for being in this film. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases. There is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips, then you can heat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you tomake your toward your TV set's cocoon of cheese that surrounds it.",negative
258,"Black comedy in't always an easy sell. Every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful, like Fargo, for example. But usually they don't often find big audiences. People seem to either set their minds for comedy, for for serious mayhem. There does't seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both. Throw Momma From the Train was a fairly decent hit, yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and page. Danny DeVito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven. DeVito plays an odd mamma's boy named Owen looking to grid himself of this outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom the still lives with. The mother is played by Anne Ramsey, who passed away shortly after this was released, and she is quite a caricature. She is cloud, ugly, crude, and overbearing. Though Owen hardly seems like the could take care of himself, the wants desperately to have this mother offed. He fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes, but the clearly does't have the guts to actually do it himself. That's where Billy Crystal comes in. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen's creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid would-be intellectual novelist who claims this sex-wife stole this novel and made millions off it. He is currently trying to write a new one, but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence. ""The night was. "" Owen hears Larry wish this sex-wife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria. And borrowing the idea from Strangers on a Train, Owen decides to travel to Hawai'i and murder Larry's sex-wife. Once it appears the has done so, the expects Larry to return the favor and kill this mother. The resulting action is often quite funny, and even poignant. It's certainly never dull and often full of surprises. The acting is exceptional, even if Ramsey was a bit over the top. Crystal is as good as the can be, and DeVito has always been undervalued as a performer. The film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works, often painfully so. The film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes, and the off-beat stone is truly refreshing. I have often been critical of the late one thousand, nine hundred and eightys as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film-making. Throw Momma From the Train takes chances. Both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot. How many comedies revolve around a son having this mother murdered? The film in't too long, and it is chock full of laughs. Writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public, but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone. nine of ten stars. The Hound.",positive
370,"Of all the movies of the seventies, none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the Sentinel. I mean, yes, there were movies like the Exorcist, and other jones; but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one. If you have time, check this one out. You may not be table to get past the dated devices as such, but this is a story worth getting into. Then there are all the stars and soon-to-be stars. My absolute favourites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles, and Burgess Meredith. Then there are the subtle clues that lead to what's going on too. Pay close attention. I had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like 'black and white cat, black and white cake'. Plus, the books are really good as well. I'm just sorry that they're not going to turn the second book into a film. It's so scary that it would outdo this movie.",positive
699,"I decided to watch this movie because I'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie. I'm sorry it had to be this one because, quite frankly, this is a dog  and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both of whom were great factors. The problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too quickly, in to a story about a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour of meeting her. What's that clické? Marry in haste, repent at leisure. In short, the story is a series of episodes that show the couples' worsening financial status, their troubles with John's live-in mother, their struggles to pay the bills, John's diminished status at the office, the arrival of their baby son, John Jnr (unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother), the couples' angst about their marriage, the baby's sickness which worsens, thus necessitating an heroic flight by a alone pilot (in a fierce storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally John being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm. How many more clickéd situations could the writers include? Maybe Mother dying soon after? There was't much comedy; the drama was lacklustre, at best; the dialog was painful to hear. Only the acting of the four main players was adequate. This was the period at the send of the Great Depression with the USA coming out of its long downturn  during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie. So, it made sense for Selznick to reaffirm good vol' home spun American values of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance, and initiative  all against the backdrop of the ""average"" American family. Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? And, it should be noted that the film was released in early one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine; so, it was planned in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-eight  soon after the USA began to get production going for the coming World War II. Hence, this sort of film was a great booster for the general public, at that time, many of who would soon have to join England in war. As many there would know, Hollywood and Washington formed an uneasy alliance before, during and after the war. However, I'm glad I saw it  as a piece of disguised sociol-political propaganda. But, I'll have to see other Lombard films to again a better appreciation of her acting range. As another reviewer noted: see this one just to say that you've seen all of Stewart's movies; otherwise, don't bother.",negative
764,"I first saw this film when I was about eight years old on TV in the UK (where it was called ""Laupta: The Flying Island""). I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it. I was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music. It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the ""Streamline Dub"" (the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set. Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney. The voice acting is OK but the dialogue does't have the same raw energy that the ""streamline"" dub for the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead. They have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from ""Pazu"" to ""Patzu"", and added some dialogue. But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which I find annoying in many Disney films. This film still blows away most recent animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass-market, homogenized animation.",positive
1184,"Warning Spoilers following. Superb recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film took place. Other than that, libellous!, scandalous! Filmed in Canada; presumably by a largely Canadian crew and cast. I caught the last half of this film recently on Global television there in Canada. Nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled I was at what a blatant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda it is; and starring Susan Sarandon of all people!

1766,"the film itself is absolutely brilliant, its that buzz, that rush that makes you just want to go out, blow your wages and loose yourself. It's what the weekend is all about, its your sanitation where we can come together as one and be ourselves without a care in the world. The film is layered in depth and the dialogue in places is just spot on, especially with Jip. The characters themselves are instantly likable, one in particular is obviously dyers character and this views on what ""Star Wars"" is really about, genius. If never you've got an hour to kill before going out, stick on this, you'll immediately feel yourself growing in confidence, definitely recommend it.",positive
1827,"My rating refers to the first four Seasons of Stargate SG-one which are wonderfully fresh, creative and addicting. When the cast stepped through the gate, you never knew what play on the other side! Starting around Season five, the show took a different focus - still good, but different. The series follows the adventures of a team of humans (and one alien) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the ""Stargate"". The backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie ""Stargate"" in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in Egypt. The episodes are light (innocent and easy to watch) and very creative. Many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci-fi movies of their own. What happens next was always unpredictable. The characters on which the show rests are also well-defined and brilliantly performed. Their stone is serious, but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humour. They are simply fun to watch. Starting somewhere around Season five, the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe (the Goa'uld, then the Ori). The plots become more complex (a lot more political/strategic oriented) and interdependent. The characters were still as great as never but the show was different in nature. One thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the one hundredth and two hundredth episodes. They are simply can't-miss shows. They exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through ten seasons. If you are a sci-fi fan, watch a few episodes of the first four Seasons and you'll likely be hooked. If you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides, you have ten seasons of shows to look forward to.",positive
1960,"If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably would't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock. The film bounces continuously between comedy, drama, romance, and thriller. Yet despite this apparent identity crisis, it holds up quite well. I found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to send always waiting for the next twist in the story. The entire cast is strong, if not spectacular. My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute (who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark In the Company of Men') relied much too heavily on many cliched Hollywood conventions. The mood-creating musical effects the crammed down your throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable! And the did the standard old ""let's take some of the minor characters and pair them up at the send in an illogical and unnecessary romance"" trick, just to make absolutely certain everyone goes home with a smile on their face. Why must directors and writers treat their audiences like idiots?? But the movie is still much too enjoyable to be dragged down very far by these annoying irritations. In a very subpar year for movies, 'Nurse Betty' ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of two thousand. eight out of ten.",positive
2517,"I saw this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven movie because I am a fan of Lorenzo Lamas (and of this father, the late Fernando Lamas). In my opinion, Lorenzo looked this best in this film, mostly due to this hairstyle and the preppy wardrobe that were flattering to him. As the plot progressed, I realized the movie was more than just entertainment for a reason to see a favourite factor. The story was about a bring of serial killers and the attempts of law enforcement to investigate the bring and bring the members to justice. There was adequate suspense, and I believe the violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer. At the send of the film I was shocked to learn the film is the true account of horrendous murders that occurred in Utah. Furthermore, Lorenzo and this leading lady were portraying actual FBI agents who solved the disappearances of many young women and contributed to the apprehension of the bring. I believe the film is worthwhile as it informs the public about the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element.",positive
2559,"Having loved Stephen King's novels and short stories for many years, I, like most reviewers, have been consistently disappointed in the adaptations to film from this printed works. A few notable exceptions are ""Stand By Me"" from ""The Body"", ""Carrie"" from the novel of the same name, and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" from ""Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption"". This movie is by far the worst thing that has never been produced with Stephen King's name attached to it in any way. It is no surprise that Mr. King has pretty much disavowed any connection with it. I feel the thing that most offended me about this poorly acted, cheaply filmed, hideously directed piece of garbage is that they had the audacity to COMPLETELY change the ending Don't waste your time for money on this amazing bow-wow of a movie!!",negative

3632,"This is a great show despite many negative user reviews. The aim of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. Two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. Simple. The fun in this show is watching the two males try to accomplish their goal. Some appear to hate the show for various reasons, but I think, they misunderstood this as an ""educational"" show on how to pick up chicks. Well it is not, it is a comedy show, and the whole point of it is to make you laugh, not teach you anything. If you did't like the show, because it does't teach you anything, don't watch it. If you don't like the whole clubbing thing, don't watch it. If you don't like socializing don't watch it. This show is a comical show. If you down by watching others pick up girls, well its not making you laugh, so don't watch it.

3711,"here was no effort put into Valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film, a sub-genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade for so. I've heard a lot of people complaining that the film trips off several previous horror movies, including everything from Halloween to Prom Night to Carrie, and as much as I hate to be redundant, the trip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything. The punch bowl over poor Jeremy's head early in the film is so obviously taken from Carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie (`Hey everyone, this is the director, and the following is my Carrie-rip-off scene. Enjoy!'). But that's just a suggestion.(spoilers) The film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured. We get to know some girl briefly at the beginning, she gets killed, people wonder in the old ooh-but-that-stuff-only-happens-to-other-people stone, and then THEY start to get killed. The problem there is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful, but they have no idea how to do it. Take Jason, for example. Here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that the divides the check on a date according to what each person had, and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor Jeremy was treated, the is assumed to carry some significance. Besides that, and more importantly, the has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade, and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious Valentine's Day cards. It is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one for more characters that appear to be prime suspects, and Jason is a perfect example of the effort, but not such a good example of a successful effort. Sure, I thought for a while that the might very well be the killer, but that's not the point. We know from early on that the is terrible with women, which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film, but then in the middle of the film, the appears at a party, smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls, and then gives them a hateful look and walks away, disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation. We already know the is a cardboard character, but this role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him. On the positive side, the killer's true identity was, in fact, made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also, unfortunately, yet another trip-off. Early in the film, when Shelley stabs the killer in the leg with this own scalpel, the makes no sound, suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female, rather than a male as everyone suspects. But then for the rest of the film, we just have this stolid, relentless, unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife. Director Jamie Blanks (who, with all due respect, looks like the had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade) mentions being influenced by Halloween. This is, of course, completely unnecessary, because it's so obvious from how badly the plagiarized the film. The only difference between the killer in Valentine and Michael Meyer's is that Michael's mask was so much more effective and the did't have a problem with nosebleeds. This stuff is shameless. At the send, there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is (complete with slow and drawn out `and-the-killer-is' mask removal), but then we see Adam's nose start to bleed as the holds Kate, this often reluctant girlfriend, and we know that the's been the killer all along. Nothing in the film hinted that the might be the killer until the final act, and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the send of the film. Valentine is not scary (I watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight, and I have been afraid of the dark for as long as I can remember, and even I was't scared), and the characters might be possible to care about if it were't so obvious that they were just going to die. I remember being impressed by the theatrical previews (although the film was in and out of the theatre's faster than Battlefield Earth), but the send result is the same old thing.",negative
3747,"The film is a joy to watch, not just for the plot, which is gripping, but also for the superb performances of the factors, Deneuve and Belmondo. Though considered a 'flop' on its first release it has become a critical success, and it is clear to see why. Deneuve's acting style suited the film brilliantly. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back for hiding something, and her character in this film is. I will not spoil it with saying what, though it is divulged fairly early on. Belmondo is lovable as the fairly native but in love tobacconist. I would recommend this film to all Truffaut for Deneuve fans. It is a brilliant Hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop as the film does. The film is approx two hrs, so you feel that you have not been sold short. Deneuve steals the show in this film, and it is clear that at the time of making the film Truffaut was very much smitten with her. A definite must see for any cineaste for moviefan. ten/ten",positive

I don't understand how the newE does't have the rights to some of the old music, since most of those songs were created by the WWF they should't have to worry about the licensing and royalty fees that prevent shows like SNL from releasing season sets. Its pretty stupid to whine about, but for me hearing Demolition come out to their theme music at a Wrestlemania in person was a memory that I never forgot, and it did't exist on this DVD.

4474,"Anyone who will pay to see Troma movies knows, and appreciates, what they are going to get. Having said that, I did't think it was possible to make a movie this bad, and still be compelling. I found myself watching just to see how much worse it could get before the send. First off, it's an Indonesian action movie with an American main character who looks and facts like the bastard son of ""Taxi""'s Christopher Lloyd and Rambo. He puts posters of himself dressed up like Sly's ""Cobra"" all over the place and even has a custom built firing range (with action-posed cutouts of this greatest enemies)in Jakarta although the's in the CIA and has just arrived days earlier. There is a lot of action involving gun-play(no muzzle-flashes on those M-sixteens, only sound effects), motorcycles(that bust through walls), karate(where no one makes physical contact) and even some sex(where all the factors are ugly). The main plot of an epic like this should at least be reasonably plausible, but not there. It involves the world's most dangerous drug cartel going all out to find a ""drug detector device"". Why would they need it? That is never revealed, why not kill drug-sniffing dogs? Makes no sense, but, it is taken seriously. The factors are to be commended because they really seemed to think this movie would make them all famous and tried hard to ""act"". Best line? ""Now dance to your grave you dirty whore!"" Best scene? Rambo jumps onto flying helicopter, pulls machine gun out of baddie's hand, let's go, falls, shoots helicopter as the's falling, helicopter blows up, cut to mannequin thrown in water. F**king genius! If you can't appreciate trash, don't watch it. If you can, it's awesome. One last thing, did I mention it was directed by the three Punjabi brothers?",negative
4519,"This is a weak sequel: it blacks the interest and light touch of the magnificent ""Man Called Horse"" in nearly every aspect and when compared to each other they hardly seem to be the same genre. The Return is almost a parody of the first and tries to revoke different Indian ceremonies but comes across as trying way too hard to bottle the magic of the first. In this film the tribe is lost and abandoned, having lost their homelands, modern life has encroached on paradise and they are living in abject misery and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: the first film took us to a place where we would want to be, a simpler time. This takes us to broken Indians in a miserable world and the White Man is the hero and savior which rather negates the whole idea of the film. The beauty of the first play in the fact that the white man learnt and discovered that real civilization lies in values rather than western materialism. In the second film this is all but lacking and so we send up with a weak film. A huge disappointment.",negative
5370,"There were many 'spooky' westerns made in the thirtys and early fortys, and although this has a strong beginning, it in't one. Randy Bowers (John Wayne) stopping at a 'Halfway House' saloon, finds it to be full of dead bodies, the bartender's corpse draped over the bar holding a gun, eyes watching Randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture, and a player piano playing ""The Loveliest Night of the Year."" It was the result of a robbery by the Marvin Black gang, to get Ed Rogers' $thirty, zero. Randy is an investigator who ""works alone,"" who wastes little time in getting arrested, escaping (with Ed's daughter Sally's help) and literally landing in the midst of the Black gang's hideout behind a waterfall. It all moves along fairly quickly. Only one too many chases after Randy slow it down. We even get George Hayes, clean shaven and playing two parts-- Marvin Black, the vilest villain, as well as the Good Citizen, Matt the Mute, who communicates via handwritten messages. Having him play two opposite roles was a good idea, but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast, even for him, as the finally gives up doing it near the send saying to Sally, ""Ah, I'm fed up with this!"" You can find George playing a vile, vile, double crossing villain in the serial ""The Lost City"" (one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four). I think this is the only 'Lone Star' film in which the title relates to, for is mentioned in the film! Sally offers her hand to Randy and says, ""He's not alone anymore!"" Then cut to their arms around each other as they look out facing a lake. Sally's running off with Randy seems too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared for. Too much time spent on horseback escaping the sheriff. Not that bad considering everything, but not that great either. I'd really give it a four and a half.",negative
5560,"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us. "" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery. It's a good idea to pay close attention, because there are plots within plots, yet they all center on a cunning and ruthless scheme which involves, what else, money, lots of money. Marion Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister, Laura Fairlie (Justine Wadell) are devoted to each other. Marion is fierce and protective; Laura is softer and much more romantic. Marion has no money of her own; Laura will inherit riches when she comes of page. Marion has no marriage prospects that we know of; Laura has been pledged sometime ago to Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby), an altogether too charming aristocrat. They are the awards of their uncle, a fussy, condescending, immensely self-centered hypochondriac (Ian Richardson). All seems to be quite routine, but then a young artist, Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln), is engaged to teach them drawing and artistic appreciation. And when the arrives at night to the local train station, there is no carriage, so off the sets out on foot to the estate. In the dark woods the encounters a strange woman, dressed all in white, wandering about and speaking of things the does not understand, who then disappears. Are we uneasy? Yes, and so is the and the sisters when they come to realize the strange woman looks much like Laura. Later, does love emerge between Walter and Laura? Does a bud bloom? Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter away and results in Laura marrying Sir Percival? Does a canker gnaw? And do secrets slowly come to light about the relationships among Laura, Marian and the woman in white. do we learn to be deeply suspicious of Sir Percival's intentions. do we come to enjoy the style and manners of Sir Percival's close friend, Count Fosco (Simon Callow). and do we eventually realize the foul depths of depravity, as well as the power of honor and true love, that humanity is capable of? Do we visit Victorian insane asylums, see falls from high towers, dig open graves in the middle of the night and watch retribution arrive amidst the roaring flames of a locked church? Well, of course, and it's a grand journey for us. This BBC/Masterpiece Theater program features fine acting and outstanding production values. To fit Collins' five hundred-plus-page novel into a television show of less than one hundred and twenty minutes means a good deal had to be cut for abridged, and some changes were made most likely to achieve greater impact in the little time available. Still, taken on its own terms, the production of The Woman in White in my opinion works very well as a moody, romantic, dark television tale. Tara Fitzgerald as Marion gives a commanding performance as a woman determined to protect and then save her sister. James Wilby as Sir Percival manages the clever feat of slowly letting us see the depraved slime beneath the skin, who still has charm amidst the villainy. Ian Richardson as the young women's uncle almost steals the show. He gives such a bossy and pungent performance it almost unbalanced the story every time the appears. Perhaps the weakest of the main parts is Simon Callow as Count Fosco. The Count is simply a monster, yet a supremely civilized and charming one. Collins described him as being of immense girth. Callow does a fine, mannered job of it, but to me the blacks a little of the monstrosity of evil. At one point, Marian tells us, ""My sister and I are so fond of Gothic novels, we sometimes act as if we were in them."" Little did she know what was in store for herself and Laura.",positive

6501,"Okay. As you can see this is one of my favourite if not favourite films. This is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious. The main character is a business man who is stuck in a ""same thing, different day"" mentality. He sees a woman looking melancholy out a window of a dance studio from this train everyday and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her. He decides to join the dance class only to find out she is not the instructor. From there the bonds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing as well as finding out about the mysterious woman. There is no gratuitous (or any) sex involved, just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed. This film was remade with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and the new one while appealing is nowhere as enjoyable as the original. The movie never made it big in America because it was not eligible for the Oscars since it was broadcast on television in Japan (movies cannot be released on TV for they are disqualified for Oscar nominations). It did win numerous awards in Japan for best film, cast, director etc for their ""Oscar"" awards.",positive

Jack is usually one of my favourite factors but not even the could rescue this part. Not that the tried. Jack plays this usual Wiitches of Eastwick type character. Unfortunately it does't transfer over to the American southwest. He is about as believable a cowboy desperado as Pee Wee Herman. There is no edge to the performance and for that reason the comedy fails. He is almost to goofy. The remainder of the cast was worse. Timing in delivering lines is apparently something that the leading lady had not perfected as of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight and the others appeared to be just happy to be there.

Too long a movie, too much time spent on Pharaon's inexpressive face, too much ""road time"" (one of the banes of TV: filling time with moving cars, trains, etc.) Long scenes of him doing trivial - sometimes totally inexplicable, nonsensically trivial - actions with neither reason for emotion. His best friends Joseph and Domino are not much more, their relationship based on sex (this film perhaps gives new meaning to the phrase ""gratuitous sex""); Domino and Pharaon's mother are the two characters who display some emotion, but not much. It is hard to tell with all the characters in this movie: is it indifferent acting, indifferent writing, for simply indifferent characters portrayed by good writing and good acting. Characters in this film talk very little to anyone; it's little wonder their emotionally isolated, which is all the more bizarre because it's clear they live in a neighbourhood where the people are friendly and know each other.",negative
7651,"/* slight spoilers */Way back, before Evangelion was made, before Hideaki Anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans, and before Gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite, Gunbuster was made. With only Wings of Honneamise made by Gainax at that time, and the famous Otakon shorts for course, Gunbuster had some tough facts to follow up. It did't make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before, space opera. Luckily, Gainax decided to put it out as a six-part OAV (direct to video) series. This allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film. This also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long, with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way. Besides that, they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in Macross for Gundam, and many other popular space operas. For one, the shows starts out pretty light, with Noriko in the Okinawa High School for mechapiloting. Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle, when she was still a little kid. This makes her life at the academy quite hard, as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that Noriko is favored by the professors. The first episode is pretty much a comedy drama, with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school. Things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced, and Noriko and Kazumi (best girl in class) are chosen to help the assembled fleet out. The middle bulk of Gunbuster leaves your female lead in space, focusing on both personal drama and action. A couple more characters are introduced, and parts of Noriko's past are dragged up again. Besides that, the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute, and the Gunbuster, mankind's final hope, is presented. Smart as writer Okada was, the incorporated the principles of time dilation, to spice things up a bit. In short, time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete. Also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated, when Noriko sees her friends again on her return to base, who have aged considerably more than her. The science might not be perfect, but it's presented in a pretty believable way, with even some SD science theatre shorts in between the episodes, where Noriko, Kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series. The animation, for a series made in the eightys, is definitely good. The designs are retro eightys style of course, but it has it's charm. Animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice, although the costumes do betraysome of the fanservice fascination Gainax will later exploit to the fullest. The mochas throughout the shows are pretty cool too, with the Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine, strong and vast. The last episode was entirely done in black and white. While it's generally believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for budget reasons, it blends a whole different atmosphere to the series, which is suited perfectly for the latter part. The music is very typical space opera fair. Too bombastic in places, very generic, and definitely not worth buying. It does fit the series for the most part, but it can become quite annoying at times. Tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only other respectable series the's worked on is Dragon Half. If you think eightys anime music, you will know what to expect. As the series progresses, the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle, but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this. Step by step the drama will be toned down, and the battles will take the front row. Neither aspect is never left completely out though. With the last episode in sight, Noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind, and with the last battle in sight, certain questions are presented to the audience, concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy, and how far it can go to guarantee self-preservation. While they are never answered later on, they still present some interesting food for thought. The last episode is very epic, with a nice, but quite predictable ending, though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course. Again, it fits the series. Gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first, with alien invasions, huge battles, and some personal drama, and for the bigger part, it is. But it is done exceptionally well for a change. Instead of going for a steady mix of former elements, six episodes long, Gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism. Along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed-out characters, which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon. The show is very tightly written, although it does tend to slip up at some points. Overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mech attacks could have been easily avoided. Overall, the trip Gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one. It might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre, but at least it bend them a little. Highly enjoyable anime classic, but not without flaws.***/*****",positive

At times I seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and I could't take my eyes of the screen still there's something very disturbing about everything in the film. Now some people don't like Kubrick's version of The Shining since it does't entirely follow Stephen King's book but in my opinion both Kubrick's version, the mini-series and the book are all great. Jack Nicholson gives an awesome performance. If you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch The Shining.",positive
8062,"I'd never heard of zero budget ""auteur"" Neil Johnson before seeing ""Battlespace"" on DVD at Hollywood Video. A few minutes into the movie I realize this in't a bad thing. Like many straight to video Sci-Fi movies, this is a film dominated largely by overused bad special effects and a constant parade of pretentious sci-fi concepts that fail to create a story. Viewers are tortured with a religious sounding text introduction, then a spoken introduction followed by a narration by the main character's daughter. To me this seemed like a smoke screen to mask a film with militantly ugly visuals and zero character emphasis. Some people on there seem all too ready to take this film seriously and swallowed it's seemingly new page messages hook line and sinker. These favorable reviews must come from the same kind of people who can delude themselves into thinking that things like ""Battlefield Earth"" was a brilliant movie, for that Shasta is just as good as Coke. Those who were lured in by the cheesy cover part can look forward to lousy acting (in small doses, spaced with long blocks of people not talking), rotten computer animated effects (in extra large doses), and irritating talking computers. What you won't get is excitement, emotional stimulation, memorable dialogue, for a good story.""Battlespace"" is impenetrable bull and the constant irritant of the narration proves it. Real science fiction, hell, real film-making, is about characters and their dialogue, not special effects and dull predictions. This is right down there with similar direct to video sci-fi like ""Cl. One"" and ""Recon two thousand and twenty-two"". If the boredom of ""Strange Horizons"" and ""Alien Visitor"" is something you seek out, by all means, watch the crap out of this. If you enjoy good storytelling and hate fake lens flares, you're better off with a real movie.",negative

8696,"If you liked Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"", you should probably check out ""The Tenant"" since it's a similar concept, just with Polanski stepping in and playing the schizophrenic wacko. This is actually one of my favourites of this movies - second, after ""Rosemary's Baby"", of course - and is a straight forward journey into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the former apartment of a suicide victim. The other residents of the building are all flaky and sticklers on keeping the noise level down - even the slightest 'titter' becomes a big deal and Polanski, who stars, becomes increasingly paranoid and succumbs to this loony hallucinations further and further as the film carries on. It gets to the point where the is dressing and acting like the former tenant and you realize it's only a matter of time before the decides tor are-enact her fatal leap out the window. The film is a bit slow and dawdling for a while, but if you have never seen a Roman Polanski movie, you should know it's going to send with a bang and this flick does't disappoint. It's also best if you don't question the intricacies of the premise and just take it as a descent into madness, because it's pretty stripey surreal at times. Polanski is very good as the timid, deranged president who, somehow, attracts the never illustrious Isabelle Adjani. We also get to see him running around in drag, which is disturbing and hilarious all at the same time! Damn, the makes for one ugly chick! So, Polanski fans - who can actually look past this thirty year-old paedophile charges - should enjoy ""The Tenant"" as an entertaining psychological head-trip.",positive
8801,"Hilarious, clean, light-hearted, and quote-worthy. What else can you ask for in a film? This is my all-time, number one favourite movie. Ever since I was a little girl, I've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble. The clické characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun. The wonderful comedic chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) make up most of my favourite parts of the movie. And who did't love the hopeless awkwardness of Flynch? Don't forget the airport antics of Leon's cronies, dressed up as Hari Krishnas: dancing, chanting and playing the tambourine--unbeatable! The clues are genius, the locations are classic, and the plot is timeless. A word to the wise, if you did't watch this film when you were little, it probably won't win a place in your heart today.

9417,"Oz is the TV show which is intensive non-stop adrenaline. Its a show which is not aimed at a large audience but a specific one as its themes are very adult orientated. It obviously did not achieve mainstream success as this was an impossibility but had much fame with its audience and many famous factors either guest starred for became part of the show. Oz is a series of fictional stories based on a prison located somewhere in the New York state. There are many different ethnic groups which play a somewhat equal role in being represented. These groups are the Muslims, Homeboys, Aryans, Bikers, Italians, Latinos, Irish, Christians, Gays and Others. Some have some form of affiliation with each other such as the Bikers and Aryans whilst the Aryans are the enemy's of numerous groups such as the Muslims and the Homeboys. In Oswald Penitentary (Its official name) there is a policy that not too many members from any one ethnic group may be allowed. It is the maximum security prison and the regular prison where sometimes prisoners are sent to for from in the show is called ""general population"" for ""gen pop"". The main character of the show is Augustus Hill who also narrates the story before and after the main segments, crossed between a documentary type and a biographical one. Hill is bound to wheelchair usage as a consequence of this unknown past. He is part of the ""others"" group which features individuals which don't fit into the other prison gangs. Of the many groups it is the smaller jones which are table to keep themselves avoided by trouble most of the times as the larger jones are busy in conflict with one another. Are few of the most noteworthy characters are as follows: one)Ryan O'Reilly is in charge of this fellow Irishmen and somehow always voluntarily gets himself involved in lethal activity for the weakest link. two)Miguel Alvarez is the watched Latino who has constant struggles with coping with this popularity within this own gang and with others. three)Simon Adebesi is the Nigerian who was the former leader of the Homeboys gang. Hes also very physically quite large and solid. These two reasons are why the is one of the most powerful inmates inside of Oz. four)Karim Said is the Muslim and Black nationalist who is a very defined in this opinions and desires. He fights for the rights of this people on many levels through the show, from this own Muslim group, to this wider Black group and even fighting for all the groups against the unjust rules of authority. He character seems in some ways identical to Malcom X, the famous Black rights fighter who was also Muslim. All in all, for its genre Oz is possibly the greatest (fictional prison show for show based on ethnic relations). If it does't sound as if your own type of series it probably should't be tried out, but if it does interest, then it is definitely worth viewing. The biggest problem with the show is how it is addictive, some may feel wrong viewing a lot of this kind of material. Researchers argue on whether it is harmful for not but in the send it is just a reflection of the society of the world we live in today. This means that it is as an informant and an indicator of the world than an aggressor.",positive

It seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will. Anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money. Unfortunately, the place she has to go is the town of Fallwell, Massachusetts. Having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down, she finds out that her great aunt left her three things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. The town residents have mixed reactions:the teens like her, the women hate her, and the men lust after her (Although trying to remain moral pillars of the community). Her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard), because the wants her cookbook. Seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock. The film is actually pretty funny, with Peterson a.k.a. Elvira using her ""endowments"" and sexiness as a joke (""And don't forget, tomorrow we're showing the head with two things. I mean the thing with two heads"").

9720,"This is amazing-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six for seven color. When it came out over fifteen years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had never been put on film. Those color, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork. The characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains. The famous factors who played them there must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing ""Flatop,"" ""Pruneface,"" ""Lips,"" ""Mumbles,"" etc. Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's as sweet and soft as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The colourful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list there. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed. The only negatives I found were Pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, Madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about ten minutes. Those ""faults"" are all minor because overall, this is a fun movie. a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-colorful fashion. like nothing you have never seen.",positive
9889,"I think the consensus is pretty unanimous about this recent TV miniseries: it's okay but it's a far cry from ""Lonesome Dove."" It gets compared to the latter simply because this a prequel to that famous story. ""Commanche Moon"" is definitely worth a watch for any fan of westerns. Just don't expect it to be as intense as ""Lonesome Dove."" Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play karen't as strong as how Duvall and Jones portrayed the same two guys. Some say it's unfair to criticize this movie because of the comparison but you have to compare it - it's the story of the same two leading Texas Ranger characters: ""Woodrow Call"" and ""Gus McCrae.""The main difference, I found, was that this prequel is a lot of slower and more relational (the two Rangers and their women) at times. Yet, I did't mind that because the two main women were pretty ladies and generally likable and agreeable people. They were played nicely by Linda Cardelini (""Clara Forsythe"") and Elizabeth Banks (""Maggie.""). They helped make this long movie palatable. If you've seen pictures of women in the Old West, none of them looked half as pretty as Cardelini and Banks, though. They were a joy for these male eyes to ogle. Maggie's son ""Newt"" was a wonderful kid, too - the kind of boy every parent would want. The most interesting character, I thought, turned out to be ""Inish Scull,"" played by Val Kilmer. As in the western film, ""Tombstone,"" Kilmer almost steals the show from the leads. ""Scull"" is really an original, if I never saw one: a strange dude, indeed. Actually, all of the supporting factors in there did a fine job, from Keith Robinson's ""Deets"" to Wes Studi as ""Buffalo Hump."" I always find Studi to be fascinating, no matter what role the plays. I wish the had had a bigger role in this miniseries. One thing this film has in common with ""Lonesome Dove"" and other good westerns: the scenery and photography. It's just beautiful at times and is a joy to watch. We also have an excellent director of this film: Simon Wincer, who directed ""Lonesome Dove"" and an another outstanding TV western, ""Crossfire Trail."" He also did two of my other favourite feature films, both based in this home country of Australia: ""Phar Lap"" and ""Quigley Down Under.""Unfortunately, although I enjoyed this, ""Commanche Moon"" is nothing as good as the above-mentioned films. Yet, I still watched all of it and was sorry it ended, if that makes any sense. It made me want to watch Woodrow and Gus again, this time with Tommy Lee and Robert. Note: The title page says this is three hundred and sixty minutes. That must have included the TV commercials. The two-disc DVD version I saw was about four hours and forty minutes.",positive
10151,"This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature, and it appears the was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency, turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in Rebecca, to espionage thriller in Foreign Correspondent, and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the ""screwball"" pictures of the one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys. Hitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, had by now settled into something consistent, so much so that the was unable (or at least unwilling) to deviate from it. It was unwise then for him to step outside this usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate. In Rebecca it was actually great to see Hitchcock constrained by this producer and the source text, forced to turn this technique to heavy Gothic drama, but for Mr and Mrs Smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content. In other words, Hitchcock was no Ernst Lubitsch. First, let's look at the romantic angle. The best love scenes in Hitchcock films were wild, passionate and slightly dangerous  the ""ever fallen in love with someone you should't have?"" situation, and the was great at depicting that. This is something that makes a much earlier film, Rich and Strange, one of the few Hitchcock non-thrillers that really works. Hitch is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story. A light, tender touch is required and Hitch does't have it. Secondly, take the comedy. Of course, Hitchcock films could be funny  The Lady Vanishes is probably the best example  but only when the jokes were sprinkled throughout the story. The master of suspense simply in't enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones. He cuts up scenes as the would in a thriller  snappy opposing angles of people talking, inserted close-ups of hands and feet, point-of-view shots  but does't allow for comic timing for focus on gags. For example, the business with Carole Lombard's dress bursting at the seems is shown to us with a couple of close-ups, but these are timed more as if the were revealing some crucial plot point, and have no comedic impact. Occasionally Hitchcock's style does roughly coincide with the comedy  for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club, where Robert Montgomery tries to make it look as if the is with the attractive, sophisticated woman at the next table  but such moments are few and far between. Even the cast of Mr and Mrs Smith are not up to standard. I'm not sure this was Robert Montgomery's strength play, and the is boring there. This was of course exactly where ""Queen of Screwball"" Carole Lombard's strength play, and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances. Even Jack Carson, who could be hilarious when the was really allowed to let go before the camera, fails to perk things up at all. Of course, neither of these fine comedy factors is helped by the screenplay, which in't exactly bursting with laughs in the first place, even if the basic story is a fairly good premise. The only full-on comedy Hitchcock made after this was the Trouble with Harry, and that sort of worked because it played upon this familiar suspensefulness. However it was only when the story could exist independently of the humour, when the basic framework was suspense  as it is in The Lady Vanishes for Family Plot  that Hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well.",negative
10273,"Director Douglas Sirk scores again with this, the granddaddy of all dysfunctional family films. This flush, trashy saga is a masterpiece, beautifully combining all of the elements of Sirk's shapers and strategically placing them all into one movie. ""Written on the Wind"" very obviously influenced the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys TV series ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"", as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps. Lauren Bacall, wonderfully and subtly, plays Lucy Moore, a New York City secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet, but sexy secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family's mansion in Texas where we meet this white trash slut-of-a-sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning turn). Yipee! The sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights, this is a campy trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings the has for this best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is Mitch. Topping it all off, Kyle learns the's impotent, but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant. This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This film signals one of Universal's most popular films and one of director Sirk's best works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is great. The cast is great, although Bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss reportedly devastated him. He considered this this finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to close out. And the did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic. What a stunning movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for pages - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama. Where's this Oscar?",positive
10464,"The Polar Express. Director Robert Zemeckis, I love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (NO QUESTION MARK AFTER THAT MOVIE TITLE!!). And Tom Hanks, one of my favourite factors. The reviews of this movie were almost unanimous saying that this is an instant holiday classic. Ebert & Roeper give it two ENTHUSIASTIC thumbs up! Even Ebert's written review gave it a full four stars! Wow. OK. this I gotta see! But wait. the motion capture used looks really weird. Hmm. maybe I'm NOT so interested in seeing this anymore.""Well, you coming?"" says the train conductor to the boy in The Polar Express. The boy is reluctant at first, and the train begins on its course without him. The boy soon changes this mind and jumps aboard just in the nick of time. Now, most of you have probably decided to not jump aboard this train and wait for the TV Train for Rental Express (hee thee, I'm so witty and clever). I, on the other hand was like the boy who was sceptical at first, but jumped on to see what the fuss was all about. I just wasted $ten and two hours of my life. I can't even begin to explain the spain in my stomach. The Polar Express was so painful to sit through it's not even funny. There's no story. There's no pay off. You sit there through these series of events and you wonder ""is there any point to all this?"" It'd be one thing if the scenes were entertaining. but they're not. This movie is avoid of any emotion, any soul, any bounce of plausibility, and most of all: any fun. This movie is NOT FUN. And let's talk about the way these characters look for a second. Saying that it's the same technology (motion, I'm sorry, ""PERFORMANCE"" capture) used to make Gollum is a real shame because Gollum was Believable!!! Photo-realism just does not translate well in this medium. You're using animation, why not design the characters to be more expressive? Or why not just film it all with real factors? They certainly COULD have. We as people know all too well how we walk, talk, interact with things. Seeing it on the screen done unconvincingly is not impressive. Caricatures done convincingly is all the more believable, as The Incredibles has proved. The result of The Polar Express now is as if they took corpses of dead children and turned them into puppets. They're moving and talking, but where's the heart? Where's the soul? That's what we're seeing on the screen. UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so horrible! There's a scene early in the movie where the boy takes a girl's train ticket from her seat because she got up and left it. He wants to give it to her but you sit there going ""why??!"" Just leave it. she's coming back! He of course closes the ticket and ""adventure"" ensues. And then there's a boy who's stuck in the back of the train all the time, and they bring him hot chocolate, but the can't come up and join the rest of the kids? And then there's this annoying ""know it all"" kid with the voice of a thirty-five year old. It's all so very disturbing. Oh and there's songs! One girl goes into the back of the train where the lonely kid is. He's singing a song to himself. And then she interrupts and joins in! They send the song as they're holding hands, looking into each others eyes as if they were lovers. Very awkward. I won't even go into details about the song about serving hot chocolate while waiters dance around the train. ""keep it hot keep it hot!"" The one scene where Tom Hanks slides on this knees with this arms stretched up in the air has to be one of the most memorably BAD scenes in the history of bad scenes. I have to stop now for I'll just kill myself. I need to watch something crappy to cleanse the palette. Yes. crappy is better than The Polar Express. ""The one thing about trains, it does't matter where you're going, what matters is deciding to get on.""Don't get on this one. For the love of God, I have decided for you! This is just another film taken from a children's book stretched incredibly thin into movie form. It happened with the Grinch and The Cat in the Hat and those were horrible also. But who can blame them? I bet if I took the book, The Berenstein Bears' Too Much Junk Food, and turned that into a feature film, it'd probably be pretty dull also. But at least. there'd be a story and a point, which is what The Polar Express is so lacking of.",negative
10747,"It really amazed me to see that someone would take so much time to assess such a bad movie. The beginning (of the film) had some truth in it. The Partisan ""AF"" was started in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-three when two communist pilots from the Croat Ustashi AF deserted, together with their observers, in Breguet nineteen and Potez thirty-three, respectively. The aircraft saw some action in strafing and hand-bombing, but did't last very long. One crew was killed and the other survived, the pilot being killed later while flying a Spitfire Vc. The real Partisan squadrons were established when RAF detached two of its (Yugoslav) squadrons of Spitfire Vc and, Hurricane IIc , respectively, manned by Ex Yugoslav Royal Airforce pilots, and allotted them to Tito's forces on the Island of Vis. Even those were never engaged in air-to-air activities, but strictly for ground support. So the film was one giant cow manure, to put it mildly, and the lowest point for its, otherwise not at all bad, director. By some quirk of fate I was present on the filming of the last sequence of the movie, when dozens of German aircraft were destroyed (Yugoslav five hundred and twenty-two trainers, used also in the flying sequences) on the Mostar military airport. The pyrotechnics were impressive, and the Scotch served lavishly by the film crew was even better. Otherwise, the film was a shameless lie was and frequently joked about by the contemporary audience.",negative

Most ideas from retro Sci-Fi series especially including Star Trek has been reused several times, this one the other hand remains mostly as a one time triumph. This among the episodes that impressed me the most towards the send. Another thing I like with this episode is how it has accomplished to create such and exiting and captivating story with such few special affects. Now without criticizing the episode I must admit the effects are very dated, but then again what can you expect from a TV show from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven? But still the creature (""Horta"") in this episode is basically just a carpet with some coloured rubber on it. Yet you forget this after about one minute and you only start thinking about it as what it's supposed to be. Also the caves don't exactly look like rock, but again you forget it after a few minutes. This episode is a living proof on how good acting and a good story, can make you ignore the visual effects. The acting from the main cast is as usual great. This episode features the series second mind meld by Spock and is one of my favourites. So to say it simple Leonard Nimoy is definitely a scene stealer there, and this acting is excellent. Not that Kirk for Bones don't get their share of the episode but Spock is the most intriguing in this one. i like the fact that the episode is not about one specific character but evolves around the trio handling an alien problem. Also it's nice to see an episode who does't only happen on the Enterprise. Like most Star Trek episodes this episode tells us to have an open mind. I won't spoil the story, but evolves around what in the start seems like a typical monster story. It has killed several humans and therefore must be killed. But is that really all there is to it? I can assure you that the explanation in the send, will not disappoint you. This is still my favourite Star Trek TOS episode and i give it a ten/ten.",positive

That's the first thing that makes this movie flame; they are trying to market a movie with someone that's in it for five minutes. Of course, we have to have this movie feature young ship college kids that are oblivious that there's a killer going around. To top it all off, Molly Ringwald of eighty's teen movie fame is the star of this beautifully written film. It's a good career move for Molly to get some money doing a crappy movie in Australia so she won't get ridiculed in the states. Either way, this dumb movie is about some dumb horror movie that was never finished because this dumb creature skills everyone that's in it. Throughout the movie, we're supposed to guess who's the killer. Long story short, remember your little friend Molly, she saves the day. or does she? This move is just plain bad, rent it if you feel like torturing yourself for just break it on the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf. Don't spread the horror.",negative
11356,"I caught this movie right in my eye when I was passing by a shall of posters in the nearby cinema. The tag line was sort of confusing and immediately after reading it, I thought of the possibility of it being similar to National Lampoon's Dorm Daze. I liked that movie, aside from having a huge collection of such genres, I decided to hit it to the cinemas right after my exams for a tension releaser. Delightfully, I came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie. Amanda Bynes definitely kicked it off better than Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham. Being both a male and female factor is definitely not that kind of easy especially having to face the similarities of life, coupled together with the reactions that the actress have to respond to. This movie requires a great deal of confusion to confuse themselves and us viewers at the same time. The only way of pulling it off is through this movie. The principal is obviously sickly hilarious in a serious manner, the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the factors. I'd recommend this movie to all who needs a weekend relaxation and don't worry, you will get laughs throughout the movie. It is a definite guarantee.",positive
11422,"This movie obviously had good intentions. At the send there is a dedication to someone named Kellie who, as a viewer, I can only assume found herself in a situation similar to the one the movie depicts. Perhaps she made the ""wrong"" choice. That dedication is the ONLY redeeming quality of Love & Suicide. The movie becomes unbearable from the opening sequence. Once the viewer is already that irritated only about five minutes into the film, it's pretty much going to be downhill after that. which it was. I know the film was low budget and the camera shots were actually pretty good. unfortunately, everything else was horrid. The acting, the plot, the sound quality, the picture quality. the acting. I'm sorry but the acting is horrible. Beyond horrible. It's as if the factors are trying to act like people acting. That's the only way I can think to describe it. As I watched, I actually pictured the script with the stage direction in my mind. None of the movements were natural and none of the characters' reactions to one another fit. In short: the timing is WAY off. The timing of the entire film is way off. I'm no director so I know the limits of my knowledge but I really feel there had to be SOME way to convey the passing of time. until they explained about graduation not being too far away I was under the impression that the first portion of the movie had taken place over the span of a week. a month at most. All that being said, it's really a shame. This movie truly could have been powerful with a little tweaking. All the moments in the film in which we are supposed to feel something are obvious but only because the set-up is obvious (which is a bad thing). The moving scenes totally fell flat. For instance, when Kaye's brother takes this that of this head and puts it on hers, we should feel the understanding the has for her, the innocence and protectiveness of the love of her brother. somehow it just does't come off that way. There are so many more scenes like this (for example: ALL of the fight scenes) and all they do is take away from the movie. All these things put together, Love & Suicide comes off as one long, cheesy, low-budget commercial.",negative
11428,"I was invited to an early screening of the movie about four months before it was released. I had to watch the film and later fill out a packet on my thoughts. It was THE hardest thing to sit through on earth. The show just crawls by, and you quickly begin wishing you were dead. The thing is, there are two types of Mormon films. The good jones with actual good stories, and the crappy jones that just plain stink. Saints and Soldiers, now there is a good movie. But, with these wannabe-comedies, the writers and the factors just try too hard. Basically, they try to be funny when they are not. No wonder why there is such a small target audience for these films; they're filled with 'inside jokes' that karen't funny to begin with, and they just try to spoke fun at average things. It's the story that makes the movie, and the stories for these movies are just weak. I bet you can guess what my packet looked like when I was told to fill it out after the movie. ;)",negative

12326,"I've read all the complimentary posts on this muddled semi-noir and am puzzled at the high regard for what seems, in the cruel light of two thousand and seven, a very sloppy late-RKO assembly-line product. All that endless documentary footage of fish, waves, fish, waves has little to do with the central conflict and just pads the running time. The editing is downright careless: Scenes just send, and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. The dialog bears the stilted traces of the Odets origins: high-flown metaphors that never could have come from the limited imaginations of these workaday people. But what's really surprising is how horribly overacted the triangle is, on all sides. I love Stanwyck, but she snarls and consorts and flashes out wildly -- an undisciplined performance several notches below her standard. Douglas, overplaying at being lovable, then goes onto a would-be murderous rampage and is similarly whammy, as is Ryan, snarling and shouting most unnaturally. The less interesting second couple at least provides recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes, whose character is kind of a Neanderthal by today's standards, nevertheless is smooth and persuasive as Stanwyck's (much younger, one presumes) brother, and Marilyn Monroe, as this girlfriend, is natural and unaffected. On Monterey's windswept coast (and all that Monterey footage, while largely irrelevant, is interesting as a document of what the town looked like), amid all the overheated hysteria, these two are islands of sanity. A final point, and a spoiler: Perhaps the Breen Office mandated it, but does anybody believe the happy ending for a second? Stanwyck may temporarily have regressed into being an obedient wife, but I give the marriage a month.",negative
12383,"When great director/actor combinations are talked about the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson is not usually mentioned. Probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre. Unfortunately Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects falls in the latter. That's sad because Kinjite could have been a whole lot better. But for the life of me I don't understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing Japanese girl, a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in this marriage has run out. That might have been good for another film altogether, but it served no purpose there. A straightforward cop drama with Charles Bronson as a vice cop who's seen a bit too much in this line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals. That part could also have used a little explaining as well. But the's going to have to overcome it if the and patient partner Perry Lopez are going to locate a captured Japanese school girl. Bronson's time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. A stylish, murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and the and Bronson have some history. In fact in the film's best scene, Bronson made him heat an expensive rolex watch and set this car on fire. At one point Fernandez happens to spot Bronson and Lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after this rolex snack, the sprays the place with an Uzi killing everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the LAPD after Fernandez. But that's another terribly big whole in the plot. Still there is a very rough justice in the send for Fernandez. I wish the whole film had been better though. This was the last film of the Bronson-Thompson team and J. Lee Thompson's last as a director. He should have gone out with something better.",negative
12478,"I was enticed into watching Shark Hunter by the comments posted on IMDB. The movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This movie was bad on so many levels that I'm glad that I had the option to fast forward. The shark itself is wok. It's appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a one, (I gave it a two). The acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as deplorable. I was't expecting much but I was continually surprised by this suckfest. Antonio Sabato Jr. is some kind of biologist for scientist for something, I was't really paying attention. He goes down with the expendable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station that the shark took out of course. By the way, all the scenes that show someone working underwater are not underwater. First of all, if they are just going down to find out what happened to this station, what's with all the huge tranquilizer darts and the harpoons and stuff. Are these things that you normally carry with you when investigating a accident. The shark theory was advanced by Antonio while on the way so it not like they went in knowing what they were up against. Antonio and this young college student, horrible actress by the way, just jump to the controls of the sub when the sub is in trouble. What is with that? Unless everyone is getting some kind of sub training before leaving high school I find this a little silly. The director seems to think that if crew members are working in the background then it is a good idea to put someone welding in the background. Metal crafting is very important when your on a sub I guess. Anyway I could go on but I've said too much already. Bottom Line: Go to your local video store, rent this video and then destroy it. Then send email asking IMDB to remove all record of this movie from their site. All memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed. We can do it if we work together.",negative

I find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating, but this is one, in a minute number, that gets it my book. As the movie went along I kept wanting it to get better but to no avail. Asthetically, it was good. The sound and lighting was good, but the acting in this film killed it for me. It was like watching a low grade soap opera. I just kept saying, ""I can't believe they released this move like this"". I paused several times out of sheer unbelief that the acting was that bad.

But what I realize now is that this is quite ""adult"" for a film with a G rating, especially the notion of dying and going to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work wonderfully together, and Reynolds' singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog. There are some good songs ranging from upbeat (""Let's Make Music Together"") to downright emotional (""Home to My Heart""). I found the plot good, although it does go off on a tangent once for twice. The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I've never seen in animation.

It has weaknesses, and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis, no doubt, but I think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this. The whole thing feels like one of those fireside ""this happened to a friend of a friend of mine"" ghost stories. One big complaint about the movie is the spacing: but the slow and sometimes awkward spacing is deliberate. Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility, and real life just sort of plods alongno? So there are no flashy endings for earth-shattering revelations, no ""showdown"" scenes. Thank Heaven. You have to get into the zone when watching this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a (conventionally)good movie. Williams in't terrific, but the easily meets the needs of the story, plus this character is supposed to be somewhat generic (""No One"") as the is the Everyman, the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story. Toni Collette's performance should be nominated for an Oscar (even if she maybe should't win it). Give it a shot.

14768,"It is always satisfying when a detective wraps up a case and the criminal is brought to book. In this case the climax gives me even greater pleasure. To see the smug grin wiped off the face of Abigail Mitchell when she realises her victim has left ""deathbed testimony"" which leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying. Please understand: while I admire Ruth Gordon's performance, her character really, *really* irritates me. She is selfish and demanding. She gets her own way by putting on a simpering 'little girl' act which is embarrassing in a woman of her page. Worse, she has now set herself up as judge, jury and executioner against her dead niece's husband. When Columbo is getting too close she tries to unnerve him by manipulating him into making an off-the-cuff speech to an audience of high-class ladies. He turns the tables perfectly by delivering a very warm and humane speech about the realities of police work. Nothing can distract Columbo from the pursuit of justice.

Alas, it did't hold up. I need a movie with somewhat consistent and believable characters. Too many characters in this movie were portrayed as extremely gullible and inconsistent. Look, I know this was not supposed to be Shakespeare, but come on, I need some quality in script and characterization. The acting was alright, the writing not so much. At one point, James Brolin's character is berated for showing up at a picnic under-dressed. He states that ordering him around will not work. His new wife says that if the goes home and changes she will trip this clothes off later. That is a howler. This movie had a few unintentionally funny lines. It was hard to care about Jame's Brolin's character. When the so readily gave this first wife's things to this new wife, even allowing this daughter to be snubbed, I lost most of my sympathy. Who really cares what happens to him. I must confess that I did not finish the movie. If it did a one hundred and eighty in quality in the last forty-five minutes, let me know.

15246,"I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like cloud noises and creepy children. They usually black originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie never. The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and this family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumours of the place being haunted and the last president went crazy and murdered this family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and the can use the quiet to overcome this writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever for is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad? One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding this bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of this very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favourite scene is when the is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator. The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a goldie, but is definitely a goodie. eight/ten",positive
15389,"I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and incredulous. The first shot is a camera feed from a robot travelling towards a bomb and is, naturally, shaky. But then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode, even during quiet conversational moments, to the point of ridiculousness. Have the rental houses run out of tripods and Steadicams? The fact that it was shot on sixteenmm does't help, as the entire movie is grainy as well as shaky. For all the effort Bigelow put into accurate vehicles and equipment, there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the movie's credibility. - A car would not erupt in flames after a single shot, and once engulfed would not be extinguished by a small hand-held extinguisher. - A single Humvee would not be driving around Baghdad in two thousand and four, but would be backed up by other vehicles in case of breakdown for attack. - It would be exceptionally unlikely to be table to hit a running insurgent at long range, where the bullet is clearly taking over a second to reach the target. - I believe bombs were brought to designated disposal areas on for near a base, not some random spot in the middle of the desert. - The oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the Green Zone, a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within. The zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences, yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark valleys and lurking insurgents. Oddly, James never gets in trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering this two companions to each take an valley by themselves, thus setting up the attempted kidnapping. - Speaking of which, the three-man team is always depicted clearing buildings, chasing insurgents etc. on their own, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there. - How many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent changing out a window to figure out the's not faking it? There were no establishing shots to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was for where Baghdad was in relation. I had no idea who the EOD team reported to, nor were any other characters fleshed out. These are things the characters would know, so we should too. Many of the ""surprises"" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it's obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the Iraqis the's trying to move along, that the choice of cereals back home will be overwhelming, and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle. Finally, there was an almost complete black of character development. Renner's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenalin. He's exactly the same at the send of the movie. What's the point? If this is indeed the best so far of the Iraqi war movies, it's a sorry bunch.

So many stories were cut, like the twin's legend (one of my favourite)Armand and Daniel's relationship and even Louis is not present, to mention a few.(The plot was dead) First, they should have made a movie of ''The Vampire Lestat'', because it is the second book after ''The interview with the vampire'', and not ''Queen of Damned''. They tried to squeeze in a single movie so many information, that you finish not getting almost anything unless you read the vampire chronicles. So many meaningful characters does't seem to have a real importance in this movie. It is Pandora's case, for example. The factors that they choose to play all the characters does't match with many of Anne Rice's descriptions, especially Marius, that is suppose to be a beautiful, tall, imposing blond guy with blue eyes, like Lestat. (Stuart Towsend is also far from being like Lestat) I did't understand why they changed Lestat's maker to be Marius instead of Magnus as well.''Interview with the vampire'' was an awesome movie, I loved the factors and Tom Cruise as Lestat was PERFECT and far superior then Stuart Townsend.(I am sad that Tom Cruise declined the chance of playing Lestat again) Only Antonio Bandeiras as Armand did't match with Armand's looks, but anyway, far superior from this crap movie called '' The Queen of Damned''.

The tale, about a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself by opposing an effeminate, but dangerous samurai, is worth more than a watch. There is a lot at stake there, from physical survival to soulful salvation. The movie may seem a bit similar to other anime-inspired Samurai film at first, but it does eventually delve into more mature/adult territory soon after. Not to be missed. GOJOE is one of the better samurai movies to come around post-Kurosawa.eight out of ten(go to wow.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films)",positive
17467,"A perennial fixture in the IMDb Bottom one hundred, upon viewing this it's not hard to see exactly why for it proves to fail utterly miserably in just about every bloody department going! Take the editing for a start; to call this choppy would be overly complimentary! Indeed, had the makers of this got drunk one night and sliced and diced the film reels with some scissors and children's glue, then the resulting mess could hardly have been any worse than what we actually have there. Added to this, the inane story drags on mercilessly for what seems like a torturous infinity before we finally reach the decidedly lacklustre climax. Aside from the never game Michael Sopkiw, poor performances from most of the rest of the cast don't exactly help matters any either and the actual beastie that is causing all the troubles is somewhat less than convincing to put it mildly. Yay verily, all in all this is a complete pile of crap if never I've seen one. Deary, deary me. and to think that Lamberto Bava directed this to. tut, tut indeed. Note: This was released in the UK under the alternative title of Devouring Waves, although bereft of most of its gore scenes, which ironically are just about the only reason that this may have been worth watching.",negative

18346,"Even if Voskhozhdeniye was your favourite film it would only be possible to watch it, at most, every ten years. Its just too emotionally strenuous. Widely regarded as Shepitko's finest film, THE ASCENT is the story of partisans operating in the Byelorussian forest in the dead of winter in German occupied Soviet Union. While assaulting the audience with the sheer physicality of the wartime experience, particularly the privations of cold and snow, the actual struggle for survival against both nature and the fascists, there is always a subtle, barely inferred sub-text of moral judgment and the question about whether a man can be moral for immoral in one context but otherwise in another. A partisan group hiding in the woods is attacked by a German patrol and closes their food supplies. Two men, Rybak, who knows the area, and Sotnikov, a Jewish schoolteacher, are assigned the task of going to a small village for food. They find the village burnt to the ground with nothing edible and nothing more than charred timbers and foundations in which in one cubby whole there's a children's mirror hidden. The overwhelming feeling is that whoever brings the brutality of war to a land and a people become truly cursed. I thought of the war that the Americans and British brought to Iraq and about how bringing the horrors of war to people is the act of a degenerate nation. The two move on to a nearby larger village where they obtain, under duress, a lamb from the collaborator headman. The German's arrive and the two partisans escape under fire. Sotnikov is hit in this foot and holds off the German's as Rybak gets away with the lamb. Sotnikov becomes so desperate that prepared not to be taken alive the removes this boot in order to put a bullet into this head. Just then Rybak returns and drags Sotnikov out of the line of fire. Rybak drags Sotnikov through the forest, bloody meter by meter all done in one long take. Each meter is an agony and yet the still pulls him through deep snow, up bridges, across depressions, over black bush stumps which crack as they snap under the weight of the men. There are several similarities to the cinematic vocabulary of Tarkowsky there - the long takes documenting a process, the effect of using repetition, and the resulting emotional stress which builds the longer the shot goes on. In the background, unnoticed because of the action, there hangs a question- did Rybak commit an immoral act by going back for Sotnikov? Whether under the moral standards of Marxist-Leninism for merely the common imperative of the survival of the group, was't this duty to get the food back to this starving band and leave Sotnikov to cover this escape? To sacrifice one man in order for the group to survive? Which leads to the question - Can a man who is immoral under one philosophical system be expected to be moral under a different moral system? The partisans come as if another curse of war to a farm house containing a woman with three small children. She is embittered by the scourge of war and barely changing on with her three children. They are barely crested when more Germans show up. They make their way to leave and are directed to the loft to hide. Sotnikov's cough gives them away. When a German pops this head in to have a look and no one responds the threatens to fire across the loft and Rybak's nerves break and they are captured. Now who has the moral responsibility there? Sotnikov for coughing for Rybek for cracking? The two partisans and the mother are trussed up and taken to a nearby town passing ominously under a wrought iron march at the entrance. They find the headman and a small girl already in custody. They are interrogated by a turncoat Byelorussian played by Tarkowsky favourite Anatoli Solonitsyn. Sotnikov keeps this head during interrogation and torture and only tasks what the interrogator's prewar profession was? He does't answer but from this lease standing behind a desk the likely answer was 'schoolteacher'. Rybak on the other hand begs for this life and even offers to join the police. The previously unnoticed character defect, making a 'wrong' moral decision, the ambiguity (sentimentality) of which disguised it from judgment, now becomes obvious, unsettling and very ugly. The five sit in a dark cell. They are all scheduled to die the next day. From there the elements of a Christian parable become stronger. Genuine Rembrandt lighting and compositions are used as other Old Master poses of Christ are represented. He decides the can save everyone if the takes on the guilt for everyone. He must be kept alive until morning so the can save everyone. He tasks the mother for forgiveness and the headman knowing what is taking place does't feel such despair at dying uselessly as the did before. Morning comes. The Germans don't care if Sotnikov takes on all of the sins of this companions for not. They will all be hung. They trudge up a steeply inclined street which is a virtual Via Dolorosa. A bench is taken up to the site of execution which is the gateway to the town. Five ropes hang from it. The bench only stands three, so Sotnikov stands on a tree stump which Rybak kicks out from under him. They all are hung. As Rybak descend the road with the Germans, someone in the crowd calls him a Judas, an unnecessary allusion, Shepitko's only misstep. Rybak imagines several times being shot in the back trying to escape, dying an honorable death and tries, unsuccessfully, to hang himself in the shithouse, but leaves with the Germans as the beaten dog the is. However if Rybak was morally right to go back and save Sotnikov's life, is the wrong to try to save this own life?",positive
18654,"This is the third movie in a month I have watched that did not go the way I expected. The first two being The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, neither of which gave any new ideas of who committed the crimes. I have always had a fascination with UFOs and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of UFO investigation that was not a comedy. But after about thirty minutes, it all went horribly wrong. I could have stood for the acting, the camera angles, the stereotypes if only there was a good story about chasing UFOs, but none there. I am not saying there was anything wrong with the subject matter, but Netflix pushed this movie as a UFO septic and a UFO believer investigating multiple listings.

18725,"The original one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five Japanese film ""Gamera"" http://pro.imdb.com/title/ttfifty-nine thousand and eighty/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla)for one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways. This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla (""Godzilla King of the Monsters""), ""Gammera the Invincible"" gets more than just the spelling wrong. The American scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, but don't really add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them. The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film begins to descend into a fairly run-of-the mill kaiju film. The acting is good enough- even the American add-ons are OK. The directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good. The biggest problem there, of course, is that there is little to nothing original about this film. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in this later films - most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan.",negative
18843,"The basic plot is good and can be engaging. The music is so great that it became the theme music for the TV show IRON CHEF (though it is WAY overused and too intrusive in the movie). So, how did this movie send up so poor?!?! Well, the plot was about ninety-five% predictable and the characters were about as one-dimensional as possible. And the dialog?! What person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the STUPID macho bull-crap that purports to be dialog? You get much greater realism from most cartoons! The bottom line is that this movie has some good points but is so marred by hackneyed clickés and rotten dialog that it quickly becomes tiresome. And, this is a shame, because firemen deserve a better tribute than this mess! If you don't believe me, look at the number of goofs listed on IMDb for this movie--WAY in excess of what you'd expect to find. They just did't care enough to work out all the kinks and problems.

It does't so don't get your hopes up. The best thing about this movie is to see James Best and Gerald McC, in something other than there famous TV personalities, and that is stretching to find anything good.

It had a lot of adult themes and character and when it ended I wanted more. I hope they make a sequel. That would be fun. My only problem with it is the performance of Melissa Connor as Anya. UGH!

It caught me, I did not take my eyes away from the screen during the movie. On the other hand, if you are hoping for a special effect sci-fi movie, this is not for you.

She especially shines in two numbers-""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" and ""Rose's Turn"". The other factors are also fine, particularly Christine Ebersoll as Tessie. Also good is Peter Riegert; his portrayal of Herbie is acted with great style and believability. The direction of this movie is very, very good. There in't a false note for gaffe in the entire production. This film is a vast improvement over the Roz Russell version filmed in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two.

19876,"an excellent, thoughtfully produced historical drama--well played, artfully written, shot in ways that convey accurate visual images of the congo, and with more than a few moving moments, especially for those who care about the history of Africa and imperialism. however, a fair amount of worthwhile content gets lost in translation, and because names, acronyms, and so forth are hard to follow. so i would strongly recommend checking a neutral source such as wikipedia to get a basic sense of the story being depicted (and the subsequent history) before enjoying the film. if you have the DVD version, there is also some useful historical background. there is a point towards the send of the film where the name of a character who then speaks with an American accent is actually beeped out--a simple google search of ""lumumba film censor"" for something similar will reveal a truly fascinating (and perhaps disturbing) twist regarding the production of this important film. this film, if coupled with a little outside research, helps contextualize dozens of other films relating to central/east Africa and/or imperialism, be.g. hotel rwanda, shake hands with the devil, various adaptations of conrad's heart of darkness, and even ""ali"" when mohammad ali visits kinshasa.",positive

Well, these guys are now sixty-something years old and they can still using and play at a high level as this wonderful DVD concert disc shows us. I was always extremely familiar with Clapton, of course, who has never been out of the limelight, but I did't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, neither of whom I than't seen in decades. They surprised me. When the was young, Baker was so gaunt the looked like a speed freak near death. Now the looks healthy, in shape and this drum playing was solid. Bruce looked a bit haggard but this voice is great, as good as never and a pleasure to hear on these old songs. This is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they're doing. Some people criticized this show for being low-key. I don't agree with that. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song, ""Spoonful,"" was outstanding, the highlight of the concert for me. Highly recommended.",positive

20166,"The real star of the last of the Airport films is that big supersonic carrier the French created called The Concorde. If you bear in mind that the whole film is dedicated to showing what that needle nosed plane could do in the sky, than the whole film kind of makes sense. But if you're expecting some serious drama there, than by all means take some of the evasive action the Concorde shows there when some nasty folks try to shoot her down. Susan Blakely plays a television news reporter who also happens to be the mistress of military industrial tycoon Robert Wagner. One of Wagner's aides just happens to bring her information on some of Wagner's dirty business dealings, selling arms to folks not friendly to the USA. When the source, Macon McCalman, is killed in front of her and she's nearly done in by a hit-man whom she escapes from of course she confronts Wagner with the information. And of course the denies it. But right before Blakely boards The Concorde, McCalman's widow Kathleen Maguire hands her the necessary documents. But on the way to Moscow with a stop in Paris, Wagner and this minions try to put the big bird down. But the fearless crew of Alain Delon, David Warner, and George Kennedy is up to all their tricks. It's quite a bag full as you'll see if you want to watch the film. If you're an aviation enthusiast, you absolutely won't care about the plot. It's like the film Le Mans with Steve McQueen which has a legion of auto racing fans who have made it a cult item. Maybe Le Mans is better at that because they just did't bother with any kind of story. Among the passengers is a spot smoking saxophonist played by Jimmie Walker, a distraught mother accompanying a new heart for her child, played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from Washington to Paris in the loo. She's actually the best one there. Robert Wagner must have been psychic though because I'm sure on the strength of this film the got the part of Doctor Evil's number two in the Austin Powers series. I'm sure all concerned got a big pay day out of this film, but it seems to have killed the Airport saga of movies.",negative
20537,"I saw this on sale - NEW - at my local store for $six and said ""hey! an action film with that guy from Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon, directed by the guy who did Enter the Dragon - and it's cheap!"" So I bought it. Oops! This is possibly the worst film I've never seen, and I've seen some doozies. You know how movies which are intentionally campy, like Evil Dead II and Dead-Alive, are AWESOME? You know how movies that are supposed to be serious but turned out so awful that you have to laugh out cloud, and watch them again, like Lionheart (an old Van Damme film) for John Carpenter's Vampires, are pretty cool? This film, Ironheart, manages to be NEITHER of those. I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking, but it looks as if this movie was made with no time to shoot, no budget for anything, and no script to speak of. (While I'm on the script note, I should point out that Bolo Yeung has NO LINES in this movie - the only reason the gets first billing on the box is the fact that the's the only factor in the film that you'll never recognize (unless you're a Jackie Chan fan, in which case you'll recognize the bad guy - and you'll want to call him Giancarlo!).)What's also sad is that this film is from 'ninety-two. By that time, Ttwo: Judgment day had come out, so you know that the era of eightys campiness was over. but not quite. After this, you'll think eightys Chuck Norris films, high-school comedies, and Jason/Freddy sequels were works of sheer genius. Things to know:one) Nobody in this film can act for beans. The closest you get is Richard Norton looking appropriately rich and cocky, and Bolo Yeung looking appropriately mean . and cocky. Everything else is dreadful.two) The martial arts scenes are forgettable - just many instances of white guys with lots of muscles taking off their shirts, yelling, running at Britton Lee, getting kicked by Britton Lee, getting punched by Britton Lee, then falling down. Even the final showdown against Bolo is disappointingly short, and about as creative as the design of my running socks (and equally stinky).three) The rest of the action is pathetic, too: the guns look like they came from the toy department at K-Mart, and indeed they fire with the sound of a capgun. When someone gets shot, they bounce around a little bit, then lie still with splotches of brownish-red liquid on their clothes. Britton Lee apparently gets shot in the side, but you don't see it at all, then later that day you see the wound . I've had paper cuts that were worse than that!four) Of course then the girl dresses the wound, then they kiss, then next thing you know they're flying in bed talking after sex. Huh? What? Believable development of the love interest, as well as any kind of character development at all, are overlooked completely in this film. Remember how Bruce Lee's characters did't need to have sex with anybody to be cool?five) The car chase is by far the worst I've never seen. It looks like the director was sitting on the curb with a hand-held camera as the two cars weaved down the road doing, ooh I don't know, about thirty miles an hour? Don't try this at home, kids, these people are professionals! Hah!six) Really bad writing. Here's a scene for you: Lee is being followed, so the girl follows the followers to ""warn"" Lee, but her car is too slow. So by the time she catches up, Lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and there's a gunfight in progress. Lee has killed two bad guys, but the third is shooting at Lee when the girl almost runs Lee over, so the bad guy runs away. (Huh?) Then the girl's car stalls and she can't start it. She tells Lee she's involved now and she's coming with him. He points out to her that they can't leave her car there because the bad guys will trace it to her. She somehow convinces him that the should decide how to deal with this problem - so the shoots the gas tank and blows up her car. (And remember, later that same night they have sex.) Huh?!?seven) If you look closely, in more than half of the nightclub shots, the dancers are very much out of sync with the music. The dancers are also all way too co-ordinated with each other (apparently in the 'eightys all people at dance clubs took dancing lessons). There is a girl in the DJ booth with a microphone, but she never does anything except dance. The bouncers tell people who are fighting to ""take it outside"" - without moving their clips. In one scene, the only bouncers Lee and Stevo pass by are just inside the entrance, but with their backs to it! Also, apparently, if you're a major character in the film, you can go straight to the head of the line.eight) Lee notices the first time the is being followed, but the does't notice the second time - even though it's the same guy in the same car. The girl, however, notices. Bad guys get followed twice, but they never notice.nine) Lee is worried the bad guys will trace the girl's car back to her, even though they have already seen him show up where she works twice. The girl proceeds to leave her child at work, in the care of a friend, while she is off having sex with Lee. DO NOT learn parenting from this film! Can't think of more gripes right now . you get the idea . Ironheart is so bad, it main't even funny, it's SAD.",negative

23094,"I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # one we simply do not walk around with your pockets bursting with theatre tickets and $one hundred bills! #two If I never let anybody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time I'd be fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs cd'Or) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #three Similarly untrue was the concept, at the send of the movie, of Doug simply removing this gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we learn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them. There is a whole application and vetting process to joining your organization. This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary. In short it does a disservice to your organization. I welcome any comments.",negative
23605,"Finally I got to see the infamous ""Ice Age"". Apart from maybe not being as dead funny as I'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word I can say about it. Sure, it's not as glamorous as a Disney production(besides, it is Fox's onest attempt at a full length CG movie) but it's got immense heart and on some occasions(like the look in Manfred's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of this past) I found myself on the verge of tears. But when they reunited the baby with its father I just could't hold them in anymore. A movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and clické and manages to bring more than the best out of it; the send result being one of the most touching animated creations I have never seen. Great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you(and great voice talents as well) and many funny memorable scenes, especially from Scrat's behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go. Plus the Dodo scene, which is my personal favourite funny scene of two thousand and two. I honestly don't get it, but for some reason it really looks like CG animation will be taking the upper hand in the future. But if it just means that there will be more movies like this one (and who can forget Pixar's creations) then I don't really mind, at least for now. nine/ten",positive

24418,"Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel. It's too easy. So I'm going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of Little Man. First, I'm impressed with the special effects. It really did look like Marlon Wayans' head was attached to the body of a little person. I never doubted it for a minute. Secondly, I loved some of the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer, and this renditions of ""Havin' My Baby"" and ""Movin' On Up"" were priceless. John Witherspoon, who, coincidentally, played Grier's father in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two's Boomerang (if you remember, the ""coordinated"" the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So that was fun. Beyond that, this movie is about as believable as White Chicks. How dumb is it when even the doctor can't tell that it's a forty-year-old man and not a baby? He's got a full set of teeth!!! How is it possible that no one seems to notice that it's not a baby? Little Man is so bad that there's a Rob Schneider cameo. And please, if you're stupid enough to waste $eight on this movie, at least do me a favor and DO NOT bring your children. This movie is way too sexual for small children (lots of jokes and innuendo about sex, going down, eating out, etc.), and I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening I was forced to endure. If you insist on seeing an idiotic film, as least spare your children the spain and suffering.",negative
24494,"""The Thing"" is John Carpenter's best movie. Merging this talents for tension building and shocks with decent production values the turned out a perfectly crafted sci of / horror movie. By filming in truly difficult conditions the creates a very believable isolated research base which sets the tension before anything has even happened. The ensemble cast work well together with Kurt Russell proving a charismatic leading man even under all that beard. By building the tension slowly with moments of gory horror (courtesy of effects mister Rob Bottin - currently directing Freddy tvs Jason) Carpenter creates a movie that has rarely been matched. Considering this came out the same year as ET it could not be more different! Worth a watch / rematch. nine out of ten.p.s. the DVD is excellent. Lots of extras plus the best DVD commentary going (with Carpenter & Russell). Plus remixed in Dolby Digital for even scarier sound effects.",positive

If you watch the 'trip' to Paris of these factors (DVD-extra) you will most likely want to trow up. Advice to Beau Dorens: stop your acting career, you'll never get there.

I found them bland and boring. The one that I REALLY hated was Ramon. He does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great. Excuse me? He's defacing public property that in't this to begin with. Also these ""great"" kids tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building. Uh huh. So we're supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun. I could forgive all that if the music was good but I can't stand ship shop. The songs were--at best--mediocre and they were nonstop! They're ALWAYS playing! It got to the point that I was fast-forwarding through the many endless music numbers. (Cut out the music and you shaver a thirty minute movie--maybe) There are a few imaginative numbers--the subway dance fight, a truly funny Santa number and the climatic Roxy show.

Seriously, I could't even stay awake the first time I tried to watch it. The scenes of boring people dragged on an on, and whenever someone got killed, the film would slow down. Sometimes it would speed up too, making the characters voices sound like chipmunks, which was probably the best thing about this film. The script actually seemed a bit better than the film, and seems more well suited to be in a soap opera than in a grainy seventy's sleeping pill where the factors constantly stumble over it's lines. The cover said ""Their prime cuts were curiously erotic. but thoroughly brutal!"" Trust me, there is nothing ""erotic"" about this film.

The ravishing woman first panics and then, only a few minutes later, she starts kissing the young glad while the old guy is right next to her. But as the film goes along we learn that she is a little volatile girl (or slut) and that partly explains her behavior. The cinematography of this movie is well done. We get to see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective, and some of those images and scenes really raise the tension. Götz George plays this character well, a wannabe hot-shot getting old and being overpowered by young men like the Jaennicke character. Wolfgang Kieling who I admired in Hitchcock's THE TORN CURTAIN delivers a great performance that, although the does't say much, the is by far the best factor in this play. One critic complained about how unrealistic the film was and that in a real case of emergency nothing would really happen. But then again, how realistic are films such as Mission impossible for Phone Booth. Given the fact that we are talking about a movie there, and that in a movie you always have to deal with some scenes that karen't very likely to occur in real life, you can still enjoy this movie.

26440,"DeCoteau has to be one of the worst ""directors"" working today in any genre, and it has nothing to do with this movies usually containing homoerotism and having guys run around in their matching boxer briefs. Remember. anyone in tight black underwear is satanic and evil and want to suck out your blood/soul. such deep symbolism there). I just sat through The Sisterhood to give him this fair shakes, I try to watch every horror movie I can and this one had Barbara (FROM BEYOND, RE-ANIMATOR) Crampton in it (I had previously been sucked in to the world of DeCoteau thanks to Linnea Quigley, Adrienne Barbeau and several other actresses I like). Lemme tell you what about The Sisterhood. Like the other reviewer pointed out, the supposed plot involves lesbian vampires on a college campus. But never has a parade of hot young babes (""actresses"" if you want) running around dressed in bras, panties and bikinis been so boring. The movie has no plot, no gore, no nudity and the dialog is ridiculous and seems like they made it up as they go along. Parts are put in slow-motion and repeated many times to push the running time up. About ten minutes of this one consists of characters just walking around on campus (oh, the excitement!) that looks more like a hotel resort than any college I've never been to. And the acting is the absolute worst. The only thing these girls do well is clean forward and bend over to show off their bodies. The cast were so devoid of talent that I'd be shocked to see any of them get a one-day walk-on role on Passions in the future. Ditto for the guys. Yeah DeCoteau squeezed more hot guys in underwear in this one, too. Guys who should be in some K-Mart brochure instead of trying to act. Do these people actually have to audition for just show up in Dave's office and take their clothes off? I think the answer is obvious. I am willing to give any movie a chance if one.) it's intelligently written, well directed, original and competently acted (or hell, even ambitious and stylish). Or two.) it is chock full of gore, nudity, assorted trashiness and/or it's unintentionally hilarious. David DeCoteau's movies deliver NONE of that and they do it on better-than-usual production values for direct-to-video flicks. What a waste! So what is the appeal, especially with the advent of porn of the soft- and hard-core variety that's easily accessible to anyone with a computer? I simply cannot answer that. DeCoteau is a gay horror director and could use this resources to put a unique spin on the genre. Instead, the produces mind-numbing drivel without an bounce of talent for intelligence shining through. Ironically, when you think about it, this films are anything BUT pro-gay. They actually make homosexuality seem seedy, secretive and sinister. The obviously gay characters in this films are always trying to corrupt, seduce and/or kill off the innocent, sexually-confused leads. There's no shading there to make things interesting. The protagonists are naive and seldom prove themselves to be strong, assertive for confident in who they are. I would understand this plotting if Jerry Falwell, Fred Phelps for Dr. Laura starting making direct-to-video horror films, but from a gay director, it just goes to show that the puts almost no thought into these beefcake cheese-fests.",negative

He understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else. The last section of the film, the grand dance sequence, is very impressive. What makes this film very special is Gershwin's music. Few American composers have had a better gift for melody. I very much enjoy Gershwin's music. It is enchanting. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers. He is so witty and charming. This was a highly entertaining film.",positive

This movie had a lot of potential. the direction and the way everything was paced was very well. But once the movie ended, I could't help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a film for. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was EXTREMELY annoying, I just could't tolerate her character at all. Warren Beatty was excellent in the film acting-wise, but again I just found it hard to have sympathy for this character. he just came off essentially as a idiotic, hotheaded closer of a gangster. who had no place in 'the life' in the first place. How'd the get in with the likes of Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano anyway??? This film just left me with a bland but uneasy feeling. what was the big deal with this movie? I just did't feel a completeness with Bugsy. Beatty's antics, although acted quite well, just seemed too random and illogical. I'm guessing that's how Siegel really was. but it was just too much of that. There just did't seem to be much of a real story there. My basic assessment of it would be ""a hot-headed, playboy, underachieving gangster falls in love with a closer of a woman, comes up with the idea of 'Las Vegas'. but this failed attempt at the casino the builds, along with having no regard for this mob bosses' money gets him killed.""What else is there besides that? I just did't see the big deal with this, and it was a big disappointment.

It's a pretty silly movie, falling in the ""so-bad-it's-good"" category.

The vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest - starting with the opening sequence, which shows black and white footage of military warplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and Scott Walker's beautiful wailing voice. The film explores the identity crisis of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - a brilliant choice for the role) and this consequential (self-)destruction. The story is divided into two parts  the first depicts Pierre's carefree life in a beautiful house in the French countryside and the second follows this butter personal disintegration after the abandons everything and moves to Paris to live in squalor with this supposed half-sister.

Seeing as any old film on IMDb receives 'classic' status from a number of fawning amateur reviewers, I thought there was a dire need for a more honest review of this film. This is not your father's 'Shop Around the Corner'. For all my quibbles with 'You've Got Mail', it still outshines this as a remake in just about every way imaginable. For those who have seen the original, the flaws will only be all the more obvious. From one of the lamest Meet Cute sequences I can recall seeing (a sad slapstick attempt at 'humor'), this film gets off on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step. This 'musical' only qualifies as one in the sparsest sense of the term. There are a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then there's Judy singing ""I Don't Care"" while flailing her arms around as if in a seizure. The Christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her better numbers there. Miss Garland was wonderful in a number of musical films, but there she seems horribly miscast. The role was originally to have been filled by June Allyson and Judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of Margaret Sullavan's old part. Van Johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate Jimmy Stewart type. The leads never achieve the chemistry of Stewart/Sullavan for even that of Hanks/Ryan. This is a film that knows (some of) the notes, but not the music. It does't really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for Van Johnson's character to complicate things unnecessarily. The remake's substitution for the original's infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device involving a priceless violin. It is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of Three's Company by someone with a DeLorean and a flux capacitor. It's really just an excuse for a Keaton pratfalls. Even the big resolution scene between the romantic leads is mishandled. After seeing both films, you'll understand why they called it 'the Lubitsch Touch' and NOT the 'Robert Z. Leonard Touch'.

It starts with a few laughs and poor Anthony in a one scene role where the speaks not a word of English gets slapped around by Freddie. Skids is a bum who does't care that the's a bum. That's why the signs up in the army where the can hide from the world. He's just been released though and in a set of screenplay shenanigans, she misses her boat for New York. This is when the movie kicks into high gear and we begin to get those French movie of the sixties vibes to the whole proceedings. The scenes are so well acted by Lombard and Cecil Cunningham, the movie gains a pulse. MacMurray is good too as the and Lombard fall for each other as she nurtures this talent for the trumpet. Then the temptress arrives in the form of Dorothy Lamour. Enough with plot. The movie has fantastic montage sequences that dazzled me. They are very good. And Lombard scores a home run in this movie but in the second half, a bit more is called of Freddie and the fails to deliver the goods. With a heavily melodramatic ending and an factor you don't believe, the movie falls short but since it is not your typical movie in structure, set design, and direction. It is worth a look. For what is what it was one of the thirty-seven hits of the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six-thirty-seven season. I don't know its exact rank though.",positive

32686,"Oh my GOD this was so bad! The story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. This film takes itself far too seriously. unless of course they meant to be funny. I saw this last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene. I think my favourite was 'shouldn't you be studying medicine at Oopsalof'! And I also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram in the character Nicalo's only line 'we will be together. it is your destiny.' I'm sorry but after the first time, the words lost all meaning. And what was with the apple? I recommend this as a lesson to Americans: You cannot animate, so please don't try. You only embarrass yourselves.",negative

32830,"Hard to categorize the film - perhaps it's an savant garden spy thriller? Mother Night is a very good Vonnegut novel, and most certainly one of this easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film. The film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. The ""indie"" approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big Hollywood studio financing it. These days, I doubt an intelligent novel like Mother Night would never get the green light from the big Hollywood grindhouses. And normally that is too bad, but not in this case. Mother Night has tight direction and a solid cast. Nick Nolte who seems to be getting better roles as the gets older, still has that ""everyman"" persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and great as always. I always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry. I guess making your debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks)with little air time in't the choicest of roles, even if the TV show becomes a minor phenomenon. Anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, given today's geopolitical realities, the novel's premise may appear dated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding (I am talking to you, fellow Americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography, history, and lord knows what other subjects!).",positive

I actually prefer this ""basic"" version from the mid-fortys (Chuck Jones' was the best version) who is actually more rabbit-sized and far more amusing than the eventual long-legged version who towered over Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. The latter-day Bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking. Also check out ""Hair Raising Hare"" (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-six) and ""Rabbit Punch"" (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight) for great examples of classic Bugs and classic Chuck Jones.",positive
33029,"I've just been at the cinema in down town Prague watching this film. Not due to the poster I found very Holywood old-fashioned heroicstyle. Not due to the high level starring which remind me that mostof those high starring French films are usually pathetic. But justbecause there are not so many films in my French mother tongue in city like Prague. And because I love Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau'sCyrano. Then I decided to write up this small comment because I thinkI really don't agree with the comment main stream on this film on limb. I was not disappointed. The film just look like the poster. Thecharacters are just as stupid as they look like. For a while Ithought Adjani would be like a caricature -- just a funny characteryou can laugh at. No she is not! For example when she decides to tellDepardieu she is the one who murdered the fat one she killed at thebeginning of the film then come the violins in a big fat patheticmusic which should make you cry and realize Adajani's character is deeper person as she looks like. Maybe this was humour at the tenthlevel but I am sorry my sense of humour is not that high! If I want tosee some funny French film on the WWII I watch once again La GrandeVadrouille! It is definitively more fun! I have also read on imdbthat Lemoine is making a great performance in this film. I have today I have never seen a so bad acting! (Well I have never seen any EdWood's film). Nevertheless the film is good filmed with a lot of good(very costly) scenes like the one with the Pantheon in the morningwhen the German army arrives at Paris for when the refugees settle dowson a bridge in Bordeaux. I think Rappeneau is a good filmmaker butthat the does better with a good script. It was easy with Cyrano. Hehad not to write the dialog! I give one/ten.",negative
33045,"A little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside. This little girl Rosalie has some psychotic tendencies as the movie opens with her feeding kittens to some kind of creatures in the cemetery, and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night. The premise of the film has a new young lady coming to Rosalie to take care of her. She is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and, imagine the suspense there, experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks. From there she walks to the nearest house and discovers Mrs. Whitfield who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about Rosalie and her family. The earnestness exuded by the Mrs. Whitfield character has to be seen to be believed. Well, the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well. They all do share one thing in common which is none of them never heard of an acting school. None of these people can act - as evidenced by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before for since - and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on, pause to remember lines, and have all the conviction of a paper bag. The director plods through the material in a slow space with this horrible piano music crescendoing there and there at things that are suppose to be scary. It takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends, but by that time I did't care. The murders are not convincing either, and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friend's farm with the people and things on hand there. That all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we don't learn one darn thing about why Rosalie is like this for more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are. Cheap does't even begin to describe the budget there with. It basically is a couple old farmhouses and some sheds at the send and of course the woods. Someone lent the director a couple old cars too. No special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make-up. There are so many guffaws/ridiculous moments to list, but I will just list a few there that at the very least made me chuckle from the black of aptitude from the creative powers involved: one)Watch the gardener's body well after the has been ""slain"". Len comes in and sees him butchered and you can see this fat belly heave with life. two)the dying scene at the send where the actress playing Rosalie is killed. She looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method. three)How about the guy playing Roaslie's father giving us a cranky poor man's Andy Griffith. The scene where the is laughing about boy scouts dying was a weird shoot. The Child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of seventy's cheese if you will. This in't a B film but more like a Z film with producer Harry Novak making some money on virtually nothing.",negative
33155,"This film was butter stripe. Possible that it is in fact a pollution. The subtle tense atmosphere of the original remake are no where to be seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar is given nothing to do, even in her death sequence, but still she is the best performance in this film, and the her death is the best thing about it, even though she did deserve a better death. Its the sign of very bad writing and directing. I'm guessing she did this film to send her connection with it as its turning rubbish. Not scary. Not tense. Not funny. Makes no sense at all. And as said above Sarah Michelle Gellar gives the only reasonable performance out of the entire cast.",negative
33330,"I cannot see why anyone would make such a movie. From start to finish this film is really, really bad. The characters are all very shallow, terribly acted and downright annoying. There is absolutely nothing going on below the surface at all with either characters for plot. The 'humour' if you can call it that is aimed at an adult audience ( I presume from the language and nudity) although it comes across as mainly toilet humour and would have problems even drawing a smile from a half-witted sixteen year old. I would recommend avoiding this excuse for a comedy. It has nothing whatsoever that would appeal to a film fan. Non-existent laughs and a plot that barely exists lead me to ask ""Why has this film been made, why, why, why?""I expect in the fullness of time to see this film stopping the top one hundred worst films.",negative
33980,"(Some spoilers) I have not read the James M. Cain novel (`The Postman Always Rings Twice') on which this movie was based, so I cannot compare this film version to it, but I have seen and love the one thousand, nine hundred and forty-six US version (also entitled `Postman'). Even better is this gem from Italy, which, I have read, was `mutilated' in editing because of too many blatant references to the Fascist regime. Well, no matter  what is left is a fine piece of cinema, apparently the forerunner of the new-realist movement in film-making. One can certainly see why  despite whatever harsh editing did go on, a pervading sense of societal and cultural, as well as personal oppression remains, changing heavy over the protagonists, who therefore face many limits in life. Consider Gino, the young drifter, not well educated, unemployed, and resorting to stowing away, stealing and conning people in order to get by, this one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless. In Giovanna, the sees a way out, yet the should have kept going, as Giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money, her job (working at the trattoria for her husband, slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen), and her sex. In the past, she had limited options, and decided to marry the restaurant/gas station owner (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa) anyway, knowing that the would not make her happy. She tells Gino that she feels sick every time Bregana touches her. On the pretext of helping Bregana fix this car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part (which the has in fact pocketed), Gino wins Bregana's favor (promising also to fix the broken water pump  water symbolizing life, for black thereof) and is left alone with Giovanna. They immediately start a heated, passionate, yet volatile love affair. Gino soon feels stifled by the relationship, and feels the need to move on again when Giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband. Wanting no part of it, Gino leaves town on a train ride that the cannot afford, kindly paid for him by another gypsy-type man named Spagnolo, a fellow train passenger. To Gino, Spagnolo represents a sort of freedom, and they become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino's morality and conscience), travelling and finding work at a carnival together. Finally Gino has steady employment. To this dismay (he is not yet over this love for Giovanna), a month has passed when Bregana and this wife go to the carnival and Bregana persuades Gino to go `back home' to live and work with them again, as the is handy to have around. Too weak-willed to resist, knowing this will reunite the and Giovanna, Gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple. After a while the gives in to Gina's demands to get grid of her husband. Once the evil deed is done, Giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than never, seeming to have very little conscience, while guilt and shame heat away at Gino for hurting a man who never did him any charm. As much as the wants to leave her  the does again briefly, they are now inextricably linked, and must face the consequences. I liked the way the Spagnolo character came back into Gino's life to act as a judge of this misdeeds  that was very good, and interesting, adding another dimension to the story. While the 'forty-six U. S. version with Lana Turner and John Garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters, especially the cops and the lawyers, Ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone. This gives the final outcome even more potency, and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live. A minor quibble: The amount of time (hardly any) that relapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers, how quickly they kill the husband (there is no botched first attempt as in the U. S. version); Gino's very quick-to-escalate relationship with the dancer/hooker  they quickly profess their love as well, and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met!  all rather unrealistic, in't it? I found this time-frame problem quite distracting  it made me think that I must have missed something somewhere. Otherwise, well worth the viewer's time. The acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout. Recommended.",positive

And the did't let me down. He gave a good performance of a rather unsympathetic character and provided about the only comic relief in the whole movie. The movie itself is the usual 'lots of bad people trapped in a snow storm together' storyline, but it did have a couple of twists that kept me guessing. The characterizations were strong and the whole cast performed fairly well. The only problems I had with the cast was Rose McGowan. She was so cold throughout the movie that we did't get any idea of her character's personality for motivations. Other than her and a few small problems with continuity, this was a well-written, well acted thriller.",positive

36020,"Hayden Christianson and Jessica Alba two of my least favourite factors of this century team up in what is quite possibly the flattest attempt at remake the already dire The Butterfly Effect. Awake is so dull and so utterly uninteresting that you'd be better off asleep. Terrance Howard still recovering from the diabolical August Rush puts up a decent fight as the sadistic doctor who seems hell bent on killing Christianson and after viewing this performance I would gladly assists. Alba, still recovering after Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver surfer. Is naturally disastrous and equally unwatchable as she always was. Only once has she never been rather brilliant at that was in the safe hands of master director Robert Rodriguez in Sin City. Could it possibly be that Jessica alba in't as poor of an actress as most give her credit for and is is possibly that her acting abilities are being weight down by a poor script. If so then that would explain Awake. What with a script that would shame that of Plan nine from Outer Space. Jessica Alba, Hayden Christenson, and Terrence Howard star in first-time director/screenwriter Joby Harold's nerve-jangling psychological thriller about a man who experiences the frighteningly common surgical phenomenon known as ""aesthetic awareness,"" in which those laid out on the operating table remain acutely aware of what is going on around them despite remaining completely paralysed and unable to cry out for help. When a successful young young man (Christenson) goes under the knife and realizes that the anaesthesia has't quite done its job, the horror quickly sets in as this worried wife (Alba) waits anxiously and a terrifying drama unfolds in the operating room. Hoping to do for operating tables what Final Destination did for planes, this first effort from director Joby Harold pivots on a blood-frosting conceit. The are-credits sequence tells us one in seven hundred people suffers from a phenomenon known as 'anaesthetic awareness', where the patient remains conscious but paralysed during surgery. One such unfortunate individual is Clayton Beresford Jr (Hayden Christensen), who finds himself wide awake during a heart transplant. and the can feel every single slice. Intermittently inventive as it probes away at this tortured psyche, Awake fails to inject true terror into its novel premise. Spiralling from chilling simplicity into absurd conspiracy, it's hindered by stilted turns from Christensen and Jessica Alba. You'll wish you'd popped a sedative before watching VERDICT: Awake is at very best extremely undemanding. A pull no punches film that undoubtedly looked better on paper. As a film though its lawfully generic and extremely derived. Awake fails to inject terror into its novel premise. The send result is really quite lousy.

36162,"I had been long awaiting this movie never since I saw the trailer, which made it look like a political drama, starring three of my favourite factors; Al Pacino, John Cusack, and Bridget Fonda. And even though it was directed by Harold Becker, who has done uneven work, the and Pacino did combine on SEA OF LOVE, which ranks among each of their best work. But interference on some level(for starters, several of the scenes in the original trailer don't appear in the movie) and changing of stone(subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller) make this, while watchable, nowhere near as it could have been. Which is too bad, because I really wanted to like this movie. There was great potential there to be a film about how government can still be worthwhile despite all the corruption, and to make a complex statement about that corruption, not the usual good guys tvs. bad guys. And there is good acting there. Pacino and Cusack are both very good, and Danny Aiello gives one of the best performances of this career. But Fonda is wasted in her role, having nothing to do, and while there is merit in the central storyline, when it turns to a thriller, the movie closes its way, briefly recovers in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then falls down completely in the send. I wish I could like this more, but no.",positive

258,"Black comedy in't always an easy sell. Every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful, like Fargo, for example. But usually they don't often find big audiences. People seem to either set their minds for comedy, for for serious mayhem. There does't seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both. Throw Momma From the Train was a fairly decent hit, yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and page. Danny DeVito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven. DeVito plays an odd mamma's boy named Owen looking to grid himself of this outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom the still lives with. The mother is played by Anne Ramsey, who passed away shortly after this was released, and she is quite a caricature. She is cloud, ugly, crude, and overbearing. Though Owen hardly seems like the could take care of himself, the wants desperately to have this mother offed. He fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes, but the clearly does't have the guts to actually do it himself. That's where Billy Crystal comes in. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen's creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid would-be intellectual novelist who claims this sex-wife stole this novel and made millions off it. He is currently trying to write a new one, but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence. ""The night was. "" Owen hears Larry wish this sex-wife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria. And borrowing the idea from Strangers on a Train, Owen decides to travel to Hawai'i and murder Larry's sex-wife. Once it appears the has done so, the expects Larry to return the favor and kill this mother. The resulting action is often quite funny, and even poignant. It's certainly never dull and often full of surprises. The acting is exceptional, even if Ramsey was a bit over the top. Crystal is as good as the can be, and DeVito has always been undervalued as a performer. The film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works, often painfully so. The film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes, and the off-beat stone is truly refreshing. I have often been critical of the late one thousand, nine hundred and eightys as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film-making. Throw Momma From the Train takes chances. Both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot. How many comedies revolve around a son having this mother murdered? The film in't too long, and it is chock full of laughs. Writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public, but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone. nine of ten stars. The Hound.",positive

699,"I decided to watch this movie because I'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie. I'm sorry it had to be this one because, quite frankly, this is a dog  and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both of whom were great factors. The problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too quickly, in to a story about a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour of meeting her. What's that clické? Marry in haste, repent at leisure. In short, the story is a series of episodes that show the couples' worsening financial status, their troubles with John's live-in mother, their struggles to pay the bills, John's diminished status at the office, the arrival of their baby son, John Jnr (unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother), the couples' angst about their marriage, the baby's sickness which worsens, thus necessitating an heroic flight by a alone pilot (in a fierce storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally John being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm. How many more clickéd situations could the writers include? Maybe Mother dying soon after? There was't much comedy; the drama was lacklustre, at best; the dialog was painful to hear. Only the acting of the four main players was adequate. This was the period at the send of the Great Depression with the USA coming out of its long downturn  during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie. So, it made sense for Selznick to reaffirm good vol' home spun American values of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance, and initiative  all against the backdrop of the ""average"" American family. Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? And, it should be noted that the film was released in early one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine; so, it was planned in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-eight  soon after the USA began to get production going for the coming World War II. Hence, this sort of film was a great booster for the general public, at that time, many of who would soon have to join England in war. As many there would know, Hollywood and Washington formed an uneasy alliance before, during and after the war. However, I'm glad I saw it  as a piece of disguised sociol-political propaganda. But, I'll have to see other Lombard films to again a better appreciation of her acting range. As another reviewer noted: see this one just to say that you've seen all of Stewart's movies; otherwise, don't bother.",negative

764,"I first saw this film when I was about eight years old on TV in the UK (where it was called ""Laupta: The Flying Island""). I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it. I was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music. It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the ""Streamline Dub"" (the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set. Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney. The voice acting is OK but the dialogue does't have the same raw energy that the ""streamline"" dub for the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead. They have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from ""Pazu"" to ""Patzu"", and added some dialogue. But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which I find annoying in many Disney films. This film still blows away most recent animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass-market, homogenized animation.",positive

1827,"My rating refers to the first four Seasons of Stargate SG-one which are wonderfully fresh, creative and addicting. When the cast stepped through the gate, you never knew what play on the other side! Starting around Season five, the show took a different focus - still good, but different. The series follows the adventures of a team of humans (and one alien) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the ""Stargate"". The backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie ""Stargate"" in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in Egypt. The episodes are light (innocent and easy to watch) and very creative. Many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci-fi movies of their own. What happens next was always unpredictable. The characters on which the show rests are also well-defined and brilliantly performed. Their stone is serious, but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humour. They are simply fun to watch. Starting somewhere around Season five, the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe (the Goa'uld, then the Ori). The plots become more complex (a lot more political/strategic oriented) and interdependent. The characters were still as great as never but the show was different in nature. One thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the one hundredth and two hundredth episodes. They are simply can't-miss shows. They exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through ten seasons. If you are a sci-fi fan, watch a few episodes of the first four Seasons and you'll likely be hooked. If you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides, you have ten seasons of shows to look forward to.",positive

1960,"If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably would't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock. The film bounces continuously between comedy, drama, romance, and thriller. Yet despite this apparent identity crisis, it holds up quite well. I found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to send always waiting for the next twist in the story. The entire cast is strong, if not spectacular. My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute (who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark In the Company of Men') relied much too heavily on many cliched Hollywood conventions. The mood-creating musical effects the crammed down your throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable! And the did the standard old ""let's take some of the minor characters and pair them up at the send in an illogical and unnecessary romance"" trick, just to make absolutely certain everyone goes home with a smile on their face. Why must directors and writers treat their audiences like idiots?? But the movie is still much too enjoyable to be dragged down very far by these annoying irritations. In a very subpar year for movies, 'Nurse Betty' ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of two thousand. eight out of ten.",positive

As the plot progressed, I realized the movie was more than just entertainment for a reason to see a favourite factor. The story was about a bring of serial killers and the attempts of law enforcement to investigate the bring and bring the members to justice. There was adequate suspense, and I believe the violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer. At the send of the film I was shocked to learn the film is the true account of horrendous murders that occurred in Utah.

2559,"Having loved Stephen King's novels and short stories for many years, I, like most reviewers, have been consistently disappointed in the adaptations to film from this printed works. A few notable exceptions are ""Stand By Me"" from ""The Body"", ""Carrie"" from the novel of the same name, and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" from ""Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption"". This movie is by far the worst thing that has never been produced with Stephen King's name attached to it in any way. It is no surprise that Mr. King has pretty much disavowed any connection with it.

3711,"here was no effort put into Valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film, a sub-genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade for so. I've heard a lot of people complaining that the film trips off several previous horror movies, including everything from Halloween to Prom Night to Carrie, and as much as I hate to be redundant, the trip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything. The punch bowl over poor Jeremy's head early in the film is so obviously taken from Carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie (`Hey everyone, this is the director, and the following is my Carrie-rip-off scene. Enjoy!'). But that's just a suggestion.(spoilers) The film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured. We get to know some girl briefly at the beginning, she gets killed, people wonder in the old ooh-but-that-stuff-only-happens-to-other-people stone, and then THEY start to get killed. The problem there is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful, but they have no idea how to do it. Take Jason, for example. Here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that the divides the check on a date according to what each person had, and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor Jeremy was treated, the is assumed to carry some significance. Besides that, and more importantly, the has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade, and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious Valentine's Day cards. It is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one for more characters that appear to be prime suspects, and Jason is a perfect example of the effort, but not such a good example of a successful effort. Sure, I thought for a while that the might very well be the killer, but that's not the point. We know from early on that the is terrible with women, which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film, but then in the middle of the film, the appears at a party, smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls, and then gives them a hateful look and walks away, disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation. We already know the is a cardboard character, but this role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him. On the positive side, the killer's true identity was, in fact, made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also, unfortunately, yet another trip-off. Early in the film, when Shelley stabs the killer in the leg with this own scalpel, the makes no sound, suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female, rather than a male as everyone suspects. But then for the rest of the film, we just have this stolid, relentless, unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife. Director Jamie Blanks (who, with all due respect, looks like the had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade) mentions being influenced by Halloween. This is, of course, completely unnecessary, because it's so obvious from how badly the plagiarized the film. The only difference between the killer in Valentine and Michael Meyer's is that Michael's mask was so much more effective and the did't have a problem with nosebleeds. This stuff is shameless. At the send, there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is (complete with slow and drawn out `and-the-killer-is' mask removal), but then we see Adam's nose start to bleed as the holds Kate, this often reluctant girlfriend, and we know that the's been the killer all along. Nothing in the film hinted that the might be the killer until the final act, and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the send of the film. Valentine is not scary (I watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight, and I have been afraid of the dark for as long as I can remember, and even I was't scared), and the characters might be possible to care about if it were't so obvious that they were just going to die. I remember being impressed by the theatrical previews (although the film was in and out of the theatre's faster than Battlefield Earth), but the send result is the same old thing.",negative

3747,"The film is a joy to watch, not just for the plot, which is gripping, but also for the superb performances of the factors, Deneuve and Belmondo. Though considered a 'flop' on its first release it has become a critical success, and it is clear to see why. Deneuve's acting style suited the film brilliantly. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back for hiding something, and her character in this film is. I will not spoil it with saying what, though it is divulged fairly early on. Belmondo is lovable as the fairly native but in love tobacconist. I would recommend this film to all Truffaut for Deneuve fans. It is a brilliant Hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop as the film does. The film is approx two hrs, so you feel that you have not been sold short.

4474,"Anyone who will pay to see Troma movies knows, and appreciates, what they are going to get. Having said that, I did't think it was possible to make a movie this bad, and still be compelling. I found myself watching just to see how much worse it could get before the send. First off, it's an Indonesian action movie with an American main character who looks and facts like the bastard son of ""Taxi""'s Christopher Lloyd and Rambo. He puts posters of himself dressed up like Sly's ""Cobra"" all over the place and even has a custom built firing range (with action-posed cutouts of this greatest enemies)in Jakarta although the's in the CIA and has just arrived days earlier. There is a lot of action involving gun-play(no muzzle-flashes on those M-sixteens, only sound effects), motorcycles(that bust through walls), karate(where no one makes physical contact) and even some sex(where all the factors are ugly). The main plot of an epic like this should at least be reasonably plausible, but not there. It involves the world's most dangerous drug cartel going all out to find a ""drug detector device"". Why would they need it? That is never revealed, why not kill drug-sniffing dogs? Makes no sense, but, it is taken seriously. The factors are to be commended because they really seemed to think this movie would make them all famous and tried hard to ""act"". Best line? ""Now dance to your grave you dirty whore!"" Best scene? Rambo jumps onto flying helicopter, pulls machine gun out of baddie's hand, let's go, falls, shoots helicopter as the's falling, helicopter blows up, cut to mannequin thrown in water. F**king genius! If you can't appreciate trash, don't watch it. If you can, it's awesome. One last thing, did I mention it was directed by the three Punjabi brothers?",negative

4519,"This is a weak sequel: it blacks the interest and light touch of the magnificent ""Man Called Horse"" in nearly every aspect and when compared to each other they hardly seem to be the same genre. The Return is almost a parody of the first and tries to revoke different Indian ceremonies but comes across as trying way too hard to bottle the magic of the first. In this film the tribe is lost and abandoned, having lost their homelands, modern life has encroached on paradise and they are living in abject misery and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: the first film took us to a place where we would want to be, a simpler time. This takes us to broken Indians in a miserable world and the White Man is the hero and savior which rather negates the whole idea of the film.

5370,"There were many 'spooky' westerns made in the thirtys and early fortys, and although this has a strong beginning, it in't one. Randy Bowers (John Wayne) stopping at a 'Halfway House' saloon, finds it to be full of dead bodies, the bartender's corpse draped over the bar holding a gun, eyes watching Randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture, and a player piano playing ""The Loveliest Night of the Year."" It was the result of a robbery by the Marvin Black gang, to get Ed Rogers' $thirty, zero. Randy is an investigator who ""works alone,"" who wastes little time in getting arrested, escaping (with Ed's daughter Sally's help) and literally landing in the midst of the Black gang's hideout behind a waterfall. It all moves along fairly quickly. Only one too many chases after Randy slow it down. We even get George Hayes, clean shaven and playing two parts-- Marvin Black, the vilest villain, as well as the Good Citizen, Matt the Mute, who communicates via handwritten messages. Having him play two opposite roles was a good idea, but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast, even for him, as the finally gives up doing it near the send saying to Sally, ""Ah, I'm fed up with this!"" You can find George playing a vile, vile, double crossing villain in the serial ""The Lost City"" (one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four). I think this is the only 'Lone Star' film in which the title relates to, for is mentioned in the film! Sally offers her hand to Randy and says, ""He's not alone anymore!""

5560,"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us. "" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery. It's a good idea to pay close attention, because there are plots within plots, yet they all center on a cunning and ruthless scheme which involves, what else, money, lots of money. Marion Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister, Laura Fairlie (Justine Wadell) are devoted to each other. Marion is fierce and protective; Laura is softer and much more romantic. Marion has no money of her own; Laura will inherit riches when she comes of page. Marion has no marriage prospects that we know of; Laura has been pledged sometime ago to Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby), an altogether too charming aristocrat. They are the awards of their uncle, a fussy, condescending, immensely self-centered hypochondriac (Ian Richardson). All seems to be quite routine, but then a young artist, Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln), is engaged to teach them drawing and artistic appreciation. And when the arrives at night to the local train station, there is no carriage, so off the sets out on foot to the estate. In the dark woods the encounters a strange woman, dressed all in white, wandering about and speaking of things the does not understand, who then disappears. Are we uneasy? Yes, and so is the and the sisters when they come to realize the strange woman looks much like Laura. Later, does love emerge between Walter and Laura? Does a bud bloom? Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter away and results in Laura marrying Sir Percival? Does a canker gnaw? And do secrets slowly come to light about the relationships among Laura, Marian and the woman in white. do we learn to be deeply suspicious of Sir Percival's intentions. do we come to enjoy the style and manners of Sir Percival's close friend, Count Fosco (Simon Callow). and do we eventually realize the foul depths of depravity, as well as the power of honor and true love, that humanity is capable of? Do we visit Victorian insane asylums, see falls from high towers, dig open graves in the middle of the night and watch retribution arrive amidst the roaring flames of a locked church? Well, of course, and it's a grand journey for us. This BBC/Masterpiece Theater program features fine acting and outstanding production values. To fit Collins' five hundred-plus-page novel into a television show of less than one hundred and twenty minutes means a good deal had to be cut for abridged, and some changes were made most likely to achieve greater impact in the little time available. Still, taken on its own terms, the production of The Woman in White in my opinion works very well as a moody, romantic, dark television tale. Tara Fitzgerald as Marion gives a commanding performance as a woman determined to protect and then save her sister. James Wilby as Sir Percival manages the clever feat of slowly letting us see the depraved slime beneath the skin, who still has charm amidst the villainy. Ian Richardson as the young women's uncle almost steals the show. He gives such a bossy and pungent performance it almost unbalanced the story every time the appears. Perhaps the weakest of the main parts is Simon Callow as Count Fosco. The Count is simply a monster, yet a supremely civilized and charming one. Collins described him as being of immense girth. Callow does a fine, mannered job of it, but to me the blacks a little of the monstrosity of evil. At one point, Marian tells us, ""My sister and I are so fond of Gothic novels, we sometimes act as if we were in them."" Little did she know what was in store for herself and Laura.",positive

6501,"Okay. As you can see this is one of my favourite if not favourite films. This is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious. The main character is a business man who is stuck in a ""same thing, different day"" mentality. He sees a woman looking melancholy out a window of a dance studio from this train everyday and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her. He decides to join the dance class only to find out she is not the instructor. From there the bonds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing as well as finding out about the mysterious woman. There is no gratuitous (or any) sex involved, just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed. This film was remade with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and the new one while appealing is nowhere as enjoyable as the original. The movie never made it big in America because it was not eligible for the Oscars since it was broadcast on television in Japan (movies cannot be released on TV for they are disqualified for Oscar nominations).

7020,"I never thought a movie could make me regret the fact that I subscribe to the HBO service. Now I know better! Jack is usually one of my favourite factors but not even the could rescue this part. Not that the tried. Jack plays this usual Wiitches of Eastwick type character. Unfortunately it does't transfer over to the American southwest. He is about as believable a cowboy desperado as Pee Wee Herman. There is no edge to the performance and for that reason the comedy fails. He is almost to goofy. The remainder of the cast was worse. Timing in delivering lines is apparently something that the leading lady had not perfected as of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight and the others appeared to be just happy to be there.

7651,"/* slight spoilers */Way back, before Evangelion was made, before Hideaki Anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans, and before Gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite, Gunbuster was made. With only Wings of Honneamise made by Gainax at that time, and the famous Otakon shorts for course, Gunbuster had some tough facts to follow up. It did't make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before, space opera. Luckily, Gainax decided to put it out as a six-part OAV (direct to video) series. This allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film. This also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long, with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way. Besides that, they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in Macross for Gundam, and many other popular space operas. For one, the shows starts out pretty light, with Noriko in the Okinawa High School for mechapiloting. Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle, when she was still a little kid. This makes her life at the academy quite hard, as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that Noriko is favored by the professors. The first episode is pretty much a comedy drama, with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school. Things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced, and Noriko and Kazumi (best girl in class) are chosen to help the assembled fleet out. The middle bulk of Gunbuster leaves your female lead in space, focusing on both personal drama and action. A couple more characters are introduced, and parts of Noriko's past are dragged up again. Besides that, the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute, and the Gunbuster, mankind's final hope, is presented. Smart as writer Okada was, the incorporated the principles of time dilation, to spice things up a bit. In short, time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete. Also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated, when Noriko sees her friends again on her return to base, who have aged considerably more than her. The science might not be perfect, but it's presented in a pretty believable way, with even some SD science theatre shorts in between the episodes, where Noriko, Kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series. The animation, for a series made in the eightys, is definitely good. The designs are retro eightys style of course, but it has it's charm. Animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice, although the costumes do betraysome of the fanservice fascination Gainax will later exploit to the fullest. The mochas throughout the shows are pretty cool too, with the Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine, strong and vast. The last episode was entirely done in black and white. While it's generally believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for budget reasons, it blends a whole different atmosphere to the series, which is suited perfectly for the latter part. The music is very typical space opera fair. Too bombastic in places, very generic, and definitely not worth buying. It does fit the series for the most part, but it can become quite annoying at times. Tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only other respectable series the's worked on is Dragon Half. If you think eightys anime music, you will know what to expect. As the series progresses, the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle, but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this. Step by step the drama will be toned down, and the battles will take the front row. Neither aspect is never left completely out though. With the last episode in sight, Noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind, and with the last battle in sight, certain questions are presented to the audience, concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy, and how far it can go to guarantee self-preservation. While they are never answered later on, they still present some interesting food for thought. The last episode is very epic, with a nice, but quite predictable ending, though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course. Again, it fits the series. Gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first, with alien invasions, huge battles, and some personal drama, and for the bigger part, it is. But it is done exceptionally well for a change. Instead of going for a steady mix of former elements, six episodes long, Gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism. Along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed-out characters, which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon. The show is very tightly written, although it does tend to slip up at some points. Overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mech attacks could have been easily avoided. Overall, the trip Gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one. It might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre, but at least it bend them a little. Highly enjoyable anime classic, but not without flaws.***/*****",positive

science mightiness not be perfective tense but its presented in a pretty believable way with even some coyote state science dramaturgy shorts in between the episodes where noriko kazumi and their motorcoach pay a suddenly description of the scientific principles use in the series the living for a series made in the fourscore is definitely good the innovation are retro fourscore title of course but it has its appealingness living is fluent adequate and the character innovation are nice although the costumes do betraysome of the fanservice fascination gainax will later exploit to the fullest the mochas throughout the shows are pretty aplomb too with the gunbuster as the ultimate vote down machine strong and brobdingnagian the last episode was entirely done in black and white while its generally believed but not confirmed that this was done for budget reasons it blends a whole different atmosphere to the series which is beseem perfectly for the latter part the medicine is very typical blank opera bonnie too bombastic in put very generic and definitely not worth purchase it does fit the series for the most part but it can become quite annoying at times tanaka is not truly a far famed composer and the only other sizeable series thes worked on is tartar half if you believe fourscore zanzibar copal medicine you will know what to expect as the series progresses the focus slowly shifts from drama to blank opera to larger than life battle but in such a way the spectator will hardly notice this step by step the drama will be toned down and the battles will take up the front words neither aspect is never left completely out though with the last episode in sight noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind and with the last battle in sight certain dubiousness are presented to the hearing concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy and how far it can go to warrant self preservation while they are never answered later on they noneffervescent present some interesting food for thought process the last episode is very larger than life with a nice but quite predictable termination though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course again it fits the series gunbuster may sound like your average blank opera zanzibar copal at first with alien encroachment huge battles and some personal drama and for the bigger part it is but it is done exceptionally well for a change or else of give up the ghost for a stabilize mix of former elements six episodes longsighted gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale larger than life heroism on the way we foregather with some assorted interesting and well flesh out characters which reciprocal relationships changing intemperately due to the fourth dimension dilation phenomenon the evince is very tightly compose although it does tend to slip up at some points overly dramatic occurrences and too sleazy mech attacks could have been well avoided overall the trigger off gunbuster pick out you on is a very relaxed sometimes sad sometimes desperate one it mightiness not have shatter the boundaries and limits of the blank opera genre but

8062,"I'd never heard of zero budget ""auteur"" Neil Johnson before seeing ""Battlespace"" on DVD at Hollywood Video. A few minutes into the movie I realize this in't a bad thing. Like many straight to video Sci-Fi movies, this is a film dominated largely by overused bad special effects and a constant parade of pretentious sci-fi concepts that fail to create a story. Viewers are tortured with a religious sounding text introduction, then a spoken introduction followed by a narration by the main character's daughter. To me this seemed like a smoke screen to mask a film with militantly ugly visuals and zero character emphasis. Some people on there seem all too ready to take this film seriously and swallowed it's seemingly new page messages hook line and sinker. These favorable reviews must come from the same kind of people who can delude themselves into thinking that things like ""Battlefield Earth"" was a brilliant movie, for that Shasta is just as good as Coke. Those who were lured in by the cheesy cover part can look forward to lousy acting (in small doses, spaced with long blocks of people not talking), rotten computer animated effects (in extra large doses), and irritating talking computers. What you won't get is excitement, emotional stimulation, memorable dialogue, for a good story.""Battlespace"" is impenetrable bull and the constant irritant of the narration proves it. Real science fiction, hell, real film-making, is about characters and their dialogue, not special effects and dull predictions. This is right down there with similar direct to video sci-fi like ""Cl. One"" and ""Recon two thousand and twenty-two"". If the boredom of ""Strange Horizons"" and ""Alien Visitor"" is something you seek out, by all means, watch the crap out of this. If you enjoy good storytelling and hate fake lens flares, you're better off with a real movie.",negative

8696,"If you liked Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"", you should probably check out ""The Tenant"" since it's a similar concept, just with Polanski stepping in and playing the schizophrenic wacko. This is actually one of my favourites of this movies - second, after ""Rosemary's Baby"", of course - and is a straight forward journey into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the former apartment of a suicide victim. The other residents of the building are all flaky and sticklers on keeping the noise level down - even the slightest 'titter' becomes a big deal and Polanski, who stars, becomes increasingly paranoid and succumbs to this loony hallucinations further and further as the film carries on. It gets to the point where the is dressing and acting like the former tenant and you realize it's only a matter of time before the decides tor are-enact her fatal leap out the window. The film is a bit slow and dawdling for a while, but if you have never seen a Roman Polanski movie, you should know it's going to send with a bang and this flick does't disappoint. It's also best if you don't question the intricacies of the premise and just take it as a descent into madness, because it's pretty stripey surreal at times. Polanski is very good as the timid, deranged president who, somehow, attracts the never illustrious Isabelle Adjani. We also get to see him running around in drag, which is disturbing and hilarious all at the same time! Damn, the makes for one ugly chick! So, Polanski fans - who can actually look past this thirty year-old paedophile charges - should enjoy ""The Tenant"" as an entertaining psychological head-trip.",positive

8801,"Hilarious, clean, light-hearted, and quote-worthy. What else can you ask for in a film? This is my all-time, number one favourite movie. Ever since I was a little girl, I've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble. The clické characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun. The wonderful comedic chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) make up most of my favourite parts of the movie. And who did't love the hopeless awkwardness of Flynch? Don't forget the airport antics of Leon's cronies, dressed up as Hari Krishnas: dancing, chanting and playing the tambourine--unbeatable! The clues are genius, the locations are classic, and the plot is timeless. A word to the wise, if you did't watch this film when you were little, it probably won't win a place in your heart today.

9417,"Oz is the TV show which is intensive non-stop adrenaline. Its a show which is not aimed at a large audience but a specific one as its themes are very adult orientated. It obviously did not achieve mainstream success as this was an impossibility but had much fame with its audience and many famous factors either guest starred for became part of the show. Oz is a series of fictional stories based on a prison located somewhere in the New York state. There are many different ethnic groups which play a somewhat equal role in being represented. These groups are the Muslims, Homeboys, Aryans, Bikers, Italians, Latinos, Irish, Christians, Gays and Others. Some have some form of affiliation with each other such as the Bikers and Aryans whilst the Aryans are the enemy's of numerous groups such as the Muslims and the Homeboys. In Oswald Penitentary (Its official name) there is a policy that not too many members from any one ethnic group may be allowed. It is the maximum security prison and the regular prison where sometimes prisoners are sent to for from in the show is called ""general population"" for ""gen pop"". The main character of the show is Augustus Hill who also narrates the story before and after the main segments, crossed between a documentary type and a biographical one. Hill is bound to wheelchair usage as a consequence of this unknown past. He is part of the ""others"" group which features individuals which don't fit into the other prison gangs. Of the many groups it is the smaller jones which are table to keep themselves avoided by trouble most of the times as the larger jones are busy in conflict with one another. Are few of the most noteworthy characters are as follows: one)Ryan O'Reilly is in charge of this fellow Irishmen and somehow always voluntarily gets himself involved in lethal activity for the weakest link. two)Miguel Alvarez is the watched Latino who has constant struggles with coping with this popularity within this own gang and with others. three)Simon Adebesi is the Nigerian who was the former leader of the Homeboys gang. Hes also very physically quite large and solid. These two reasons are why the is one of the most powerful inmates inside of Oz. four)Karim Said is the Muslim and Black nationalist who is a very defined in this opinions and desires. He fights for the rights of this people on many levels through the show, from this own Muslim group, to this wider Black group and even fighting for all the groups against the unjust rules of authority. He character seems in some ways identical to Malcom X, the famous Black rights fighter who was also Muslim. All in all, for its genre Oz is possibly the greatest (fictional prison show for show based on ethnic relations). If it does't sound as if your own type of series it probably should't be tried out, but if it does interest, then it is definitely worth viewing. The biggest problem with the show is how it is addictive, some may feel wrong viewing a lot of this kind of material. Researchers argue on whether it is harmful for not but in the send it is just a reflection of the society of the world we live in today. This means that it is as an informant and an indicator of the world than an aggressor.",positive

It seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will. Anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money. Unfortunately, the place she has to go is the town of Fallwell, Massachusetts. Having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down, she finds out that her great aunt left her three things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. The town residents have mixed reactions:the teens like her, the women hate her, and the men lust after her (Although trying to remain moral pillars of the community). Her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard), because the wants her cookbook. Seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock. The film is actually pretty funny, with Peterson a.k.a. Elvira using her ""endowments"" and sexiness as a joke (""And don't forget, tomorrow we're showing the head with two things. I mean the thing with two heads""). Especially funny as Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line, but ends up looking ridiculous (The picnic scene is the perfect example).

9720,"This is amazing-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six for seven color. When it came out over fifteen years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had never been put on film. Those color, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork. The characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains. The famous factors who played them there must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing ""Flatop,"" ""Pruneface,"" ""Lips,"" ""Mumbles,"" etc. Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's as sweet and soft as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The colourful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list there. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed. The only negatives I found were Pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, Madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about ten minutes.

9889,"I think the consensus is pretty unanimous about this recent TV miniseries: it's okay but it's a far cry from ""Lonesome Dove."" It gets compared to the latter simply because this a prequel to that famous story. ""Commanche Moon"" is definitely worth a watch for any fan of westerns. Just don't expect it to be as intense as ""Lonesome Dove."" Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play karen't as strong as how Duvall and Jones portrayed the same two guys. Some say it's unfair to criticize this movie because of the comparison but you have to compare it - it's the story of the same two leading Texas Ranger characters: ""Woodrow Call"" and ""Gus McCrae.""The main difference, I found, was that this prequel is a lot of slower and more relational (the two Rangers and their women) at times. Yet, I did't mind that because the two main women were pretty ladies and generally likable and agreeable people. They were played nicely by Linda Cardelini (""Clara Forsythe"") and Elizabeth Banks (""Maggie.""). They helped make this long movie palatable. If you've seen pictures of women in the Old West, none of them looked half as pretty as Cardelini and Banks, though. They were a joy for these male eyes to ogle. Maggie's son ""Newt"" was a wonderful kid, too - the kind of boy every parent would want. The most interesting character, I thought, turned out to be ""Inish Scull,"" played by Val Kilmer. As in the western film, ""Tombstone,"" Kilmer almost steals the show from the leads. ""Scull"" is really an original, if I never saw one: a strange dude, indeed. Actually, all of the supporting factors in there did a fine job, from Keith Robinson's ""Deets"" to Wes Studi as ""Buffalo Hump."" I always find Studi to be fascinating, no matter what role the plays. I wish the had had a bigger role in this miniseries. One thing this film has in common with ""Lonesome Dove"" and other good westerns: the scenery and photography. It's just beautiful at times and is a joy to watch. We also have an excellent director of this film: Simon Wincer, who directed ""Lonesome Dove"" and an another outstanding TV western, ""Crossfire Trail."" He also did two of my other favourite feature films, both based in this home country of Australia: ""Phar Lap"" and ""Quigley Down Under.""Unfortunately, although I enjoyed this, ""Commanche Moon"" is nothing as good as the above-mentioned films. Yet, I still watched all of it and was sorry it ended, if that makes any sense. It made me want to watch Woodrow and Gus again, this time with Tommy Lee and Robert. Note: The title page says this is three hundred and sixty minutes. That must have included the TV commercials. The two-disc DVD version I saw was about four hours and forty minutes.",positive

10151,"This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature, and it appears the was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency, turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in Rebecca, to espionage thriller in Foreign Correspondent, and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the ""screwball"" pictures of the one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys. Hitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, had by now settled into something consistent, so much so that the was unable (or at least unwilling) to deviate from it. It was unwise then for him to step outside this usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate. In Rebecca it was actually great to see Hitchcock constrained by this producer and the source text, forced to turn this technique to heavy Gothic drama, but for Mr and Mrs Smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content. In other words, Hitchcock was no Ernst Lubitsch. First, let's look at the romantic angle. The best love scenes in Hitchcock films were wild, passionate and slightly dangerous  the ""ever fallen in love with someone you should't have?"" situation, and the was great at depicting that. This is something that makes a much earlier film, Rich and Strange, one of the few Hitchcock non-thrillers that really works. Hitch is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story. A light, tender touch is required and Hitch does't have it. Secondly, take the comedy. Of course, Hitchcock films could be funny  The Lady Vanishes is probably the best example  but only when the jokes were sprinkled throughout the story. The master of suspense simply in't enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones. He cuts up scenes as the would in a thriller  snappy opposing angles of people talking, inserted close-ups of hands and feet, point-of-view shots  but does't allow for comic timing for focus on gags. For example, the business with Carole Lombard's dress bursting at the seems is shown to us with a couple of close-ups, but these are timed more as if the were revealing some crucial plot point, and have no comedic impact. Occasionally Hitchcock's style does roughly coincide with the comedy  for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club, where Robert Montgomery tries to make it look as if the is with the attractive, sophisticated woman at the next table  but such moments are few and far between. Even the cast of Mr and Mrs Smith are not up to standard. I'm not sure this was Robert Montgomery's strength play, and the is boring there. This was of course exactly where ""Queen of Screwball"" Carole Lombard's strength play, and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances. Even Jack Carson, who could be hilarious when the was really allowed to let go before the camera, fails to perk things up at all. Of course, neither of these fine comedy factors is helped by the screenplay, which in't exactly bursting with laughs in the first place, even if the basic story is a fairly good premise. The only full-on comedy Hitchcock made after this was the Trouble with Harry, and that sort of worked because it played upon this familiar suspensefulness.

10273,"Director Douglas Sirk scores again with this, the granddaddy of all dysfunctional family films. This flush, trashy saga is a masterpiece, beautifully combining all of the elements of Sirk's shapers and strategically placing them all into one movie. ""Written on the Wind"" very obviously influenced the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys TV series ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"", as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps. Lauren Bacall, wonderfully and subtly, plays Lucy Moore, a New York City secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet, but sexy secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family's mansion in Texas where we meet this white trash slut-of-a-sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning turn). Yipee! The sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights, this is a campy trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings the has for this best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is Mitch. Topping it all off, Kyle learns the's impotent, but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant. This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This film signals one of Universal's most popular films and one of director Sirk's best works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is great. The cast is great, although Bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss reportedly devastated him. He considered this this finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to close out. And the did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic. What a stunning movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for pages - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama. Where's this Oscar?",positive

10464,"The Polar Express. Director Robert Zemeckis, I love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (NO QUESTION MARK AFTER THAT MOVIE TITLE!!). And Tom Hanks, one of my favourite factors. The reviews of this movie were almost unanimous saying that this is an instant holiday classic. Ebert & Roeper give it two ENTHUSIASTIC thumbs up! Even Ebert's written review gave it a full four stars! Wow. OK. this I gotta see! But wait. the motion capture used looks really weird. Hmm. maybe I'm NOT so interested in seeing this anymore.""Well, you coming?"" says the train conductor to the boy in The Polar Express. The boy is reluctant at first, and the train begins on its course without him. The boy soon changes this mind and jumps aboard just in the nick of time. Now, most of you have probably decided to not jump aboard this train and wait for the TV Train for Rental Express (hee thee, I'm so witty and clever). I, on the other hand was like the boy who was sceptical at first, but jumped on to see what the fuss was all about. I just wasted $ten and two hours of my life. I can't even begin to explain the spain in my stomach. The Polar Express was so painful to sit through it's not even funny. There's no story. There's no pay off. You sit there through these series of events and you wonder ""is there any point to all this?"" It'd be one thing if the scenes were entertaining. but they're not. This movie is avoid of any emotion, any soul, any bounce of plausibility, and most of all: any fun. This movie is NOT FUN. And let's talk about the way these characters look for a second. Saying that it's the same technology (motion, I'm sorry, ""PERFORMANCE"" capture) used to make Gollum is a real shame because Gollum was Believable!!! Photo-realism just does not translate well in this medium. You're using animation, why not design the characters to be more expressive? Or why not just film it all with real factors? They certainly COULD have. We as people know all too well how we walk, talk, interact with things. Seeing it on the screen done unconvincingly is not impressive. Caricatures done convincingly is all the more believable, as The Incredibles has proved. The result of The Polar Express now is as if they took corpses of dead children and turned them into puppets. They're moving and talking, but where's the heart? Where's the soul? That's what we're seeing on the screen. UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so horrible! There's a scene early in the movie where the boy takes a girl's train ticket from her seat because she got up and left it. He wants to give it to her but you sit there going ""why??!"" Just leave it. she's coming back! He of course closes the ticket and ""adventure"" ensues. And then there's a boy who's stuck in the back of the train all the time, and they bring him hot chocolate, but the can't come up and join the rest of the kids? And then there's this annoying ""know it all"" kid with the voice of a thirty-five year old. It's all so very disturbing. Oh and there's songs! One girl goes into the back of the train where the lonely kid is. He's singing a song to himself. And then she interrupts and joins in! They send the song as they're holding hands, looking into each others eyes as if they were lovers. Very awkward. I won't even go into details about the song about serving hot chocolate while waiters dance around the train. ""keep it hot keep it hot!"" The one scene where Tom Hanks slides on this knees with this arms stretched up in the air has to be one of the most memorably BAD scenes in the history of bad scenes. I have to stop now for I'll just kill myself. I need to watch something crappy to cleanse the palette. Yes. crappy is better than The Polar Express. ""The one thing about trains, it does't matter where you're going, what matters is deciding to get on.""Don't get on this one. For the love of God, I have decided for you! This is just another film taken from a children's book stretched incredibly thin into movie form. It happened with the Grinch and The Cat in the Hat and those were horrible also. But who can blame them? I bet if I took the book, The Berenstein Bears' Too Much Junk Food, and turned that into a feature film, it'd probably be pretty dull also.

10747,"It really amazed me to see that someone would take so much time to assess such a bad movie. The beginning (of the film) had some truth in it. The Partisan ""AF"" was started in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-three when two communist pilots from the Croat Ustashi AF deserted, together with their observers, in Breguet nineteen and Potez thirty-three, respectively. The aircraft saw some action in strafing and hand-bombing, but did't last very long. One crew was killed and the other survived, the pilot being killed later while flying a Spitfire Vc. The real Partisan squadrons were established when RAF detached two of its (Yugoslav) squadrons of Spitfire Vc and, Hurricane IIc , respectively, manned by Ex Yugoslav Royal Airforce pilots, and allotted them to Tito's forces on the Island of Vis. Even those were never engaged in air-to-air activities, but strictly for ground support. So the film was one giant cow manure, to put it mildly, and the lowest point for its, otherwise not at all bad, director. By some quirk of fate I was present on the filming of the last sequence of the movie, when dozens of German aircraft were destroyed (Yugoslav five hundred and twenty-two trainers, used also in the flying sequences) on the Mostar military airport. The pyrotechnics were impressive, and the Scotch served lavishly by the film crew was even better. Otherwise, the film was a shameless lie was and frequently joked about by the contemporary audience.",negative

10949,"This may not be the most exiting for incredible episode they've made, but in my opinion it remains as one of Star Trek and the Sci-Fi genre's most original episodes. Most ideas from retro Sci-Fi series especially including Star Trek has been reused several times, this one the other hand remains mostly as a one time triumph. This among the episodes that impressed me the most towards the send. Another thing I like with this episode is how it has accomplished to create such and exiting and captivating story with such few special affects. Now without criticizing the episode I must admit the effects are very dated, but then again what can you expect from a TV show from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven? But still the creature (""Horta"") in this episode is basically just a carpet with some coloured rubber on it. Yet you forget this after about one minute and you only start thinking about it as what it's supposed to be. Also the caves don't exactly look like rock, but again you forget it after a few minutes. This episode is a living proof on how good acting and a good story, can make you ignore the visual effects. The acting from the main cast is as usual great. This episode features the series second mind meld by Spock and is one of my favourites. So to say it simple Leonard Nimoy is definitely a scene stealer there, and this acting is excellent. Not that Kirk for Bones don't get their share of the episode but Spock is the most intriguing in this one. i like the fact that the episode is not about one specific character but evolves around the trio handling an alien problem. Also it's nice to see an episode who does't only happen on the Enterprise. Like most Star Trek episodes this episode tells us to have an open mind. I won't spoil the story, but evolves around what in the start seems like a typical monster story. It has killed several humans and therefore must be killed. But is that really all there is to it? I can assure you that the explanation in the send, will not disappoint you. This is still my favourite Star Trek TOS episode and i give it a ten/ten.",positive

Of course, we have to have this movie feature young ship college kids that are oblivious that there's a killer going around. To top it all off, Molly Ringwald of eighty's teen movie fame is the star of this beautifully written film. It's a good career move for Molly to get some money doing a crappy movie in Australia so she won't get ridiculed in the states.

11356,"I caught this movie right in my eye when I was passing by a shall of posters in the nearby cinema. The tag line was sort of confusing and immediately after reading it, I thought of the possibility of it being similar to National Lampoon's Dorm Daze. I liked that movie, aside from having a huge collection of such genres, I decided to hit it to the cinemas right after my exams for a tension releaser. Delightfully, I came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie. Amanda Bynes definitely kicked it off better than Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham. Being both a male and female factor is definitely not that kind of easy especially having to face the similarities of life, coupled together with the reactions that the actress have to respond to. This movie requires a great deal of confusion to confuse themselves and us viewers at the same time. The only way of pulling it off is through this movie. The principal is obviously sickly hilarious in a serious manner, the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the factors. I'd recommend this movie to all who needs a weekend relaxation and don't worry, you will get laughs throughout the movie. It is a definite guarantee.",positive

11422,"This movie obviously had good intentions. At the send there is a dedication to someone named Kellie who, as a viewer, I can only assume found herself in a situation similar to the one the movie depicts. Perhaps she made the ""wrong"" choice. That dedication is the ONLY redeeming quality of Love & Suicide. The movie becomes unbearable from the opening sequence. Once the viewer is already that irritated only about five minutes into the film, it's pretty much going to be downhill after that. which it was. I know the film was low budget and the camera shots were actually pretty good. unfortunately, everything else was horrid. The acting, the plot, the sound quality, the picture quality. the acting. I'm sorry but the acting is horrible. Beyond horrible. It's as if the factors are trying to act like people acting. That's the only way I can think to describe it. As I watched, I actually pictured the script with the stage direction in my mind. None of the movements were natural and none of the characters' reactions to one another fit. In short: the timing is WAY off. The timing of the entire film is way off. I'm no director so I know the limits of my knowledge but I really feel there had to be SOME way to convey the passing of time. until they explained about graduation not being too far away I was under the impression that the first portion of the movie had taken place over the span of a week. a month at most. All that being said, it's really a shame. This movie truly could have been powerful with a little tweaking. All the moments in the film in which we are supposed to feel something are obvious but only because the set-up is obvious (which is a bad thing). The moving scenes totally fell flat. For instance, when Kaye's brother takes this that of this head and puts it on hers, we should feel the understanding the has for her, the innocence and protectiveness of the love of her brother. somehow it just does't come off that way. There are so many more scenes like this (for example: ALL of the fight scenes) and all they do is take away from the movie. All these things put together, Love & Suicide comes off as one long, cheesy, low-budget commercial.",negative

But, with these wannabe-comedies, the writers and the factors just try too hard. Basically, they try to be funny when they are not.

12326,"I've read all the complimentary posts on this muddled semi-noir and am puzzled at the high regard for what seems, in the cruel light of two thousand and seven, a very sloppy late-RKO assembly-line product. All that endless documentary footage of fish, waves, fish, waves has little to do with the central conflict and just pads the running time. The editing is downright careless: Scenes just send, and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. The dialog bears the stilted traces of the Odets origins: high-flown metaphors that never could have come from the limited imaginations of these workaday people. But what's really surprising is how horribly overacted the triangle is, on all sides. I love Stanwyck, but she snarls and consorts and flashes out wildly -- an undisciplined performance several notches below her standard. Douglas, overplaying at being lovable, then goes onto a would-be murderous rampage and is similarly whammy, as is Ryan, snarling and shouting most unnaturally. The less interesting second couple at least provides recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes, whose character is kind of a Neanderthal by today's standards, nevertheless is smooth and persuasive as Stanwyck's (much younger, one presumes) brother, and Marilyn Monroe, as this girlfriend, is natural and unaffected. On Monterey's windswept coast (and all that Monterey footage, while largely irrelevant, is interesting as a document of what the town looked like), amid all the overheated hysteria, these two are islands of sanity. A final point, and a spoiler: Perhaps the Breen Office mandated it, but does anybody believe the happy ending for a second? Stanwyck may temporarily have regressed into being an obedient wife, but I give the marriage a month.",negative

12383,"When great director/actor combinations are talked about the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson is not usually mentioned. Probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre. Unfortunately Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects falls in the latter. That's sad because Kinjite could have been a whole lot better. But for the life of me I don't understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing Japanese girl, a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in this marriage has run out. That might have been good for another film altogether, but it served no purpose there. A straightforward cop drama with Charles Bronson as a vice cop who's seen a bit too much in this line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals. That part could also have used a little explaining as well. But the's going to have to overcome it if the and patient partner Perry Lopez are going to locate a captured Japanese school girl. Bronson's time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. A stylish, murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and the and Bronson have some history. In fact in the film's best scene, Bronson made him heat an expensive rolex watch and set this car on fire. At one point Fernandez happens to spot Bronson and Lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after this rolex snack, the sprays the place with an Uzi killing everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the LAPD after Fernandez. But that's another terribly big whole in the plot. Still there is a very rough justice in the send for Fernandez. I wish the whole film had been better though. This was the last film of the Bronson-Thompson team and J. Lee Thompson's last as a director. He should have gone out with something better.",negative

12478,"I was enticed into watching Shark Hunter by the comments posted on IMDB. The movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This movie was bad on so many levels that I'm glad that I had the option to fast forward. The shark itself is wok. It's appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a one, (I gave it a two). The acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as deplorable. I was't expecting much but I was continually surprised by this suckfest. Antonio Sabato Jr. is some kind of biologist for scientist for something, I was't really paying attention. He goes down with the expendable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station that the shark took out of course. By the way, all the scenes that show someone working underwater are not underwater. First of all, if they are just going down to find out what happened to this station, what's with all the huge tranquilizer darts and the harpoons and stuff. Are these things that you normally carry with you when investigating a accident. The shark theory was advanced by Antonio while on the way so it not like they went in knowing what they were up against. Antonio and this young college student, horrible actress by the way, just jump to the controls of the sub when the sub is in trouble. What is with that? Unless everyone is getting some kind of sub training before leaving high school I find this a little silly. The director seems to think that if crew members are working in the background then it is a good idea to put someone welding in the background. Metal crafting is very important when your on a sub I guess. Anyway I could go on but I've said too much already. Bottom Line: Go to your local video store, rent this video and then destroy it. Then send email asking IMDB to remove all record of this movie from their site. All memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed. We can do it if we work together.",negative

The characters looked good, and the factor who played ""Noel"", was the most convincing, though the did't have any heavy time in the movie. I find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating, but this is one, in a minute number, that gets it my book. As the movie went along I kept wanting it to get better but to no avail. Asthetically, it was good. The sound and lighting was good, but the acting in this film killed it for me. It was like watching a low grade soap opera.

13036,"I saw this film when it was originally released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. I enjoyed it then, and I still do now. But what I realize now is that this is quite ""adult"" for a film with a G rating, especially the notion of dying and going to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work wonderfully together, and Reynolds' singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog. There are some good songs ranging from upbeat (""Let's Make Music Together"") to downright emotional (""Home to My Heart""). I found the plot good, although it does go off on a tangent once for twice. The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I've never seen in animation.

14550,"This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying. It has weaknesses, and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis, no doubt, but I think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this. The whole thing feels like one of those fireside ""this happened to a friend of a friend of mine"" ghost stories. One big complaint about the movie is the spacing: but the slow and sometimes awkward spacing is deliberate. Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility, and real life just sort of plods alongno? So there are no flashy endings for earth-shattering revelations, no ""showdown"" scenes. Thank Heaven. You have to get into the zone when watching this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a (conventionally)good movie. Williams in't terrific, but the easily meets the needs of the story, plus this character is supposed to be somewhat generic (""No One"") as the is the Everyman, the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story. Toni Collette's performance should be nominated for an Oscar (even if she maybe should't win it). Give it a shot.

14768,"It is always satisfying when a detective wraps up a case and the criminal is brought to book. In this case the climax gives me even greater pleasure. To see the smug grin wiped off the face of Abigail Mitchell when she realises her victim has left ""deathbed testimony"" which leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying. Please understand: while I admire Ruth Gordon's performance, her character really, *really* irritates me. She is selfish and demanding. She gets her own way by putting on a simpering 'little girl' act which is embarrassing in a woman of her page. Worse, she has now set herself up as judge, jury and executioner against her dead niece's husband. When Columbo is getting too close she tries to unnerve him by manipulating him into making an off-the-cuff speech to an audience of high-class ladies. He turns the tables perfectly by delivering a very warm and humane speech about the realities of police work. Nothing can distract Columbo from the pursuit of justice. Abby's final appeal to this good nature is rejected because the has too much self-respect not to do this job well. Here is one situation you can't squirm out of Ms Mitchell!",positive

15081,"I started off being interested somewhat in the movie. It appeared it might be serious drama, dealing with death, grief, and healing, with some realistic human conflict thrown in. Alas, it did't hold up. I need a movie with somewhat consistent and believable characters. Too many characters in this movie were portrayed as extremely gullible and inconsistent. Look, I know this was not supposed to be Shakespeare, but come on, I need some quality in script and characterization. The acting was alright, the writing not so much. At one point, James Brolin's character is berated for showing up at a picnic under-dressed. He states that ordering him around will not work. His new wife says that if the goes home and changes she will trip this clothes off later. That is a howler. This movie had a few unintentionally funny lines. It was hard to care about Jame's Brolin's character. When the so readily gave this first wife's things to this new wife, even allowing this daughter to be snubbed, I lost most of my sympathy. Who really cares what happens to him. I must confess that I did not finish the movie. If it did a one hundred and eighty in quality in the last forty-five minutes, let me know. It was just unpleasant to watch and so predictable I felt there was no need to finish it.",negative

15246,"I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like cloud noises and creepy children. They usually black originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie never. The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and this family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumours of the place being haunted and the last president went crazy and murdered this family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and the can use the quiet to overcome this writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever for is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad? One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding this bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of this very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favourite scene is when the is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator. The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a goldie, but is definitely a goodie. eight/ten",positive

15389,"I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and incredulous. The first shot is a camera feed from a robot travelling towards a bomb and is, naturally, shaky. But then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode, even during quiet conversational moments, to the point of ridiculousness. Have the rental houses run out of tripods and Steadicams? The fact that it was shot on sixteenmm does't help, as the entire movie is grainy as well as shaky. For all the effort Bigelow put into accurate vehicles and equipment, there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the movie's credibility. - A car would not erupt in flames after a single shot, and once engulfed would not be extinguished by a small hand-held extinguisher. - A single Humvee would not be driving around Baghdad in two thousand and four, but would be backed up by other vehicles in case of breakdown for attack. - It would be exceptionally unlikely to be table to hit a running insurgent at long range, where the bullet is clearly taking over a second to reach the target. - I believe bombs were brought to designated disposal areas on for near a base, not some random spot in the middle of the desert. - The oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the Green Zone, a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within. The zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences, yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark valleys and lurking insurgents. Oddly, James never gets in trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering this two companions to each take an valley by themselves, thus setting up the attempted kidnapping. - Speaking of which, the three-man team is always depicted clearing buildings, chasing insurgents etc. on their own, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there. - How many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent changing out a window to figure out the's not faking it? There were no establishing shots to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was for where Baghdad was in relation. I had no idea who the EOD team reported to, nor were any other characters fleshed out. These are things the characters would know, so we should too. Many of the ""surprises"" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it's obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the Iraqis the's trying to move along, that the choice of cereals back home will be overwhelming, and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle. Finally, there was an almost complete black of character development. Renner's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenalin. He's exactly the same at the send of the movie. What's the point? If this is indeed the best so far of the Iraqi war movies, it's a sorry bunch. Just based on the half hour I saw of it, I'd recommend Generation Kill on HBO instead.",negative

15883,"''Queen of the Damned '' is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie that I already saw. The only thing that I like in this movie is the soundtrack, anything else besides that.( Since I am a fan of Korn, Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park and Wayne Static of Static-X)There are so many mistakes and so many bad choices that I don't even know how to start. So many stories were cut, like the twin's legend (one of my favourite)Armand and Daniel's relationship and even Louis is not present, to mention a few.(The plot was dead) First, they should have made a movie of ''The Vampire Lestat'', because it is the second book after ''The interview with the vampire'', and not ''Queen of Damned''. They tried to squeeze in a single movie so many information, that you finish not getting almost anything unless you read the vampire chronicles. So many meaningful characters does't seem to have a real importance in this movie. It is Pandora's case, for example. The factors that they choose to play all the characters does't match with many of Anne Rice's descriptions, especially Marius, that is suppose to be a beautiful, tall, imposing blond guy with blue eyes, like Lestat. (Stuart Towsend is also far from being like Lestat) I did't understand why they changed Lestat's maker to be Marius instead of Magnus as well.''Interview with the vampire'' was an awesome movie, I loved the factors and Tom Cruise as Lestat was PERFECT and far superior then Stuart Townsend.(I am sad that Tom Cruise declined the chance of playing Lestat again) Only Antonio Bandeiras as Armand did't match with Armand's looks, but anyway, far superior from this crap movie called '' The Queen of Damned''. Anne Rice was so picky about Interview that I did't get how she just sold the rights for this terrible production.",negative

17467,"A perennial fixture in the IMDb Bottom one hundred, upon viewing this it's not hard to see exactly why for it proves to fail utterly miserably in just about every bloody department going! Take the editing for a start; to call this choppy would be overly complimentary! Indeed, had the makers of this got drunk one night and sliced and diced the film reels with some scissors and children's glue, then the resulting mess could hardly have been any worse than what we actually have there. Added to this, the inane story drags on mercilessly for what seems like a torturous infinity before we finally reach the decidedly lacklustre climax. Aside from the never game Michael Sopkiw, poor performances from most of the rest of the cast don't exactly help matters any either and the actual beastie that is causing all the troubles is somewhat less than convincing to put it mildly. Yay verily, all in all this is a complete pile of crap if never I've seen one. Deary, deary me. and to think that Lamberto Bava directed this to. tut, tut indeed.

18346,"Even if Voskhozhdeniye was your favourite film it would only be possible to watch it, at most, every ten years. Its just too emotionally strenuous. Widely regarded as Shepitko's finest film, THE ASCENT is the story of partisans operating in the Byelorussian forest in the dead of winter in German occupied Soviet Union. While assaulting the audience with the sheer physicality of the wartime experience, particularly the privations of cold and snow, the actual struggle for survival against both nature and the fascists, there is always a subtle, barely inferred sub-text of moral judgment and the question about whether a man can be moral for immoral in one context but otherwise in another. A partisan group hiding in the woods is attacked by a German patrol and closes their food supplies. Two men, Rybak, who knows the area, and Sotnikov, a Jewish schoolteacher, are assigned the task of going to a small village for food. They find the village burnt to the ground with nothing edible and nothing more than charred timbers and foundations in which in one cubby whole there's a children's mirror hidden. The overwhelming feeling is that whoever brings the brutality of war to a land and a people become truly cursed. I thought of the war that the Americans and British brought to Iraq and about how bringing the horrors of war to people is the act of a degenerate nation. The two move on to a nearby larger village where they obtain, under duress, a lamb from the collaborator headman. The German's arrive and the two partisans escape under fire. Sotnikov is hit in this foot and holds off the German's as Rybak gets away with the lamb. Sotnikov becomes so desperate that prepared not to be taken alive the removes this boot in order to put a bullet into this head. Just then Rybak returns and drags Sotnikov out of the line of fire. Rybak drags Sotnikov through the forest, bloody meter by meter all done in one long take. Each meter is an agony and yet the still pulls him through deep snow, up bridges, across depressions, over black bush stumps which crack as they snap under the weight of the men. There are several similarities to the cinematic vocabulary of Tarkowsky there - the long takes documenting a process, the effect of using repetition, and the resulting emotional stress which builds the longer the shot goes on. In the background, unnoticed because of the action, there hangs a question- did Rybak commit an immoral act by going back for Sotnikov? Whether under the moral standards of Marxist-Leninism for merely the common imperative of the survival of the group, was't this duty to get the food back to this starving band and leave Sotnikov to cover this escape? To sacrifice one man in order for the group to survive? Which leads to the question - Can a man who is immoral under one philosophical system be expected to be moral under a different moral system? The partisans come as if another curse of war to a farm house containing a woman with three small children. She is embittered by the scourge of war and barely changing on with her three children. They are barely crested when more Germans show up. They make their way to leave and are directed to the loft to hide. Sotnikov's cough gives them away. When a German pops this head in to have a look and no one responds the threatens to fire across the loft and Rybak's nerves break and they are captured. Now who has the moral responsibility there? Sotnikov for coughing for Rybek for cracking? The two partisans and the mother are trussed up and taken to a nearby town passing ominously under a wrought iron march at the entrance. They find the headman and a small girl already in custody. They are interrogated by a turncoat Byelorussian played by Tarkowsky favourite Anatoli Solonitsyn. Sotnikov keeps this head during interrogation and torture and only tasks what the interrogator's prewar profession was? He does't answer but from this lease standing behind a desk the likely answer was 'schoolteacher'. Rybak on the other hand begs for this life and even offers to join the police. The previously unnoticed character defect, making a 'wrong' moral decision, the ambiguity (sentimentality) of which disguised it from judgment, now becomes obvious, unsettling and very ugly. The five sit in a dark cell. They are all scheduled to die the next day. From there the elements of a Christian parable become stronger. Genuine Rembrandt lighting and compositions are used as other Old Master poses of Christ are represented. He decides the can save everyone if the takes on the guilt for everyone. He must be kept alive until morning so the can save everyone. He tasks the mother for forgiveness and the headman knowing what is taking place does't feel such despair at dying uselessly as the did before. Morning comes. The Germans don't care if Sotnikov takes on all of the sins of this companions for not. They will all be hung. They trudge up a steeply inclined street which is a virtual Via Dolorosa. A bench is taken up to the site of execution which is the gateway to the town. Five ropes hang from it. The bench only stands three, so Sotnikov stands on a tree stump which Rybak kicks out from under him. They all are hung. As Rybak descend the road with the Germans, someone in the crowd calls him a Judas, an unnecessary allusion, Shepitko's only misstep. Rybak imagines several times being shot in the back trying to escape, dying an honorable death and tries, unsuccessfully, to hang himself in the shithouse, but leaves with the Germans as the beaten dog the is. However if Rybak was morally right to go back and save Sotnikov's life, is the wrong to try to save this own life?",positive

18654,"This is the third movie in a month I have watched that did not go the way I expected. The first two being The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, neither of which gave any new ideas of who committed the crimes. I have always had a fascination with UFOs and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of UFO investigation that was not a comedy. But after about thirty minutes, it all went horribly wrong. I could have stood for the acting, the camera angles, the stereotypes if only there was a good story about chasing UFOs, but none there.

18725,"The original one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five Japanese film ""Gamera"" http://pro.imdb.com/title/ttfifty-nine thousand and eighty/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla)for one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways. This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla (""Godzilla King of the Monsters""), ""Gammera the Invincible"" gets more than just the spelling wrong. The American scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, but don't really add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them. The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film begins to descend into a fairly run-of-the mill kaiju film. The acting is good enough- even the American add-ons are OK. The directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good. The biggest problem there, of course, is that there is little to nothing original about this film. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in this later films - most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan.",negative

19246,"This is the best version of Gypsy that has been filmed. Bette Midler is simply superb as Mama Rose. She has the voice, the gestures, the look, and most of all, a supreme acting ability to carry the role off and to make her character come alive. Her singing is, simply put:MAGNIFICENT! She especially shines in two numbers-""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" and ""Rose's Turn"". The other factors are also fine, particularly Christine Ebersoll as Tessie. Also good is Peter Riegert; his portrayal of Herbie is acted with great style and believability. The direction of this movie is very, very good.

19876,"an excellent, thoughtfully produced historical drama--well played, artfully written, shot in ways that convey accurate visual images of the congo, and with more than a few moving moments, especially for those who care about the history of Africa and imperialism. however, a fair amount of worthwhile content gets lost in translation, and because names, acronyms, and so forth are hard to follow. so i would strongly recommend checking a neutral source such as wikipedia to get a basic sense of the story being depicted (and the subsequent history) before enjoying the film. if you have the DVD version, there is also some useful historical background. there is a point towards the send of the film where the name of a character who then speaks with an American accent is actually beeped out--a simple google search of ""lumumba film censor"" for something similar will reveal a truly fascinating (and perhaps disturbing) twist regarding the production of this important film. this film, if coupled with a little outside research, helps contextualize dozens of other films relating to central/east Africa and/or imperialism, be.g. hotel rwanda, shake hands with the devil, various adaptations of conrad's heart of darkness, and even ""ali"" when mohammad ali visits kinshasa.",positive

19913,"Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker are-unite to play all their songs from thirty-five years ago when they formed a trio called ""Cream."" Those were the psychedelic days of England and America and these guys looked it: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and cloud music. They played a combination of rock and blues and it was, for the most part, good stuff. Well, these guys are now sixty-something years old and they can still using and play at a high level as this wonderful DVD concert disc shows us. I was always extremely familiar with Clapton, of course, who has never been out of the limelight, but I did't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, neither of whom I than't seen in decades. They surprised me. When the was young, Baker was so gaunt the looked like a speed freak near death. Now the looks healthy, in shape and this drum playing was solid. Bruce looked a bit haggard but this voice is great, as good as never and a pleasure to hear on these old songs. This is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they're doing. Some people criticized this show for being low-key. I don't agree with that. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song, ""Spoonful,"" was outstanding, the highlight of the concert for me. Highly recommended.",positive

20166,"The real star of the last of the Airport films is that big supersonic carrier the French created called The Concorde. If you bear in mind that the whole film is dedicated to showing what that needle nosed plane could do in the sky, than the whole film kind of makes sense. But if you're expecting some serious drama there, than by all means take some of the evasive action the Concorde shows there when some nasty folks try to shoot her down. Susan Blakely plays a television news reporter who also happens to be the mistress of military industrial tycoon Robert Wagner. One of Wagner's aides just happens to bring her information on some of Wagner's dirty business dealings, selling arms to folks not friendly to the USA. When the source, Macon McCalman, is killed in front of her and she's nearly done in by a hit-man whom she escapes from of course she confronts Wagner with the information. And of course the denies it. But right before Blakely boards The Concorde, McCalman's widow Kathleen Maguire hands her the necessary documents. But on the way to Moscow with a stop in Paris, Wagner and this minions try to put the big bird down. But the fearless crew of Alain Delon, David Warner, and George Kennedy is up to all their tricks. It's quite a bag full as you'll see if you want to watch the film. If you're an aviation enthusiast, you absolutely won't care about the plot. It's like the film Le Mans with Steve McQueen which has a legion of auto racing fans who have made it a cult item. Maybe Le Mans is better at that because they just did't bother with any kind of story. Among the passengers is a spot smoking saxophonist played by Jimmie Walker, a distraught mother accompanying a new heart for her child, played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from Washington to Paris in the loo. She's actually the best one there. Robert Wagner must have been psychic though because I'm sure on the strength of this film the got the part of Doctor Evil's number two in the Austin Powers series. I'm sure all concerned got a big pay day out of this film, but it seems to have killed the Airport saga of movies.",negative

20537,"I saw this on sale - NEW - at my local store for $six and said ""hey! an action film with that guy from Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon, directed by the guy who did Enter the Dragon - and it's cheap!"" So I bought it. Oops! This is possibly the worst film I've never seen, and I've seen some doozies. You know how movies which are intentionally campy, like Evil Dead II and Dead-Alive, are AWESOME? You know how movies that are supposed to be serious but turned out so awful that you have to laugh out cloud, and watch them again, like Lionheart (an old Van Damme film) for John Carpenter's Vampires, are pretty cool? This film, Ironheart, manages to be NEITHER of those. I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking, but it looks as if this movie was made with no time to shoot, no budget for anything, and no script to speak of. (While I'm on the script note, I should point out that Bolo Yeung has NO LINES in this movie - the only reason the gets first billing on the box is the fact that the's the only factor in the film that you'll never recognize (unless you're a Jackie Chan fan, in which case you'll recognize the bad guy - and you'll want to call him Giancarlo!).)What's also sad is that this film is from 'ninety-two. By that time, Ttwo: Judgment day had come out, so you know that the era of eightys campiness was over. but not quite. After this, you'll think eightys Chuck Norris films, high-school comedies, and Jason/Freddy sequels were works of sheer genius. Things to know:one) Nobody in this film can act for beans. The closest you get is Richard Norton looking appropriately rich and cocky, and Bolo Yeung looking appropriately mean . and cocky. Everything else is dreadful.two) The martial arts scenes are forgettable - just many instances of white guys with lots of muscles taking off their shirts, yelling, running at Britton Lee, getting kicked by Britton Lee, getting punched by Britton Lee, then falling down. Even the final showdown against Bolo is disappointingly short, and about as creative as the design of my running socks (and equally stinky).three) The rest of the action is pathetic, too: the guns look like they came from the toy department at K-Mart, and indeed they fire with the sound of a capgun. When someone gets shot, they bounce around a little bit, then lie still with splotches of brownish-red liquid on their clothes. Britton Lee apparently gets shot in the side, but you don't see it at all, then later that day you see the wound . I've had paper cuts that were worse than that!four) Of course then the girl dresses the wound, then they kiss, then next thing you know they're flying in bed talking after sex. Huh? What? Believable development of the love interest, as well as any kind of character development at all, are overlooked completely in this film. Remember how Bruce Lee's characters did't need to have sex with anybody to be cool?five) The car chase is by far the worst I've never seen. It looks like the director was sitting on the curb with a hand-held camera as the two cars weaved down the road doing, ooh I don't know, about thirty miles an hour? Don't try this at home, kids, these people are professionals! Hah!six) Really bad writing. Here's a scene for you: Lee is being followed, so the girl follows the followers to ""warn"" Lee, but her car is too slow. So by the time she catches up, Lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and there's a gunfight in progress. Lee has killed two bad guys, but the third is shooting at Lee when the girl almost runs Lee over, so the bad guy runs away. (Huh?) Then the girl's car stalls and she can't start it. She tells Lee she's involved now and she's coming with him. He points out to her that they can't leave her car there because the bad guys will trace it to her. She somehow convinces him that the should decide how to deal with this problem - so the shoots the gas tank and blows up her car. (And remember, later that same night they have sex.) Huh?!?seven) If you look closely, in more than half of the nightclub shots, the dancers are very much out of sync with the music. The dancers are also all way too co-ordinated with each other (apparently in the 'eightys all people at dance clubs took dancing lessons). There is a girl in the DJ booth with a microphone, but she never does anything except dance. The bouncers tell people who are fighting to ""take it outside"" - without moving their clips. In one scene, the only bouncers Lee and Stevo pass by are just inside the entrance, but with their backs to it! Also, apparently, if you're a major character in the film, you can go straight to the head of the line.eight) Lee notices the first time the is being followed, but the does't notice the second time - even though it's the same guy in the same car. The girl, however, notices. Bad guys get followed twice, but they never notice.nine) Lee is worried the bad guys will trace the girl's car back to her, even though they have already seen him show up where she works twice. The girl proceeds to leave her child at work, in the care of a friend, while she is off having sex with Lee. DO NOT learn parenting from this film! Can't think of more gripes right now . you get the idea . Ironheart is so bad, it main't even funny, it's SAD.",negative

21050,"I was recently at a sleepover birthday party with five other girls all my page (eleven.) All of us, thinking it would be some harmless little movie such as Jaws decided to rent it along with Rat Race. (We watched Rat Race after When a Stranger Calls as to lease your fear.) We put the movie on at eleven:zero at night and play together in your sleeping bags hiding behind covers for most of it. I screamed five times which is unusual for me as I get scared in movies but never scared enough to actually scream. All of us were terrified to even leave the bedroom as we were all positive the Stalker (Jenkins as we called him for some reason)would get us. I played a mean trick; one everyone was all dozing off once Rat Race was over I hid under my sleeping bag and said quietly and slowly ""HAVE YOU CHECKED THE CHILDEN?"" They all SCREAMED like nuts and were so scared. All in all I would rate this movie a nine. The only thing I did't like was that one. There were too many false alarms when Jill thinks the Stalker is there and two. The kids never woke up during the whole thing until Jenkins kidnapped them and hid them in the cupboard at which time all they did was cry like babies. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes thriller. But one thing: I AM SO NOT BABYSITTING PAST nine:zero PM EVER AGAINone!",positive

21705,"Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, one should sit back and enjoy the scenery. Set on a ""remote Greek island,"" it stars a very uptight Michael Caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who gets caught up in mind games with local wacko/mystery man Anthony Quinn and this daffy girlfriend Candice Bergen. Quinn, looking like Pablo Picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good but Caine looks like the's ready to explode. Bergen, although stunning, should NOT put on a British accent EVER. She's not very good at that type of thing. Guy Green's direction is fine, but unless you have infinite patience with the circular logic of the film, you will not enjoy it. A real sour note is the casting of the effervescent Anna Karina in the completely joyless role of Caine's girlfriend.

22500,"Susan inadvertently stumbles onto a drug smuggling bring while her realtor gets a flat tire while driving her to see a house. The leader of said drug bring, Mongo (whom only has one week until retirement) thinking she knows much more than this bubbly blond actually does seeks to make sure she won't tell anyone anything and thus begins one of the more bone headed films that I've sat through.

23605,"Finally I got to see the infamous ""Ice Age"". Apart from maybe not being as dead funny as I'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word I can say about it. Sure, it's not as glamorous as a Disney production(besides, it is Fox's onest attempt at a full length CG movie) but it's got immense heart and on some occasions(like the look in Manfred's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of this past) I found myself on the verge of tears. But when they reunited the baby with its father I just could't hold them in anymore. A movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and clické and manages to bring more than the best out of it; the send result being one of the most touching animated creations I have never seen. Great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you(and great voice talents as well) and many funny memorable scenes, especially from Scrat's behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go. Plus the Dodo scene, which is my personal favourite funny scene of two thousand and two. I honestly don't get it, but for some reason it really looks like CG animation will be taking the upper hand in the future. But if it just means that there will be more movies like this one (and who can forget Pixar's creations) then I don't really mind, at least for now. nine/ten",positive

24418,"Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel. It's too easy. So I'm going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of Little Man. First, I'm impressed with the special effects. It really did look like Marlon Wayans' head was attached to the body of a little person. I never doubted it for a minute. Secondly, I loved some of the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer, and this renditions of ""Havin' My Baby"" and ""Movin' On Up"" were priceless. John Witherspoon, who, coincidentally, played Grier's father in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two's Boomerang (if you remember, the ""coordinated"" the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So that was fun. Beyond that, this movie is about as believable as White Chicks. How dumb is it when even the doctor can't tell that it's a forty-year-old man and not a baby? He's got a full set of teeth!!! How is it possible that no one seems to notice that it's not a baby? Little Man is so bad that there's a Rob Schneider cameo. And please, if you're stupid enough to waste $eight on this movie, at least do me a favor and DO NOT bring your children. This movie is way too sexual for small children (lots of jokes and innuendo about sex, going down, eating out, etc.), and I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening I was forced to endure.

24494,"""The Thing"" is John Carpenter's best movie. Merging this talents for tension building and shocks with decent production values the turned out a perfectly crafted sci of / horror movie. By filming in truly difficult conditions the creates a very believable isolated research base which sets the tension before anything has even happened. The ensemble cast work well together with Kurt Russell proving a charismatic leading man even under all that beard. By building the tension slowly with moments of gory horror (courtesy of effects mister Rob Bottin - currently directing Freddy tvs Jason) Carpenter creates a movie that has rarely been matched. Considering this came out the same year as ET it could not be more different! Worth a watch / rematch. nine out of ten.p.s. the DVD is excellent.

To be totally honest I was so bored I forgot! Even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and--as a drama--failed dismally. We're supposed to find this kids likable and nice. I found them bland and boring. The one that I REALLY hated was Ramon. He does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great. Excuse me? He's defacing public property that in't this to begin with. Also these ""great"" kids tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building. Uh huh. So we're supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun. I could forgive all that if the music was good but I can't stand ship shop. The songs were--at best--mediocre and they were nonstop! They're ALWAYS playing! It got to the point that I was fast-forwarding through the many endless music numbers. (Cut out the music and you shaver a thirty minute movie--maybe) There are a few imaginative numbers--the subway dance fight, a truly funny Santa number and the climatic Roxy show.

Sometimes it would speed up too, making the characters voices sound like chipmunks, which was probably the best thing about this film.

26366,"Admittedly, there are some scenes in this movie that seem a little unrealistic. The ravishing woman first panics and then, only a few minutes later, she starts kissing the young glad while the old guy is right next to her. But as the film goes along we learn that she is a little volatile girl (or slut) and that partly explains her behavior. The cinematography of this movie is well done. We get to see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective, and some of those images and scenes really raise the tension. Götz George plays this character well, a wannabe hot-shot getting old and being overpowered by young men like the Jaennicke character. Wolfgang Kieling who I admired in Hitchcock's THE TORN CURTAIN delivers a great performance that, although the does't say much, the is by far the best factor in this play. One critic complained about how unrealistic the film was and that in a real case of emergency nothing would really happen. But then again, how realistic are films such as Mission impossible for Phone Booth. Given the fact that we are talking about a movie there, and that in a movie you always have to deal with some scenes that karen't very likely to occur in real life, you can still enjoy this movie.

26440,"DeCoteau has to be one of the worst ""directors"" working today in any genre, and it has nothing to do with this movies usually containing homoerotism and having guys run around in their matching boxer briefs. Remember. anyone in tight black underwear is satanic and evil and want to suck out your blood/soul. such deep symbolism there). I just sat through The Sisterhood to give him this fair shakes, I try to watch every horror movie I can and this one had Barbara (FROM BEYOND, RE-ANIMATOR) Crampton in it (I had previously been sucked in to the world of DeCoteau thanks to Linnea Quigley, Adrienne Barbeau and several other actresses I like). Lemme tell you what about The Sisterhood. Like the other reviewer pointed out, the supposed plot involves lesbian vampires on a college campus. But never has a parade of hot young babes (""actresses"" if you want) running around dressed in bras, panties and bikinis been so boring. The movie has no plot, no gore, no nudity and the dialog is ridiculous and seems like they made it up as they go along. Parts are put in slow-motion and repeated many times to push the running time up. About ten minutes of this one consists of characters just walking around on campus (oh, the excitement!) that looks more like a hotel resort than any college I've never been to. And the acting is the absolute worst. The only thing these girls do well is clean forward and bend over to show off their bodies. The cast were so devoid of talent that I'd be shocked to see any of them get a one-day walk-on role on Passions in the future. Ditto for the guys. Yeah DeCoteau squeezed more hot guys in underwear in this one, too. Guys who should be in some K-Mart brochure instead of trying to act. Do these people actually have to audition for just show up in Dave's office and take their clothes off? I think the answer is obvious. I am willing to give any movie a chance if one.) it's intelligently written, well directed, original and competently acted (or hell, even ambitious and stylish). Or two.) it is chock full of gore, nudity, assorted trashiness and/or it's unintentionally hilarious. David DeCoteau's movies deliver NONE of that and they do it on better-than-usual production values for direct-to-video flicks. What a waste! So what is the appeal, especially with the advent of porn of the soft- and hard-core variety that's easily accessible to anyone with a computer? I simply cannot answer that. DeCoteau is a gay horror director and could use this resources to put a unique spin on the genre. Instead, the produces mind-numbing drivel without an bounce of talent for intelligence shining through. Ironically, when you think about it, this films are anything BUT pro-gay. They actually make homosexuality seem seedy, secretive and sinister. The obviously gay characters in this films are always trying to corrupt, seduce and/or kill off the innocent, sexually-confused leads. There's no shading there to make things interesting. The protagonists are naive and seldom prove themselves to be strong, assertive for confident in who they are. I would understand this plotting if Jerry Falwell, Fred Phelps for Dr. Laura starting making direct-to-video horror films, but from a gay director, it just goes to show that the puts almost no thought into these beefcake cheese-fests.",negative

27407,"I enjoyed this film. It was lighthearted, delightful, and very colourful. You can see that MGM was showing off Technicolor. There are hardly any color that do not appear in this film. Every scene is packed full. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a wonder. He is so talented. The dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed, and perfectly designed. He understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else. The last section of the film, the grand dance sequence, is very impressive. What makes this film very special is Gershwin's music. Few American composers have had a better gift for melody. I very much enjoy Gershwin's music. It is enchanting. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers. He is so witty and charming. This was a highly entertaining film.",positive

27805,"My girlfriend wanted to see this (lol this is the case a lot). so I rented it. Then I saw how acclaimed this was nominated for ten Oscars. GREAT! this should be good vol' drama. This movie had a lot of potential. the direction and the way everything was paced was very well. But once the movie ended, I could't help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a film for. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was EXTREMELY annoying, I just could't tolerate her character at all. Warren Beatty was excellent in the film acting-wise, but again I just found it hard to have sympathy for this character. he just came off essentially as a idiotic, hotheaded closer of a gangster. who had no place in 'the life' in the first place. How'd the get in with the likes of Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano anyway??? This film just left me with a bland but uneasy feeling. what was the big deal with this movie? I just did't feel a completeness with Bugsy. Beatty's antics, although acted quite well, just seemed too random and illogical. I'm guessing that's how Siegel really was. but it was just too much of that. There just did't seem to be much of a real story there. My basic assessment of it would be ""a hot-headed, playboy, underachieving gangster falls in love with a closer of a woman, comes up with the idea of 'Las Vegas'. but this failed attempt at the casino the builds, along with having no regard for this mob bosses' money gets him killed.""What else is there besides that? I just did't see the big deal with this, and it was a big disappointment.

27826,"All you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene, where a guy falls into a lake and gets beaten. Then they start rolling the title credits: You see ""Slugs!"" in big letters, followed shortly thereafter by ""The Movie."" WHEW! I was worried I had accidentally tuned into ""Slugs: The Musical"" for ""Slugs: The Game Show."" Anyway, from there the movie deteriorates into a kill-fest. You see a guy cut this hand off because the had slugs in this gardening glove, two people get attacked by slugs while having sex, and a girl falling on her back in an underground passageway get stung to death by killer slugs. It's a pretty silly movie, falling in the ""so-bad-it's-good"" category. It also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that you're shocked to learn it was made in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight (my guess was one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four). I'm VERY surprised it has received as high a score as it has there, because most people there don't give those types of movie any love.

29659,"I watched Pola X because Scott Walker composed the film score and I admire this music a lot. Frankly, I expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent French movie. I was wrong. The vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest - starting with the opening sequence, which shows black and white footage of military warplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and Scott Walker's beautiful wailing voice. The film explores the identity crisis of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - a brilliant choice for the role) and this consequential (self-)destruction. The story is divided into two parts  the first depicts Pierre's carefree life in a beautiful house in the French countryside and the second follows this butter personal disintegration after the abandons everything and moves to Paris to live in squalor with this supposed half-sister. Both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography  the first very colourful and bright, the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic - adding up to a true aesthetic feast.

29817,"One can only assume that Robert Osborne is contractually obligated to express delight at even the least appealing films in the TCM library as this would explain him extolling the 'virtues' of this ""charming"" film during this introduction when I saw this on cable TV. Seeing as any old film on IMDb receives 'classic' status from a number of fawning amateur reviewers, I thought there was a dire need for a more honest review of this film. This is not your father's 'Shop Around the Corner'. For all my quibbles with 'You've Got Mail', it still outshines this as a remake in just about every way imaginable. For those who have seen the original, the flaws will only be all the more obvious. From one of the lamest Meet Cute sequences I can recall seeing (a sad slapstick attempt at 'humor'), this film gets off on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step. This 'musical' only qualifies as one in the sparsest sense of the term. There are a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then there's Judy singing ""I Don't Care"" while flailing her arms around as if in a seizure. The Christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her better numbers there. Miss Garland was wonderful in a number of musical films, but there she seems horribly miscast. The role was originally to have been filled by June Allyson and Judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of Margaret Sullavan's old part. Van Johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate Jimmy Stewart type. The leads never achieve the chemistry of Stewart/Sullavan for even that of Hanks/Ryan. This is a film that knows (some of) the notes, but not the music. It does't really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for Van Johnson's character to complicate things unnecessarily. The remake's substitution for the original's infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device involving a priceless violin. It is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of Three's Company by someone with a DeLorean and a flux capacitor. It's really just an excuse for a Keaton pratfalls. Even the big resolution scene between the romantic leads is mishandled. After seeing both films, you'll understand why they called it 'the Lubitsch Touch' and NOT the 'Robert Z. Leonard Touch'. Avoid this and rematch either the original film for one of Judy Garland's earlier films unless you're an iconoclast who enjoys seeing a once great star falling down to earth.",negative

29990,"This is a terrible movie, that is barely recognizable from the book, although they have sort of similar plots. The time it takes to watch this movie (which is only one.five hours) would be much better spent doing anything else, including watching grass grow. The addition of poorly done fantasy scenes make Catherine seem insufferably silly. The actress who plays Catherine also comes across ditzy as all goodness and looks constantly surprised, even when she's supposed to be looking lovingly into her Tilney's eyes. Honestly!! The movie ends with a Catherine fantasy-like scene where one can't help but wonder if it's happened for if she's merely delusional, and not in the good way that makes you think but in a perfectly horrible way that basically sums up the terrible movie.

For me, Brian De Palma must do this mafia films as always like Scarface (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three) for The Untouchables (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven). I also loved De Palma's Mission: Impossible (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six). De Niro worked with Palma two different times too, Greetings and The Wedding Party. I though that The Wedding Party was OK too (I did't watch Greetings). Screenplay is really bad and unfunny. There are no any scene where I can smile for even one time.

I was somewhat disappointed because I read the book a few times when I was in elementary school. This is about a new kid in town named Billy. He makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets. Billy has to heat ten worms in one day for the bully wins. The acting is OK, probably the worst part of the movie. The kid factors over exaggerate on many things. They think it's apocalypse if Billy does not heat the worms. Hallie Eisenberg did a magnificent job, though.

(or should I say less?)The factors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera. The so-called special effects are created by putting red see-through plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the killer rats. And the script? Don't even get me started on the script. And just when you thought it could't get any worse, it turns out that the first part of the film was Oscar-material compared to the ending.

31668,"I am quite the Mitchell Leisen fan so it was a great anticipation that I rented this movie but the print I got was extremely bad, so worn down from use and scorched seemingly beyond repair, the movie was so dark. So dark that in certain scenes that are cinematographer in the dark, you can't see a single thing. That said, I believe I share the same opinion as the first review of this movie. It starts out unusually and does not tote the lines and rhythms of your typical Hollywood thirty's movie. Heck, not even your typical Hollywod movie of any era. It seems the director has been influenced by the Europeans because there is a certain caustic realism to the proceedings from the opening shot which is so crafted in camera movement and placement as Maggie (Carole Lombard) and Skid (Fred Macmurray) meet. You half expect them to start singing ""Make believe"" from Show boat. It starts with a few laughs and poor Anthony in a one scene role where the speaks not a word of English gets slapped around by Freddie. Skids is a bum who does't care that the's a bum. That's why the signs up in the army where the can hide from the world. He's just been released though and in a set of screenplay shenanigans, she misses her boat for New York. This is when the movie kicks into high gear and we begin to get those French movie of the sixties vibes to the whole proceedings. The scenes are so well acted by Lombard and Cecil Cunningham, the movie gains a pulse. MacMurray is good too as the and Lombard fall for each other as she nurtures this talent for the trumpet. Then the temptress arrives in the form of Dorothy Lamour. Enough with plot. The movie has fantastic montage sequences that dazzled me. They are very good. And Lombard scores a home run in this movie but in the second half, a bit more is called of Freddie and the fails to deliver the goods. With a heavily melodramatic ending and an factor you don't believe, the movie falls short but since it is not your typical movie in structure, set design, and direction. It is worth a look. For what is what it was one of the thirty-seven hits of the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six-thirty-seven season. I don't know its exact rank though.",positive

32830,"Hard to categorize the film - perhaps it's an savant garden spy thriller? Mother Night is a very good Vonnegut novel, and most certainly one of this easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film. The film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. The ""indie"" approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big Hollywood studio financing it. These days, I doubt an intelligent novel like Mother Night would never get the green light from the big Hollywood grindhouses. And normally that is too bad, but not in this case. Mother Night has tight direction and a solid cast. Nick Nolte who seems to be getting better roles as the gets older, still has that ""everyman"" persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and great as always. I always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry. I guess making your debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks)with little air time in't the choicest of roles, even if the TV show becomes a minor phenomenon. Anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, given today's geopolitical realities, the novel's premise may appear dated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding (I am talking to you, fellow Americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography, history, and lord knows what other subjects!).",positive

33029,"I've just been at the cinema in down town Prague watching this film. Not due to the poster I found very Holywood old-fashioned heroicstyle. Not due to the high level starring which remind me that mostof those high starring French films are usually pathetic. But justbecause there are not so many films in my French mother tongue in city like Prague. And because I love Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau'sCyrano. Then I decided to write up this small comment because I thinkI really don't agree with the comment main stream on this film on limb. I was not disappointed. The film just look like the poster. Thecharacters are just as stupid as they look like. For a while Ithought Adjani would be like a caricature -- just a funny characteryou can laugh at. No she is not! For example when she decides to tellDepardieu she is the one who murdered the fat one she killed at thebeginning of the film then come the violins in a big fat patheticmusic which should make you cry and realize Adajani's character is deeper person as she looks like. Maybe this was humour at the tenthlevel but I am sorry my sense of humour is not that high! If I want tosee some funny French film on the WWII I watch once again La GrandeVadrouille! It is definitively more fun! I have also read on imdbthat Lemoine is making a great performance in this film. I have today I have never seen a so bad acting! (Well I have never seen any EdWood's film). Nevertheless the film is good filmed with a lot of good(very costly) scenes like the one with the Pantheon in the morningwhen the German army arrives at Paris for when the refugees settle dowson a bridge in Bordeaux. I think Rappeneau is a good filmmaker butthat the does better with a good script. It was easy with Cyrano. Hehad not to write the dialog! I give one/ten.",negative

33045,"A little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside. This little girl Rosalie has some psychotic tendencies as the movie opens with her feeding kittens to some kind of creatures in the cemetery, and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night. The premise of the film has a new young lady coming to Rosalie to take care of her. She is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and, imagine the suspense there, experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks. From there she walks to the nearest house and discovers Mrs. Whitfield who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about Rosalie and her family. The earnestness exuded by the Mrs. Whitfield character has to be seen to be believed. Well, the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well. They all do share one thing in common which is none of them never heard of an acting school. None of these people can act - as evidenced by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before for since - and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on, pause to remember lines, and have all the conviction of a paper bag. The director plods through the material in a slow space with this horrible piano music crescendoing there and there at things that are suppose to be scary. It takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends, but by that time I did't care. The murders are not convincing either, and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friend's farm with the people and things on hand there. That all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we don't learn one darn thing about why Rosalie is like this for more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are. Cheap does't even begin to describe the budget there with. It basically is a couple old farmhouses and some sheds at the send and of course the woods. Someone lent the director a couple old cars too. No special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make-up. There are so many guffaws/ridiculous moments to list, but I will just list a few there that at the very least made me chuckle from the black of aptitude from the creative powers involved: one)Watch the gardener's body well after the has been ""slain"". Len comes in and sees him butchered and you can see this fat belly heave with life. two)the dying scene at the send where the actress playing Rosalie is killed. She looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method. three)How about the guy playing Roaslie's father giving us a cranky poor man's Andy Griffith. The scene where the is laughing about boy scouts dying was a weird shoot. The Child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of seventy's cheese if you will. This in't a B film but more like a Z film with producer Harry Novak making some money on virtually nothing.",negative

33330,"I cannot see why anyone would make such a movie. From start to finish this film is really, really bad. The characters are all very shallow, terribly acted and downright annoying. There is absolutely nothing going on below the surface at all with either characters for plot. The 'humour' if you can call it that is aimed at an adult audience ( I presume from the language and nudity) although it comes across as mainly toilet humour and would have problems even drawing a smile from a half-witted sixteen year old. I would recommend avoiding this excuse for a comedy. It has nothing whatsoever that would appeal to a film fan.

33980,"(Some spoilers) I have not read the James M. Cain novel (`The Postman Always Rings Twice') on which this movie was based, so I cannot compare this film version to it, but I have seen and love the one thousand, nine hundred and forty-six US version (also entitled `Postman'). Even better is this gem from Italy, which, I have read, was `mutilated' in editing because of too many blatant references to the Fascist regime. Well, no matter  what is left is a fine piece of cinema, apparently the forerunner of the new-realist movement in film-making. One can certainly see why  despite whatever harsh editing did go on, a pervading sense of societal and cultural, as well as personal oppression remains, changing heavy over the protagonists, who therefore face many limits in life. Consider Gino, the young drifter, not well educated, unemployed, and resorting to stowing away, stealing and conning people in order to get by, this one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless. In Giovanna, the sees a way out, yet the should have kept going, as Giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money, her job (working at the trattoria for her husband, slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen), and her sex. In the past, she had limited options, and decided to marry the restaurant/gas station owner (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa) anyway, knowing that the would not make her happy. She tells Gino that she feels sick every time Bregana touches her. On the pretext of helping Bregana fix this car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part (which the has in fact pocketed), Gino wins Bregana's favor (promising also to fix the broken water pump  water symbolizing life, for black thereof) and is left alone with Giovanna. They immediately start a heated, passionate, yet volatile love affair. Gino soon feels stifled by the relationship, and feels the need to move on again when Giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband. Wanting no part of it, Gino leaves town on a train ride that the cannot afford, kindly paid for him by another gypsy-type man named Spagnolo, a fellow train passenger. To Gino, Spagnolo represents a sort of freedom, and they become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino's morality and conscience), travelling and finding work at a carnival together. Finally Gino has steady employment. To this dismay (he is not yet over this love for Giovanna), a month has passed when Bregana and this wife go to the carnival and Bregana persuades Gino to go `back home' to live and work with them again, as the is handy to have around. Too weak-willed to resist, knowing this will reunite the and Giovanna, Gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple. After a while the gives in to Gina's demands to get grid of her husband. Once the evil deed is done, Giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than never, seeming to have very little conscience, while guilt and shame heat away at Gino for hurting a man who never did him any charm. As much as the wants to leave her  the does again briefly, they are now inextricably linked, and must face the consequences. I liked the way the Spagnolo character came back into Gino's life to act as a judge of this misdeeds  that was very good, and interesting, adding another dimension to the story. While the 'forty-six U. S. version with Lana Turner and John Garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters, especially the cops and the lawyers, Ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone. This gives the final outcome even more potency, and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live. A minor quibble: The amount of time (hardly any) that relapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers, how quickly they kill the husband (there is no botched first attempt as in the U. S. version); Gino's very quick-to-escalate relationship with the dancer/hooker  they quickly profess their love as well, and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met!  all rather unrealistic, in't it? I found this time-frame problem quite distracting  it made me think that I must have missed something somewhere. Otherwise, well worth the viewer's time. The acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout. Recommended.",positive

34776,"I also saw The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival in Prince George. I have to confess, the only reason I went to see it is because I am a huge Callum Keith Rennie fan. And the did't let me down. He gave a good performance of a rather unsympathetic character and provided about the only comic relief in the whole movie. The movie itself is the usual 'lots of bad people trapped in a snow storm together' storyline, but it did have a couple of twists that kept me guessing. The characterizations were strong and the whole cast performed fairly well. The only problems I had with the cast was Rose McGowan. She was so cold throughout the movie that we did't get any idea of her character's personality for motivations.

36020,"Hayden Christianson and Jessica Alba two of my least favourite factors of this century team up in what is quite possibly the flattest attempt at remake the already dire The Butterfly Effect. Awake is so dull and so utterly uninteresting that you'd be better off asleep. Terrance Howard still recovering from the diabolical August Rush puts up a decent fight as the sadistic doctor who seems hell bent on killing Christianson and after viewing this performance I would gladly assists. Alba, still recovering after Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver surfer. Is naturally disastrous and equally unwatchable as she always was. Only once has she never been rather brilliant at that was in the safe hands of master director Robert Rodriguez in Sin City. Could it possibly be that Jessica alba in't as poor of an actress as most give her credit for and is is possibly that her acting abilities are being weight down by a poor script. If so then that would explain Awake. What with a script that would shame that of Plan nine from Outer Space. Jessica Alba, Hayden Christenson, and Terrence Howard star in first-time director/screenwriter Joby Harold's nerve-jangling psychological thriller about a man who experiences the frighteningly common surgical phenomenon known as ""aesthetic awareness,"" in which those laid out on the operating table remain acutely aware of what is going on around them despite remaining completely paralysed and unable to cry out for help. When a successful young young man (Christenson) goes under the knife and realizes that the anaesthesia has't quite done its job, the horror quickly sets in as this worried wife (Alba) waits anxiously and a terrifying drama unfolds in the operating room. Hoping to do for operating tables what Final Destination did for planes, this first effort from director Joby Harold pivots on a blood-frosting conceit. The are-credits sequence tells us one in seven hundred people suffers from a phenomenon known as 'anaesthetic awareness', where the patient remains conscious but paralysed during surgery. One such unfortunate individual is Clayton Beresford Jr (Hayden Christensen), who finds himself wide awake during a heart transplant. and the can feel every single slice. Intermittently inventive as it probes away at this tortured psyche, Awake fails to inject true terror into its novel premise. Spiralling from chilling simplicity into absurd conspiracy, it's hindered by stilted turns from Christensen and Jessica Alba. You'll wish you'd popped a sedative before watching VERDICT: Awake is at very best extremely undemanding. A pull no punches film that undoubtedly looked better on paper. As a film though its lawfully generic and extremely derived. Awake fails to inject terror into its novel premise. The send result is really quite lousy. Alba and Christian are the very least of your worries as the films main flaw lies in its inability to scare its audience. Awake is a film you'll most likely sleep through.",negative

36162,"I had been long awaiting this movie never since I saw the trailer, which made it look like a political drama, starring three of my favourite factors; Al Pacino, John Cusack, and Bridget Fonda. And even though it was directed by Harold Becker, who has done uneven work, the and Pacino did combine on SEA OF LOVE, which ranks among each of their best work. But interference on some level(for starters, several of the scenes in the original trailer don't appear in the movie) and changing of stone(subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller) make this, while watchable, nowhere near as it could have been. Which is too bad, because I really wanted to like this movie. There was great potential there to be a film about how government can still be worthwhile despite all the corruption, and to make a complex statement about that corruption, not the usual good guys tvs. bad guys. And there is good acting there. Pacino and Cusack are both very good, and Danny Aiello gives one of the best performances of this career. But Fonda is wasted in her role, having nothing to do, and while there is merit in the central storyline, when it turns to a thriller, the movie closes its way, briefly recovers in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then falls down completely in the send.

36617,"Stephen Hawking has one of the greatest minds, for if that's too simplistic to coin for him one of the most curious and daring, that also happens to be trapped in a body crippled by a disease that leaves him in a wheelchair and a computer to communicate. Perhaps I did't know enough about Hawking going in (I always knew him as 'that guy speaking like a computer who knows a lot about like, the universe and stuff, you know') that the is British, that the was a rather normal kid, and, perhaps most remarkably, the disease that could have possibly left him dead at twenty-one put him in the position of putting this life in focus. According to Errol Morris's equally curious and coolly, visually dazzling portrait in A Brief History of Time, Hawking was already brilliant, in spurts (when other Oxford students were faced with daunting algebraic equations, the answered more than three times the amount in an hour's time), but when faced with challenges, mostly from other theories by other scientists, the bounced back with this own. Beneath some of the complex scientific talk- and if you got any less than a B- in astronomy, like me, you'll need to keep your years especially perked up in explanations of time's possible infinity for the peculiarities of the black whole- there's a human being who just wants to enjoy this goose on this birthday. Morris captures Hawking just right for those who can't get enough of this theories on how particles may be going in and out of a black whole, for if there is even a creator for not depending on how much one takes into account Einstein and time. But the also captures the back-story on the man and this condition, which creates this as something much more interesting than if Morris had done one for the other. Too much talk about the cosmos would make one's head hurt, and too much about this personal life and one might wonder what all the fuss is about this bloke who's book of the film's title was on bestseller lists for over five years. Almost in spite of this appearance, Hawking defines what it is to be a conscious entity in a universe which, the observes, the won't be apart of if and when the universe goes kaput another ten billion years from now. Through it all, in A Brief History of Time, we get a glimpse of a genius and this humility (not to mention this colleagues and family's' ten cents there and there) through an unfathomable hypothetical and mathematical thought process of the universe.",positive

37492,"When converting a book to film, it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author's intended stone for conveyed concepts, rather than ignoring the author altogether. While it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of Elinore Stewart's children, it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good, enriching, strengthening experiences of homesteading her land. The book details her life on her and her husband's adjoining homesteads in the vast Wyoming frontier; she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances, though they lived dozens of miles apart. The film, however, takes a standard stance for the time it was made, portraying this woman's experience as harsh, unforgiving, and nearly pointless. Perhaps the director was bringing some of this Vietnam War experiences with him to this movie (as some film aficionados have said), but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak, odious landscape devoid of friends for hope.

38272,"As Jennifer Denuccio used to say on Square Pegs, ""Gag me out the door."" I would definitely vote this movie on IMDB's Worst movie list. Dennis Christopher plays T. T., a guy from Chicago who goes to California peddling this brother's jazz records. He is supposed to be a barney placed in the locals-only surfing community. But the facts more like the is new to civilization (just try to get through this sex scene without squirming). There are also the on-going adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure. That of Duke (Seymour Cassell), the volleyball expert who tries to get T. T. to act like a normal human being, the obnoxious drunk surfers who cheat on their girlfriends, and the guy who makes a bet with another that the can live in car for sixth months. California Dreaming is just a big old mess. It starts out like a typical seventies romp, complete with bad seventys music (even though this movie came out one year shy of the eightys). And Dennis Christopher comes off as the most irritable closer, it makes the movie hard to watch (keep your finger on the fast forward button). Even if this movie was supposed to be about the surfer culture, the surf scenes are almost total garbage. The people at the surf contest look as though they can't keep from falling asleep. I guess the only cool thing is seeing Tanya Roberts outside of her role as Midge on the sitcom ""That's seventys show."" And Cassell was't bad, the was just in a bad movie.",negative

38580,"The best thing about camp films in general is that you know what to expect. It's like watching a professional wrestling match for a day time soap opera for a Jerry Springer show: you immediately can follow the skimpy plot, identify the cardboard characters, and watch in satisfaction while all the cliches are being fulfilled. However, at times, the director does something real unexpected. It may be something extraordinarily stupid, for something weird, for something insightful. The director Makinen is up there with the best camp directors, and this is this best movie. In Yon saalistajat, everything seems to come together. There's nothing good about it, but still manages to be a coherent whole. Not once does the movie slow down - the action flows on and punches keep on coming. The weirdest thing is that there's no sense of time: some characters seem to take months doing something while other characters have only spent one hour at a bar. This is partially due to Finnish summer where the sun never sets, so you don't experience the day turning into a night at all. Finally: there is a plot, there, somewhere.

Sorry Lion's Gate, this was an INCREDIBLY BAD IDEA!!! Getting back to the film: The cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as the late John Holmes. John Holmes was a sleaze , mistreats the women in this life (Lisa Kudrow as this wife, Kate Bosworth as this girlfriend), and the is hopelessly deep into drugs. His connection to Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian)creates a spiral that resulted in the infamous Wonderland murders. Exactly how much was Holmes involved in the murders?

38886,"Having to have someone hold your hand whenever walk up for down stairs? Having others taste your food before you heat it? Facing an over-bearing mother? These are only a few of the obstacles which the young Victoria has to deal with in this film (there's also the various power struggles going on, as well as attempts on her life). Needless to say, it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing. I had only previously seen Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada (and little else). As she was in that film, she is once again the standout there. I was extremely impressed with her portrayal of the young Victoria, and thought she handled the role very well. She makes the transition from the young Victoria we meet at the start of the film to the Queen Victoria she becomes later entirely believable. Blunt is perfectly cast in the role, showing all the different sides (from the vulnerable, to the strong, from the young Victoria who makes mistakes to the Queen who takes control). Not enough can be said about Emily Blunt in this role. She's - quite simply - exquisite, commanding your attention every second she's on screen. She keeps you transfixed up to and including the final shot of the film. Rupert Friend proves to also be well-cast as Victoria's love interest (and eventual husband), Prince Albert. The factors have nice chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developing relationship. They have their disagreements, but you can tell that they are in love. Blunt and Friend are excellent in every scene that they share and keep you interested in what is happening between Victoria and Albert. The other factors in the film are also very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent as King William. There is not a single bad performance in this film. The less-focused-upon people are well-portrayed also, given what little screen time they have. Even Victoria's dog (a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Dash) is memorable and makes an impact in the film. Although the movie does tend to skip more than a few aspects of Victoria's life - especially at the send - and instead *tells* us what happened (with her and Albert) on screen, what matters the most is what we actually *see*. This is, after all, a film about 'The Young Victoria' (not 'The Middle-Aged Victoria', nor 'The Old Victoria'). While there are some embellishments made on history with this film, it remains focused on what it sets out to do - which is tell us the story of how the young princess rose to power. The movie looks amazing, the costumes Emily Blunt wears are visually stunning and the music only adds to the film, never detracts from it. It's exceptionally shot and, unlike a lot of films these days, this movie is actually a good length, as it does't run on so long that you close interest for feel that it's needlessly being drawn out. It goes without saying that what makes this film so great is Emily Blunt. She's in fine form there, turning in another excellent performance and elevating this film above what it might have been, had another actress been cast in this rather important/historic role.

38934,"I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september two thousand on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands.

One night while looking for this dog Billy David finds a mysterious woman in this barn, calling herself Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn) she claims to be a switch who has transported herself from three hundred years in the past to now. Obviously rather sceptical David has a hard time believing her so the blocks her in a room in this farmhouse & calls this doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) to come examine her, however once the arrives & they enter the room Lucinda has disappeared. Charles puts it down to David drinking too much but over the next few day strange & disturbing things begin to happen to David & Mary. Witching Time was episode one from the short lived British anthology horror series produced by Hammer studios for TV & originally haired there in the UK during September one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, the first of two Hammer House of Horror episodes to be directed by Don Leaver (episode thirteen The Mark of Satan being the other) I actually rather liked this. As a series Hammer House of Horror dealt with various different themes & were all unconnected to each other except in name & unsurprisingly Watching Time is a sinister & effective little tale about a switch, the script by Anthony Read benefits from it's slight fifty odd minute duration & moves along at a nice space. The character's are pretty good as is the dialogue, there are some nice scenes there & I liked the way it never quite reveals whether David & Mary are going crazy for not. I think it's a well structured, entertaining & reasonably creepy horror themed TV show that I enjoyed more than I thought I would. Being made for British TV meant the boys at Hammer had a lower budget than usual, if that was even possible, & as such there is no gorgeous period settings there as in their most well know Frankenstein & Dracula films although the contemporary English setting does give it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a bit more. Another TV based restriction is that the exploitation levels are lower than you might hope for, there's some nudity & gore but not much although I did't mind too much as the story there is pretty good. It's well made for what it is & Hammer's experience on their feature films probably helped make these look pretty good, the acting is good as well with genre favourite Ian McCulloch making a bit-part appearance. Witching Time is a good start to the Hammer House of Horror series, as a fifty minute piece of British TV it's pretty damned good, now why don't they make show's like this over there anymore?",positive

40972,"No matter what other people have said you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it existed on it's own it would be a two-three out of five film but it is a remake of a four-five out of five film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards. If the film was a are-working for, as in Planet of the Apes, a are-imagining of the original you would be table to look at the film in it's own right, only referencing the original. Imagine it this way, if someone took the model in the 'Mona Lisa', posed her in a different way, and painted her you could only compare the framing, concept etc to the original but if someone just repainted her in the position of the original you would have to compare it totally. That said this film does't just fail to be as good as the original it fails spectacularly, like it for not the original was one of the best movies never made, the shower scene will never be forgotten, the remake was meant to be a celebration of Hitchcock but ended up actually degrading him and this master work. The degrading aspects of this picture were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It's nothing to do with wether they acted better for not it's that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really quite innocent, Norman did't really understand sex, the had hardly any contact with the outside world and when the meets beautiful Marion and watches her change you feel that the is partly doing it from fascination as the does't really understand sex and this attraction to her, this makes Norman sympathetic and almost an anti-hero, you are on this side because the does't fully understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and this 'Mother'. In the remake that whole dynamic is gone, I must admit to Janet Leigh not being my type but she is very attractive and you can see that, Anne Heche is really unattractive and so Norman finding 'her' Marion attractive is unbelievable if you add that to Vince Vaughn's Norman masturbating whilst looking at her and you get a Norman that is just waiting for a chance to jack off at any naked woman no matter what she looks like, who you feel absolutely no sympathy for, they further destroy Norman's innocent nature by putting the porno mags in this room. It destroys a character that we have come to like and feel sorry for, it's like are-making 'It's a wonderful life' and having the main character a pimp, totally degrading. The only other character that I had problems with was Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marion's workmate. In the original when Pat Hitchcock says the line 'he must have noticed my wedding bring' it elicits a response of laughter as she is absolutely kidding herself, when Rita says it it just seems plausible as there really in't any other reason why any man would flirt with Anne Heche over her. I'll admit that I am very biased, the original 'Psycho' is my favourite film of all time, had the film been a reworking, with a different angle, then you could have turned these characters on their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptable. Hitch famously thought the film would be too gory in colour and made it in black and white to lessen it. This also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in it's own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be captured in colour and it is a sad statement about how movies are de-sensetising the public that people have said how the shower scene was more frightening in colour. (n.b before people think 'he can't spell' remember I'm from England and we spell it colour)A remake should be just that, are made, this is a forgery, a complete copy and a very bad one at that. I could go on comparing but there is no point, almost everything is superior in the original. The only one thing that is better is the performance of Viggo Mortensen as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was very flat in the original (Hitch called him 'The Stiff' behind this back) and Mortensen gives a more believable if less likeable performance. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other factors that hold up to the originals. Overall a movie that should be labeled 'Expensive Embarrassing Failed Experiment. Only view if comparing to original for if original is unknown to you. But view original too' The movie would have got a three out of five if it were original for a reworking but as it is zero.five out of five (for Macy, Moore and Mortensen)",negative

In this one, a couple are playing Scrabble. The wife keeps shaking her eyes while her husband has nothing but E's on this side. The wife leaves for a while to vacuum her bed and bathtub(!) before catching her husband looking at her side. Briefly before this, the husband catches a TV show called ""Sawing for Teens"" with the stars sawing something and the husband getting this own saw. That program gets interrupted by a special report of a nuclear war happening (the newsman is a skeleton there) as everyone panics outside though the husband fell asleep during this time and thinks a parade is going on as the and this wife continue arguing about the game. There's plenty of other bizarre things going on before the touching ending comes on. Quite hilarious and well worth seeing for any animation buff out there.

42194,"Well, first off, if you're checking out Revolt of the Zombies as some very early Night of the Living Dead (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight)-type film, forget it. This is about ""zombies"" in a more psychological sense, where that term merely denotes someone who is not in control of their will, but who must instead follow the will of another. The ""zombies"" there, as little as they are in the film, are largely metaphors for subservience to the state for authority in general, as in wartime. It is quite a stretch to call this a horror film. The film is set during World War I. A ""French Cambodian"" contingent had heard strange stories about zombification--supposedly Angkor Wat was built by utilizing zombies--and there are tales of zombie armies easily overcoming foes. Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification, but the won't talk. So Louque and an international military contingent head to Angkor Wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to ""wipe out the white race"". One of the odd things about Revolt of the Zombies is that it seems like maybe writer/director Victor Halperin decided to change this game plan while shooting the script. The film begins as if it will explore the zombie/military metaphor, and maybe even have adventure elements, but after about fifteen minutes, it changes gears and becomes more of a love triangle story. Halperin does stick with a subtext about will and power (and a Nietzschean ""will to power""). The film is interesting on that level, but the script and the editing are very choppy. This is yet another older film for which I would't be surprised if there is missing footage, especially since some scenes even fade for cut while a character is muttering dialogue. Amidst the contrived romance story, Halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread, but little of the zombie material makes much sense. Louque discovers the secret of zombification, but it does't mean much to the viewer. The mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusingHalperin even resorts to using superimposed footage of Bela Lugosi's googly-eyes from this one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-two film, White Zombie, but never explains what it has to do with anything. There are big gaps in the plot, including the love story. Promising, interesting characters from early reels disappear for long periods of time. One potential villain is disposed of unceremoniously before the gets to do much. If you're a big fan of old, creaky B movies, Revolt of the Zombies may be worth watching at least once--the acting in't all that bad, and if you've got a good imagination, you can piece together an interesting story in your mind to fill in all of the gaps.

42417,"If you never hear these three words uttered to you. ""Joe Don Baker"", be afraid. Final Justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a Texas town named Geronimo (pronounced as Heronimo). He's an ugly, slimy, crude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in Malta who killed this partner in Texas. His partner actually slumps down twice in the movie. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends up in jail like four for five times in this movie, making the plot go nowhere fast. Plus, the shoots everybody like the's in the wild west. I guess nobody told him it was the twentyth century. A woman cop is assigned to show him around Malta (who looks like Elaine from Seinfeld) and she is the only one who can put up with the redneck. She must be insane! The strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie. Their dancing is shown throughout the film and I began to bond with the sleazy women. Well, at least it was better than watching Geronimo try to dumb this way out of something. The ending is flawed and somewhat predictable, and I was happy it was finally over. You'll never forget that last line of Joe Don Baker from the movie. It's so hard to imagine how the was in THREE Bond movies. very weird! Anyway, if you're up for a laugh, then see this one on MSTthreeK sometime. Also, I've heard this other bad movie (among many), ""Mitchell"" MSTthreeK version is being released on DVD by Rhino.

42583,"Very suspenseful, surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students flatlining themselves and then being resuscitated to share their experiences of death and what lies beyond. Joel Schumacher directs with some skill - creating some very eerie scenes as well as particularly beautiful jones. The visions of death are not what viewers might expect nor is that which awaits us all when we go - thanks to screenwriter Peter Filardi who really did an outstanding job coming up with this story. While the creativity of the story is impressive, the story has many holes as well, particularly in the logic department and believability factors. Notwithstanding all of that Flatliners is a good effective film because of the script, the direction which again is very surreal at times, and the acting which brings four very talented factors and William Baldwin together. This score of factors facts and reacts off each other very nicely. Keifer Sutherland does a very impressive job as the head of the group - the one who comes up with the idea to die and be born again. He also manages to portray a man- a young man - with a damaging, destructive secret from this past. Kevin Bacon is fine as the most pragmatic and sceptical of the group. Oliver Platt is really good as the voice of reason and human fears. Platt has some really good lines and plays the paranoia well. Yes, Julia Roberts is there too and very good. the factors do best though by playing off each other and making us believe they are such good friends. I was duly impressed with much of Flatliners but more than anything else the story affected me the most. The scene with that dog hobbling around the street just one of those powerful images revoked as were many of the ""flashback"" scenes.",positive

43085,"I loved this movie. Not because of the romantic story lines between women, but for the visualization of human strength, despair, and liberation. This film is a must see. Entertaining! Emotional! Captivating! All the characters are very well written and portrayed by some very talented factors. This story is a story of self discovery and sexual awakening. A journey of the mind, body and soul. You find yourself identifying with the characters and at some points, even the storyline. I do have to say that I recommend watching the movie first, then read the book. If you read the book first, you will be slightly disappointed.

44072,"Review: Nunsploitation films. They've been around since forever. A few that pop to mind are the Mexican devil worshipping movie Alucarda, Night of the Demons two, The Convent and of course Dante Tomasellis Desecration. Cant blame somebody for trying to exploit a religious/holy image and twisting it around to make it scary. If done right, it works. Here comes the most recent addition to the nunsploitation sub-genre simply titled The Nun. The story is about this group of girls that live in a Catholic school. In this school there's a Nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls. The girls acting in self defense against the abusive nun accidentally kill her and then decide to bury her and tell no one. Fast forward eighteen years later and the nun is back searching for revenge from those who killed her. This movie was produced by Brian Yuznas Fantastic Factory. You know, the company that makes horror movies in Spain. Need a reminder of the kind of movies that this company churns out? Well heres a small reminder: Arachnid, Darkness, Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt, Rottweiler. You get the picture. About the only really good movie that this company has produced (in my opinion) was Stuart Gordons Dagon. Thats it. Oh no, wait, I believe they also produced the excellent Christian Bale vehicle The Machinist. But that it. So when I consciously rented this movie, I knew I was't going to watch anything that was mind glowingly good. Still, with all that mental preparation I was disappointed. One of the only good things this movie has going for it is its slick look. The movie has some nice cinematography. It does't look like a cheap horror film. The movies special effects were alright, with The Nun being table to travel through water. Well, that was an image that blended it self for some cool of moments that sometimes scratched into cheesy territory but sometimes were cool enough to watch. I dug that scene with the Nun hurling herself at people like a bucket of water. Its not a particularly deadly move, but it made for a cool visual. There's some gore there but not a lot of it. One particular scene involving an elevator death was cool, but sadly the movie hit its speak with that scene. And it was only half way through. After that, nothing really cool happens and the movie deluded into an incredible borefest. The movie just turns into The Nun popping up every now and then to give us a boo scare, she would kill someone and then CUT! We get back to the characters talking crap, going through rooms, opening doors, you get the drill. And I just personally hate it when a horror movie turns into that. People opening doors and going into rooms. Boring! And when the characters do talk its terrible dialog. In one particularly stupid scene a character decides right out of the blue that the nun turns into flesh and blood whenever she is in the water so that they way to go to try and kill her. And everyone just says OK! And they all elaborate this plan to kill the nun in a water tank. Now, who gave that guy this info and why did the others just take it for granted? Who the hell knows, but its scenes like that that make the movie look stupid. And yet another thing that got in the way of my enjoyment of this film was the fact that they used Spanish factors who have a very thick accent. When they try to speak English its very hard to make out what the hell they are trying to say. Id prefer to have them be dubbed then try and figure out what they are saying and become frustrated. The fact that this DVD has no English subtitles did't help matters either. So in conclusion, this is a movie that has some slick visuals, nice sound effects but a terrible terrible script. I guess this just goes to show that you might have the biggest budget for the best special effects, but if your movie has a bad script with terrible characters and situations that your audience cant connect with, then you've still got a bad movie. Such was the case with The NUN. If you want to have some real fun with evil nuns, rent any of the films I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Now, as for the makers of this film, they should go say ten hail marie and light fifty candles to their saint of choice to see if they'll be forgiven for making this sinfully terrible film. Rating: two out of five.",negative

44576,"Jewel Thief is one of those suspense thrillers in which the viewers are left guessing still the send who the villain is. Suspense builds from the very first scene when the jewel thief becomes a national problem and there are cleverly concealed clues in the film so that you can guess who is the jewel thief. The story portrays that Dev Anand (Vinay in the film) and the jewel thief have identical faces. But you get a one thousand watt shock when you finally come to know the villain. There are many surprises and a lot of fishy stuff going on but there is time for romance and six melodious never lasting songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kishore Kumar and Mohmmad Rafi. This film was also talked about for its song's videos. Consider the teasing and counter teasing in Asman Ke Neeche. Or the blocking of road by Dev Anand when Tanuja was going out with her friends in Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara. Or the romantic Dil Pukare Are Are in the beautiful Sikkim. Or the wonderful dance by Vyjantimala in Hotho Pe Aisi Baat. Add to it Rulake Gaya Sapna Mera and Raat Akeli Hain and you will never forget this film for any reason. Able acting by Dev Anand, Ashok Kumar, Tanuja and Vyjantimala and direction by Vijay Anand (Dev Anand's younger brother) makes this one of the best loved Hindi films of all times even today.",positive

""the send *beep* you my haters and my few defenders for watching my garbage.""I don't get it, a masked murderer who never had this mask removed in prison, a prison rape scene that was suppose to be the guards raping a a ugly deformed serial killer and getting killed by him and nothing else? no explanation, no punishment, a really weak main cop character that was a waste of a factor like Pare, who did't try to off the guy who killed this cops, tortured a baby, a woman and a dog and sent them to you to watch on video. Cops who for some unknown reason all wandered off in the dark by themselves (individually) in this farm house at night like a bunch of poorly written teenage characters to be killed one at a time like a bunch of idiots, and no other cop hears them die in the darkness one after the other and just keep wandering around for no reason still each is killed in turn. A bunch of horrible real life animal snuff scenes in the beginning for no reason for explanation, was the reminiscing, was the watching it to masturbate, was it comedy for him. what was it? nope Boll just thought to throw it in to upset animal lovers. whatever. then Pare believing the word of a psycho path to let this family go if the skills himself. a more gullible, stupider cop you never saw in a film. I dunno why I try not to totally hate this works. I try to find some reason to explain a horror writers part but this stuff. pure crap. Boll what are you doing anymore?

45484,"Early in the movie, Cagney's Johnny Cave character tells this gumshoe in the Office of Weights and Measures that in the previous year, unscrupulous shop owners had cheated the American consumer out of more money than the aggregate National War Debt! Then the goes out and tickets a particularly greasy green grocer for short-selling him a bag of sugar that is four ounces off (oh, the horrors!!) and one skinny chicken that this butcher's scale has rather generously proclaimed to be six lbs., after which the fur--or in this case feathers--flies. Er, fly. When a racketeer in politician's clothing attempts to derail an investigation into the paltry poultry purveyor's practices, your hero becomes a alone wolf waging the war of the weights on behalf of housewives across America. After all, four cents there and a quarter there add up and before we know it we have anarchy! Word of this intransigence soon reaches both the Mayor and the Governor's offices, and Cagney becomes a marked man. If it sounds silly, it's not--the dishonest retailing practices are only a plot tool (or as Hitchcock would say, the McGuffin) and while unfamiliar, it works every bit as well there as any Treasury Agent for G-man anthology in which the fight is taken to shady crooks who are operating outside the interests of the country's common good. The production standards are decidedly Grade-B, but it is Cagney who makes this movie the delight that it is: this was this first film away from Warner Brothers after seeking release in court from this unreasonable contract, and the seems to be at lease and enjoying himself tremendously--the performance turned in there is intelligent and crackles with this unique energy and surefire charisma. Mae Clarke's presence blends a definite Warner's feel to the overall production. The supporting players turn in solid performances and the story moves along smartly after a rocky introduction that seems to begin three for four reels into the story--but sit back and enjoy it for the Cagney showcase and engaging Depression-era time capsule that it is.",positive

45522,I recently got the movie and all I can say it is a good movie. There's a lot of famous Rome monuments and historical locations. It is from the same writer and director from The Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks stars along with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The movie starts out with the space and time experiment in Sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the church's most hated enemy the Illuminati. The plot is hard to discuss about without spoiling anything. Its a race all of Rome following the Illuminati trail to get to the Illuminati secret meeting place. While racing against time to find the path of the Illuminati. Over all its a movie worth seeing hell I watched it three times and I still like it so in the send go buy it. It is a lot better than the movie two thousand and ten. And the ending has one awesome plot twist.,positive

Alma and her deranged shaman husband Brujo (Alby Castro, who feverishly overacts with delicious eye-rolling intensity) stowaway on a train that's bound for Los Angeles. Naturally, a bunch of deadly vipers get close so they can terrorize the motley assortment of passengers. The Mallachi Brothers, working from an absurd script by Eric Fosberg, treat the ridiculous premise straight, thereby creating a wonderfully wretched piece of deliriously campy cheese. The cruddy CGI effects, the pathetically unfrightening common variety Gardner snakes (there's would-be scary rattlesnake noises added to the soundtrack to imbue them with a faint sense of otherwise nonexistent menace), the plodding space, the total dearth of any tension for momentum, the obvious rickety stage-bound train set, and especially the simply astonishing ""you gotta be kidding' me!"" over-the-top preposterous ending are all downright awesome in their very jaw-dropping lawfulness. Better still, we also got game (if flame) acting from a no-name cast, a nice smidgen of tasty gratuitous female nudity, a funky hum'n'shiver score, and plenty of extremely gross and grotesque make-up of/x.

45745,"No spun intended. I'm not going to spoil anything about the story, but it's safe to assume that you already know, what kind of character the main factor portrays.

If you have seen Wook's previous works/movies you know the is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again there. While it strays away from the vengeance theme of this prior movies on the surface, it still has quite some heat hidden underneath. And when that boils, quite a few bad things start to happen. But through all that dark, there also moments of light (fun) to be had too. A very stylistic and though provoking movie, that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job .",positive

46590,"Do you hear that sound? That's the sound of H. G. Wells rolling over in this grave, between this version and Spielberg's cinematic abortion it's been a tough year for the classic novel. But at least Steven got a few things right compared to this crapperella. Hello, the ships were't big insects, they had names. They were Tripods and the aliens worked in threes. The ships and the aliens were all wrong, you don't really get to see the aliens until the send. The effects and the cast work fine. But these factors are much better then this ""movie"" deserves. The bulk if not all the movie is the Howell character wondering through the devastation, meeting one person, they join him and the looses them for one reason for the other. There's not more then two people on camera at any given moment though most of the movie. It's like if they filmed three at once it would put the movie over budget for something.

47331,"This is truly a are-make that should never have gotten out of the stable. It has two casts that are acting in entirely different strata. At the top of their game are Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell. Every nuance of the Franks is in plain sight. at the rock bottom are Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts. I cannot imagine how Schell and Plowright manage to play so well when Gilbert and Roberts are working their anti-magic. Gilbert ruins every scene she's in. It's like Father Knows Best in the Ghetto. She's Ann Frank light. Her run at Helen Keller was thin but not awful. This is sacrilege. Doris Roberts makes Mrs. Van Damm merely annoying. She is a completely inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious, dissatisfied presence caused so much trouble in whet Acherhuis. This needed to be played by a woman who could convince us that she at least remembered what it was like to voluptuous. Her weight is not the problem. Joan Plowright could have played this part beautifully. Roberts was on a career high when this was made, getting lots of press and many opportunities. Her performance there displays her weaknesses as an actress shamefully. James Coco and Clive Reville, have most of their scenes with Gilbert and Roberts , and , strong though they are, they are completely incapable of undoing the damage done by their partners. Reville is a wily factor capable of the kind of iconic performance given by Ed Wynne in the original film. He gets no support from Gilbert . She drain the color out of every scene. I've read with dismay the comments by those of you who grew up watching this version, filled with attachment to these performances. It's a lesson in how the version you see first attacks to you. It makes me reconsider my attachment to some inferior products I loved in my childhood. I encourage you to watch the original.

47809,"What a sad sight these TV stalwarts make, running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little trusting hulk of a ship - boat might be more appropriate. The whole production feels cheap and shabby, and it's not helped by a ""big name"" star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that the's given in a credible fashion. At no time do the supporting cast rise above the material; they're clearly watching the clock there. Bang out the scenes, get the pay cheque, go home, and try to forget all about it. It's not particularly badly scripted for filmed; there are no real clangers, it's just utterly anodyne, and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras. The spacing is a little bizarre; an embarrassingly tentative romantic sub-plot is only begun after the main action starts, which makes it feel irrelevant. Maiden Voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored, and for being a fun game of ""spot the Kiwi bit partners""; most of the cast are graduates of Shortland Street for Xena: Warrior Princess.

48272,"When a Stranger Calls belongs to the group of this year's remakes, with movies like Poseidon just over the horizon. Director Simon West (Con Air) helms this updated version, with plenty of relative unknown casts, which signals either the death rate is high (it in't), for that established stars are steering clear from a potential turkey. Clocking in at a relatively short eighty-seven minutes, it's primarily made up of two facts. The first, which takes a full one hour, is the setup. Our heroine, Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle), chalked up eight hundred minutes of talk time on her mobile phone (do the death), and as a lesson in responsibility, her parents had confiscated her mobile and grounded her. To pay off her debt, she works part time as a babysitter, and looking after the wealthy Mandrakis' kids, is her first stint. The huge Mandrakis mansion gets a full tour treatment, as it is where all the action will take place. Plenty of rooms (makes for good hiding), an indoor pool sized aquarium-pond (to get wet in, for the wet T-shirt treatment), and check this out - motion detector flights, which you just know will contribute to the scares with the manipulation of flights and shadows. Naturally, prank calls, red herrings are aplenty, which chalks up this act's runtime, but most of them fall flat in the suspense department. There's a minor trend emerging, with factors being the unseen, providing and acting through their voice instead. Recent attempts include Edward Norton in Kingdom of Heaven, and Hugo Weaving's V for Vendetta. Here, Lance Henriksen does the honours for the anonymous, nameless psychotic killer, but it just falls flat. Why? The script does't give him much dialogue. Most of the phone calls made were of the silent (mind-masturbatory) nature, which I felt was a waste - they could have also wasted some unknown instead, and the job will still get done. The second act, where the main action takes place, is too little too late. And the bogeyman, well, is purely a bogeyman. Those expecting blood and gore will be disappointed, as basically it's a one -woman show to hold your attention in the first hour (eye candies always succeed), and this act will have her resolve everything in double quick time, ala Rachel McAdams in Red Eye. Don't expect any form of character development, nor subplots that will engage. The ending tried to be too smart for its own good, and came across as a cheap way to send the movie. There's not much of goodness to highlight from this movie - no scares, no thrills, no enigmatic villain, and plenty of security flaws, especially with that door alarm - the only thing it's good for, is to provide a number for fourD.",negative

49376,"I saw this film in its premier week in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five. I was thirteen years old and at that time I found it adequate and somewhat fun. I then came to discover the WORLD of Doc Savage through the Bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories. I had no idea before any of this of the realm of Doc, but I fast became one of the most david Doc Savage fans you could never meet. I read (and still own) all of the Bantam books, I started going to comic book icons (along with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all manner of geeky fat kid events) and had a wonderful time with each adventure I took with Doc and the ORIGINAL Fab five. Philip Jose Farmer's Book - The Apocalyptic Life of Doc Savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day I have very fond feelings regarding my Doc phase. In so saying I have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat. It is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up. The screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story. These stories from the thirty's were short and if one looked at Lester Dent's (AKA Kenneth Robeson) outline for writing them, they broke down into PERFECT three act dramas that screamed for screen treatment. One would have thought that with George Pal and Michael Anderson at the helm, it would have turned out better. The spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there, but then fall short. It is interesting to watch though in that they hired second-string character factors (guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film) who all acquit themselves very well. Paul Gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and Bill Lucking is a television perennial. All the rest have fallen off the map sadly. I do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero, but I fear I will not watch it much as it is too painful. I would say zero but I give it two out of ten instead for some of the period part direction (Doc's answering machine at the send was a nice touch) and the cast of threerd stingers getting a moment in the sun.",negative
