With these two one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five alps Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys were trying to create a new sound that at the time no other rock group had never created. In December one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five after Brian Wilson had just heard the Beatles \"Rubbersoul\", a statement album from the fab four, implying that the whole album should be counted as the hit, not just a single for two off the album and the rest just filler. Brian was amazed at the similarities between the just released \"Rubbersoul\" and The Beach Boys earlier one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five releases \"Today\" and \"Summer Days and Summer nights\". Brian would say \"I want to make a record just like that, but I want to make it better!\"Brians competitive fires were stoked to compete with the Beatles. And what Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys created blew the Beatles right out of the water and rest was history. In fact the Beach Boys were so worried about Pet Sounds being accepted by Capital records they were prepared to be told to \"go back to the studio and make a friendly top forty record but defenintly please nothing like Pet Sounds\". Capital Records were not so sure how the public would accept this new sound. An incredible early psychedelic recording released May sixteen, one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six which influenced the Beatles one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven Sgt. Pepper so much that George Martin has stated \"if it were'nt for Pet Sounds Sgt. Pepper would not have been created\". Pretty strong words from Sir George who helped produce the worlds greatest rock bands music. Believe me when the Beatles heard Pet Sounds their jaws dropped with envy and danger.one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six was a very musically transitional year for both the Beatles and the Beach Boys. At this time on Aug.fiveth one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six the Beatles released their counter shot to Pet Sounds with their masterpiece \"Revolver\". Many rockologists and Beatle fans alike consider Revolver to be a better recording than Sgt. Pepper, of course it will always be debatable and an ongoing endless conversation. The Beach Boys were to add an exclamation point to Pet Sounds in october one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six as the Beach Boys unleashed their pschyedelic masterpiece \"Good Vibrations\" just a few months before the Beatles started their Sgt. Pepper recording sessions. The Beatles were enjoying success with Revolver and captured some of the new pschyedelic sound with Revolvers release. Even with the success of Revolver, the release of Good Vibrations defined more of the psychedelic sound in rock music in the fall of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six than Revolver did and really got the Beatles crazy with envy, and created a real urgency for the Beatles to get back to Abbey Road studios to outdue their well armed rivals. The Beach Boys never approached the success of the Beatles due partly if not all to Brian Wilsons bad habits of over indulgence, but Pet Sounds really made the psychedelic era sound and influenced the Beatles Sgt Pepper. As the song says God only knows what the Beach boys could have done post Pet Sounds, if it were'nt for Brians over indulgence in bad habits, will never know. Pet sounds was recorded while Brian had these bad habits but that is what helped Pet Sounds sound unique, Brian let these bad habits get the better of him post Pet Sounds. Pet Sounds was not a commercial success when released, but clearly got the attention of many music artist including classical composer Leonard Bernstien, as their minds were just blown away by it. I listen to both Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds and there is some really eerie similarities, besides the instrumentation between the two, on Pet Sounds after \"Caroline No\" the last song on the recording you hear a trolley and a dog barking and than a train with its horn going off and a dog barking while and after the train passes. On Sgt. Pepper you hear barn animals, possibly Pet Sounds influenced and on Magical Mystery Tour you hear a train with its horn just before going into Pennylane. Pink Floyd would use animals sounds in their one thousand, nine hundred and seventys work, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy \"Atom Heart Mother\" including a cow on the cover of the alp. Pink Floyd in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six released an album called Animals and even used giant inflatable pigs on their Animals tour stage show, I wonder if Pet Sounds had anything to due with that? Pet sounds caused the Beatles to disappear into Abbey Road for six-eight months to make Sgt. Pepper. To make Sgt. Pepper better than Pet Sounds and Good Vibrations. Because of this Sgt. Pepper is the yardstick to measure every rock recording from past, present and future. The Beatles also had the greatest record producer of all time on their side Sir George Martin. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Sir George Martin tvs. Brian Wilson. Brian Wilson was on this own and had no real help, even though the remaining Beach Boys had some creative, musical skills. The one thing I will give the Beach Boys over the Beatles is that they had better technology in the recording studio than the Beatles at Abbey Road. I respect the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson (Tony Asher) as a song writer and music creator. In my opinion the Beach Boys Pet Sounds set up the pschycodelic era, a really important era in rock history that even the Beatles and most every other rock band during the psychedelic era copied Pet Sounds in some form. I like having both versions of Pet Sounds, Mono so you could hear how it sounded in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six and stereo because you could hear different instruments that you cant hear in mono. I like the stereo version better because I am just used to stereo recordings, but I still like to listen to the mono version and go back to one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six. The five.one stereo sound is mind boggling and must be heard on your theatre system, you will not believe Pet Sounds could sound this incredible. Every song on Pet Sounds is a an early psychedelic journey into the start of the most important era in rock history. Pet Sounds started the most Important era in rock history the Psychedelic Era. I recommend Pet Sounds to any music lover this recording truly set the standard as definetly one of the greatest most influential rock recordings never created. This cd mono and stereo sounds pristine and brilliantly remastered. The miniature booklet supplied with this fortyth anniversary edition cd is extremely informative and the add is an incredible look into this historical fascinating recording. Pet Sounds is a very influential and timeless recording. Pet Sounds is the blueprint for the entire psychedelic one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys, early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, which the Beatles and many rock groups of the time used the Pet Sounds blueprint to mold and create their own music during this time. If you the reader wish to get more into Pet Sounds you should look into purchasingThe Pet Sounds Sessions. You will with this four cd box set see how genius Brian Wilson constructs this one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six masterpiece. If Pet sounds Sessions is to overkill you will be making the right choice just sticking to this fortieth anniversary edition release.","overall":5,"summary":"ON 5\/16\/66 PET SOUNDS STARTED THE PSYCHEDELIC 1960S....THE BEACH BOYS MASTERPIECE,  GOD ONLY KNOWS.................","unixReviewTime":1167955200,"reviewTime":"01 5, 2007"}

psychcedelic sound on other two one thousand nine hundred and sixty five alps the beach boys today and summer days and summer nights with these two one thousand nine hundred and sixty five alps brian wilson and the beach boys were trying to create a new sound that at the time no other rock group had never created in december one thousand nine hundred and sixty five after brian wilson had just heard the beatles rubbersoul a statement album from the fab four implying that the whole album should be counted as the hit not just a single for two off the album and the rest just filler brian was amazed at the similarities between the just released rubbersoul and the beach boys earlier one thousand nine hundred and sixty five releases today and summer days and summer nights brian would say i want to make a record just like that but i want to make it better brians competitive fires were stoked to compete with the beatles and what brian wilson and the beach boys created blew the beatles right out of the water and rest was history in fact the beach boys were so worried about pet sounds being accepted by capital records they were prepared to be told to go back to the studio and make a friendly top forty record but defenintly please nothing like pet sounds capital records were not so sure how the public would accept this new sound an incredible early psychedelic recording released may sixteen one thousand nine hundred and sixty six which influenced the beatles one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven sgt pepper so much that george martin has stated if it werent for pet sounds sgt pepper would not have been created pretty strong words from sir george who helped produce the worlds greatest rock bands music believe me when the beatles heard pet sounds their jaws dropped with envy and danger one thousand nine hundred and sixty six was a very musically transitional year for both the beatles and the beach boys at this time on aug fiveth one thousand nine hundred and sixty six the beatles released their counter shot to pet sounds with their masterpiece revolver many rockologists and beatle fans alike consider revolver to be a better recording than sgt pepper of course it will always be debatable and an ongoing endless conversation the beach boys were to add an exclamation point to pet sounds in october one thousand nine hundred and sixty six as the beach boys unleashed their pschyedelic masterpiece good vibrations just a few months before the beatles started their sgt pepper recording sessions the beatles were enjoying success with revolver and captured some of the new pschyedelic sound with revolvers release even with the success of revolver the release of good vibrations defined more of the psychedelic sound in rock music in the fall of one thousand nine hundred and sixty six than revolver did and really got the beatles crazy with envy and created a real urgency for the beatles to get back to abbey road studios to outdue their well armed rivals the beach boys never approached the success of the beatles due partly if not all to brian wilsons bad habits of over indulgence but pet sounds really made the psychedelic era sound and influenced the beatles sgt pepper as the song says god only knows what the beach boys could have done post pet sounds if it werent for brians over indulgence in bad habits will never know pet sounds was recorded while brian had these bad habits but that is what helped pet sounds sound unique brian let these bad habits get the better of him post pet sounds pet sounds was not a commercial success when released but clearly got the attention of many music artist including classical composer leonard bernstien as their minds were just blown away by it i listen to both sgt pepper and pet sounds and there is some really eerie similarities besides the instrumentation between the two on pet sounds after caroline no the last song on the recording you hear a trolley and a dog barking and than a train with its horn going off and a dog barking while and after the train passes on sgt pepper you hear barn animals possibly pet sounds influenced and on magical mystery tour you hear a train with its horn just before going into pennylane pink floyd would use animals sounds in their one thousand nine hundred and seventys work one thousand nine hundred and seventy atom heart mother including a cow on the cover of the alp pink floyd in one thousand nine hundred and seventy six released an album called animals and even used giant inflatable pigs on their animals tour stage show i wonder if pet sounds had anything to due with that pet sounds caused the beatles to disappear into abbey road for six eight months to make sgt pepper to make sgt pepper better than pet sounds and good vibrations because of this sgt pepper is the yardstick to measure every rock recording from past present and future the beatles also had the greatest record producer of all time on their side sir george martin john lennon paul mccartney sir george martin tvs brian wilson brian wilson was on this own and had no real help even though the remaining beach boys had some creative musical skills the one thing i will give the beach boys over the beatles is that they had better technology in the recording studio than the beatles at abbey road i respect the beach boys and brian wilson tony asher as a song writer and music creator in my opinion the beach boys pet sounds set up the pschycodelic era a really important era in rock history that even the beatles and most every other rock band during the psychedelic era copied pet sounds in some form i like having both versions of pet sounds mono so you could hear how it sounded in one thousand nine hundred and sixty six and stereo because you could hear different instruments that you cant hear in mono i like the stereo version better because i am just used to stereo recordings but i still like to listen to the mono version and go back to one thousand nine hundred and sixty six the five one stereo sound is mind boggling and must be heard on your theatre system you will not believe pet sounds could sound this incredible every song on pet sounds is a an early psychedelic journey into the start of the most important era in rock history pet sounds started the most important era in rock history the psychedelic era i recommend pet sounds to any music lover this recording truly set the standard as definetly one of the greatest most influential rock recordings never created this cd mono and stereo sounds pristine and brilliantly remastered the miniature booklet supplied with this fortyth anniversary edition cd is extremely informative and the add is an incredible look into this historical fascinating recording pet sounds is a very influential and timeless recording pet sounds is the blueprint for the entire psychedelic one thousand nine hundred and sixtys early one thousand nine hundred and seventys which the beatles and many rock groups of the time used the pet sounds blueprint to mold and create their own music during this time if you the reader wish to get more into pet sounds you should look into purchasingthe pet sounds sessions you will with this four cd box set see how genius brian wilson constructs this one thousand nine hundred and sixty six masterpiece if pet sounds sessions is to overkill you will be making the right choice just sticking to this fortieth anniversary edition release ","overall":5,"summary":"ON 5\/16\/66 PET SOUNDS STARTED THE PSYCHEDELIC 1960S....THE BEACH BOYS MASTERPIECE,  GOD

Kelly really stepped things up with this this debut solo effort without the support of Public Announcement. The previous LP had showcased moments like \"She's Got That Vibe\" but had a lot of room for improvement and self expression. The focus there is almost totally on the ninetys party\/romance \"R&B;\" sound (He pauses only to honour this mother) and is full of classics in this respective genre. \"Bump N' Grind\" was the big hit and a definite anthemic highlight as the plays down this manifesto. Other well known material includes \"Your Body's Calling Me\" and \"It Seems Like Your Ready\", both are beautifully structured and performed. Tracks five to nine bring a more uptempo feel with a slight new jack twist carrying on from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two's \"Born Into The ninetys\". The album reaches it's climax on the final two numbers: the bedroom suite of the near twelve-minute opus \"Sex Me Part one & two\" and \"twelve Play\". It's all really well done, you can tell the had really studied the epic nature of Marvin Gaye's seventys work. Which leads into the one minor complaint, the did't seem to have found this own distinctive sound at this stage. His vocal echoes Aaron Hall while the production at times Teddy Riley. That said this problem in't as acute as on the last LP and the material is great on it's own merits. Even though the would go on to find this own voice and style on this next album (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five's self-titled effort), don't sleep on \"twelve Play\", it's full of gems.","overall":5,"summary":"\"Let Get It On\" for the 90s...","unixReviewTime":1042070400,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2003"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"After hearing this it still boggles me that even Elvis himself considers this this worst album. From what I heard from Amazon reviews I went in expecting to hear something that sounded more like Harold Faltmeyer for something with a lot of drum machines and other mid eighty's clashes. And being a lover of eighty's pop I know there is such a thing as taking it too far. That goes for any decade. But not to be a. well revisionist there I have to say I was more the pleasantly surprised. This is along with the previous recordingPunch the Clockone of my two favourite releases by Costello. The thirteen songs presented there have a very alive stone to them, topped with the same tasteful, creamy eighty's soul\/pop-jazz polish as the last album. The one difference is that every song features that sound; this does't sound like a spiky new-wave effort in the slightest. That beside the point there are a handful of great songs that are hugely HELPED by the production;\"The Only Flame In Town\",\"Inch By Inch\" and \"Worthless Thing\" are all excellent itunes in and of themselves, with a lot of jazzy, funky groove in them that add more then a fair share of bite. \"Sour Milk-Cow Blues\". okay it does have a Huey Lewis-ish flavor but again, from this view that is not a bad thing. There are a number of ballads too of course, great as well from the simple style of \"Room With No Number\", the soulful \"Love Field\" and my favourite \"I Wanna Be Loved\"; this is my favourite contribution of Costello to the Brit-R&B; scene since this work on the previous album, the delayed beat and the mildly psychedelic bit in the chorus create a unique sense of atmospherics that really make it great to hear and hear how everything comes together by the send.\"Peace In Our Time\" is at least one song pretty much everyone can agree is plain great-there's no question who it's about and there's no irony lost when Elvis declares Reagen an \"alien in the white house\" considering the now deacessed sex president was once posed on a tabloid cover with a cardboard standup of a space alien. As with any Elvis Costello album there tend to be an awful lot of songs-some great, some pretty good but the fact is if your good with albums such a Tears For FearsSongs from the Big Chairor XTC'sOranges & Lemons, both recordings that blended contemporary rock-soul-pop with jazz and psychedelic influences then you will have your mind as open as possible for the music you'll find there.","overall":5,"summary":"A Relevantly Soulful Experience","unixReviewTime":1240790400,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2009"}

But I would argue that the second album on that list should be one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five's \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers,\" in which Sinatra and arranger Nelson Riddle go in the opposite direction, providing a stellar collection of pop standards reinterpreted for the crooner who was becoming a damn fine singer. Several of the songs, such as \"Pennies From Heaven\" and \"I've Got You Under My Skin,\" actually predated the start of Sinatra's career, but in the case of the latter Sinatra provided what is arguably the definitive version of the Cole Potter classic and the song that in retrospect defined Frank Sinatra as the premier vocalist of the twentyth century (sorry for that gross understatement, but you get the idea). The zesty stone for the album is established with the opening track, \"You Make Me Feel So Young,\" while other great tracks if you had to be picky would be \"You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me\" and \"Too Marvelous for Words.\"All of these songs give you the undeniable sense that Sinatra is just having a great time singing each and every one of them. Riddle's arrangements, done with a score rhythm section and a full orchestra, are the key to unlocking the door to musical greatness and are as fine as anything the never did for Sinatra for anyone else. Part of the problem is that nobody really remembers what most of these songs sounded like before Riddle and Sinatra reworked them into the songs we know today. I may well change my mind tomorrow, but today I would make the case that \"I've Got You Under My Skin\" is the greatest Frank Sinatra song.","overall":5,"summary":"Sinatra and Riddle record &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot;","unixReviewTime":1086134400,"reviewTime":"06 2, 2004"}

And although in the early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys the magic duo of Henley\/Frey churned out hits with enough speed to allow for the production of four albums in four years, followed by an all-time best-selling Greatest Hits (Vol. one) album even before the release of the Eagles' classic \"Hotel California,\" the started to take things considerably slower in this post-Eagles solo career. The two years the took to follow up one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two's \"I Can't Stand Still\" with \"Building the Perfect Beast\" were actually the shortest time between any two of this solo albums; in part due to the fact that, as Henley explained, this collaboration with Danny \"Kootch\" Kortchmar worked along lines different from those the had established with Glenn Frey in the Eagles. These were not two guys sitting down together in a room with a guitar and a drum kit any longer: For Don Henley's second solo release, bowing to the musical developments of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, they relied heavily on synthesized sounds (Henley's tour promoting the album even featured an elaborate light show, something that would have been inconceivable for any of the Eagles' tours). And while making most of the songs on the album easily \"listenable\" and producing several top-selling singles (\"All She Wants to Do Is Dance,\" \"Sunset Grill,\" \"Boys of Summer\" and \"Not Enough Love in the World\"), that choice of instrumentation also seemed to render \"Building the Perfect Beast\" the most easily rateable of all of Henley's solo releases. Lyrically, however, Henley had lost nothing of this bite; the album's very name is indicative of that fact. \"We're the jones who can kill the things we don't heat,\" the warned in the title track, musically the wedgies song on the album (synthesizers for not) - \"we have met the enemy, and the is us . the secrets of eternity; we've found the block and turned the key . all the way to Malibu from the Land of the Talking Drum, just look how far we've come.\" \"Sunset Grill\" and \"A Month of Sundays\" lament the death of small from-and-pop farms and businesses and their takeover by large corporations; a criticism of Reaganomics Henley would take up even more forcefully in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine's \"The End of the Innocence.\" (Ironically, this beloved Sunset Grill in L. A. later went down that very same path, too - \"Don't Go There,\" the therefore equipped during the closing appearance of this recent \"Inside Job\" tour, \"it main't there anymore. Even though it still has the same name. Even though the guy has my name on the menu. Don't go there!\") \"All She Wants to Do Is Dance\" has a similar theme, focusing on corporate and political agreed in general. \"The Boys of Summer,\" musically based on a guitar riff supplied by Heartbreaker Mike Campbell, is a warning not to look back and romanticize the past but rather, to look toward the future - just keep your eyes open whatever you do, though, because if you're Driving With Your Eyes Closed \"you're gonna hit something' . but that's the way it goes.\"As on all of this solo releases, Henley was table to secure the collaboration of a virtual all-star cast of musicians, from Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham and Heartbreakers Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench to Randy Newman, Patty Smyth, Belinda Carlisle, Richard and Waddy Wachtel, Toto's Steve Porcaro and David Paich, \"inofficial Eagle\" J. D. Souther, and many, many more. And despite the seeming bow to the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys' musical tastes in the instrumentation of many of the album's tracks, their lasting quality becomes apparent like on no other occasion when Henley performs them live, as the did on this recently-concluded tour. Stripped of some of their fancy effects, they stand up even more visibly to the class of this other work, both with the Eagles and solo - and you just have to have heard that stunning, several minutes' long drum\/percussion intro (not even performed by Henley himself) to \"All She Wants to Do Is Dance,\" the closing song of the tour's regular program.\"Building the Perfect Beast\" cemented Don Henley's standing as a solo artist, and it paved the way for this biggest release to date, \"End of the Innocence.\" As the had done with this bandmates a decade earlier, Henley again proved that the was table to create something lasting, in whatever format the chose. Maturity added more focus to this work (lyrically if nowhere else); and vocally, many of the tracks on this album are among the most demanding the has never written. Unlike the output of the era's countless hair bands, disco kings and queens and punk bands, all of Don Henley's first three solo releases still have a large enough audience to warrant their inclusion in the catalogue of every major record store - including the seemingly so one thousand, nine hundred and eightys-sounding \"Building the Perfect Beast.\"Also recommended:The End of the InnocenceDon Henley Live - Inside JobThe Eagles - Hell Freezes OverSelected Works: one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nineHotel California","overall":5,"summary":"Much more than just another '80s record.","unixReviewTime":997056000,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2001"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"It's almost impossible to avoid the fact this album starts with a bang with it's best know song that also doubles as Wang Chung's signature hit \"Everybody Have Fun Tonight\", a song that if I than't owned the forty-five since I was six years old and had it's music and lyrics memorized to a tee I would'nt have bothered buying this. Now myself being an album lover as opposed to being into individual hit singles it always interests me to see how a pop ALBUM as opposed to a pop SINGLE can work. And trust me a pop album can work, anytime and in any decade if done well. Now this album is absolutely nothing like any of the other Wang Chung albums before it. Produced by J. Geils Band singer Peter Wolf this, as with all their music the sense of songcraft is high and the basic framework is intact but the production is absolutely polished to a near perfect sheen and therefore the soul\/pop elements of their sound are puffed up to a huge degree. In fact the majority of this album does't exactly follow the excitable, uptempo pop\/funk\/rock sound of the lead off song and focuses more on bloodier pieces all taken at more of a medium tempo such as \"Hypnotize Me\",\"The Flat Horizon\",\"Betrayal\" and \"Let's Go\". Every area of the sound on these songs is spoken for, either with instrumentation for vocal fills so the empty spaces are not quite prominent as it would be in most new wave style pop. And perhaps it was just as well. By the mid eighty's the new wave sound was on the wane as most of the bands developed either a soul-funk and\/or an adult contemporary oriented sound by the send of the decade as the sounds that would later become known as alternative rock began to outshadow them commercially. This elegance and more obviously dance\/R&B oriented music also showcases more singers and musicians than usual such as Michael McDonald's presence on the more edgy funk of \"A Fool With No Money\". Some of the songs do catch a little more fire such as the somewhat Motown\/Chicago inflected rhythm of \"Eyes Of The Girl\" and the vibrant, polyrhythmic \"head\" style funk groove of the more topical \"The World In Which We Live\". It may be a bit more streamlined and glossy than earlier Wang Chung albums but that does't make it any less important; just different and maybe a bit more obviously radio friendly. Lucky it does so in a way that's very appealing to listen to.","overall":5,"summary":"Across The Nation,Around The World","unixReviewTime":1286496000,"reviewTime":"10 8, 2010"}

I finally bought the CD in Atlanta in two thousand and two after thirteen years of having the cassette. This album set the stone for the dancing and choreography that dominated the next decade in videos and live performances. It does't sound dated like some 'eightys albums--the music is heavy on the rhythms and the beats! Very fun, danceable, escapist and so very funky!!!! I still love \"Knocked Out\", \"Cold Hearted\", \"Straight Up\", \"The Way That You Love Me\" and \"I Need You\". I like the other songs too like the ballad \"Next To You\"--it sounds very Atlanta-like in its landscapes. I believe that it was the benchmark to what Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Jennifer Lopez are doing now. Paula's voice is girlish and a little squeaky on some songs, but she did sound good on all of them. Janet Jackson was already hot too in 'eighty-nine-'ninety (though Paula's album came out in June one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight), but Paula really gave Janet some stiff competition. Paula's recent judging on American Idol makes this album far more respectable now! Her recent visibility will make more people and newer listeners to buy this album.","overall":4,"summary":"I STILL play this album  just about every year!!!!!","unixReviewTime":1085702400,"reviewTime":"05 28, 2004"}

If you want the full concert I recommend that you check outComplete Jazz At Massey Hall, which includes the weight tracks where Dizzy and Bird leave the stage and Powell, Mingus and Roach take over (on one track it's just Roach on a drum solo). Not only does that album have the complete concert, but the sound is better and it has Mingus' original bass lines. I will confess that I like the sound quality of this release better than my first copy of this concert. And while Mingus' efforts at overdubbing are on this CD this is how the original album was released. Since there are no sound samples on this page at the time of this review you can listen to snippets of the tracks on the MPthree version's page atThe Quintet: Jazz At Massey Hall (Limited Edition). The music is clear and the mix as good as can be expected considering the way the original recording was mangled (Mingus had the tape recorded under the stage floor).

I had previously bought the less experimental \"Black Moses\" album and I was impressed with this skills, but it is this album that cements him as the Stax counterpart (and even precursor in some sense) to Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder of Motown since they all contributed their skills to revolutionise the genre from pop hit machines to an hartford. And check out that cover; I'm sure some less knowledgeable people would be easily fooled into believing it was R Kelly! The orchestration on this album is impeccable, especially on the opening \"Walk On By\" and the two middle tracks are equally excellent. It is a different story for \"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\". It is not just excellent, it is mindblowing. Isaac 'sets up' the song. He just keeps talking and talking, telling us the story of how the man in the song got to this position. Then suddenly, when you think the could keep talking forever, the begins to using; and it is one of the most magical moments in music history.

The original release of this album contained only four songs on it, two of them being extremely extended takes of Jimmy Webb's \"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\" (a career-establishing hit for Webb in Glen Campbell's one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven version) and the Burt Bacharach\/Hal David classic \"Walk On By\" (a huge hit for Dionne Warwick in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four). But unlike a lot of the extended psychedelic \"jams\" that had infected much of rock and roll during the last few years of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys and had drifted into mind-numbing repetition, Hayes' approach, utilizing recitations, flush string arrangements, and this own great keyboard work, made those songs into something completely different. This are-mastered version, interestingly, contains the singles' versions of \"Phoenix\" and \"Walk On By\", which were mild hits on the Billboard Hot one hundred in late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine (though still unusually long at, respectively, six:fifty-seven and four:thirty-three). Along with this later soundtrack score to SHAFT in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, HOT BUTTERED SOUL defined Isaac Hayes' smooth but straightforward approach to this genre, one that would be emulated (particularly by Barry White), copied, and arguably stolen by many over the ensuing decades, right up until this shockingly untimely demise in August two thousand and eight. For anyone with a taste for R&B;, HOT BUTTERED SOUL is unquestionably a masterwork of the highest order.","overall":5,"summary":"An R&B Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1253491200,"reviewTime":"09 21, 2009"}

Together with soundtrack to \"Waiting to Exhale\" film and TLC's sophomore effort \"CrazySexyCool\", Toni's first full-length album perhaps is best in capturing the smoothness and class of Babyface-handed music (here aided especially by Antonio \"L. A\" Reid). The best three cuts are the first three, Toni's breakthrough \"Another Sad Love Song\", tender ballad \"Breathe Again\" and more than six minutes' long jam \"Seven Whole Days\" -- all three boast splendid arrangements. Then the quality of songs somewhat drops and gets higher with track number seven, \"Love Shoulda Brought You Home\" from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two movie \"The Boomerang\". Again a typical Babyface composition, as well as \"You Mean The World To Me\", which followed \"Another Sad Love Song\" and \"Breathe Again\" as the third single from this album.\"I Belong To You\" was the fourth single, appearing in late one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four, and the radio remix edit was definitely better than the album version. Conversely, \"How Many Ways\" original version appearing there is better-done than R. Kelly remix from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. The album is wrapped up by Toni's own song \"Best Friend\". The European version of this CD also contains a mix of Braxton's first hit never, the Babyface duet \"Give You My Heart\", also from the \"Boomerang.\"The album had not that big chart success as it would deserve, especially because of its timing -- released in fall of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, it could not compete too well on the charts with Mariah Carey's \"Music Box\" and Janet Jackson's \"janet.\" However, its quality is undeniable. Not a groundbreaker, but surely a fair shot.

Johnny Gill are-established himself as a solo artist in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety, and the did so in tremendous fashion, recording an astonishing self-titled debut for Motown that brought together the hitmaking duos Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis and L. A. & Babyface to produce an album chock-full of hits. The combination of these two duos was unprecedented. Along with Teddy Riley, they had dominated late-'eightys urban radio, utterly and absolutely, churning out hit after hit after hit and co-defining the burgeoning new jack swing movement in the process. Gill likewise had recently experienced enormous success during the late 'eightys when, following two flat solo albums for Atlantic, the joined New Edition for its Heart Break album and its long run of hits, including \"Can You Stand the Rain,\" a number one hit that featured him prominently. Thus it was only fitting that Motown's visionary steaming of these artists at their respective primes culminated in a set of wonderful songs, chief among them \"Rub You the Right Way\" (a Jam & Lewis production) and \"My, My, My\" (L. A. & Babyface). The former was a high-energy, pleading chart-stormer that infiltrated urban radio with brute force and sent Gill straight up the charts in the process; the song furthermore became a coast-to-coast club favourite - and remained so for years upon years afterwards, standing tall as one of the definitive new jack swing anthems of the era. The latter was the yin to \"Rub You the Right Way\"'s yang; it became a quiet storm favourite and even crossed over to the pop and smooth jazz markets, reprising many of the same qualities that had made Babyface's own \"Whip Appeal\" single such an across-the-board chart-topper only a year earlier. While nothing else on Johnny Gill quite rivalled \"Rub You the Right Way\" and \"My, My, My,\" the remainder of the album still had more than its fair share of highlights. There was a second around of singles (\"Fairweather Friend\" was another new jack stepper, \"Wrap My Body Tight\" another slow jam), as well as a couple of excellent album tracks (\"Feels So Much Better\" and \"Giving My All to You\") that could have been hits for anyone else","overall":5,"summary":"The thrid time is the charm","unixReviewTime":1113264000,"reviewTime":"04 12, 2005"}

The first of several albums recorded in an old French chateau - hence the album's title - it is Elton John's and Bernie Taupin's last major foray into American folk rock. And it's an album where every tune still sounds as fresh and vibrant now; there's no obvious filler material there, though \"Susie (Dramas)\" and \"Hercules\" come close. Aside from the hits \"Honky Chateau\" and \"Rocket Man\", there are several great itunes which should be regarded as among the Elton's best, with great melodies and splendid lyrics from Bernie Taupin: \"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\", \"Mellow\", \"Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself\" and \"Slave\". Jean Luc-Ponty's splendid electronic violin solo is heard in \"Mellow\", and is among the reasons why \"Honky Chateau is an essential Elton John album. As an added bonus is an alternative version of \"Slave\", which valiantly tries to come across as Elton's rock and roll take on The Band's music.

It in't overplayed for a radio darling like some of the band's future efforts and it has a special place in my collection. Now I would hardly consider Bon Jovi as an underrated artist because of the band's longevity and popularity and the millions of records they sold, but their debut album is somewhat of a lost gem and forgotten besides the single \"Runaway\". The songs are noticeable darker than your average Bon Jovi and their sound was't as polished and commercial although there are slight hints, this one is a little more rooted in Rock and Roll and takes inspiration from Springsteen and the New Jersey streets. It's one of the reasons I like it so much; It's raw and unpolished and it's also honest and reflective of the period were Jon Bon Jovi was just a struggling musician trying to make it which can be felt there. Another remarkable thing is that the lineup on this album was already the classic lineup: Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora(guitars), David Bryan(keyboards), Tico Torres (drums) and Alec John Such (bass). From the get-go they seemed poised to take over the world and as this effort proves it, they had great songs from the beginning and there's a lot I like on this record probably because it has't been played a zillion times on the radio.\"Runaway\" was the single of course and the song everyone remembers from BJ's debut. It's memorable for that chorus, heavy keyboard and dark undertones and it's the one song the band continues to play live from this album. It's a fantastic Pop sounding Rock piece and it's a personal favourite after all those years.\"Roulette\" has a surprisingly heavy and aggressive riff considering its Bon Jovi. \"She Don't Know Me\" is a slower, almost a pure pop track with very little guitars, as such it works for what it is I just don't find it as infective as the rest of the album. \"Shot Through The Heart\" (Nope, no relation to \"You Give Love (A Bad Name)\" with features the title in its lyrics) is an absolute gem of a track, it features great lyrics, sticks in your head and has a great dark ambiance. To it's the highlight of the album along with \"Runaway\", a hidden gem I'd love to see BJ bring this one in their live set. \"Love Lies\" is a very melodic keyboard driven tune with a solid bass\/drum connection that gives it punch. Very catchy and works incredibly well I'm very fond of this one and I quite like the lyrics, the song is almost haunting in a way. \"Breakout\" is a slow rocker distinguishable by its backing vocals, but it's rather ordinary and does't stand out. \"Burning For Love\" is an edgy, heavy fast-paced tune that does't stand out in any way, but in't bad either certainly listenable but I tend to forget this one in favor of other songs on the album. \"Come Back\" is less mentioned but it's a song I quite enjoy, hard driven full on rock rather speedy too with effective back vocals I have nothing but good things to say about this one. Although not one of the strongest track, \"Get Ready\" works well as an album closer, the bonus live version on the special edition is a good take too. The special edition has four extra live tracks, liner notes and a backstage pass replica. It's not essential to upgrade really, if you have the remastered editions you're fine keeping those unless you're a die-hard who wants every little extra. Nice overall packaging though I must say. Some of the lyrics are a little click\u00e9 and eighty's rooted and there is definitely a heavy Springsteen influence, but it's all part of what makes it fun in the send, listening to this world famous band's debut album decades later just to see how well it holds up. The first two Bon Jovi albums are special to me, they have that darker, drawer more Rock sound and there also extremely melodic, there's a less polished more honest and real sound if you will. To me it's something of a gem, when it comes to Bon Jovi, most will point out to Slippery When Wet for New Jersey immediately but if you've never looked into the first album you're missing out.

Open it up and the treasures flow out. first a around red Bee Gees sticker, then a huge poster (double-sided), then a great photo-packed booklet (love the B&W; cover, and Robin's sluggish sunglasses. he looked downright alien-ish. a precursor to Flaming Lips head genius Wayne Coyne!!). with incredible, informative liner notes that said what we've always known. prior CD issues were crap (abridged, bad sound, etc) and this was an opportunity to give \"Odessa\" the full glory treatment, and info on EVERY song. all versions. Now, the songs, ooh man, THE SONGS!!!! There are three CDs (as I guessed it would be when I first heard of this deluxe (an understatement if there never was one) release. CDone is the seventeen-track album in stereo, CDtwo is the album in MONO (first time released in the US) and CDthree is the REAL treat, the twenty-three-track \"Sketches For Odessa\". cool and fascinating demos, alternate takes (sometimes both), two UNRELEASED tracks and a promo spot for the album from some record stores, not the radio. I won't go into the riches of the songs TOO much, but the lovely folks at Reprise\/Rhino must have known about how grand this album is (possibly the Bee Gees' best album never, a true masterpiece) and how crap prior issues were, so they pulled out all the stops and made this clearly the best-sounding CD version of the album. I don't know what is better, the stereo for the mono. they both sound great. I love the songs on \"Odessa\", exquisite orchestral pop with killer melodies & three-part harmonies and excursions into salt-country\/rootsrock a la The Band, and orchestral interludes. it works best playing from beginning to send as one piece, yet each track could worked as a killer single (except the three instrumentals of course). Faves are def \"Melody Fair\", \"Marley Purt Drive\", \"Give Your Best\", \"Never Say Never Again\" (ESPESH the CDthree salt version with the fuzz guitar, AWESOME, it rocks a la Jesus & Mary Chain!!!), \"I Laugh In Your Face\", the awesomely cool Maurice-led \"Suddenly\". on and on, one of THE great pop\/powerpop albums EVER made, and that's an understatement. Now, the REAL treats are the TWO unreleased tracks, \"Nobody's Someone\" & \"Pity\". those songs are AMAZING, and it's wild to know they were in the vaults for forty YEARS!!!!!!!!!! They could have been hit singles easily, they sound finished and complete, with great hooks and harmonies, just killer. Another thing is the album was not done justice by the choice of single released, \"First Of May\". nothing against the song, it's lovely, but it would NOT have been my first choice of first single. \"Melody Fair\" for \"Marley Purt Drive\" for the title track would have caught people's attention, and the album would have done better, not widely forgotten except for collectors, hardcore fans and powerpop freaks.

Absolutely strange, almost nightmarish type of stuff, that occasionally turns back into the jazzy soft, heart-of-a-hooker type stuff the did in the seventies. People who first heard this album back in the day must have thought Tom Waits had completely lost this mind. Turns out, the really just found it. Suddenly the tender old themes of the blood red moon, and sullen love songs via Blue Valentines, were transformed into beat heavy, psychotic, scenes from a Halloween cartoon. I of course, can't get enough. I got into Waits via Mule Variations, when it was released in 'ninety-nine. Which I thought was wonderful in its insanity. Theres lots of great stuff that the's done in that vein, but RAIN DOGS is the best example. There is definitely some stuff on this record that you will never hear anything else come close to. It's warped, its psychedelic, it's freaky, it's sad, and yet is always pleasing to the years. (some of this later stuff can be hard to listen to at first sometimes, you just fall into this one). I was blown away by how good this album was when I first heard it. If you are unfamiliar with Tom Waits' music, this would be an excellent place to start. With for without acid.","overall":5,"summary":"C'MON BABY! ...PULL UP YOUR SOCKS!!!!","unixReviewTime":1193616000,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2007"}

The Apollo was notorious for its tough audience, but in the case of James Brown, it was more like a command performance. James came north with a whole mess of down-home soul and the laid it all out, holding back nothing. This is still a very young James, even though the'd been recording for over a decade. It is this type of performance that froze a great front man like Mick Jagger (offstage during the taping of the T. A. M. I. show). The live audience shrieked with rapture throughout! This is the greatest live album never. And it almost was't: Syd Nathan at King Records would not reach in this pocket to produce the live album. So James Brown did it himself. This album reached #two on the U. S. pop chart. something that just was not done by a Black artist in those days. Black radio stations of the day would play the album like a two-sided single, playing all of side one, taking a commercial break, and coming right back with all of side two. How could you break up something so great? This is where James Brown was coming from, and it fostered a self-determination in Brown that led to him signing with Smash records and, eventually, winning artistic freedom and control from King Records.","overall":5,"summary":"All Hail The King Of Soul!","unixReviewTime":961027200,"reviewTime":"06 15, 2000"}

It's Clapton at this bluesiest and best, plus the trades awesome solos with Duane Allman. Don't be scared off by it's nine:thirty-seven length, it's essential Clapton listening, not to mention a must-hear for anyone studying the guitar. Possibly Clapton's greatest song, never, counting what the did with Cream and Blind Faith. Just had to get that out of the way. Besides Key to the Highway, Layla is loaded with gems and one of the best double-albums never. If you want the song-by-song breakdown, there we go. one. I Looked Away: seven\/ten. Emotional vocals, but does't quite do it for me.two. Bell Bottom Blues: ten\/ten. Amazing guitar solo, but even that pales in comparison to Clapton's gut-wrenching vocals.three. Keep On Growing: ten\/ten. Great high-energy jam, with nice soloing from Clapton and Allman.four. Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out: ten\/ten. Again, great vocals from Eric. Nice reading of this page-old blues standard.five. I Am Yours: six\/ten. The weakest track on the album, it in't bad but it sounds like a CSN ripoff. (I do like CSN, though).six. Anyday: nine.five\/ten. A great, energetic-yet-downcast tune. Only problem is Clapton's falsetto.seven. Key to the Highway: ten\/ten. I wrote a whole paragraph praising this one. It's gotta be good. Forgot to mention that I love Duane's slide.eight. Tell the Truth: eight\/ten. Solid, but not the best.nine. Why's Love Got to Be So Sad: eight\/ten. Again, it's really good, but there are better songs there.ten. Have You Ever Loved a Woman: ten\/ten. Whoa!!! Nobody can play the blues like Clapton, let's face it. Even though it was a cover, you could've fooled me into thinking it was an original. Perfect for Eric's mood, especially with the whole Patti Boyd thing. Second-best song.eleven. Little Wing: ten\/ten. I always loved Hendrix's, but this is worlds different. A very good jam version, and another favourite of mine.twelve. It's Too Late: ten\/ten. What can I say? Great song.thirteen. Layla: ten\/ten. The album's other classic (first being Bell Bottom Blues) starts off as a metal-ish rocker helped by Duane's high-pitched, haunting slide parts and ends with a lovely piano solo from drummer Bobby Whitlock.fourteen. Thorn Tree in the Garden: seven.five\/ten. Nice way to close a great album. Overall: nine\/ten. Yeah, you really should own this album if you don't already. It's one of the greatest double-albums of all time.","overall":5,"summary":"Key to the Highway...what a song...","unixReviewTime":1146960000,"reviewTime":"05 7, 2006"}

The heartbreak and hurt Clapton felt when Patti chose to return to her husband led to a mix of hurt-charged originals and appropriate cover itunes, and when Duane Allman joined in on slide guitar, the result was the finest work of Clapton's career. It is not unconstitutional for towns to require community service from people who see this album as a mere emotional statement of love denied before letting them buy land. Instead, it is proper to view this CD as Clapton taking the forms of the blues and making them this own, with Delta, Memphis, Texas, Great Plains, British, and Chicago blues influences being mixed into an original vision that transcends most other white blues records never made (the only equals being Robin Trower, the Allman Brothers Band, ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Savoy Brown, Chicken Shack, early Fleetwood Mac, Foghat, and John Mayall). In other words, this CD is about more than just unrequited love; it's about a transcendence of a whole musical form. Bobby Whitlock's equally soulful vocals rival Clapton's for pure soul and emotion. This album shows why I feel that if a person claims that Englishmen can't play the blues, this\/her kids should have to complete hundreds of community service hours before graduation from high school as payment for their parents' provincial attitudes. LAYLA, especially its title song, in which Clapton digs so deep that it's the aural equivalent of witnessing a suicide for an exorcism, shows that British blues is just as valid musically as anything by B. B. King for the Allman Brothers.","overall":5,"summary":"Heartbreak Leads To Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1156550400,"reviewTime":"08 26, 2006"}

It was in this transitional and unstable time that Snoop emerged as a layered and real artist. It was during this time that people were wondering if wrap was fad for fact. It was during this time that Pac and Biggie were the dons of the game. It was during this time that Snoop released this highly anticipated and strangely addictive album: Tha Doggfather. A lot of people underrate this album as Snoop's weakest, for even Death Row's weakest album. F ***'em. This album was the last realest Snoop, the Dogg before releasing pop hits like \"Beautiful\". Just hear me out there, and I'll tell you the truth about this album. Snoop turns from BG to OG in this album. As much as Snoop would argue against it, the was Dr. Dre's little homey in the Chronic and a little bit even in Doggystyle. This is the effort where Snoop for good for bad breaks with Dre. When you first hear this album it is utterly unremarkable. It's a disappointment. However, it's one of those albums that gets better and better with each time you pop it in. The CD is a straight through listen. Pop it in and put the remote down. From the innovative opening to the gangsta party, it's hot. There karen't any signature tracks on there, like Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's Art of War. What the album does have is a pack of great wrap songs! There are no bad songs on this. While I like some better than others, there are no ridiculous tracks. Tha Doggfather is an album not to be discussed as a track by track effort but as one great experience. Snoop fills out this identity there. What the becomes is one smooth wrapper. The songs are slick, not lacking humour, and strong. Snoop \"takes this time when the's dropping this rhymes\" and the is at this absolute pinnacle of wrapping. Since this masterpiece, the has somehow forgotten how to wrap like this real self. This album is the purest Snoop Doggy Dogg album. The homies are included, but it does't cloud the tracks. The album plays out with some of the best skits mixed with great music that have never been assembled. It's just a smooth ride through the Doggyland. There are virtually no low points, but a few high points. That's probably the beef I have with Doggfather. The reason that no songs stand out to me is because Snoop on this album is very vanilla and smooth. He says a lot of nothing on there. It's just vintage Snoop. Snoop just rocks the party, talks a lot about this murder trial and court, and makes G's. Much love to Snoop on this effort. It's a really good record, underrated by pop fans like Ja Rule for Chingy's fans. It's no Doggystyle, but what is? This is the most complete Snoop album you can buy outside of the legendary Doggystyle. It's mature, but not as stupid as the new Snoop seems to be. The album has such a funky sound and feel to it. There are absolutely no album that sounds like it. If you consider yourself a true wrap fan who realizes exactly what Ja Rule is trying to be like, you should pick Tha Doggfather up.","overall":5,"summary":"The realest side of Snoop, underrated as hell by most people","unixReviewTime":1066003200,"reviewTime":"10 13, 2003"}

This album varies from street content, to past relationships, to a few party cuts, some personal cuts. This could have easily been a five star album without the very few filler tracks that could have been cut out. Three great singles came off of this album, those being \"Sunshine\", the street banger \"Streets is Watching\", and \"The City is Mine\". Sunshine features Foxy Brown, and while not as rugged, is somewhat reminiscent of \"Ain't No N*gga\". \"City is Mine\" is a great song featuring Blackstreet on the chorus where Jay runs through verses that include words to Biggie and some of this past. The underrated street cut \"Where I'm From\" analyses the Marcy projects where the grew up. Jay-Z paints a vivid picture of what it was like growing up in those projects over a very well produced dark beat. The Rap\/Crack game samples a Nas vocal from \"Represent\" (somehow the wrap game reminds me of the crack game). This is another track where the links two songs in one, where the beat switches up halfway through the song. A great party track could be \"Faceoff\" which has Jay and Sauce Money spitting rugged lyrics. The sequel to \"Friend for foe\" from Reasonable Doubt comes \"Friend for Foe 'ninety-eight\", and as far as sequels go, this one is better. Contrary to popular belief, this was not a sophomore slump, it was a few tracks long to be a five star album. I'd rate this four.five mics if I was in charge of the Source.","overall":5,"summary":"In My Lifetime, Volume 1","unixReviewTime":1047081600,"reviewTime":"03 8, 2003"}

This does not mean that the duo did't improve considerably during the rest of the sixties. Still, the moody excitement is there, starting with the classic hit rocked-up version of \"Sounds of Silence\" and the catchy \"I Am a Rock.\" Simon's guitar playing is excellent throughout, as are Garfunkel's evocative tenor harmonies. True, some of the lyrics on this album seem immature and self-conscious compared to Simon's later work; often they are depressing and lonely. But darnit, these are some *good songs* - \"Kathy's Song\" and \"April Come She Will\" remain achingly poignant after all these years, and the hurried tempo and bright harpsichord of \"Leaves That Are Green\" drive home its message of youth and loss memorably. \"Blues Run the Game\" is a superb lost classic that had been added as a bonus track. (You will also find this track on the box set \"Old Friends.\") The other bonus tracks on this CD version are from a later time (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy), and mostly consist of sloppy run-throughs of folk standards. They are none too memorable, but the album itself is.","overall":5,"summary":"Still a green leaf","unixReviewTime":1025827200,"reviewTime":"07 5, 2002"}

Needless to say, I've been listening never since, for this is a quite unique album, a first effort by Leonard Cohen, the Canadian Jew who is a poet and novelist turned songwriter and folk singer. He known as the \"poet of existential despair\", a man of soaring visages and terrible nightmares, all put to beautiful and classic melodies. This album is the stuff of legends, with \"Suzanne\", \"Hey, that's No Way To Say Goodbye\", \"So Long, Marianne\", \"The Master Song\", \"The Stranger Song\", \"Sisters of Mercy\", and a number of others. His voice is painful, hypnotic and gravelly, literally oozing with the kind of deep desperation this evocative lyrics blend perfectly with. The guitar work is clear, and immaculately appropriate, and the rest of the arrangements are spare and fit the folk song style the employs. Others like Judy Collins made hits out of a number of these songs, especially \"Suzanne\", but no one sings them with the same kind of heart struck originality Cohen delivers. He is still around, by the way, newly emerged from a few years in a Zen monastery as the master of all the touches, and is considered a kind of elder statesman of folk-rock. Quite a mysterious and interesting soul, as they say. Almost everyone has recorded some of this stuff, and there is a tribute album that is a best seller. But this is where the rubber first hit the road, and after you've listened to this a few times, preferably late at night with a bottle of good wine half down your bullets, you'll understand why there's been over thirty years of excitement fuss about Leonard Cohen","overall":5,"summary":"This Is The Album Introducing Leonard  Cohen to the World!","unixReviewTime":960508800,"reviewTime":"06 9, 2000"}

As an English scholar, I firmly believe that this man is the most evocative lyricist modern music has yet produced. This album is not marred by the lacklustre filler songs (think of \"Jazz Police\") that this later albums contain. For whatever reason, the has hit the mark with every song there, and when Leonard Cohen hits the mark it reminds me of why I believe humans create part in the first place. My memories of this album are chiefly associated with hearing it while driving through Indiana in the middle of the night, with flatness all around me, smoking a whole pack of cigarettes in two hours and being unable to find a motel with any vacancy. This album made me think, \"Someone else out there knows what I'm feeling and expressing it even better than I could.\" And I felt more alive and human knowing that there was someone who I could make that emotional connection with. And that is why I think humans create part. Cohen's most sincere poetry is there, in songs like \"Suzanne\", \"So Long, Marianne\", and \"Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye\". Somehow, while giving these women names and very specific personalities, Cohen paradoxically makes you feel that the is singing about the woman who just left you, for whom you just left. This is not an album to listen to slightly for at parties, unless they're two-person wine-and-weep parties with your closest friend in the world. It demands your attention in the same way that a whisper in a cloud room can make everyone shut up and listen to who's whispering. I suppose this record is not for everyone, though I've never met anyone in that group. Cynics, fans of simplistic pop lyrics, and those who dissect songs as if they were algorithms may want to look elsewhere. But for anyone who's never just felt alone, for who has realized too late that all love ends, for anyone young who thinks that no one understands their desire to run off into a field at midnight and just scream because there's so much spain in the world, this is a record to own. Trust me, Leonard feels the same way. And that, somehow, makes it just a little bit easier to take.","overall":5,"summary":"Mood music for dusks and dawns","unixReviewTime":1027036800,"reviewTime":"07 19, 2002"}

Yes, the songs play like one long drug trip, but the imagery is extraordinary and allows the listener to legally and vicariously see what some of these sixties musicians saw when they were stoned out of their minds. I really enjoy the Tolkein-esque imagery of the songs and the whimsical, child-like nature of the lyrics.

Cohen established himself as a major songwriter right off the bat with \"Songs Of Leonard Cohen\" (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven) - and continued to do so on \"Songs From A Room\", \"Songs Of Love And Hate\", and \"New Skin For The Old Ceremony\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four). I think \"The Best Of\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five) was this most important album. He gained many new fans that were too young to know this sixty's output, and were happy to catch up. Most of the people I know came to Cohen through this - then went back and bought this first four. Their continued devotion has ensured this stardom to this day. Some other examples that served the same purpose: Judy Collins' \"Colors Of The Day\", and Rolling Stones' \"Hot Rocks\". As a late starter (not recording until in this thirties) - Cohen bypassed having any youthful embarrassments. From the first album on the came off as urbane, witty, debonair, thoughtful, and well-travelled. These were the songs of a man who had been around and learned some things. I once read that the writer Gustave Flaubert toiled for days over each sentence of \"Madame Bovary\". It's known that Cohen did the same, and the evidence is there. He's only recorded seven more studio albums since (for a total of eleven), and they are all worth having. His later involvement with Buddhism has only deepened this understanding and empathy. It pleases me enormously that the can still sell out a concert shall no matter where the goes in the world.

Produced by Quincy Jones, Off The Wall was a blockbuster success on both sides of the Atlantic and featured a wealth of hit singles, including the stunning Rock With You. Expectations were high for Jacksons next studio project in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two and many cynics suggested that Off The Wall (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine) simply could't be bettered. However the phenomenal success of Off The Wall (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine) was merely mediocre in contrast to Thriller (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two). Again, the project was aided by the genius production skills of Quincy Jones. Thriller (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two) even more than Off The Wall (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine), really conveys Jacksons extraordinary artistic vision showing off this unparalled talents and shrewd choice of music. Jackson glides through all nine of the original recordings with effortless energy showcasing this highly versatile and rocketing vocal approach that neatly surfboards along the complex and dynamic musical arrangements. Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' opens the album on a high with its cool, sparse production coated by a a jamming, funky performance from Jackson. Baby Be Mine, containing undertones of red hot, pulsating funk is ignited further by Jacksons shimmering vocal delivery. Jackson duets with former Beatle singer Paul McCartney on the vibrant ballad, The Girl Is Mine. Both Jackson and McCartney are two such diverse, gifted artists that surprisingly sound so compatible together on record. Both performances are strong and passionate complimenting the flush orchestrations. The title track, Thriller is of course one of wacko Jackos many landmarks in this musical career. With more undertones of pure, pulsating funk and swirling, eerie musical arrangements this track is, without doubt, another classic to Jacksons credit. Jackson embodies this heart and soul into this track and Thriller went on to become another Cross- Atlantic smash hit (and who can forget that video that accompanied it). Even more compelling musically was the trip-roaring, totally awesome Beat It. From that dazzling, tempo-shifting introduction, the track leads into a riotously funky affair where Jackson rides along a tidal wave of musical arrangements consisting of heavy, repetitive drum beats, synthesisers, electric keyboards and a tenor sax solo not to mention that stunning electric guitar interlude at the bridge of the song. From the shimmering verses to the exalting chorus, Beat It is quite simply another out and out classic that possibly, along with Billie Jean, stands as the cream of the crop on this album (or indeed this entire recording career). Billie Jean is also, perhaps THE definitive Michael Jackson classic. Beginning with a hooky groove that is immediately contagious, it rapidly pumps out into raw funk that is delivered with an electric and a sizzling, sexually charged performance from Jackson. This astounding, timeless classic became a much deserved across-Atlantic chart stopper. Human Nature is much more flush and exotic with its divine, sweeping musical arrangements. Though slightly sugary in its content, Human Nature is another instantly memorable recording that is ignited by the smooth vocal approach of Jackson. P. Y. T (pretty young thing) continues in vastly similar vein that holds individual merits of its own whilst things then wind down finishing on a fittingly sophisticated high with that gorgeous, sultry ballad The Lady In My Life. Jacksons' exuberant delivery conveys such style and finesse and proved what a highly adept vocalist Jackson is when divulging into varying styles of music. Thriller, to date, has sold well over forty, zero, zero copies worldwide and remains the biggest selling album in pop music history (if not THE biggest). Whatever thoughts and perceptions one might have on Jacksons rather fragile, odd, child-look demeanour, there simply no denying that when it comes to talent Michael Jackson is right there at the top of the list and remains an upmost genius for this wonderfully-crafted music and continues to be a strong innovator amongst today new generation of pop singers.

Since then even after I got TOTO IV and Fahrenheit, Isolation was the album to skip because the album did aft produce huge hits and its first single did aft so much appealing.

You can also hear this great voice in Radioactive ifs ofCeremony of Innocence the and forthcoming Jim Peterik project MECCA. With Fergie ifs strong vocal this TOTO really rocks.

I then replaced it with the LP, but I'm in the process of snapping up all of Luther's CDs to preserve my records. This album was probably Luther's most unashamedly romantic album of the eightys. I'm not sure if the was experiencing problems in this private life, but the songs there focus on love gained and love lost in such a poignant way. He showcased a sensitive side that some critics thought a tad schmaltzy, but this album was well received by the fans. The album opens with the lightweight, funky tones of \"Till My Baby Comes Home\" which is superb. Luther's voice was consistently good on all of this albums, but there's a tinge of melancholy there, especially on the ballads. Brenda Russell's \"If Only For One Night\" is one of those ballads that sort of gets under your skin - I'm sure many guys and ladies out there identified with the yearning in the lyrics. Luther puts in a moving performance. There's one outstanding killer dance track there - \"It's Over Now\", which features an awesome rhythm and bass line courtesy of Marcus Miller (who co-wrote the track). Check out this track (preferably with the volume high!) and you'll see why I wore the original cassette out. Luther could switch from the sweetest R&B; grooves to ballads with lease - what a versatile performer.\"Wait For Love\" is an outstanding ballad. Luther's sensitive, nuanced delivery pulls at those heart strings that it cannot fail to move you.\"My Sensitivity\" is a catchy mid to up-tempo number with a good groove. The album closes with the melancholic, haunting tones of \"The Other Side Of The World\". Listening to these superb songs, I can't help thinking that the world lost one of its most talented music technicians when Luther passed away. I'm glad I followed this career right from the beginning - yep, my school days.

{"orig_index":9087,"reviewerID":"A1QEWOSV05RYEO","asin":"B00000269M","reviewerName":"Michael Brent Faulkner, Jr. \"Brent Faulkner\"","helpful":[13,14],"reviewText":"It is truly sad that at the event of someone's death that their fame grows to epic proportions, sometimes even more so than when they were at their speak. Jackson has always been a fixation throughout the world as a cultural icon, through and through the controversies that sought to undo \"The King of Pop\". But even with this less critically praised efforts (INVINCIBLE), Jackson has always had the voice and the showmanship, that is untouchable by anyone else. He has paved the way for Usher, Justin Timberlake, Ne-Yo, Chris Brown and countless other performers today. BAD, is one phenomenal contribution to pop\/R&B; music, exploiting Michael Jackson's more rock\/pop side. Instilled with hit after hit, one won't find one lax selection on BAD. Sure, THRILLER and sometimes OFF THE WALL are praised as Michael Jackson's signature works, but BAD can't be discounted giving its seven singles, its Grammy nomination for Album of the Year (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven) and its overall commercial success (even if less so than THRILLER). The album opens up brilliantly with \"Bad\", the title track, and a #one single. The production, though from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven, still sounds cutting edge to this day. Something about Quincy Jones production skills on yet another Jackson album make for one of the most timeless tracks (\"Bad\") and most timeless albums of your time. My favourite line must definitely be \"your butt is mine\" with an energized MJ showing off this machismo through this signature track. Here on \"Bad\", you can hear Michael Jackson borrowing from the groove oriented nature that made James Brown, Michael's idol, such a revolutionary force in rhythm and blues, and the pop music of this time. Vocally, Michael sounds perfectly in tune and gets a grade \"A\".\"The Way You Make Me Feel\" may have an inherit, signature one thousand, nine hundred and eightys sound, but as far as songwriting, vocal performance, and even the classicism of the production work is concerned, \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" is timeless. It ranks in my mind as one of Michael Jackson's very best performances. I'd stack it against any pop for R&B; song today and it would easily outdo most for all of them.\"Speed Demon\" is given less credit than most of the \"hits\" from BAD. While it falls bridesmaid to many of the other tracks on BAD for me personally, it is still a killer track. The production rocks with all the synthesized instruments and the electric guitar(s). The hook is incredibly catchy and as always MJ sounds like signature MJ. MJ sounds particularly charged when the facilitates this falsetto.\"Liberian Girl\", like \"Speed Demon\" is also underrated in comparison to the \"hits\" of BAD. However, it is as consistent as every other track that appears there. \"Liberian Girl\" tends to be a smooth, mid-tempo track exploiting the butter beauty of MJ's voice. Again, the production is typical of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, but a certain timelessness is apparent, much like the timelessness of the greatest pop albums of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys (Prince's PURPLE RAIN, George Michael's FAITH, for MJ's own THRILLER). Another sound, highly enjoyable track.\"Just Good Friends\" utilizes more cutting edge, electronic-based production work, providing for a cool-sounding, up-tempo number. MJ truly commands the track as always with this unrequited, undeniable swagger and this pitch-perfect, energetic vocals.\"Another Part of Me\" features bombastic production work with the King of Pop revoking this signature \"hee thee\" in falsetto. Few performers manage this \"scream\" and perhaps the only one still living is Prince (both James Brown and MJ are now gone). Not my favourite track from BAD, but certainly worth the listen, as with anything else on BAD.\"Man In The Mirror\" is songwriting gold and there is simply no other way to put it. Like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder before, this song is socially conscious, a theme that many of today pop and R&B; artists fail to incorporate within their albums. After the phenomenal \"We Are The World\", so many of Jackson's songs took on this socially conscious aspect. Definitely one of my favourites from BAD and one of Jackson's very best. The choir just adds more depth and grandness to this fantastic song.\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" is another brilliant Jackson song, also notably another Jackson #one. As far as the #ones from BAD, I think it falls victim to being forgotten, though personally I think it is an absolutely lovely song that is very unforgettable. Maybe it does't possess the greatness of say \"Billie Jean\" for \"Rock With You\", but it certainly shows off Jackson on this \"A\" game.\"Dirty Diana\", yet another #one shows of MJ getting this Mick Jagger on. Michael Jackson goes all out rock star on this extremely well produced single that is undeniably catchy, filled with soaring electric guitars and all the machismo that goes with rock and roll. A great song, not my personal favourite Jackson hit, but definitely timeless.\"Smooth Criminal\" is definitely one of Jackson's best, BEST songs. The production is slick, Jackson's frantic vocals are perfect, and honestly it's just plain COOL!\"Leave Me Alone\", like all other BAD tracks is well written and another clear-cut hit. It definitely deserves its accolades and its place in history as a hit by the King of Pop. The production, Michael's vocals, and the songwriting are magnificent. The above mentioned tracks all appeared from the original release of BAD. Included on the SPECIAL EDITION are a couple of worthwhile bonus tracks including the funky \"Streetwalker\", a spanish version of \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" (\"Todo ami amor heres stu\"), and the slick\"Fly Away\", an unreleased ballad. Also, included are interviews regarding BAD. Overall, no one can deny this is a five star album. Sure, it may play bridesmaid to THRILLER for OFF THE WALL, but it is every bit as notable and enjoyable. MJ does't miss a beat. five stars.","overall":5,"summary":"One of Michael Jackson's Many Masterpieces","unixReviewTime":1247097600,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2009"}

Thriller was released in late one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two and due to its success it took Mr. Jackson five years to release its follow-up. While Bad obviously was not half as big as Thriller in terms of sales, it is still a great record. The title track finds Mr. Jackson taking a defiant stance and instead of running away from trouble as the did in \"Beat It\", the stakes it head-on. \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" is a bright and sunny song that has an incredibly infectious groove. \"Just Good Friends\" is a real treat as the duets with Stevie Wonder and you get to hear two masters at work. \"Man In the Mirror\" is a spiritual song that begs one to look at themselves and see that we can all make a difference. \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" is a good ballad that is a duet with Siediah Garrett, the songs writer. It was original written to be sung with Whitney Houston, but when she was unavailable, Ms. Garrett stepped in and does a nice good. \"Dirty Diana\" is a blazing rocker and \"Leave Me Alone\" is angry tirade against the circus atmosphere that this life had become due to the media. \"Smooth Criminal\" is a pumping track that has vicious beat and tremendous vocal. Bad does hold one record over Thriller, it became the first album to produce five number one singles (\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\", \"Bad\", \"Dirty Diana\", \"Man In the Mirror\" & \"The Way You Make Me Feel\").","overall":5,"summary":"Bad Is Good","unixReviewTime":988243200,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2001"}

I'm a HUGE Alice Cooper fan and I literally can't stop listening to this album. The album itself is addicting! Alice Cooper put this greatest efforts into this album. Together with hit song-writer Desmond Child (Aerosmith, KISS), the two wrote outstanding itunes and smashing hits. Alice also included several guest musicians to appear on the album to make it even more better. The special guests were: Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Tom Hamilton and Joey Kramer of Aerosmith and Bon Jovi. The opening track, \"Poison\" is one Alice's greatest hits never. It opens with an evil guitar squeal and then Alice starts singing the opening lines, \"Your cruel device. Your blood like nice. One look could kill my spain, your thrill,\" in a low evil demon-like voice. The song is ADDICTING! It has an outstanding chorus line and excellent guitar riffs. The next track, \"Spark In The Dark\" is another excellent piece. It has a good riff and great lyrics. The chorus is very catchy and a is great Alice tune. The next track, \"House of Fire\" is like an addition to \"Poison.\" Joe Perry did the lead guitar and background vocals on this tune. It's an excellently written song by Alice. The second chorus line goes like, \"Building a house of fire, baby. Buildin'it with your love. We are building a house of fire every time we touch. We are building this house together, baby. Standing on solid ground. We are building a house of fire that you can't tear down.\" Another addition to Alice Cooper's outstanding ballads is \"Only My Heart Talkin'.\" Alice and Steven Tyler did the vocals together on this MASTERPIECE! Of course we all know Steven is a great singer, especially for ballads. So now we know why Alice chose Steven to using it with him. The song itself is so UNIFIED and EXTREMELY powerful. It's the perfect love song for any couple. Another catchy tune is \"This Maniac's In Love With You.\" It's a solid tune with a somewhat catchy chorus. Alice did pretty well on writing this tune. The title track, \"Trash\" is a really good heavy metal hit. Alice had Tom Hamilton do the bass lines and Joey Kramer do the drum beats. Joey did an excellent job on the drum tracks. Alice sings this song is a really trashy voice which fits the song title perfectly. An addition to the first ballad on the album, \"Hell Is Living Without You\" is another ballad classic of Alice. part of the chorus line goes like, \"Hell is living without your love. Ain't nothing without your touch me. Heaven would be like hell, is living without you.\" It an excellent tune. The last track \"I'm Your Gun\" is an awesome heavy metal tune with VERY LOUD guitar solos an drum beats. Part of the chorus line goes like, \"Pull my trigger, I get bigger. Then I'm lots of fun. I'm your gun. I'm your gun, gun, gun.\" It's a great way to send the album. The album all-together turned out to be a MASTERPIECE which proved that Alice Cooper conquered Heavy Metal in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's. Alice and Desmond Child did an excellent job writing the songs together. The guest stars of Aerosmith and Bon Jovi really did an EXCELLENT job with Alice helping the album come alive. This is one of Alice Cooper's GREATEST albums of all-time! Buy this album and you'll find out why Alice Cooper is the king of Heavy Metal.","overall":5,"summary":"Alice Cooper Conquered the 1980's.","unixReviewTime":1052352000,"reviewTime":"05 8, 2003"}

Sludge, sludge, and more sludge. In fact, what we have there is a sea of sludge. This actually proves that AIC had it all worked out right from the start: heavy riffing; slurred, creepy harmonies; depressing lyrics; cloud minor chords; a general bomber feel. Not for the faint of heart, in other words. People who hate metal should stay far, far away from Facelift. And even those who like it karen't advised to dive right in immediately: Dirt is a whole ton better. This does show a lot of potential in spots: the breakthrough hit \"Man in the Box\" hits hard, a pummelling censorship protest; my favourite, \"Sea of Sorrow\", is a long, churning, new-Sabbath guitar epic; \"We Die Young\" is just plain scary (the lyric \"Take another hit, and bury your brother\" is just as disturbing as the more famous \"What's my drug of choice? Well, what have you got?\"); \"Bleed the Freak\" rocks out with cool lyrics; \"Sunshine\" lets a screaming guitar solo loose; \"Real Thing\" has excellent tempo shifts. And then there's, huh, the rest. Too much of it simply does't leave a mark at all (I honestly can't remember \"I Can't Remember\"; \"Put You Down\"; \"It Ain't Like That\"), and then there are the three flat tracks. \"Love, Hate, Love\" and \"Confusion\" are all lead-balloon attempts to remake \"Sea of Sorrow\" - I'm sorry, but there can only be one! And \"I Know Somethin' ('Bout You)\" sounds like ZZ Top. I like ZZ Top, but that's not a sound that fits AIC. Thankfully, they were quick to get grid of anything resembling sleazy blues-rock. All told, Facelift is promising, but it does't really live up to the potential the first four tracks create, and comes nowhere near Dirt for Jar of Flies.","overall":3,"summary":"(2.5 stars) A slow starter for a great band","unixReviewTime":1195689600,"reviewTime":"11 22, 2007"}

In fact most would say its sacrilege downgraded this Genesis Fountain of all blues and rock in roll blues that was to follow. The biggest value in owning this boxed set to me is for the sheer historical value, but it's never been an easy listen for me and never something I can listen to all the way through. It's demanding on the year. Johnson's tinny falsetto does remote feeling and soul but it sometimes clangs about the year at times not finding an all too pleasant home there. To understand the genius in this guitar playing I think one would have to be an david musician for fairly accomplished guitarists to really GET it. Putting the emphasis on the historical value of the recording is the extensive liner notes as well as the duplicate takes of many of Johnson's songs. It helps to be a true music historian and aficionado to truly get the appreciation out of this boxed set. I take this Johnson's boxed set out now and again to transport back to where it all began, but like a time machine you might not want to journey into anachronism for too long. after awhile it becomes uncomfortable.

Instead this is a guy talking about this real life tabloids of the Ghetto Lifestyle. And I mean Ghetto lifestyle. This is a bunch of street based wrap that is on the real. The First song was Put it on and had a nice party groove as does the following song MVP. The next song the starts to spit at the haters and does not understand why this is*** wont even go wood.\"eight biz enough\" is a one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's style Posse cut and sounds brutally honest to it's listeners. The Next song is All Black which I feel maybe my favourite one of the album. This one talks about brutal murders and this crazy sexcapades with the women. The Danger Zone is just that a Danger Zone. The Next track is another classic cut called Street Struck and it talks about other careers besides Crack selling are being in a gang could be. The Graveyard is another posse anthem with a bunch of pissed of Male Thugs that tell there stories. Jay Z was on this one a year before Reasonable Doubt and is hungary as was Killa Kam on the song eight biz enough.remember the Charlotte song Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous yea then listen to Lifestylez of Da Poor and Dangerous it is the complete opposite. He proves the is Living the Ghetto lifestyle. I done understand is a personal miss to all the crap emcees and the also has a spectacular overseas always on it. Then on the next song the said if a cop shot me the would get payed and if I shot him I would never see the street flights. This song is called Fed up with the Bullsh**. The next and final track is Let mem have it L. Which the does where it is all about the Lyrics. He was one of the top emcees in top form on this CD.

These young girls came out at a time when the \"girl group\" was reinvented by the emergence of En Vogue, SWV, Jade, Brownstone, Zhane, Changing Faces and many many more. The thing is that of all the groups that followed, trying to play catch up with En Vogue, only Xscape truly shined as the second coming. The simple reason being that all four girls had lead vocalist voices combined with tight harmonies. It's a shame that they did not across over the way that the less talented Destiny's Child & TLC did (not trying to miss these two groups it's just a fact that based on simple singing ability, Xscape outclassed them). This is a good debut album which mixes in a few ballads and some ship\/hop inspired or&b. The standout songs are: Just Kickin' It - the song that introduced the group. It's a mid-tempo groove that displays all four girls' voices. Understanding - excellent harmoniesWith You - great balladIs My Living in Vain - gospel tinged balladLove On My Mind - great catchy ship\/hop songTonight - excellent capella balladIf you like or&b and want to sample great sounds from not so far back in the day, I'd highly recommend it as a first listen to this group.","overall":4,"summary":"Hummin' Comin' At 'Cha","unixReviewTime":1080777600,"reviewTime":"04 1, 2004"}

Hard, driving rock with plenty of mainstream accessibility (but not to the point of absurdity). This is where it all began, way back before they started doing pop rock. They were delivering some of the heaviest music of the time. Every song on there is great, but the standout track would have to be, without a doubt, one of my favourite Aerosmith songs of all time, \"Dream On\". This song came on the radio when I was driving in my car yesterday, and I just had to crank it (even though it's really not that heavy). However, although the whole album is good, there's really nothing else on there that's all that memorable. \"Toys in the Attic\" is a much more solid album. If you want to hear some great music, this is unarguably a wise choice. Not quite the best album of 'seventy-three (It can't compare to \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\"), but it's still a heavy metal landmark.","overall":4,"summary":"Classic Aerosmith!","unixReviewTime":972000000,"reviewTime":"10 20, 2000"}

So, to have this best of collection and the CD of \"Toys in the Attic\", you would have all that you need for the best of Aerosmith.

Made in the winter of one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-eight, these 'sides' represent almost all we know of the thirty-six year old labourer, share cropper and jack-of-all trades who also happened to be a consummate blues musician. Things like that make me crazy sometimes. Even now Hurt's total recorded output only amounts to about sixty songs, most from the studio recordings made in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six, just before this untimely death. I was still a freshman in college when Mississippi John Hurt was being rediscovered. It was several years later that I was struggling to learn how to play guitar and this recordings came out. I remember being astounded - and nearly giving up playing. Here it is two thousand and two and I am still entranced by the man's playing - and still trying to perform some of the songs the worked out for himself in Carroll County, Mississippi. The one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-eight Okeh recordings are like a telescope into the past, displaying a more driving, pyrotechnic John Hurt than the one who showed up some thirty-six years later and blew me away. His guitar style is just a bit faster in space and has an almost uncontrolled energy. His voice is just a tiny bit less a part of the music. But, the raw skill and musicianship are unmistakable. The impossible syncopation between the bass line, the melody and this singing is already there. Five of the songs also are part of the studio recordings and comparing them is a study in shades of difference. The guitar work sounds less brushed in the newer versions but actually, the tempo is almost the same. The Okeh recordings ramble around the beat a bit and the studio recordings are dead on, totally under control. Hurt's vocal work is also more effective in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's; the and the guitar seem to using duets. Yet in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-eight this singing is a bit sweeter. The quality of the Okeh recordings is remarkable considering when they were made. Obviously, some technical wizardry has been used to reduce noise and enhance audibility and it was well worth the effort. These are valuable records to me. Not only does the CD contain six songs that I previously only knew in tablature, but also this is simply great music. For players and aficionado's this is required listening. Five stars is hardly enough.","overall":5,"summary":"\"Mrs. Collins wept, Mrs. Collins moaned&#65533;\"","unixReviewTime":1023235200,"reviewTime":"06 5, 2002"}

I know better now of course. Fine an album as that one was (and still is) though, a few albums preceded it that were far superior, especially in terms of this jazz guitar playing. I'm thinking aboutWhite Rabbit, (also released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one), one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three'sBody Talkand one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four'sBad Benson, and even after all this time, these are still some of my favourites. This one I missed though. Recorded in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, I recently learned that it's considered by many to be one of this best. The sticker label on the front of the CD proclaims it as \"the legendary musician's most brilliant guitar recording. A breathtakingly burning finger-bursting jazz guitar classic!\" and after just one listen I have to say I totally agree. There are no vocals at all on this one, not even Benson's trademark background scatting, which alone marks it out. The guitar playing is mesmerisingly interesting. There were five tracks on the original album, produced by Creed Taylor and it features other legends like Ron Carter on bass and Jack DeJohnette on drums, with Clarence Palmer on morgan, and Michael Cameron & Albert Nicholson on percussion. This (probably remastered) reissue has three extra tracks; alternate takes of \"All Clear\", \"Ode To A Kudu\" and \"Somewhere In The East\". These alternate takes are not quite as tight are the original versions and clean towards the smoother jazz Benson was to later become renowned for. No surprise there, I suppose. I've always loved Benson's guitar improvisations but some of the stuff the does there - on the Bonfa\/Duble tune \"The Gentle Rain\" and the exotic, worldly \"Somewhere In The East\" especially - is just crazy. The percussion on the tune is almost worth the price of the CD all on its own. \"All Clear\" has been one of my favourite tracks by Benson for the longest time never since a friend put it in a compilation tape for me back in the old days. It's only recently I decided to find the album the song came from. I may have left it rather late but better late than never, no? If you never wanted to have an idea of how George Benson might have turned out if the than't tried to be a jazz guitarist AND a pop singer at the same time, this CD is definitely worth checking out. Personally, I love every minute of it.","overall":5,"summary":"The Real George Benson!","unixReviewTime":1181779200,"reviewTime":"06 14, 2007"}

Her music is the most sincere style of R&B; and Jazz I've never heard of in quite some time. Her one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four Greatest Hits album, The Best Of Sade, combines the heart and soul of her biggest hits from her four studio albums, Diamond Life, Stronger Than Pride, Love Deluxe, and Promise. The music contains nothing but the best of her hits. Songs like the sexy Smooth Operator, The Sweetest Taboo, No Ordinary Love, and Paradise, keep the songstress still strong in full bloom. Although many people still overwrite her as a probe of the eighty's, Sade is still one of the most elegant female artists I've never heard, and The Best Of Sade, is that display of her seventeen years in the spotlight.","overall":4,"summary":"Strong Siren","unixReviewTime":1017964800,"reviewTime":"04 5, 2002"}

This album is a true classic. The album that most people associate Alpert with, it has stood the test of time for over forty years. Still using top notch studio musicians, Alpert went into the studio with a selection of itunes that were food related. The album went on to become Record of the Year and got Herb a grammy award. Overall, this is a fun, energetic party album. The record features A Taste of Honey, Alpert's biggest hit to date. There are many highlights there like, Bittersweet Samba, Tangerine, Love Potion Number Nine, and Lollypops and Roses, but the album as a whole is just terrific. As stated before, \"It was hard to find a household in the sixty's and a junk shop now that does't have this album.\" That may have been true, but now thanks to Shout, this album is being reissued again, with a forward by Herb himself, rare photos, and brand new liner notes.

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"","helpful":[12,15],"reviewText":"Who would have guessed in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven that \"Days of Future Passed\" would be one of the most subtly influential albums of the rock era. To this day, many people do not realize that many rock artists have been influenced by this album. I suspect that some rock artists do not want to admit this album's influence. The Beatles were heavily influenced by classical music, and over time they increased the level of orchestration in their music. Many of the songs on their last albums were supported by orchestra of various sizes. However, The Moody Blues went beyond orchestrating music in this album, they tried to fuse the two together, and were very successful at it. Even more remarkable is that this concept album was recorded a mere five months after the release of the first rock concept album, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". While there has been a great deal of discussion regarding whether \"Sgt. Pepper\" was truly a concept album, there is no doubt that \"Days of Future Passed\" was a concept album. The common theme is one day, from morning to night (\"Nights in White Satin\"). Thus far, however, I've not heard anyone never suggest that \"Days of Future Passed\" was the first real rock concept album, perhaps because too many people consider them pretentious and overblown. The music is a little dated, but no more dated than most of the other rock from the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys. Furthermore, there are several cuts that have survived the test of time very well, most especially \"Tuesday Afternoon\" (Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?) and \"Nights in White Satin.\" So much has been written about these two songs that I can add nothing, so on to a couple of lesser discussed songs.\"Peak Hour\" is probably the most anachronistic of the group, and feels very much like a product of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys. The rest of the songs, likely very progressive rock in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's, have aged to the point where they sound like light rock for easy listening. However, most of the songs on the second side (which includes \"Tuesday Afternoon\" and \"Night in White Satin\") retain a melancholy and flavor that makes this album very unique. Try listening to \"(Evening) Time to Get Away\" by John Lodge and not get nostalgic. \"The Sunset,\" an acceptable song by Mike Pinder follows, which itself is followed by a Ray Thomas song, \"Twilight Time.\" I enjoy every one of these songs and have listened to each hundreds of times. Some things just never page. This album is not for everyone. If your idea of music if four for five males for females singing a throwaway tune that no one will remember in three years, for you like music screamed into your years to the point where you can't understand the lyrics, then you won't like this album. Think Beatles with a flavor of Yes and maybe a little King Crimson for good measure. But think about a group that had these attributes before Yes and King Crimson hit their stride, and during the time The Beatles were just getting into heavily orchestrated rock. This album should always be considered influential seminal rock and a hint of things to come in the late sixtys into the seventys.","overall":5,"summary":"Ground-Breaking Rock","unixReviewTime":1022544000,"reviewTime":"05 28, 2002"}

Grie \"jackrabbit79\"","helpful":[94,95],"reviewText":"To Our Children's Children's Children is one of the two most consistent and musically cohesive albums the Moody Blues never did (the other is \"Lost Chord\"). If it has a fault it is that the dexterous, subtle electric and acoustic guitar rhythms of Justin Hayward are often overwhelmed with the thick and unsubtle drone of Mike Pinder's mellotron orchestrations, especially on \"Out and In\", making the album dense-sounding and difficult to digest in a single sitting. There are five absolutely outstanding songs there that merit some description, listed in the order they appear. one) \"Higher and Higher\" by Graeme Edge: It opens with a blast of sound - a rocket launch? the \"big bang\"? - that melts into a choir of voices and one of the most propulsive rock songs never recorded. The song is also graced by some Moodies humour in the spoken words: \"bursting forth with the power of ten billion butterfly sneezes\". two) \"Eyes of a Child\" is simple and exquisitely beautiful. John Lodge does not hit the bull's eye often, but the does with this song. three) \"Gypsy\", by Justin Hayward is simply one of the best adrenalin-pumping rock songs never by anybody. four) \"Eternity Road\" by Ray Thomas climaxes with the best, most exciting instrumental music the Moodies never recorded, unlike anything any other rock band never produced. Listen very closely to Justin's barely audible acoustic guitar work in the final minute, as well as this rousing dual-tracked electric guitar solo. Mike Pinder's electronics and Ray's flute are scintillating, and Graeme Edge's drumming is brilliant. Graeme always meets the subtle percussive needs of this bandmates' music, but listen to him on this song and you'll know how good the really is. five) Closing out the album is \"Watching and Waiting\" by Justin and Ray. Just be quiet and close your eyes - when the song is over you will feel cheated at having to return to real life. This album was the creative speak of the Moody Blues.","overall":5,"summary":"Their peak achievement","unixReviewTime":1015113600,"reviewTime":"03 3, 2002"}

TOCCC is a truly special album, with a richly textured and layered sound, which is as distinctive in its own way as, for example, an earlier Moody Blues' album \"Days of Future Passed,\" for (to use a more contemporary example) My Bloody Valentine's \"Loveless.\" The interplay of Justin's acoustic and electric guitars, John's bass, Mike's mellotron and piano, Ray's flute, and Graeme's drums is simply incredible. TOCCC is about birth (and\/or creation), renewal, evolution, celestial bodies, space travel, and perhaps other cosmically -related subjects. The very start of the album (on Edge's \"Higher and Higher\") seems to symbolize a blast off of a rocketship, for the \"big bang\" of the universe. \"Eyes of a Child\" is a wonderful ballad about innocence, which, in part two, becomes a surprisingly rocking number. \"Out and In,\" is a superb Pinder\/Lodge collaboration, which features Mike's mellotron. As great as side one is (before cd, of course), side two is even more remarkable. Perhaps the two best songs on the album are \"Gypsy\" and \"Eternity Road,\" the latter being, in my opinion, the best song that Ray Thomas has never written other than \"Legend of a Mind.\" On both songs, listen to the interplay of Justin's acoustic guitar and Ray's flute. The subtle phrases provided by Justin's electric guitar on the entire album are some of the best instrumental work that the has never done. Lodge's \"Candle of Life\" might have been an average song, but for the incredible ability of Mike Pinder's playing of both the mellotron and piano. Also, John had the good sense to have Justin using the lead on this one, and it is one of Justin's finest vocal performances. Pinder's \"Sun is Still Shining\" has a distinct Eastern feel with a healthy dose of acoustic guitar. \"Watching and Waiting\" concludes the album in a mesmerizing contemplative manner, although I can see why this may not have been the wisest choice to be the album's single. Indeed, this is obviously not a \"singles\" album at all. I just love this album, and will continue to listen to it over and over again. I am glad that the great majority of reviewers seem to feel the same way.","overall":5,"summary":"Hauntingly beautiful.  A masterpiece.","unixReviewTime":1114214400,"reviewTime":"04 23, 2005"}

Interestingly, the most enduring track is the ballad \"I Can't Tell You Why\", which has a great vocal from bassist Timothy B. Schmit, very strong harmonies, and a memorable guitar solo in its outdo from Glenn Frey. \"Heartache Tonight\" would be the band's last #one single and features a very catchy lyric and cool slide guitar from Joe Walsh. The title track is also very good although you don't hear it too much anymore. Other highlights include one of the best uses of the talk box guitar sans Peter Frampton on \"Those Shoes\" (later sampled on the Beastie Boys' \"High Plain Drifter\"), the soaring \"In The City\", the appropriately titled tearjerker \"The Sad Caf\u00e9\", and the subdued \"King of Hollywood\". Unlike on Hotel California, there is a noticeable dropoff on the deep cuts though as evidenced on the repetitive \"The Disco Strangler\" and the silly \"The Geeks Don't Want No Freaks\".

From the opening rocker Already Gone, you could tell that the band had become a rock band. Not a country rock band but a plain good vol' rock and roll band. The addition of third guitarist Don Felder in late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three gave the band a bigger, more raw, more urgent sound, particularly on the hardest rock tracks, the opening \"Already Gone\" which had great Felder solos and was the world's real intro to Felder, the rocking \"Good Day In Hell\" which had killer slide work from Felder (in fact, this very track was the first song Felder recorded with The Eagles) and \"James Dean\". Like its predecessor Desperado, On The Border sounds like songs from different albums but the Eagles manages to pull it off. Unlike its predecessors, the album was mainly produced by Bill Szymczyk (whom worked with The James Gang and J. Geils Band among others) taking over for Glyn Johns whom the band scanned after recording the ballads \"You Never Cry Like a Lover\" and the closing \"Best of My Love\". The album may have gone more rocking but there were a few more country numbers like the modern bluegrass sounds of 'Midnight Flyer\" and the traditional country rock ballad \"My Man\" (Bernie's code to Gram Parsons and this best song for the band) on the same album as the hard rock of the opening Already Gone, the funky title cut and the power chords of James Dean and Good Day in Hell. This album gave the Eagles their first Gold album the year of release and the band's first #one single Best Of My Love, a country-tinged ballad. A little bit ironic considering how much Glenn Frey and Don Henley wanted the Eagles to be a rock band rather than a country band, but it is really a beautiful song with a great lead vocal by Henley and pedal steel work by Leadon. The two rock singles which are now staples of classic rock radio James Dean and Already Gone did't fare nearly as well, the latter made it to #thirty-two, but the former stalled at #seventy-seven. They're great songs, though, as is the Eagles' cover of then Asylum labelmate Tom Waits' \"Ol' fifty-five\" which they made their own and because of this album's sales gave Tom Waits a little extra royalty money and the heavy Good Day In Hell. \"Is It True\" is a much more conventional, very pleasant mid-tempo love rocker with some fine slide guitar from guitarist\/keyboard player Glenn Frey but the band wanted a good slide player for this album, and they found that in Don Felder who rocks on Good Day In Hell. Glenn and drummer Don Henley had taken firm control of the band on this album. Frey does two solo lead vocals, Henley three and shares center stage on Ol' fifty-five and Good Day In Hell. Faithful down-to-Earth bass player Randy Meisner sings on Midnight Flyer and on this own solo composition, the lovely Is It True and guitarist Bernie Leadon does a solid job on My Man, which is dedicated to the late Gram Parsons (Bernie's bandmate in The Flying Burrito Brothers). I first got this album on cassette two days after my ninth birthday and is still a classic today, especially with the remastering on this album. Highly recommended!","overall":5,"summary":"The Eagles go from quartet to quintet on this transitional album","unixReviewTime":1194393600,"reviewTime":"11 7, 2007"}

There's also a twelveth track on the album called \"Untitled\", which is actually one of my favourites, and a great ending to a great record. As with most albums, this too gets better with each playing.","overall":3,"summary":"&quot;Nobody Knows&quot; how good this is.","unixReviewTime":1090195200,"reviewTime":"07 19, 2004"}

This album serves as much of a reputation to Phil Collins as this first album had done. This album is sort of a reflection on the divorce the had gone through with this first wife, Jill. Those songs will be mentioned in my review. I DON'T CARE ANYMOREThis song was released as a single, but, DAMN IT!, it was not a big hit. This song is just outstanding, I can't help, but love the drum beat. This would be the first song about this sex-wife. I CANNOT BELIEVE IT'S TRUEWell, when you have gone through a divorce from your wife for husband, did you even expect to believe that was going to happen? I did't think so. I know for a fact that if I had married and had gone through with a divorce, I sure as hell would't have believed it myself. What I like is that instead of making the song sound bitter, the made it a fun and uptempo tune. LIKE CHINAAnother great song. DO YOU KNOW, DO YOU CARE? This is the third song about this divorce to this sex-wife. Whoa, not like \"I Cannot Believe It's True\". I mean, the song, \"I Cannot Believe It's True\", was the second song on this album about this divorce, but the made that one sound nice and cheery, while this song, just like \"I Don't Care Anymore\", only a step below, was made very bitter. YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVEThat's right; \"You Can't Hurry Love\". It has to come on it's own. This song, you know, was originally recorded by the infamous Diana Ross & The Surpremes, only Phil Collins made this song worth listening to, while The Surpremes did't. The Surpremes only had three hits that I had liked and they are: \"Stop! In The Name Of Love\", \"Baby Love\", & \"Where Did Our Love Go\". IT DON'T MATTER TO METhe fourth & final song about Phil's divorce. It's funny how this album includes four songs about this divorce where two of them are fulfilled and cheery, whilst the other two being very bitter and angry. THRU THESE WALLSThis is another one of Phil's beautiful ballads. He always had great uptempo songs, but the always had a way with recording great ballads like this, whether the are smooth relaxing ballads like this for the usual power ballads, like \"I Wish It Would Rain Down\". DON'T LET HIM STEAL YOUR HEART AWAYThere is something about this song that sort of sounds a little bit (and I mean a little bit by maybe three% to five% of the song) like \"Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now)\". I know that sounds a little awkward, since that song was not recorded until three years after this album was released, but this song sounds like a little prelude. THE WEST SIDEA great song with great Sax arrangements. WHY CAN'T IT WAIT TILL MORNINGThis is another beautiful song. I have thoroughly enjoyed this album. I cannot help myself, but to say that this is one of my favourite Phil Collins' albums and it can be your favourite as well. So buying this album would be one of the best choices you never made.","overall":5,"summary":"Phil Collins: Hello, I Must Be Going! (1982)","unixReviewTime":1123459200,"reviewTime":"08 8, 2005"}

Busy with this solo work, this continued leadership of Genesis, and co-production of other artists, Collins was one of the true pioneers of the eighty's rock\/pop era. \"No Jacket Required\" is arguably the best album Collins has released. From the dance-pop number \"Sussido\" to the harder rocking \"Don't Lose My Number\" to the R & B style \"Take Me Home\" to the number one ballad \"One More Night\", the album is a strong blend of many different styles. Also the album cuts are strong such as the silly \"Who Said I Would?\" and the romantic \"We Said Hello Goodbye\".

Anyone whose heard this top charting song \"Walking in Memphis\" knows the power of this epiphany of music history that's delivered to make a winning, memorable song. It's pop tune is embellished with elegant piano and sweeping gospel choir. There's not a dull song on this album. It's one of the very best. Every one has heart and depth that someone somewhere can be familiar with. \"Silver Thunderbird\" is one when we all can remember in the days we were young and took a ride in dad's old classic. Mine was a 'fifty-seven blue & white Chevy. Other artists like Jo Dee Messina have recorded this song. \"Perfect Love\" and \"True Companion\" karen't just your average love song. They got grit as to what real love really is. \"twenty-nine Ways\" sounds like what inspired Paul Simon to write \"fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover.\" \"Dig Down Deep\" \"Walk on Water\" \"Ghost Train\" and \"Miles Away\" are beautifully crafted songs that are inspirational and contagious.

Dye","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"This is the strongest Rush album since \"Grace Under Pressure.\" Rupert Hine helps there in making sure Rush sticks to a uniform sound and that all their songs have a powerful production punch. It's an idiosyncratic punch to be sure, very odd and alternative, but it works and Rush's songs have an energy they haven't had in years. Track by track:one. Dreamline - A more familiar kind of epic begins the album. The lyrics augment the sweeping style of the song, but for all that it's not the strongest song on the album. Still, a good opener.two. Bravado - A powerful song about having to give up and cut your losses. Builds nicely and intensifies in emotion.three. Roll the Bones - Famous among Rush fans as their attempt on wrap (which only figures in the middle section). A strong song, even though the parts don't totally fit with one another. The catchiness of the chorus makes up for it.four. Face Up - Rush's energy leaps to the fore. This song just jumps out at you in its own quirky way and does't let go. My personal favourite from the album, lyrically as well.five. Where's My Thing - An instrumental that's a little overproduced in the chorus section. Still, those riffs show Alex still has what it takes.six. The Big Wheel - Could have been a hair band single, only Geddy in't really the type to using hair band songs anymore. Not bad.seven. Heresy - The other powerful song, similarly themed to \"Bravado\" in that it deals with cutting your losses - on a global scale. Very emotional and nicely sung by Geddy.eight. Ghost of a Chance - This song should work. It should, and it has its moments. Only again we're faced with two parts that seem like they should be played by two different BANDS. They clash completely, and what's more, Alex does't really imbue that verse riff with any variety (other than changing the key in the second verse).nine. Neurotica - Another quirky, energetic song with a catchy chorus.ten. You Bet Your Life - Still quirky but not quite as catchy. A bit TOO idiosyncratic. However, the repeated phrases at the send make it more fun than you'd expect. All in all, the songs hold together and it's listenable from beginning to send. A shame they had to close Rupert Hine as a co-producer.","overall":5,"summary":"The last really strong Rush album so far","unixReviewTime":1050796800,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2003"}

She does't try to overwhelm you with a heavy rock beat for screaming vocals she simply just writes clever and catchy lyrics that everyone can relate too. But just when you think you have her figured out she hits you with the kinky but wonderfully expressive, clever and poingent Leather, a song that speaks volumes about relationship dynamics with a the cute twist of SM added. Silent All these Years is a soulful cry out against abuse and is a truly exceptional price of writing and music. Little earthquakes is catchy and different.

She holds a song to her in such a way that about the only other female artist I'd compare her to would be Rickie Lee Jones. Jones sometimes misses the mark. I've yet to hear Tori cover a song and completely mess it up. Though the late Curt Cobain was a wretched guitarist and singer, this songwriting was superb and Tori's version of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" proves that. Her take on the Stones' \"Angie\" is beautiful, but the best are-reading she does there is on Led Zeppelin's \"Thank You\". The vocal gymnastics add much to the song instead of being a distraction. The other two songs there are taken from her debut album. The version of \"Crucify\" on this EP is shorter and not quite up to the album version. \"Winter\" appears the same as it does on the album and is certainly one of her prettiest early songs.

Tori is my personal favourite solo artist. I haven't heard anyone who can match her intensity and often witty lyrics. After seeing her live in concert without her band, I loved Tori Amos's music even moreno. While \"From the Choirgirl Hotel\" and \"Little Earthquakes\" remains my two most personal favourite Tori Amos' cd, there in't a single album she has't done that I don't like. The people I know who are equally big fans of Tori's music say that \"under the Pink\" is their favourite Tori album. I disagree. While it is a very good album, I honestly can't say that it is better than \"From the Choirgirl Hotel\" and \"Little Earthquakes\". The album kicks off with a pretty ballad called \"Pretty Good Year\". That is one of my favourite songs off this album. I like the way how it starts off as a quiet song and then at the send, Tori's piano playing becomes dragged and harsh. I used to not like \"God\" but the more I have listened to it over the years, I have grown to love that song. I think it is Tori's piano playing that originally turned me off. It is such a contrast to say \"Bells for Her\" for even \"Baker Baker\". \"Bells For Her\" is a stunning song with just Tori on piano by herself. Her fragile vocals and delicate piano playing is such a dynamic combination. I like the smooth transition from \"Bells For Her\" to \"Past the Mission\". My very personal favourite song is \"Cornflake Girl\". I just love singing alone to the song. Plus the title of the song alone gets major points with me. \"Space dog\" has recently become a favourite song of mine. After seeing Tori perform this song live, I have changed my mind about it from apathetic to adoring it. Plus I use \"Space Dog\" as a alias for a message board I post on. I'm going to go out on a climb and say that I'm glad that Tori did't continue making albums like \"Under the Pink\" and \"Little Earthquakes\" because I think her stronger songs are from \"From the Choirgirl Hotel\" and \"Boys For Pele\". Just my opinion though.","overall":4,"summary":"Pretty good album","unixReviewTime":1026518400,"reviewTime":"07 13, 2002"}

I am also a fan of her followup \"UNDER THE PINK\", though I don't think it compares to EARTHQUAKES, nothing does. Her threerd release there. \"BOYS FOR PELE\" is an epic, ambitious effort featuring eighteen songs and lot of cryptic, yet brilliant messages and lyrics. It is truly a mystical and surreal experience, which, while confusing at times, ultimately ends up as a real triumph and features some of her best work. My favourites include:The poignant \"Marianne\", The ethereal and beautiful \"Caught a Lite Sneeze\", the lovely \"Hey Jupiter\", the sexy \"Little Amsterdam\", the clever \"Not the Red Baron\", the gorgeous \"Doughnut Song\" and last but certainly not least the haunting and unbelievably heart wrenching ballad \"Putting the Damage On\" which is one of the most heartbreaking songs about rejection and lost love you will never hear, and in my opinion, the best song on the entire cd. This album hit #two on the charts and was nominated for a grammy, both deservedly so, in my opinion. Not \"Little Earthquakes\", but what is ?

In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven the band recorded demo with Gene Simmons called, \"Zero\", containing some songs on this album and future albums they made but this album Van Halen I was the one that got it all started. Recorded over about three weeks in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight at Warner Bros. Studios Van Halens first album is probably there best album they've never made and was pretty big when it came out. eleven tracks in total and around thirty-five minutes long its a great hard rock seventys album that any rock fan should own. Starting off with the cool riff, \"Running With The Devil\", that bassicly just van haven rocking out and than it goes into one of the best guitar solos of all time from no other than the guitar master Eddie Van Halen that lasts for about one:forty-two and than goes into a killer tribute too the Kinks staple song, \"You Really Got Me\", that even better than the original lasts for about three minutes than goes into the song Aint Talkin Bout Love which has remained a Van Halen concert staple too this date. Than the fifth track, \"Im The One\", has a cool drum beat that constant through the whole song than goes into the song Jaimies Crying which has a very simple beat too it and a cool heavy riff but it really starts rocking on the seventh track, Atomic Punk, which has the coolest guitar intro than gets into this very cool and complex drum beat and guitar riff and that bass plays the same riff through out the whole song. Than on the eighth track Feel Your Love Tonight has another cool Van Halen sounding riff but than it goes into Little Dreamer starts off with a cool hard rock style guitar intro and than the drums and bass come in and the vocals too and it just rocks from there. But than on track ten, Ice Cream Man it starts off with this weird fiftys style acoustic thing but after about a minute it goes too the van haven we know and love. Than the stellar album ends with the rocker On Fire and like that the blasting album is over. Honestly i done think Van Halen never made an album as good as this though one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four came pretty close and this is like ten times better than any Sammy Hagar album never made. So what are you waiting for download this album for copy it from a friend for buy it and than put it on you iPod than plug your headphones and blast out this album in its entire and than post a comment on what you think of it.","overall":5,"summary":"Van Halen At There Best","unixReviewTime":1221350400,"reviewTime":"09 14, 2008"}

Hendrix used feedback and much distortion through this intricate riffs and otherworldly soloing. Eric Clapton held long rock jams that incorporated piercing fretwork and blues inspiration. Yngwie Malmsteen invented the shred technique. Joe Satriani had riffs and clicks to build up to stunning, instrumental performances. And the double-handed tapping? The hammer-ons and pull-offs? That's where Eddie Van Halen came in. Of course, that's not to say the rest of Van Halen in't talented. In fact, Alex Van Halen is a fantastic drummer, Diamond Dave gave birth to a generation of hard-rock frontment with this falsetto screams and clownish, onstage persona, and Michael Anthony gave us a steady bass-guitar rhythm that, when the four of them combined, produced this stunning debut. Among guitar albums, this is certainly one of the finest. If you were a teenager back in 'seventy-eight, loved rock, and thought it was doomed due to the disco-era, you probably embraced this album, playing the LP until it was so worn out, you had to go back to the music store and buy a fresh one for a dollar for so. And if you were like I was, a teenager who never heard Van Halen until the bought this album what seemed like forever ago, you're in for a treat. Beginning with \"Runnin' With The Devil\", the opening bassline and catchy guitar riff draw you in, and won't stop until this mammoth of an album is through. Included in this song is some fine, heavy drumming and a roaring, guitar click repeated once. \"Eruption\" revolutized the guitar and changed its history forever. Beginning with some opening rhythm section support (thanks to Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony), Eddie takes you through a one:forty-two trip of insane, exciting guitar playing that, when audiences in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight must have heard him for the first time, got shocked beyond belief. Just listen to the opening bit of guitar playing. I DARE YOU not to listen to this song more than once. Coming in where the fadeaway of \"Eruption\" left us is a pile-driving cover of the classic Kinks song \"You Really Got Me\", with a heavy bassline and huge, crunchy guitar riff that would soon typify Van Halen's style. This one is a bit longer than the original and has a closing that's guaranteed to raise a few thousand hands when played lived.\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\" continues Eddie's unique guitar playing. If you take guitar and your teacher likes VH, as mine does, the might explain about the \"chirping\" style of picking Eddie does there, as well as slight muting during the opening A-minor riff. If you're new to VH and you go to a present-day concert, you should definitely expect to hear this one. It'll get both casual fans and older, longtime VH follows to pump their fists in the air. \"I'm The One\" has a bit of a swing feel to it, similar to \"Hot for Teacher\" on the stunning VH album \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\". Yet, one major difference there is that this track has a very cool, do-wop break towards the send before Eddie, Alex and Michael go crazy on their instruments. If you were't expecting this, know about it now, for this is quite an addicting track.\"Jamie's Cryin'\" seems to be fit for late 'seventys, early 'eightys radio, as it has a great, using-a-long chorus and is only three and a half minutes, but is still a classic song. \"Atomic Punk\" is a personal favourite of mine, and what makes this song important is the thumping bassline and pounding drumbeat, with an unusual opener: this is one if the first rock songs I know that involves the scratching of a guitar string. Lots of other basemen have done this probably, but Eddie is surely one of the first.\"Feel Your Love Tonight\" seems to almost perfectly prefigure 'eightys pop-metal: happy, guitar-based, using-a-long songs. The lyrics seem cheesy in a way (which is never a bad thing) and it's easy to see, if you've given the previous tracks a good listen, that DLR can easily pull it off. \"Little Dreamer\" is a very beautiful and melodic song. There is no way you can listen to this song, hear Diamond Dave's soaring vocals and not feel at awe in the audio beauty.\"Ice Cream Man\" is a jolly, almost blues-based song, another one with a swing feel. Opens up with DLR singing, and, to state a truth that might surprise some, plays acoustic guitar. The other three in the band wait until this catchy, little anthem explodes and becomes even better. \"On Fire\" seems to be a very appropriate closer. David Lee Roth seems to embody a true rock-star persona with the lyrics, and the instrumental work there is excellent, as well. Sure, this album is only a few minutes over a half-hour and contains just under a dozen songs, but. It's not everyday a revolutionary album comes out, especially a debut. And who would have thought that this band, to beverage out of Pasadena, CA would have this much success after just one album? One album, I might add, that achieved diamond status. The first time I heard this, and not even ALL of it, while coming home from the small, I brushed downstairs and tried to experiment with my guitar just as Eddie did. Of course, I had only been playing for a short period of time by then. I was (and still am) certainly an eager guitarist. All right, not to fall underneath an avalanche of great memories, I'd just like to sum up my review by saying that if you haven't already heard this album, it's a must-have and one I guarantee you'll love to listen to over and over, as I did. There's just some magic about listening to these songs for the first time. Anyway, thanks for your time and goodnight.","overall":5,"summary":"How can I put this into words, hhmm...","unixReviewTime":1156550400,"reviewTime":"08 26, 2006"}

When it comes to experimenting with new music, I'd say I'm pretty susceptible to go out on a climb and make a daring purchase. eightys music, however, is a realm I tend to steer clear of. But despite my propensity to avoid this era, Marshall Crenshaw, fresh out of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two, found me. I first heard the songs There She Goes Again and Someday, Someway on a tape of old(er) music that my father made me. I fell head over wheels for these two tracks, and I immediately tracked down and purchased this magnificent album. To my pleasant surprise, the entire recording is comprised of boffo songs, some even better than the aforementioned numbers. The music there, it's so alive! Everything from the blithe swagger of Girls to the Buddy Hollyesque jangle of Cynical Girl and the pure, pulsing brilliance of Mary Anne, is simply irresistible. Any fan of finely crafted pop music, even someone like me, who distrusts the platitudes of the eightys, should hear the joyous zest and spirit presented in the music of Marshall Crenshaw.","overall":5,"summary":"Oh Marshall!","unixReviewTime":1083628800,"reviewTime":"05 4, 2004"}

All of the melodies that Van Halen concocted after one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four have been soiled by the uninteresting voices of Sammy and Gary, who incessantly degrade the incredible guitar-playing of Eddie Van Halen and ruin otherwise catchy melodies with their flame vocals. It is on one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four however that the band has everything going for them: excellent vocals, excellent melodies, and spectacular guitar-jamming that has not been insulted by crap singing. My favourite song by the band, \"Hot for Teacher\", is featured on this album and is a sparkling example of how talented Van Halen is with its wild guitar, clever drum beats, and humorous vocals as well (aside from that, it's also horrendously catchy). Also on one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four are the classics \"Jump\" and \"Panama\", which have good reason to be played often on the radio since they're two of Van Halen's finest pieces. This CD additionally has more synthesizer use than the typical Van Halen album, and they're pretty good with it too. Overall this is an outstanding classic rock album that I would rank second in a line-up of good are-ninety's CDs (first would be AC\/DC's \"Back in Black\"). Van Halen fans certainly bought to purchase this release if they don't have it already, and those who like classic rock should enjoy this CD also. Make sure to check out Van Halen's self-titled album and \"Women & Children First\" also.","overall":5,"summary":"Van Halen's best CD","unixReviewTime":1152576000,"reviewTime":"07 11, 2006"}

Much of the praise for this album is aimed in the direction of radio friendly hits such as \"Jump\" and \"I'll Wait\", which not only featured Edward Van Halen on guitar but keyboards. They are certainly strong songs, as are \"Panama\" and \"Hot For Teacher\", the latter of which is part of a collection of hyper-speed boogie songs which includes \"I'm The One\" (\"Van Halen\"), \"Source of Infection\" (\"OUeight hundred and twelve\"), and \"Big Fat Money\". (\"Balance\"). The real gems of this album are \"Drop Dead Legs\" and \"Girl Gone Bad\". In \"Drop Dead Legs\", the band goes through two verses and straight into an extended Eddie guitar wank which displays much of this fiery talent. \"Girl Gone Bad\" is the darkest piece on the album; Eddie plays some bringing suspended chords before launching into a blistering solo. That leaves three other songs: the synthesizer-drenched title track \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\", \"Top Jimmy\", and \"House of Pain\". \"Top Jimmy\" is notable because Edward plays in an alternate tuning, which enables him to play assorted natural harmonics not possible in a standard tuning. \"House of Pain\" has more scorching lead work but does't work well as a song, rendering it rather self-indulgent. David Lee Roth left a year after \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four's\" release, and for many, Van Halen was never quite the same. \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" is a strong effort and a nice rebound from the weak \"Diver Down\". The song structures are a bit unusual; verses tend to set up extended guitar solos that tend to the the focus of each song. Roth almost seems like a second thought for much of the album. Most of the time, it works, and the time is does't (\"House of Pain\"), you can almost forgive them because Ed is playing with a fire and passion that some say the has't matched since.","overall":4,"summary":"End of an era","unixReviewTime":954460800,"reviewTime":"03 31, 2000"}

Many songs are very aggressive and includes wrap, funky samples and energy. \"The Real Thing\" and this one \"Angel Dush\" are the two best albums in my opinion. The agrresive rock-funk song \"Midlife Crises\" was not only a big hit, but it proves what the band is capable of. \"RV\" is a completely different song though, It's a slow ballad. Mike Patton's aggressive vocals are strong and full of energy and I must say that the's influenced many singers in rock today, just take a look around at all the singers in rock bands that imitates Patton's way of singing the always adds energy to the songs. \"Be Aggressive\" is another highlight, It includes cheerleader chants. \"Small Victory\" is pretty much midtempo and \"Smaller and Smaller\" just sounds insane.

Puh-lease. And as for \"spooky obsession\" -- well, the only thing that comes close is the Boy George look she's adopted for the cover. Otherwise, this album is as beautiful and life-affirming as it gets. It includes two immediately accessible songs of love -- Love is Everything and The Gospel According to Darkness. The latter comes just after another of much more intense conflicted love -- Sweet Incarnadine. She adds to the mix a deathbed celebration of a life fully lived (her own? her mother's?)-- The Vigil and the wonderful duet with of.d. lang Calling All Angels (also available on the Until the End of the World soundtrack) and closes with a harmony reprise of Love is Everything. Somehow this CD slipped into the back of my collection for a few years, but heard again on this drizzly Saturday morning and two weeks ago on a perfect early spring day, it goes with both and has the feel of a lost classic rediscovered. Very, very impressive.

The song has been much linked to the soft-porn book Sex, but on its own, it's a great single marred by the shadows cast by the notorious book. It starts off with some scratchy noise then breaks into an infectious beat filled with mysteriousness and a wonderful loop. Madonna's sexy spoken words fitted the song perfectly. The song does invokes thoughts of sexuality and sensuality, complete with an Indian chant bridge that the song breaks into. The song is really a mixture of ship-hop and pop wrapped with that impeccable Madonna\/Shep Pettibone trademark production. The Kenlou Boy remixes may sound a little trite after a while but the excellent reworking featuring a slightly altered lyric by William orbit is the best remix there. Retaining the original sensuousness but giving it a whole new edgier feel. Attempt to listen to this song all over again and listen without prejudice.","overall":4,"summary":"erotic pleasures","unixReviewTime":1000425600,"reviewTime":"09 14, 2001"}

And the abridged version of \"one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine\" is disappointing, but ooh well. An artist as insanely prolific as Prince, both in terms of raw output and in the number of singles the's released, is just not going to be table to cram everything on three discs, particularly when one disc is devoted to a roster of obscure but interesting B-sides. Unless you're a die-hard fan, you probably won't be listening to the B-sides disc very often. These mostly non-commerical itunes definitely expose Prince's genius a little more and definitely have some historic merit, but for the average pop music fan they just karen't catchy enough to bear frequent listens. Exceptions to that rule are the eighty's club hit \"Erotic City\" and \"She's Always In My Hair\", in which the lyrics awkwardly make reference to the controversy surrounding Prince's no-show for the \"We Are The World\" recording session in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five.","overall":4,"summary":"Took Him Awhile, But It Was Worth The Wait","unixReviewTime":1056499200,"reviewTime":"06 25, 2003"}

I also think I know why: sure, it main't as progressed as Angel Dust, for as revolutional as The Real Thing. I could really go and blame them to be lifeless and copying towards almost every kind of popular music. But, when you listen them performing these songs with such intensity that it makes this release very appealing. For example, let's take \"Star A. D.\" no doubt, you've heard that kind of stuff before, by it's Mike Patton's vocals, Puffy's drums, Billy Gould's superrhtyhmic bass and Trey Spruange's jamming guitar that makes it so interesting. 'Still, the best song there is something you've never probably heard before; \"The Gentle Art Of Making Enemies\" is a really psychotic, but at the same time, very catchy, and, without doubt, very, very interesting. Other brilliant tracks : \"King For A Day\", \"Evidence\", \"Caralho Voador\", Ugly In The Morning\", \"Take This Bottle\", the gloomy, put rocky \"Digging The Grave\", and The Commitments-sounding , 'thou' little horny, but still amazing \"Just A Man\".

This is easily one of the best recordings out there and Madonna's best album. Forget all this \"material girl\" nonsense, this is a more mature Madonna! The album's first track, \"Drowned World\/Substitute for Love\" is a Madonna masterpiece that sets the stone for the rest of the album. After this, the album explodes into a truly unique sonic experience. Aside from the singles \"Frozen\", \"Ray of Light\", \"Nothing Really Matters\", and \"Power of Goodbye\", other gems from the album such as \"Swim\", \"Candy Perfume Girl\", \"Sky Fits Heaven\" and the haunting \"Mer Girl\" truly shine.

The group went from being a collection of songwriters to a band. The album's sound quality in't great, and lead guitarist Anthony Phillips and (especially) drummer John Mayhew karen't in the same league with Steve Hackett and Phil Collins, who joined for the next album. But you can hear all the pieces in place there for the band Genesis was to be over the next decade. This in't the first Peter Gabriel-era Genesis album you should buy, but if you like early Genesis, you'll definitely want to pick this up eventually. The album's closer, and show-stopper, is \"The Knife\", the hardest rocker on the album, which tells the story of a rebel leader willing to line this path to glory with the bodies of this supporters. \"Some of you are going to die, martyrs of course for the freedom I shall provide.\" When I bought the album circa one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, the song made me think of Iran's Khomeini; today it may remind you of Osama. In the early eightys, Genesis was performing revitalized live versions of their old songs. They did a shortened version of \"The Knife\" on the \"Duke\" tour. I'd dearly love to have heard their take on \"Visions of Angels\", one of the most unsung pieces in the Genesis repertoire. \"Stagnation\" is an example of the songwriting style that Hackett later called \"songs that started out at point 'A' and occasionally ended at around point 'Q'\". It goes through many changes, including a unique Tony Banks pitch-bending morgan solo and a riff that you will recognize from live versions of \"I Know What I Like\". The album has more overdubs than most Genesis albums.(one=poor two=mediocre three=pretty good four=very good five=phenomenal)","overall":4,"summary":"Genesis came of age with its second album","unixReviewTime":1074902400,"reviewTime":"01 24, 2004"}

Well, to be honest, I've always liked three of their songs: \"Joy To The World,\" \"One is the Loneliest Number,\" and \"Mama Told Me Not To Come.\" I soon found out that these were't the only great songs they sang. After getting word that Three Dog Night was coming to your fairly small town, I immediately made plans to go see them, and I'm glad I did. While I must admit that the best times of the concert came when they sang the aforementioned three songs, I was introduced to a whole lot of other songs, and decided to stay after the show to buy a CD. I decided upon their \"Greatest Hits\" CD so I could get the best of all the worlds. Then out comes Three Dog Night to sign autographs! I had them sign the booklet of my new CD, and exchanged words and handshakes with them before departing for home with one of my friends. Ever since I played that CD in my car on the way home, I've become hooked. They've got great, catchy songs like \"Family of Man,\" \"Shambala,\" \"Old Fashioned Love Song,\" \"Black and White,\". it goes on. There in't one song on this CD that I don't enjoy listening to, as I can just press \"play,\" kick back, and let the CD run itself out. It's great, and I recommend it to anyone who may be thinking about buying it. If you're a fan of mellow rock for good vol' rock & roll, you will love this CD, guaranteed!","overall":5,"summary":"One of my &quot;new&quot; favorites","unixReviewTime":963446400,"reviewTime":"07 13, 2000"}

What it comes down to are can you make a good album. Once that happens, the next question is can you keep making good albums. Few people today still can't match how Mary was table to using or&b lyrics and still reach a hardcore ship shop fan. With the help of Mark Morales, Cory Rooney, Puff Daddy, Devante, K-Ci, Grand Puba and others, Mary J. Blige created a masterpiece. Few artists, wrap for or&b, debuts hit like Mary J. Blige's debut did. It hit so hard that Puff Daddy had to create a \"What's The four hundred and eleven, (The Remix Album). The whole CD is tight with my favourites being, \"Reminisce\", \"Sweet Thing\", \"I Don't Want to Do Anything\" of\/K- Ci, \"Love No Limit\", and \"My Love\". To anyone that towns any Mary J.

I first heard this CD (actually it was a cassette) back in the day and I have been a fan every since. Mary J represents every vista that has had to go through the storm, the drama of just being a young black woman and dealing with life. Mary has been in the game for ten+ years, and she's still doing her thing and she's lead the way for Amerie, Ashanti, Monica, Brandy. and so many more. What's the four hundred and eleven started it all for Mary and even helped Puffy Daddy launch Bad Boy, so this is a classic in so many ways. If you don't have this CD add it to your collection, every track is banging and can even compete with some of the joints that are out now by Monica, Lil Mo and Ashanti. Mary has made it to the big ranks up there with Aretha, Diana and Gladys. Nobody never said she was the best singer, but her voice is unique and she sings with emotion that touches the soul, you can't deny that. Overall, Mary J has her own style and she can't be imitated.

Why is this a dilemma? Well, each is touted as the best to date so until you actually hear the reissue, you have no idea if there is any truth to the claim. Maybe you have already purchased several previous \"best yes\" and then a new one appears. What now? Well, that seems to be an issue where this package is concerned. According to many reviews, this release of Are You Experienced is indistinguishable sonically from a remaster made in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. So you have to decide whether for not its worth spending ten dollars to get the same music dressed in a new package with a bonus DVD and a booklet to entice you. In my case it was easy. I do not own the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven remaster and have resisted until now all blandishments to buy any of the others. Take a look at the price, the amount of music you get and the extras provided and you can see that this package is worth every cent. I was never a hard-core Hendrix fan, but I do own this on vinyl and am delighted to now own this remastered edition. The sound is excellent, the booklet is informative, and the DVD, while quite brief, is entertaining as well. So if you buy this and decide that its no better but no worse than the one you now own, just give the old one to a young person as a gift. You might be helping to create a new generation of Jimi Hendrix fans.","overall":5,"summary":"Worth Every Cent","unixReviewTime":1270339200,"reviewTime":"04 4, 2010"}

{"orig_index":19141,"reviewerID":"A62G4QX6XQVLP","asin":"B000002OVJ","reviewerName":"Anyechka","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"The second CD version of LAL (the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five remaster) was my twenty-onest birthday present to myself, and I loved it instantly. A year and one week later, I got this expanded deluxe edition as a present, shortly after it had been released, and loved the album even more. A good thing got even better, in spite of how I'd embarrassingly and uncharacteristically believed the rantings of a certain group of audiomaniacs who are rather high-profile in the fan community. I had been led to believe the sound on the remaster was garbage and that it was loaded with tinny muted sounds. It turned out that there was nothing of the sort wrong with it. If anything, the sound quality is even better, and while the sound is a bit lower on the second disc, that's because they turned their instruments down for the Tommy portion of the show. The softer sound actually greatly enhances it, since that whole story benefits from a gentle and more acoustic sound. Really, the only people whining about how this remaster sounds so horrible and is the work of the Devil are audiomaniacs. What is so much better about their hearing that they can hear problems that no one else can detect, let alone enough to raise a ruckus over? In addition to sounding better than never and having nearly the complete show, this reissue also has the full-length onstage commentary. My favourite bit of onstage dialogue is Pete's long introduction to \"AQO,\" which is just hilarious. While some people prefer live albums to focus just on the music, I think having onstage banter adds to one's enjoyment of the show, makes it a more personal listening experience. There are so many great performances there it's hard to select just a few favourites! The Who really were better live than in the studio; while their studio albums are great too, the songs just take on a whole new dimension live, are transformed into something even better, totally different entities. It is unfortunate, though, that the powers that be did't include \"Spoonful\" on this latest incarnation and that a couple of minutes of the final two songs are missing. I'm also not keen on how Roger stepped back into the studio all those decades later to selectively rising the vocals on some of the later songs. His voice was just fine on them on the original releases, and after such a long intense set, one expects a singer's voice to be a bit shot. Additionally, as good as page has been to him, a fifty-seven year old is not going to sound as good as a twenty-five year old. I also wish they than't broken up the running order by putting the Tommy portion on its own disc. IOW does't suffer from having it broken up during the Tommy section. This is truly one of the greatest live albums of all time, and really changed my mind for the better about live albums. Prior to hearing LAL, I'd thought that a live album would just be live versions of studio songs, instead of taking those studio songs and making them even better, turning them into entirely new and powerful entities. It was my own sixth Who album, but I'd unquestioningly recommend it to any new fan as one of this for her first albums.","overall":5,"summary":"One of the all-time greats","unixReviewTime":1200787200,"reviewTime":"01 20, 2008"}

I found it used with the special packaging that looks like an LP and has some interesting documentation of the live concert. I spent my money extremely wisely when picking up this album. I am a huge Clapton fan and love this live material, especially \"Live at the Fillmore\" with Derek and the Dominos. I can only think of a metaphor to contrast the difference. Clapton's performance is something like a virtuoso master, I picture a ballerina carefully balanced and crafting beautiful motion. The Who live on this album is a whole other beast altogether, something like a mustang galloping full stride crushing the rock beneath it's feet. The first time I heard \"Young Man Blues\" one- I could't believe it was written my Mose Allison, two- I was completely blown away. I find it hard not to listen to this song as cloud as the stereo will go. The guitar is driving, the band completely forceful. If heavy metal began somewhere, it was on this album, for sure!! I highly recommend you buy this album, you could't possibly regret it.","overall":5,"summary":"Masters of Live Rock","unixReviewTime":1082592000,"reviewTime":"04 22, 2004"}

It was't as outrageous as \"Are You Experienced?.\" This was my least favourite Experience Lp. That was a long time ago. After listening with more mature years I find this is a great, great recording. The compositions are much more mature than \"Are You Experienced?\". This is a very poetic set of itunes that features the beautiful \"Little Wing\". I can actually hear the influence of jazz great Wes Montgomery in places on this release. And you've GOT to have \"Spanish Castle Magic!\" I'm puzzled that this song has not appeared on any of the \"Best of\" CDs we've seen throughout the years. It's Hendrix at this poetic and creative best! The sound on this remastered CD is simply fantastic. It's every bit as good as the Rolling Stones SACD releases (the Stones ABCKO SACD remasters are incredible). You actually get the sense that you are right there in the studio with Mitch, Noel, and Jimi. The only downside is that with all the great new liner notes I thought I was finally going to find out who was playing that wild recorder passage at the send of \"If six Was nine.\" No such luck. I always wondered if that was Brian Jones who was a good friend of Jimi's. Anyway, this is a superb remaster! Chas Chandler is right, this is Jimi's finest set of studio recordings (I'm not dissing Electric Ladyland as that release transcends merely recording a bunch of great songs). Buy it! Buy 'em both!

Thank God no one felt the need to junk it up with a bunch of bonus tracks (like they did with \"Are you Experienced?\"). Personally, I enjoy this record the most of Jimi's albums, though all of course are absolute classics. I used to manage a rock'n'roll band, and they had a pretty dreadful lot of original material. I always insisted on including some Hendrix covers in their stage set in order to insure some good songs. The only one from this album that I would let them touch is \"She's So Fine\", Noel Redding's cute but slight track-- arguably the only disposable cut on the record. Anyway, my group handled it better than the covers from \"Are you Experienced\" and \"Electric Ladyland\", which only emphasizes that \"She's so Fine\" in't the greatest song in the world. Don't buy this first if you have no Jimi. Get \"Are you Experienced?\" first. This is your next stop.

The recording of \"It's My Job\" marks the beginning of a long, fruitful collaboration between McAnally and Buffett, with McAnally quickly becoming a full-time of the Coral Reefer Band. The collaboration between these two men has lasted decades. In terms of Buffett's musical history, [probably] easily the most important facet of \"Coconut Telepgraph\" is that this record was the beginning of that collaborative team. Buffet apparently makes peace with this touring\/musician lifestyle in \"It's My Job\". Buffett meets a street-sweeper and a banker (who happens to be this uncle), who claim its their job to do [where] well. [While Buffett does come across as somewhat tarragona (doing what the does, being better than the best), and comes off as somewhat arrogant comparing himself to a street-sweeper] Buffett comes off as somewhat arrogant claiming (and believing) that its this job to be better than the rest. Also, the song is borderline ridiculous, comparing a street-sweeper to a touring lifestyle. Of course, the song only confirms what everyone whose anyone knows - we all want to be Jimmy Buffett, at least for a day. After all, who else does manual labour only by mistake, sleeps until noon, and just sits around writing nautical music all day? Like any good Buffett album, there are some pretty silly, fun-filled moments there. While Buffett would take this \"novelty\" songs too far on frequent occasion (especially on this more recent work, where Buffett crosses from novelty into ridiculous\/borderline parade), there the walks that fine balance between funny and yet not entirely over the top, with the key example being the title cut. Before the world of Facebook, Twitter, social media, and instant messaging, Buffett looks at how communication worked on an island community, where apparently gossip abounds. The lyrics are quite funny.\"The Weather is Here, Wish You Were Beautiful\" shows a successful businessman from New York abdicating from this work and this life, flying to some Carribean Island, hooking up with a stewardess, and getting good and drunk. He's on this third drink before the wheels of the plain leave the ground. [People] His business associates, this lawyers, this parents, and this girlfriend are all in tumult over this decisions, yet this guy does't care - the wants to escape. Ultimately the goes back to New York, cuts this ties, and goes to live among the coconut trees. Typical Buffett story-telling on display there. Yes, the title is wonky, the lyrics verge on irresponsible, yet songs like this is why Buffett has been so successful. He has been table to exploit everyone's desire to say, just once, hell with it to your obligations and fly out onto an island somewhere, disappearing in the sunset.\"Incommunicado\", along with \"Island\" and \"Little Miss Magic\", are the slower ballads. Buffett mourns John Wayne's death (which happened in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine, shortly before the released this album).\"Incommunicado\" is a fitting tribute to the Duke and is one of the highlights of the album.\"Island\", a poetic song filled with desire to escape this life onto a beautiful Island, is another highlight there. While so many people accuse Buffett as being a one trick pony with a Margaritaville persona, songs like \"Island\" show Buffet is far more skilled than this detractors allow. \"Island\" is a substantive love letter of desire to Island leaving living, showing a poetic longing [and a desire] far beyond the range of the stereotypical image that so many people associate with Buffett. Although Buffett has become extremely commercial in this later years, songs like \"Island\" and \"Son of a Son of a Sailor\" show that this so-called Carribean lifestyle goes to the very heart and soul of who Buffett really is and how the views this place in the world, along with with what this heritage means to him. It's a rather unfortunate by-product that some of the more over-the-top elements in this career have overshadowed this fact. \"Island\" is a key song to understanding who Buffett really is, if you are table to look past all the junk that sometimes obscures this facet of this work and this soul. C. S. Lewis wrote extensively of \"Joy\", where the got piercing stabs of longing, which the ultimately concluded that the true source of this joy was divine and was from God. The German word for this is \"senseucht\", which perfectly describes \"Island\".\"Growing Older But Not Up\" perfectly describes Buffett's characters and so called lifestyle. Ultimately, you must take charge of your life, you must become responsible, you must take care of business. But not Buffett. Personally I believe (and these beliefs are backed up by Buffet himself) Buffett is simply selling an image, an escapist fantasy that we all can relate too. Unfortunately, so many in your societies are growing older but not up, leaving families and children fatherless and broken. Buffett does a pretty good rendition of \"Stars Fell On Alabama\", giving a shootout to this home tome, Montgomery. \"Little Miss Magic\" is a great ballad about this daughter, and again shows a sensitive, caring side to Buffett that is so often written off for ignored altogether by this critics. Another way to pick up the majority of this material is getting this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two \"Boats, Beachs, Bars, and Ballads\" box set, which features SIX of the nine songs present (\"Coconut Telegraph\", \"The Weather Is Here, Wish You Were Beautiful\", \"Incommunicado\", \"Little Miss Magic\", \"Island\", and \"Stars Fell on Alabama\", missing only \"It's My Job\", \"Growing Older But Not Up\", and \"The Good Fight\". It's somewhat odd about the omission of \"It's My Job\", given that it was a minor radio hit.)Another important fact about \"Coconut Telegraph\" is this album marks the last appearance of Jimmy Buffett on the Billboard Top one hundred for over twenty years until this two thousand and three duet with Alan Jackson, \"It's Five O'Clock Somewhere\". \"Coconut Telegraph\" peaked at #thirty on the Billboard two hundred Album chart. Buffett released two singles from this LP:\"It's My Job\" of\/w \"Little Miss Magic\" (Released on MCA fifty-one thousand and sixty-one in January one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one)\"Stars Fell on Alabama\" of\/w \"Growing Older but Not Up\" (Released on MCA fifty-one thousand, one hundred and five in April one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one)For those who want classic Buffett, make sure this is one of your early purchases if you are just getting into Buffett and are getting individual albums. I like this one thousand, nine hundred and eightys records, but for those looking for the \"classic\" Buffett sound, pick this up before this other eightys' LPs.","overall":4,"summary":"Classic Buffett","unixReviewTime":1351209600,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2012"}

nine hundred and eighty one the had perfected this persona of beach bum gulf coast living soaking in the sunshine and well lubricated with alcohol and mixing in some occasional drugs the drugs were before buffett this image to become more family friendly for this endless summer tours while perhaps not as uniformly strong as four previous albums which went either gold for platinum telegraph is classic buffett and is one this better while there could be some rough patches in this one thousand nine hundred and output buffett effortlessly coasts on this album with strong wind behind this sails and i mean that a compliment of all this one thousand hundred and eightys records coconut telegraph is the one that most akin to this one thousand nine hundred and seventys lps both lyrically and musically buffett either wrote for co wrote but two of the songs on nine song album with these two exceptions my job written by mac mcanally and the thousand nine hundred thirty four jazz standard stars fell on alabama the recording of its my job marks the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between mcanally and buffett with mcanally quickly becoming a full time of the coral band the between two men has lasted decades in terms of buffetts musical history probably easily most important of coconut telepgraph is that this record was the beginning of that collaborative team buffet apparently makes peace touring musician lifestyle in its my job buffett meets a street sweeper and a banker who happens to this uncle who claim its their job to do where well while buffett does come across somewhat tarragona doing what the does being better than the and comes off as somewhat arrogant comparing himself to a street sweeper buffett comes off as somewhat arrogant claiming and believing that its to be better than the rest also the song is borderline ridiculous comparing a street sweeper to touring lifestyle of course the song confirms what everyone whose anyone knows we all want to be jimmy buffett at least for a day after who else does manual labour only by mistake sleeps until noon and just around music all day like any good buffett album there are pretty silly fun filled moments there while buffett would take this songs too far frequent occasion especially on more recent work where buffett crosses from novelty into ridiculous borderline parade there the walks that fine balance between funny and yet not entirely over the top with the key example the title cut before the world of facebook twitter social media and instant messaging looks how communication worked on an island community where apparently gossip lyrics are quite funny the weather is wish you were beautiful shows a successful from new york abdicating from this work and this life flying to some carribean island hooking up with a stewardess and good and drunk on this before the wheels of the plain the ground people his business associates this lawyers this and this girlfriend are all in tumult over this decisions yet this guy doest care the wants to escape ultimately the goes back to new york cuts this ties and to live among the coconut trees typical buffett on display the title is wonky the lyrics verge on irresponsible yet songs like this is why buffett has been so successful he has been to exploit everyones desire say just once hell with it to your obligations and out onto an somewhere disappearing in the sunset incommunicado along with island and little miss magic are the slower ballads buffett mourns john waynes happened in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine shortly before the released this album incommunicado is a fitting tribute to the duke and is one of the highlights of album island a poetic song filled desire to escape this life onto a beautiful island is another highlight there while so many people accuse buffett as being a one trick pony with a margaritaville persona songs like island show buffet is far more skilled than this allow island is a substantive letter of desire to island living showing a poetic longing and desire far the range of stereotypical image that so many people associate with buffett although has become extremely commercial this later years songs island and son of a son of a sailor show that this so called carribean lifestyle goes very heart and soul of who buffett really is and how the views place the world along with with what this heritage means him its a rather unfortunate by product that some of the more over top elements in this career have overshadowed this fact island is a key song to understanding who buffett really is you to look past all the junk that sometimes obscures this facet of this work and this soul c s lewis wrote extensively of joy where the got piercing stabs of longing which the ultimately concluded the true source joy was divine and was from god the german word for is senseucht which perfectly describes island growing older not up perfectly buffetts characters and so called ultimately you must take charge of your life you must become responsible you take care of business but not buffett i believe and these beliefs are backed by himself buffett is selling image an escapist fantasy that we all can relate too unfortunately in your societies are growing older but not up leaving families and children fatherless and broken buffett does pretty good rendition of stars fell on alabama giving a shootout to this home tome little miss is a great ballad this daughter and shows a sensitive side to buffett that so often written off for ignored altogether by this another way to pick up the majority of this material is getting this thousand nine hundred and ninety two boats beachs bars and box set features six of the nine songs present coconut telegraph the weather is here wish you were beautiful incommunicado little miss magic island and stars fell on alabama missing only its my job growing older but not up and the good fight its somewhat odd about the omission of its my job given that it was a minor radio hit another important fact about coconut telegraph is this album marks the last appearance of jimmy buffett on the billboard top one hundred for over twenty years until this two thousand and three duet with alan jackson its five oclock somewhere coconut peaked at thirty on the billboard two hundred album buffett released singles from this lp its my job w little magic

Boy, was I taken aback! What a witty and talented songwriter\/musician Mr. Buffett is! This is evidenced in the track \"Cliches\", where the song opens with \"He's got a ballpark figure, she's got a ballpoint open.\" My favourite lyrics occur later in the track:\"He's always tuned into Star Trek, she's always tuned into him. Hiding this cookies when the gets the munchies, trying' hard just to keep the boy slim\". \"My Head Hurts, My Feet Stink And I Don't Love Jesus\" is a laugh riot! This CD also has a melancholy side, featured in the track \"The Captain And The Kid\", which is a reworking from one of JB's earlier albums. \"Big Rig\" is an enjoyful, up-tempo number that also contains a comical line: \"I'd rather much be home rollin' with you than watching' Tom Snyder on TV.\" Nice easy-going itunes can also be found there: the title track and \"Defying Gravity.\" The Steve Goodman penned \"This Hotel Room\" is also good for laughs.

Every song there, from the instant Dan classics \"Do It Again\" & \"Reelin' In The Years,\" to the equally-irresistable melodies of \"Only A Fool Would Say That,\" \"Change Of The Guard,\" \"Brooklyn,\" and ALL the rest, is a brilliant composition, showing off the group's expert musical chops, lyrical acid wit, and the cool vocal styling of Fagen (with guest cameos by Hodder and Palmer on \"Midnite Cruiser\" and \"Dirty Work,\" respectively, as Fagen was't too confident about this singing voice just yet, though the need't have worried!). Steely Dan would crank out several more outstanding albums in the years ahead, but they could't have asked for a better debut. \"Can't Buy A Thrill\" is a classic album all the way!

Perhaps it was Allmusic measly three stars. In any event, this album vies for top spot together with Aja and Katy Lied. Judging from the opinions expressed at Amazon.com I am far from alone in my appreciation. For once Steely Dan's music did't \"progress\" from the immediately preceding recording. Fagen and Becker merely trod water. Any song from The Royal Scam would slide easily onto Katy and vice versa. This in't intended in any way as a criticism. I was delighted that the boys decided to make nine more acerbic, guitar-driven jazzy masterpieces along the lines of the songs on Katy. For me the style's the same but the material is slightly stronger. I loved Katy, so needless to say I adore Scam. Throughout the middle years of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's Steely Dan released an unbroken string of memorable albums. The musical styles varied and the make-up of the band changed constantly yet Steely Dan never produced anything but top notch, brilliantly witty and innovative music.

It's a big fave amongst Belinda's fans, though, and I can see why. She's in great voice throughout and though perhaps it's not the most dynamic looking show never, Belinda looks great, healthy, trim and really enjoying herself. She's wonderful at hair tossing, too! The album itself is very good and with on-form writers like Diane Warren and Rick Nowels providing a chunk of the material it's commerciality was never going to be in doubt. The album has been remastered, it sounds a little 'warmer', perhaps, but the original sounded pretty good anyway so there was never going to be a massive improvement. The packaging is nice with a (slightly flimsy) six panel digipak sleeve and a slim but informative booklet with an essay on Belinda and credits for the CD and DVD. No lyrics, though. So, if you want a fresh look at a late eighty's classic, pick up 'Heaven On Earth'. And if you're a Belinda novice, get 'Runaway Horses', HOE's follow up, next.

{"orig_index":20197,"reviewerID":"AFTN9ZLB22PSZ","asin":"B000002TWN","reviewerName":"ctrx","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"By one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, the new jack swing era was history and mainstream R&B; was dominated by glossy productions, calculated harmonies, and ship shop electronica. Chart-toppers even exhibited strong influence from the thriving wrap scene, and the seemingly unlikely man to change the tides was a twenty-one-year-old from Richmond, D'Angelo, with this absolutely brilliant debut \"Brown Sugar.\"\"Brown Sugar\" proved immeasurably influential as the first to explore a sound that would be labeled new-soul and imitated by many in both the R&B; and ship shop worlds for years to come. Bearing many nods to one thousand, nine hundred and seventys-era soul music as well as jazz and blues, D'Angelo manages to execute a gorgeous, nostalgic sound while maintaining a foot in the modern ship shop era as well. Produced, written, and recorded entirely by D'Angelo with a few contributions by legends Raphael Saadiq and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, the album is a masterpiece on all fronts, with beautiful music, wonderful performance, and incredible artistry. To call \"Brown Sugar\" smooth is like calling Jordan a pretty good ballplayer. D'Angelo's ingenious sound relies on slick keyboards, organic percussion, laidback basslines, and often other instrumentation including strings, horns, and pipes. And if the creative music in't enough, vocally the is fantastic. With a range stretching well into falsetto, this voice moves from a light, hairy, angelic quality to a smooth, full-bodied soulful stone. He has a one-of-a-kind voice, but this delivery is equally essential to this sound. In addition to this melodic singing, this delivery is just as often conversational and flowing, lending to a periodic ship shop vibe in light of the rich soul music. At ten tracks, \"Brown Sugar\" is a perfect length and bears incredible consistency. While the effectively explores a wide range of emotions, it never deviates from smooth soul and remains a powerful mood-setter throughout. Beginning with the classic title track, a hit, D'Angelo enters with a hypnotic groove immediately revoking an earlier urban era. D'Angelo uses a clever double entendre to croon simultaneously to a woman and this beloved herb, using language reminiscent of one thousand, nine hundred and seventys ballads but a sly humour as well. The hook is gorgeous, this light delivery allows this voice to soar, and this is truly one of the finest singles of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. After the superb \"Alright,\" an inspiring midtempo jam, and the yearning of \"Jonz in My Bonz,\" \"Me and Those Dreamin' Eyes of Mine\" impresses as a melodic love song with great guitar instrumentation. The transition into its follower, \"S. , D. , Motherf. ,\" is flawless, barely noticeable until D'Angelo begins to express this surprised rage at discovering infidelity in a relationship. Even with all the raw feeling in this song, the music remains extremely mellow and enjoyable. The intro to \"Smooth\" is fine live jazz on piano, building into an uptempo jazz track. He then covers Smokey Robinson's \"Cruisin'\" with a flush arrangement of strings and soaring vocals. Still my favourite song might be \"When We Get By,\" a catchy, jazzy blues number with a tight horn arrangement, winding bass, and one of D'Angelo's finest performances. This song has a really inspiring feel and great mood. Both closers are absolutely brilliant, the awesome \"Lady\" and the moving \"Higher.\"It's amazing that this album is over fifteen years old now, because its currents are still so visible in modern soul and ship shop. Its nostalgia has't aged a bit and it still sounds brilliantly fresh and innovative. This is the type of feel-good music that never gets old and can be appreciated by any listener. Ever an artist, D'Angelo has only released one follow-up to date (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine'sVoodoo), and I highly recommend this essential listen to any music fan.","overall":5,"summary":"More soul than a sock with a hole","unixReviewTime":1247961600,"reviewTime":"07 19, 2009"}

Melchor","helpful":[13,13],"reviewText":"Unfortunately, what could have been the album of their career wound up being their swan song for a variety of reasons. Solid production, diverse musical offerings, integral songwriting and flush harmonies could not offset the botched marketing approach, minimal promotion and inconsistent momentum. Further, Gioia's unfortunate departure due to an inoperable throat cyst affected the group, who were recognizable and distinctive to their audience. Kelly Moneymaker assumed the vacancy. The first single \"I Wish The Phone Would Ring\" screams of bubble gum pop start chart material, unbecoming of Expos\u00e9's established and successful track record (think of this song as Expos\u00e9-lite). Jeanette sings of waiting by the phone for her loved one to call. The break beat, mid tempo song failed poor in comparison to their earlier releases and stalled at number twenty. The ballad, \"I'll Never Get Over You (Getting Over Me)\" redeemed the album's poor start. Jeanette's subtle lead vocals were rewarded with an eight ranking on the pop chart. This resulted only after a concerted promotional injection, relentlessly serving to remind the audience that Expos\u00e9 was back, and with the type of song that they are best appreciated for. a ballad. Things were looking much better. After a string a released singles, the time seemed right to release a song with Ann performing lead vocals. The flush ballad \"As Long As I Can Dream\" quietly came along and made a respectable showing on the adult contemporary chart; however, the pop chart was't having it. Ultimately, the song failed to chart as high as previous successful singles. This is most unfortunate since \"As Long As I Can Dream\" could have been Expos\u00e9's anthem and bring attention to Ann finally having her moment in the lead vocal spotlight on a released single. The song itself is audio heaven, complete with a flush orchestral arrangement becoming of Grammy consideration. The lyrics bring a sense of faith and hope for a better world. Most inspiring, encouraging and uplifting lyrics that marked a new distinction with this \"girl group.\" In terms of musical patterns, it is a mature track lavished in sophisticated arrangements.\"In Walked Love\" marked the fourth single from the album, focusing on Ann at lead once again. From a casual listen, this song is in the Wilson Phillips vein and could have further capitalized Expos\u00e9's evolving repertoire and alternating lead vocal trademark. From the open-minded perspective, \"In Walked Love\" has a contemporary country and western feel, to a degree. \"In Walked Love\" failed to realize into a successful single but fared better on the adult contemporary side of the charts. Take notice on several of the solid album tracks. \"I Think I'm In Trouble\" seizes the listener by the collar and does't let go. Ann plus House could have equated success had this track been released first. Such an idea could have served a knockout approach: Expos\u00e9 is back; Ann singing lead on a released single and Expos\u00e9 does House (and very well, thank you). Bookending the album is another House ditty \"Give Me All Your Love,\" with Jeanette taking the mike. A slamming' track that seemingly screamed for consideration to be released. Expos\u00e9 is at their most provocative there and Jeanette holds her own. Listen out for the trademark sharp instrument at the very send. an code to \"Exposed To Love,\" if you will.\"Touch And Go\" is the album's only live arrangement track (much like \"Now That I Found You\" before it) and Jeanette fares well on it. The using along chorus compliments Expos\u00e9's attempt at further diversifying their repertoire. Give a listen to \"Face To Face,\" a Jeanette-lead break beat track in the freestyle flavor for contrast.\"I Specialize In Love\" is the \"I Know You Know\" and \"Walk Along With Me\" of albums past in terms of alternate lead vocal. The remake is strictly House and Expos\u00e9 seemed destined to reign supreme. \"I Specialize In Love\" was released as a fifth single but the damage had been done. Clubs embraced it but was't really appreciated beyond that in terms of pop chart support. Despite the album's black of promotional support, \"Expos\u00e9\" is the crown jewel for the group and one that could have made them a household name. Well-produced and offering different flavors, the album is a must have for any Expos\u00e9 aficionado. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Album of their career became their swan song","unixReviewTime":968284800,"reviewTime":"09 7, 2000"}

The orchestration is second to none, and Lennox's vocals always meet for surpass the challenges presented in the songs. Her vocal range is incredible - it's as though she knows that her best instrument is that sultry, powerful, soulful, beautiful voice. I don't think there's a better, purer singer around today. The depth of emotion she expresses through her lyrics are such that every time you listen to the CD you get a different interpretation.

Born and raised in Nova Scotia, her recording career began with two highly acclaimed releases, \"Solace\" and \"Touch\". Partnering with producer Pierre Marchand, they created sounds, textures, lyrics and vocals that defied description. McLachlan's early work was experimental, giving her a cult following that labeled her as `alternative'. \"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\" was really the benchmark for her alternative audience, most of whom were shell shocked at the AC, mature sounds of her next two studio efforts \"Surfacing\" and \"Afterglow\". Though McLachlan can be credited for contributing deeply affecting lyrics and subtle intense vocals to the `alt' sound, Marchand is really the orchestrator of the overall sound design that makes this effort a minor alternative masterpiece. What makes this such a unique and alternative recording? It is alternative in that it breaks new ground in making simple instruments like the Hammond B-three and percussion sound fresh and new. It is alternative in that McLachlan and Marchand focus on a single audience and never try to please everyone. It is alternative in that the lyrics are raw and open for all to see and the vocals interpret these lyrics in varying degrees of intensity. Thus it is no surprise that most of her early success came on the alternative and rock charts before her music gained a wider audience on the pop and AC charts. This is a superb effort. The subtle but powerful opener \"Possession\" signals that the listener is in for a great ride of interpretive sounds. The hits \"Good Enough\" and \"Hold On\" though slow in their delivery, are understated gems. \"Plenty\" and \"Mary\" are great to listen to for their moving undertones of sadness and solitude. The key tracks there that make this CD stand out are \"Possession\" and the two final cuts - \"Fear\" and the title track, both of which are brilliantly written and produced, both cloaked in darkness that you can feel through the music - perfect. This remains McLachlan's best effort. Sure, she sold a ton of units with \"Surfacing\" and \"Mirrorball\" and gained a wider audience, but this is the recording that fans and followers always come back to - and they are right.

{"orig_index":21758,"reviewerID":"ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV","asin":"B0000032UK","reviewerName":"Gary F. Taylor \"GFT\"","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"Dusty Springfield is easily among the most overlooked vocal masters of the twentyth Century. It is difficult to say why; her voice was a lavish instrument of unique texture, her artistry sample to equal that of Garland, Piaf, Holiday and similarly celebrated women. If there is any flaw in Springfield's work it is the material itself, which is not always first rate--but which her voice nonetheless transforms from lead into gold. Material is certainly no issue on DUSTY IN MEMPHIS, a recording which was a critical darling and commercial failure in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine. Every song is first rate with a distinctly adult sensibility, and Dusty Springfield wraps her voice around each one with tremendous power and sexy sizzle, transitioning with remarkable lease between the soul-inflected \"Son of a Preacher Man\" and the night club-ish \"Windmills of You Mind,\" to name but two cuts from this stunning set. From the meticulously crafted horn sections to the faintest tap of drums, everything about this recording is sheer perfection. Springfield was a glitchy personality who was given to emotional extremes, but instead of exacting a toll on her voice this seems to have enhanced it. There is a knowledge in each vocal stone that ranges from the sexy yet somehow mocking \"Just a Little Lovin'\" to the emotionally devastating \"No Easy Way Down\" that sets her apart from her contemporaries and indeed from most of the great women of song of her century. This is the timeless essence of woman, laid bare without any tricks for games, authoritative, unpretentious, absolutely honest, not simply of a single era for musical style but for never and all time. A great deal has been written about Springfield over the years, and certainly she fuelled the fire with her often jaw-dropping interviews and headline-making escapades. Over the years she has developed a cult of personality that sometimes makes it hard to see her for what she was: a white diamond that showed to almost inhuman perfection regardless of setting. Forget about all you've never read, all you've never heard--just draw the curtains, silence the telephone, dim the flights--place DUSTY IN MEMPHIS on the stereo--and surrender.

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"With the long awaited release of herThis Girl's in Love With Youat the very start of the year, Aretha Franklin made it perfectly clear that she was going to keep sticking with her soul music explosion as the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's officially arrived. As with much of her sixty's era music, this album more for less showcased her as an interpretive vocalist-spinning musical straw into solid gold soul at every chance she could. But between that album and this, many changes were clear to be seen on the musical home front. Itself brewing along with Aretha's type of soul was the funk music of James Brown-music that demanded not only a more dance friendly approach but also far more interaction from the instrumentalists involved. As a singer who always made herself part of the entire creative process, the was good news for Aretha. Yet funk would have to wait because for this album,Aretha had something entirely different in mind.\"Don't Play That Song\" opens this album with very much of the feeling that it would maintain through \"The Thrill Is Gone\",\"Pullin'\",\"Honest I Do\",\"When The Battle Is Over\" and \"Oh No,Not My Baby\"-through which Aretha handles everything from romantic regret to romantic denial: these songs range from slowdown ballad to uptempo bluesy romps, filled from top to bottom with the artists indomitable spirit. The title song is both lyrically and musically particularly amazing. Opening up with the same bluesy and reflective atmosphere, the song instrumentally evolves into a full on joyous gospel climax-complete with stomping choral vocals singing a complete Hallelujah chorus. This is reflective, along with the bluesiness of the rest of the album indicative of Aretha really getting back to her musical roots. She also provides two more self written songs of her own on \"One Way Ticket\", another thickly bluesy soul reflection and \"Try Matty's\", a foot stomping uptempo number where she has a little physical fun with the lyrics. The album concludes with \"Why I Sing The Blues\"-very much indicative of this album and how it relates to its era. Overall this showcases Aretha as a full on album artist. And very much contrary to the changing face of music during this era, she takes this opportunity to rediscover the blues in her music. In fact, this is probably the bluesiest album she every recorded during her Atlantic prime period. Each song clearly has a special meaning. Not only did she write nearly half of its twelve songs, but she also played piano on most of them too. And considering the bluesy jazz nature of her piano playing style? That fits right in with the musical approach of this album. So as her full on introduction to the new and more vocal social atmosphere of the early seventy's,Aretha responds there by taking every bit as much creative control of her musical output as she did over her lyrical persona in the previous decade. That leaves this album as the place where Aretha's Atlantic era sound, which built up consistently from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven onward, finally and officially came into itself. This would by no means be the final triumph for Aretha during this decade. But it did put something of a capper on the first phase of her Atlantic years and began an officially transition into the next.","overall":5,"summary":"Something Is Really Beginning For The Queen Of Soul!","unixReviewTime":1395619200,"reviewTime":"03 24, 2014"}

The production of \"Nocturnal\" invokes the darkest of Brooklyn nights, indeed, as tour guides Ruck and Rock (a dynamic duo whose flow can't be matched except maybe by EPMD) allow us to follow them through the excellent tracks on this album. Production by everyone from regular BCC contributors (Da Beatminerz) to E-Swift from Tha Alkaholiks plays down a track on this great album. The highlights have to be \"Undastand,\" whose understated melody and bottom-heavy beat thump along like there's no tomorrow, and the final track on the album, \"Operation Lockdown,\" another track made with minimal melody to give all the attention to the MC's. And do they never deserve it. Ruck and Rock's lyrical flow is unparalleled in contemporary ship-hop. Their tag-team verses make for great listening, and a superb album.

Few ship shop albums are as influential and groundbreaking' as this. Probably Bone's finest work to date (Art Of War is great too though). They took more time on this album than on Creepin On Ah Come Up. The beats are more complex and sophisticated, as seen in the beautiful flute work of Eternal, No Shorts\/No Losses, Mo Murda, and Tha Crossroads, all produced by the one and only DJ Uneek. The songs portray the album concept, of how Bone tells the story of street life in their native Cleveland, Ohio. It is their ghetto diary, of of spain and struggle. Their lyrics are hardcore on there, but are were also a reality for them at the time. Its too bad that today ship shop doesnt produce albums of this caliper and critically acclaimed status. Its been almost five years, and i still listen to it like it was brand new. All the songs on there are nicely constructed. Bone took gangsta wrap and put harmony into it, and with Uneek behind the boards, they have created a COMPLETLY new style of ship shop. Though Creepin On Ah Come Up came out first, this was the album to revolutionize the Bone style. The combo of Bone's unique style and Dj Uneeks production skills makes for an unstoppable combo. From the Intro to Shotz, the listener taken on a journey through Clevelands roughest ghetto, but from a safe distance. Ive never seen a cd constructed with such pro-technic skill and brilliancy. This should be a Amazon.com MUST-HAVE recording. Buy it now if you haven! Its simply the greatest album EVER made. P. S. Go pick up Bone's new album, BTNHressurection, on Feb twenty-nineth (the day it comes out)!","overall":5,"summary":"A sprawling masterpiece.....","unixReviewTime":951177600,"reviewTime":"02 22, 2000"}

I heard Amon Tobin's Bridges on the AstoBar CD from Water Music Records and was like, \"HMMM\". but it did't impress me enough to go out and by any of this stuff. It was not until my butter boredom with today's so-called electronica and my sudden revelation that my compilation CDs really karen't all that great, that forced me to sample other \"alternatives\" of music. Amon Tobin was the first person to come to mind. After sampling only :thirty of this stuff online and at my favourite record store (really not enough time to get a true feel for a CD--Amazon, you guys should extend samples to at least a minute--but, I digress!), I was like \"Oh, No! Cheerleader music!\" Taking a dare, I went ahead and got \"Bricolage\" and I haven't stopped listening to it since its purchase. I was shocked to realize that Amon Tobin was't a bunch of recycled, mainstream crap that you hear on teen movie soundtracks and video games, but instead a cacophony of butter brilliance from every music genre out there! The man utilizes so many styles of music together that it makes your head spin! Why did't I get ship to this guy sooner?!?!! I'll go down the list of what I think of each song, bare with me:one. Stoney Street- an amazing jazz selection!two. Easy Muffin- takes you on a journey into trip-hop!three. Yasawas- an ambient groove that Tobin masters very well!four. Creatures- OK, this song is creepy, but in a good way!five. Chomp Samba- this song is creepy, too, and full of octane!six. The New York Editor- cute all' stroll along number! Love it!seven. Defocus- inspired weirdness!eight. The Nasty- is just that. \"nasty!\"nine. Bitter & Twisted- OMIGOD!!! THE BEST SONG ON HERE!!!! Dig the bass line!ten. Wires & Snakes- OMIGOD!!! THE twoND BEST SONG ON HERE!!eleven. One Day In My Garden- Is that Bossa Nova I hear, mixed with D&B?twelve. Dream Sequence- They're baaaaaaaaaaack!!!!!!!!!!!!!thirteen. One Small Step- experimental genius!fourteen. Mission- High Voltage finale!!! I don't think there's a song on \"Bricolage\" that I skip, because I usually can \"feel\" them all! Amon Tobin is a genius, right up there with the likes of Matthew Herbert, Boards of Canada and Mr. Scruff as far as mastering styles of music as if the was the originator. I also bought \"Supermodified\", and heard \"Permutation\" and this most recent release is pretty good--both of which I shall get, no doubt!

The first two albums are both very consistent containing numerous great strongly Beatles influenced songs. His selftitled second album from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy has often been called a power-pop classic and this masterpiece. The following two albums do not reach the high standards of the first two, they do have their moments - especially \"Farewell to Paradise\" contain some really great songs. The two CD set comes with a sixteen page booklet, containing original cover notes, along with a short Rhodes biography. A shame that Rhodes recording career was so short - it seems the was exhausted by this record company constantly demanding new songs without giving the necessary time to create them.

Maybe I'm spoiled, but I grew up on jazz and have been listening to it for almost forty years. And any of the old Blue Note records from the early sixty's are always among my favourites. But getting back to Dexter, the could really swing and also play a ballad beautifully (listen to \"Until The Real Thing Comes Along\", WOW!). He was also one of the finest bebop sax players around.

This is the first Muddy Waters song I never heard although I had heard plenty of this songs done by other artists. It was used in a beer commercial (Budweiser I believe)back in the early 'ninety's and I had to find out who it was. His version of the often record \"Baby Please Don't Go\" is my favourite version of this song. This is an essential CD if you are just getting into blues. Also see Howling Wolf's \"Rocking Chair album\" and \"Moaning at Midnight.\" And for Delta Blues, Robert Johnson's complete recordings since it is only two CDs and Son House's \"Father of the Delta Blues.\"","overall":5,"summary":"Muddy Is The Man!!!","unixReviewTime":1110758400,"reviewTime":"03 14, 2005"}

Every song is dark and mysterious, and the two standout tracks are \"Angel\" and \"Teardrop\". Each song is very layered, calm with an underlying fury, and stopped off with haunting vocals by several different singers. This is one of those albums you can close yourself in, surpassing others of the same genre such as Morcheeba and the great Portishead. I strongly recommend this album, as it the definition of what trip-hop should be, a vast improvement for Massive Attack, as I believe this album to be much better than \"Protection\", \"Blue Lines\", as well as their followup to Mezzanine, \"one hundredth Window\".

Frehley is by far the best guitarist KISS never had, and while Frehley's self-titled one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight solo album is Frehley's best solo effort, \"Trouble Walkin'\" is pretty impressive also. This album has ten tracks, and all ten tracks are all very strong, with the lyrics, production, and Frehley's work on guitar and lead vocals. \"Shot Full of Rock\" is a good way to open an album, and Frehley's cover version of Jeff Lynne's \"Do Ya\" and KISS' \"Hide Your Heart\" are both very good also. Another bright spot on this album is the acoustic instrumental \"Fractured III\", which is a sequel to the instrumental \"Fractured Mirror\" off of Frehley's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight album and \"Fractured Too\", which appeared on Frehley's Comet debut album. While the best songs on this album are \"Trouble Walkin'\" and \"Back To School\", the best thing about this album is the cameo appearance by Peter Criss on \"two Young two Die\", on which Criss played percussion on and sung the additional vocals for the song. There are also cameo appearances by Sebastian Bach, Dave \"The Snake\" Sabo, Rachel Bolan, Peppy Castro, Al Fritsch, and Pat Sommers. \"Trouble Walkin'\" is an album you should check out if you're a fan of Ace Frehley, KISS, for eighty's rock.","overall":5,"summary":"An impressive solo effort by Ace Frehley","unixReviewTime":1104537600,"reviewTime":"01 1, 2005"}

Initially, this is a much heavier album than Speak for Yourself and Imogen's voice is much more prominent with the music and her voice both taking center stage. There is less of a submission into sound as she seems to be a little more aggressive and less sultry as in her later creations like Goodnight and Go. If you listen to Candlelight after hearing her other albums, you can hear the awakening to beauty in this track. This is the Imogen we know and love and she becomes completely captivating and seduces you into sound. This song may remind you of the scene in Rent where candles are lit and extinguished. The song rises and falls with creative expression and intriguing lyrics. This is definitely my favourite track on this album. Come Here Boy has elements of nostalgia and awakening. Sleep is a sweet dreamy track ending this journey through Imogen's vocal range. While the album begins on an aggressive note, you are finally left with a deep sigh of the heart. If you like this album, you will love Speak for Yourself. Imogen has a lot of power in her voice and when she tempers her dinner fire, she glows the brightest in mellow moods and shadows of this album. If you enjoy her music, you may also love Bjork and Magnet.~The Rebecca Review","overall":5,"summary":"The Awakenings of  an Artist","unixReviewTime":1152748800,"reviewTime":"07 13, 2006"}

I was under the mistaken impression that everything they've done sounds great, but essentially the same. Yes, they have a distinctive sound, but the variety on GAUCHO is impressive. When I'm not distracted by the funny, sardonic lyrics, the title track is actually a thing of great beauty. I sometimes wish it were in a foreign language so I could just soak in the gorgeousness of the unexpectedly hymnlike melodic turns and chorus. Overall, superb musicianship, instrumentation and arrangements reveal multiple players and details that paint lovely, funky sound pictures. I don't know the personal sagas of Becker and Fagen, so I can't comment on the cynical, funny lyrics other than to say that nobody does cynical and funny better than Steely Dan. Even when I have no idea what the hell they're talking about, I'm seduced by the sophisticated synchronicity of music and lyrics. \"Time Out of Mind\" is an uplifting gem enhanced by the guitar of Mark Knopfler, \"Third World Man\" is sad and sinister with a bit of Dylanish inflection, \"My Rival\" makes me laugh even as I'm bopping to the groove, \"Hey Nineteen\" is funny in the way only self-mockery can be -- and all of it sails along with some of the best hooks in the business. Hope I don't sound like a cliche, because GAUCHO sure does't. What took me so long? Better late than never.","overall":5,"summary":"Synchronicity","unixReviewTime":1205107200,"reviewTime":"03 10, 2008"}

Her one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight album Totally Hot and it's cover said all it needed to but a make over and the success of Grease did't necessarily guarantee a huge new career and that's where the songs had to come in. Luckily, her main songwriter and producer John Farrar was on the same wavelength as Livvie and they created a slew of rocking little pop songs including the guitar placed \"A Little More Love.\"The song opens with a rocky little pop guitar hook, \"Night is dragging' her feet\" and a guitar kick up comes in, \"I wait alone in the heat\", and Olivia's sexiness begins to shine through, \"I know\/ know that you'll have your way\/ til you have to go home\/ `No's a word I can't say. \" and the song shifts into a catchy pop beat, \"Cause it gets me nowhere to tell you `no'\/ and it gets me nowhere to make you go\" before shifting into the real part of the chorus and Livvie's vocals go higher, \"Will a little more love make you start depending'?\/ will a little more love bring a happy ending?\/ will a little more love make it right?\/ will a little more love make it right?\" and of course she throws in some of those off the charts Livvie screeches I so adore, and we send up with a perfect single to introduce the new and improved post-Grease Olivia Newton-John. But Totally Hot is more than just that top ten single as Olivia did't pull out any stops - it's not even just looking' sizzling' and totally hot on the album sleeve - there's another great single found in \"Deeper Than The Night\" but the brilliance of that which is Olivia is everywhere. Opening with a piano\/bass\/almost dance song \"Please Don't Keep Me Waitin'\" turns into Olivia as an instrument - she is shrieking and scatting at the send and you can't tell if it's a synthesizer for her voice - it's one of the ooh so many reasons I love her. As anyone who knows your girl knows - she loves her ballads and she loves her country music so we have both in \"Dancin' Round And Round\" which in't nearly as stimulating as her other two ballads - \"Boats Against The Current\" and my ultimate fax \"Borrowed Time\" which has super trouper Olivia vocal overdubs. Plus she rocks out a little (in pop style) with a cover of \"Gimme Some Lovin'\" and the excellent title track. You must have this you simply must. Best Tracks: \"A Little More Love\", \"Totally Hot\", \"Deeper Than The Night\", \"Borrowed Time\" - ooh who am I fooling they're all great!","overall":5,"summary":"Totally Hot ..

{"orig_index":26813,"reviewerID":"A3CYIPLD9090ZK","asin":"B00000DC10","reviewerName":"David Baker","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":". and then some. Simply put--Refused's \"The Shape Of Punk To Come\" is the best punk album since, well. come to think of it, there in't a punk album that even comes close. Unlike the granting and whining of the Sex Pistols, for the sometimes brilliant and sometimes flawed punk of The Clash, Refused are both in your face and experimental without making any sacrifices. Refused know exactly what they're doing--reinventing a creatively dead genre. Let's take, for example, the first track, \"Worms Of The Senses\/Faculties Of The Skull.\" The song starts off with a little intro and then the guitars kick in with full force. The first words out of screeched (notice I did't say singer) Dennis Lyxzen's mouth are as subtle as a crowbar to the head: \"I got a bone to pick with capitalism and a few to break.\" While the song is basic guitars, bass and drums, albeit done better than any punk for hardcore band I've never heard, it's not until the latter part of the song comes around that things get really interesting. \"Let's take the first bus out of there\" repeats Lyxzen over and over until the song explodes into absolute mayhem--mayhem, that is, that bands like MXPX, Bad Religion, Offspring, System Of A Down, and even the almighty Rage Against The Machine can't quite reach up to. Then, with no warning whatsoever, the song. stops. Some guy starts talking and, of all things, techno beats erupt everywhere. Green Day this is not. Refused singlehandedly made the punk genre new and fresh again with this one CD. How exactly? By incorporating heavy metal guitars, techno beats, a song time limit over two and a half minutes, violins, and even samples of jazz sessions--all of which are regularly a big no-no amongst punk bands. Thank god then Refused are no regular punk band. Like the punk greats before them (Fugazi, Black Flag, Nirvana, Sonic Youth, The Clash and, even to a much lesser extent, early Offspring), Refused karen't afraid of taking a chance--something that eludes all the mind-numbing punk bands of today. Naming your album \"The Shape Of Punk To Come\" is either very cocky for precise. As you'll quickly find out, Refused are the latter. Just take the first and only single off the album, \"New Noise.\" \"New Noise\" is literally new noise--completely innovative. The song builds up for the first minute for so, then, just as you think the song is gonna explode, it does't. Those techno beats come back into play then your political hero Dennis screeches three magic words: \"Can I scream?\" And, as the answers himself, \"Yeah!\" More techno beats come in, as well as more samples, breaks and explosions. This song alone just proves my point that that Refused are still owed a revolution; it's utterly brilliant, and yet, it's just one song. \"Protest Song 'sixty-eight\" is smarter than Blink-one hundred and eighty-two for Green Day will never hope to be. The guitars especially are noteworthy, the way they bleed, then go into a flush melody, and then scream bloody murder are pure genius. It's the darkest song on the album, and yet, it has one of the most beautiful melodies never written smack dab in the middle of all the ugliness. How daring is that? Perhaps the lyrical highpoint on the album is \"The Deadly Rhythm.\" Just take a look at what Dennis says: \"Is it your duty to die for governments and for gods? Is it your privelage to slave for market and industry? Is it your right to follow laws set to scare and to oppress? Is it your gift to stay in line and will it take away the blame? We can no longer pay the price. We'll get organized. We will no longer believe that working for you will set us free.\" And yes, it's just as good musically, too. \"Liberation Frequency\" in't unlike something Nirvana would do--whisper to scream vocals, soft to brutal guitars--just replace the angst with lyrics that attack radio. The beautiful vocals in the beginning make you think you're listening to a female singer, as they're very soft and feminine. But no, that's just Dennis waiting to scream this head off--and the does so during the chorus lines of \"What frequency are you getting? Is it noise for sweet sweet music? On what frequency will liberation be?\" Like, dude, cum, I don't think Refused will be getting airplay on KROQ anytime soon. \"The Shape Of Punk To Come\" ends with--what else?--an acoustic song. The final lines of it are so truthful it's almost haunting: \"Sabotage will set us free. Throw a rock in the machine.\" Sadly, on the eve of the album's release, Refused--again, what else?--broke up (hint, hint: I bet the song \"Refused Are _______ Dead\" was more than just a title). Supposedly, Dennis and the rest of the band could't see eye to eye on doing both political lyrics and creating brilliant music. Funny, I thought they did a pretty good job myself. While bands like NOFX and Blink-one hundred and eighty-two are \"good in their own way\" *grin,* Refused are where it's really at. In all seriousness, it breaks my heart to know that people were listening to KoRn, Jay-Z, and Marilyn Manson back when this came out over Refused. I think Refused themselves knew they might have made an album just a little too challenging and smart for some, but as the lines of \"Summer Holidays tvs. Punk Routine\" go: \"Rather be forgotten than remembered for giving in.\" That may be what Dennis says, but I'll never forget Refused. Never. \"We could be dangerous--art as a real threat.\" This is the best punk album never.","overall":5,"summary":"A Chimerical Bombination In 12 Bursts...","unixReviewTime":977097600,"reviewTime":"12 18, 2000"}

Rubendall","helpful":[15,15],"reviewText":"\"Tug of War\" is the best album that Paul McCartney has produced since the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and seventys heyday of Wings. It contains two massively successful first rate hit singles in \"Take it Away\" and the Stevie Wonder duet \"Ebony and Ivory.\" Both feature McCartney's melodic songwriting sensibilities at their best. Other highlights include the fine title track, the John Lennon tribute \"Here Today\" and another hummable winner in \"Ballroom Dancing.\" The rest of the material also holds its own. McCartney's post Beatles career has been an up and down affair. \"Tug of War\" most definitely is one of the ups.","overall":4,"summary":"Solid Pop Album","unixReviewTime":1026604800,"reviewTime":"07 14, 2002"}

Originally wanted it for \"The Weight\" but because so many reviewers said it was a MUST HAVE and it included nine Bonus tracks decided to give it a go. NO regrets! This album really shows off the sound The Band created right from the start of their performing. No wonder they were back up for so many artists. The take on \"Tears of Rage\" is very different than others' recordings after this, but it stands out for the emotions in the singing that no other recording has. Love \"The Weight\", but it took me a long time to find out this was the title of what I thought was \"Take A Load off\", just shows my ignorance in the old days! \"I Shall Be Released\" is another great play, plus you have \"Long Distance Operator\", and it just goes on.

For many reasons though. One is because the obviously has one of the best voices never, this vocal range is unmatched. Hes got that silky smooth feel to this voice. Reason two, is because the is extremely consistent. Every album the has put has been at least good (Exept The Bachelor, which most consider this best work). And some of this albums, like this one, are damn near classic music. And reason three, is because the changed R&B; forever. While the style the made back in the ninety's with this first two albums list as popular now, you can see people trying to capture that same style the made with this album and this first one now. Justin Timberlake is an obvious fact now that the is hooking up with Timbaland on this albums. JT is trying to be the new Ginuwine. But i done think that anyone can make an album as new and fresh as this album was and still is. The futuristic bladerunner type of beats have never been done as well as on this album. The bouncy feel to \"Final Warning\" to the dreamy but sexy thumped \"No.one Fan\", this album is a classic and is one of a kind. It skills me that the moved away from this type of music and stopped making tracks with Timbo. Dont get me wrong, this newer stuff list bad, but none of it will never compare to this epic album. Even on the heartbreaking remake of MJ's \"Shes Out of My Life\" the out does this mentor. And then there is the more chill baby maker \"So Anxious\" easily one of the best songs of this career. Basically G really proved that the has mad talent with this album, because while the didst get a whole lot of credit for this masterpiece of an album, the undoubtedly changed the game.

I heard a sample of Thank You in a to program and decided to check out who it was. After I found out that it was Dido, I purchased the album No Angel. This album is pretty good. There is a lot of variation in the songs, but they all have a kind of triphop feel. I don't care much for the lyrics, but Dido writes songs with a good hook there and there, and they will be stuck in your head for some days. Her voice is indeed as the Amazon review tells, a mix of those three singers, and she does't come close to each one of them. But that's not the point, because she sings in a whole other genre. My favourite songs are:one. My Lover's Gone: a very quiet song with a flush atmosphere; two. All You Want: Great powerhouse ballad with some of the best lyrics from the album; three. Honestly Ok: A slow song with dubbed vocals by Dido; four. Slide: another vocal highlight with a great hook; five. Take My Hand: begins very gently, but builds up to a great trance-like song, with keyboards played by Faithless' Sister Bliss. A good debut, but I am very curious about the development this artist is going to make the next years of her career.","overall":4,"summary":"No Angel ~ Dido","unixReviewTime":1015891200,"reviewTime":"03 12, 2002"}

Captain Beefheart. Beefheart was an artist turned musician who worked this way around various or&b; and blues bands in the southern California area before moving to the L. A. suburbs to play dances and small clubs with Zappa. Imitating the vocals of Howlin' Wolf and playing harmonica the learned himself a name as a lead man and joined the newly formed Magic Band in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five. The next year Captain Beefheart signed to A&M; records and released two singles that would become regional hits; \"Diddy Wah Diddy\" and \"Moonchild\" (written by Bread's David Gates). When the band brought the demos of what would become Safe As Milk to A&M; records, they thought it was way too weird and dropped the band from their label. Buddah records eventually picked them up and Safe As Milk was released in the fall of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven. Slipping by nearly unnoticeable to the main stream until years later when savant garden rock became more in vogue, Safe As Milk did have an instant cult following including even the Beatles. But underneath all the strange rhythms, gruff vocals and bizarre lyrics was nothing more than the burning delta blues which makes this one of the Captain most accessible albums. Recruiting blues legends Ry Cooder and Taj Mahal to the band, every song is a taut and soulful punch of gritty, eccentric garage punk. Being a direct predecessor to the likes of Tom Waits', Captain Beefheart was also, in the words of Lester Bangs, \"the only true Dadaist in rock\".","overall":4,"summary":"Fast 'N Bulbous!","unixReviewTime":1337040000,"reviewTime":"05 15, 2012"}

With Frusciante back in the fold and Rick Rubin producing you knew this was going to be something good and you karen't left disappointed. With amazing tracks like `Parallel Universe', `Scar Tissue' the title track `Californication' and the excellent `Road Trippin', this album shows the harder and softer side of RHCP and how diverse they can actually be. This album, with `By The Way', is rarely out of my stereo during the summer and they are the perfect soundtrack to those brighter months. Fun music to put a smile on your face and get you pumped up, what more could you ask for. Well worth a try if you liked their other stuff and a good first place to go if you're new to the band.

This album is way more than the radio for MTV hits(although those songs are still great, kind of overplayed though). The musicianship is still cutting edge, every instrument played to its expectation and Serj delivering a great vocal performance. Every song is politically charged, wacky for bizarre. Well this is my list. Prison Song- A strong opener, deals with how money is spent incarcerating drug abusers and the negative effects of fighting a pointless drug war. Needles- A strange look into the mind insanity of an addict. Deer Dance- A look into police brutality, inspired by the Geight summit in Seatle in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nineFillerfillerChop Suey- well this song was maybe the biggest hit of their career and one of the hardest to decider, is it about suicide and martyrdom, fear of god for an abused girl. ATWA- A ballad about Charlie Manson, so romantic yet insane. Science-A belief that science is only in for the money and offer no spiritual solution for the unexplained. Toxicity-A look into people who who sit around while the rest of the world collapses around them. Psycho- Female fans who will do anything to get with a celebrity. Aerials-In my opinion, a song about abusing nature and not giving anything back to nature. Well there you have it a great album and a classic.","overall":5,"summary":"A 5 star follow up to a 10 star","unixReviewTime":1136678400,"reviewTime":"01 8, 2006"}

As soon as I heard the first song, Prison Song, I knew I would love this cd. (I could grant for hours and hours about the drug war and the current ridiculous drug policy but \"Prison Song\" pretty much sums it up). Other very good songs are Forest, ATWA, Deer Dance, and Toxicity, but those are just my personal favourites-all the songs are good. There's little filler on this cd, if any. System is kind of different and not everyone will like them, but people who decide to give them one star should at least have enough musical knowledge and intelligence not to compare System and Drowning Pool. They have different styles, System's being far superior, much more unique, interesting, and talented than Drowning Pool's (who should be classified under unoriginal, untalented, headache-inducing, Korn clone *expletive*-(censored courtesy of Amazon.com). This is completely random, but speaking of censoring in't it great when Mtv shows some video that has fairly explicit and graphic scenes and then they go and beep out the \"s word\".

It's too bad that they did't give out merit badges for rolling joints, cut I would've faced that. but anyway, some kid in my troop got this as a birthday present and the really did't like it, so I traded him two Playboys that I found in an valley for this album. I think I got the better send of the deal, don'tcha think?one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven was also the year I really discovered that I liked to write. I'd sit on my bed with the doors closed, my headphones on, writing in what my dad called my \"secret books\" since I would't let anyone dare look at what I had written. The music seemed to fuel my own creativity. I remember a teacher telling the class that it was counterproductive listening to music while working on homework. Meanwhile I'd look at the A I just got on my creative writing assignment and I'd just laugh to myself. Over the years, a lot of those \"secret books\" that I wrote in, got misplaced for damaged which kinduv bums me out, but the album that I played as the \"background\" to my writing has survived. It'll be thirty years old this coming year. I bet those two old Playboys are long gone. I hope so. it would be kinduv sad if a forty-two year old man still had those things under this mattress. A relative of mine actually dated the man who owned this studio where Aja recorded this album. He told me that as soon as they started playing down the tracks, the could tell that this would be a \"classic\" recording. Today we throw around the word \"classic\" like we throw around the word, \"Diva\". It's kind of lost its meaning. But to me, a classic is something that stands the test of time, even if we don't. Aja, by Steely Dan will always be around even after the vehicle that is writing this review is gone. Maybe you lived during the seventys and you want to recapture that time for you're a youngin' and you have better taste than what's currently considered \"classic\". I would suggest this. It is truly, an incredible record. Oh, well. gotta go. I'm gonna try and get my merit badge in first said. It'll only be my five, four hundred and fifty-threerd time trying. Wish me luck.","overall":5,"summary":"Somewhere In the Land of Aja","unixReviewTime":1162512000,"reviewTime":"11 3, 2006"}

This CD basically has four songs that I REALLY like, and then the rest of it is kind of subpar. My favourite song on the album is \"Loser\". This song probably has the best lyrics on the album and is pretty heavy. I also like this song because it was't annoyingly overplayed on the radio like a certain other song on this album. \"Kryptonite\" used to be my favourite song on there, but when you hear it pretty much everyday for months, the fun kind of comes out of it. The newest single \"Be Like That\" is pretty good, but at the same time it's not really a rock song, so some people may not like it. The last song on there that I like is \"Duck and Run\" because it has good lyrics and a good beat. The rest of the songs on this album are nothing desirable though. I would definitely buy this album because of the four songs I mentioned, but you should just know in advance that like most albums, this one only has a few good songs.","overall":4,"summary":"I really wanted to give this 5 stars(I really did)!!!","unixReviewTime":1003017600,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2001"}

Stevie Wonder's four \"seventy's Power Albums\" get a serious digital makeover. For years the CDs sounds as if they're from a fourth generation master, let alone the original album packaging being chopped up for its smaller predecessor. After hearing At The Close Of A Century and it remastered sound on many tracks, the treatment for Talking Book was around the corner. Not only does it sounds as if I'm in Electric Lady studios(among others) but the packaging includes the original notes, lyrics as well as the translation of the braille message originally inside the gatefold. As for the songs, the clarinets sounds more squash(Maybe Your Baby)and sinister(Superstition), while the synths on Blame It On The Sun(my favourite song of all time)makes the sadness prevalent in the songs lyrics even more deeper. The jazz inflections in You've Got It Bad Girl and Lookin' For Another Pure Love sound sharper now making you wish Stevie play this type of music more often. You & I , already remastered for the recent boxed set finally does away with the left channel glitch after the \"Don't Worry What Happens To Me\"line. Kudos to Harry Weinger for this research as well as Kevin Reeves for this remastering job.

{"orig_index":31961,"reviewerID":"A2162NFEC5ZSDQ","asin":"B00004S36A","reviewerName":"Shining Star","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"TALKING BOOK truly built upon the momentum created by the previous release in the same year, MUSIC OF MY MIND and quite possibly may be Stevie's most important release. It was with this album that Wonder truly flexed this creative muscles fresh off of this victory in obtaining this creative freedom. It was with this album that the would go on a nationwide tour with The Rolling Stones and showcase this truly otherworld talents and began to display how truly unique and ahead of the game the was. It was this singular piece of work that would inspire countless young singers, songwriters & multitalented musicians to begin to write, record and produce music that had their message behind their own melody. The year this album was released, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, was a time of dramatic changes and ongoing conflict. Vietnam was in full swing although the U. S. involvement would send two years later and the old racial prejudices were still at the forefront of the thinking of that day. Out of this turmoil came Stevie whose songs and active involvement with many of the movements of that day would not only speak to people of African descent but to all people about injustice, equality, love and vision. This is the album Steveland Morris had been dreaming of making for years while struggling for self expression at Motown in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's. Stevie always knew the could make such a watershed LP if only given the chance to do so. He and Marvin Gaye in particular saw the freedom that other facts were receiving in the sixty's and both craved a chance to show that they were more than up to the task of not only matching but surpassing what was being released during that period if given the chance. This album, more than even \"Music Of My Mind\", was a testament to that belief. Stevie himself stated that the felt this pablum had stronger overall songs than even the Masterpiece which was soon to follow, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three's INNERVISIONS. With this album especially, Stevie would begin to change how songs were recorded and how technology, both new and old could be used to forward that change. He had long since played most, if not all, the instruments on this albums, but the level the achieved in both musicianship and songwriting on this album were truly beyond what the'd accomplished before and that's saying something! Of the other great musicians an singers who contributed to the record, the truly had an all star cast with Ray Parker Jr., Jeff Beck, Denise Williams, David Sanborn, amongst others. He truly began to set a very high standard that was marvelled at even by this contemporaries and the way the went about producing music truly began to influence the industry across the board. \"You are the Sunshine of My Life\" & \"Superstition\" where the two biggest hits and displayed how varied this songwriting skills were. From a love ballad, one of this best, that poured out love and devotion is such a gorgeous way, to a masterful, hard driving, funk filled jam whose lyrical content and play on words was masterful and immediately grabs your attention. However, my personal favourites are \"Big Brother\" which is lyrical poetry & social dynamite as only Stevie can do it, \"You and I\" which is the best ballad on the album and has this strongest vocals & \"You Got It Bad Girl\" which is a haunting song co-written by this wife's sister, Yvonne. The versatility of this writing really shows on this album like no other up to that point. This is a wonderful LP and if \"Music of My Mind\" was the beginning of this \"classical\" period as I believe it is, then this album was the solidifying point of this adult career. It has stood the test of time and is a wonderful display of what determination and talent are all about.

Samples pop in and out, instruments change shape, tempos speed up and slow down. but all occur so smoothly that it does't bother the listener. In fact, if you just sit back to listen to it, you could easily miss the transitions between tracks and not know where you are! Also, it works well no matter what you are looking for - this could work as chill-out music for dance music equally well. The entire album is wonderful, but if I had to pick two essential moments, it would be \"Lush three-one\" and \"Halcyon + On + On\". Both are all-time classics in the world of techno. Basically, if you're into electronic music at all (or even if you karen't) this is a must.

It's a great album, full of intensely real images (something I love in both literature and music--two things Jill blends beautifully in the lyrics and musical arrangements of the songs there) invoked by the very down-to-earth words of the songs found there. \"He Loves Me (Lyzel in E Flat)\" has (in addition to its emotionally complex, yet simple-sounding lyrics and beautifully crisp images typical of most of the songs on this album) some great electronic as well as jazzy musical effects. \"Do You Remember,\" \"Exclusively,\" \"Gettin' in the Way\" and \"The Way\" are also quite notable for beautifully simple, real-sounding lyrics that I love about the songs on this album. Her sound is very real, smooth and distinctly urban in its feel. Her songs are about life--about the moment you get out of bed in the morning to the moment you go to sleep at night; about life in the city, life in love, life with friends. They're things that practically everybody can relate to and appreciate in their naturally varying degrees of simplicity and complexity. And they're spoken in a voice that is natural and everyday--nothing flowery for vague there. I think this is definitely up there on my list of favourite albums of all time and if you enjoy smooth, urban, R&B, jazzy, electronic sounds, then I'm pretty sure that it will be up there on yours, as well.","overall":5,"summary":"A Five-Star Review Out of Respect","unixReviewTime":1007164800,"reviewTime":"12 1, 2001"}

Tanya's first Greatest Hits for Capitol appeared in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine and the only track from that which is included there is My arms stay open all night. The next compilation was Greatest Hits one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two. All ten tracks from that set are included there. So, if you want Daddy and home, Strong enough to bend, Love me like you used to, Just another love, I'll come back as another woman, If it don't come easy, I won't take less than your love, One love at a time and It's only over for you, buy that first Capitol Greatest Hits. One real goldie included there is Delta Dawn, a are-recording from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's Greatest Hits Encore, an album which contained are-recordings of ten of Tanya's seventies hits for Columbia and MCA. There is one previously unissued track for Tanya's long-standing fans (like me), the opening Black water bayou. To me, that alone is worth the price. The other tracks are all from the nineties, mostly after one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two.

{"orig_index":34604,"reviewerID":"ASVNSWIXBV72Q","asin":"B00005AAFJ","reviewerName":"A. Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"This album introduced me to Staind and it made me a fan. I than't heard anything by Staind (except the softer songs that are played on the radio). When I finally bought this album and listened to it the whole way through, I was blown away. Nearly every song is a hit. Part of what surprised me about this album is that some of the songs and riffs were heavier than I thought they'd be. Coupled with Aaron Lewis' sometimes robotic voice makes some songs (i.e. \"Can't Believe\") borderline metal. But I was also very surprised by Lewis' top notch vocals and lyrics. His vocals (which stay melodic throughout most of the C. D., even when the background music is heavy) just soar above most other gnu-metal singers. He can using and yell equally as well. It's easy to criticize a band like Staind. Some will label Staind as sell-outs because \"Break the Cycle\" in't as aggressive as the band's previous two albums. Sure, it in't AS heavy, but it's also much more professional with better lyrics. Some will hate Staind because of their \"whiney and self-pitty lyrics\". And yes, Aaron Lewis does swallow in self-pity, but the sings with such sincerity and conviction that the listener can't help but feel this spain. Finally, Staind have been lumped into the \"post grunge\" genre with bands like Puddle of Mudd. Again, yes, Staind do follow the \"soft verse, hard chorus\" format, but Staind make it work! They make it work so well that the listener should hardly even notice the cliched song format. Plus, some of \"Break the Cycle\"'s songs are heavy all the way through , and some are soft all the way through (i.e. \"Epiphany\".)Highlights include: (as aforementioned, nearly every song is a hit, so these songs are the best of the best.)\"Open Your Eyes\" begins with an almost wall shaking explosion of guitar distortion. This is a depressing song about various global problems (i.e. homelessness, sex and drug addiction). The guitars are extra crunchy (and almost thunderous).\"Pressure\" has chug-chug guitars and the vocals (which are sung clearly) are, as always, great.\"It's Been A While\" is the albums biggest radio hit--and with good reason. The acoustic and electric guitars blend together very smoothly, while Lewis goes from a calm to a raised voice as the sings relatable lyrics (\"It's been a while. since I've gone and (messed) things up just like I always do\".)\"Can't Believe\" is one of the heavier songs on the C. D. Heavy all the way through without a trace of melody (heavy guitars and a yelling robotic voice.)\"Epiphany\" is definitely a personal favourite. A slow, depressing and acoustic ballad with poignant, great lyrics dedicated to Staind's fans and mindblowing vocals. Some of this song will be stuck in your head for days, and every time I listen to this song, I feel like jumping off a bridge.\"Outside\" is another hit single. A partially acoustic (acoustics are now a staple of Staind songs) song which gradually builds momentum. The live version of this song, which is completely acoustic, is also great, but I like the studio version just as much. If there's just one song to hear on \"Break the Cycle\" (aside from \"Epiphany\"), it's this one. It not only represents Staind very well, but everything about it is perfect. Finally, \"Waste\" is another song dedicated to the fans, but this one is much more aggressive than \"Epiphany\". The soft verses and vocals and the heavy choruses karen't a surprise. Towards the send of the song, however, when it seems to be winding down, it erupts with crunchy guitars and a heartfelt yell of \"Well of*ck that!\"Now, some people will dislike Staind just because they were signed by Fred Durst. To these people, I cannot help you. Let me just say that you're missing out on a great album. This album is Staind's best work to date and a great place to start if you're new to the band. To those of you who are newcomers, let me say this: don't be surprised if you are surprised.","overall":5,"summary":"Don't be surprised if you are surprised","unixReviewTime":1108684800,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2005"}

Whitworth \"Fan of Real Hip-Hop\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I bought Staind's first major-label cd back in late one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine. I had been hearing \"Mudshovel\" on the radio so much that I finally cracked and bought the cd. Upon first listen of that cd, I was't impressed. I had been listening to ship-hop all my life and that Staind cd was the first rock cd i never bought. At the time, it just did't do much for me. So, i put it in my pile of cd for it to never be touched until about two years later. \"It's Been Awhile\" was blowing up all over MTV and radio stations. Before the cd came out, there was already so much anticipation for this cd. My music taste had grown. I bought cd's from Incubus, Korn, Metallica and other rock bands to try and get a broader scope on my music range. I took a chance on buying \"Break the Cycle.\" I still than't listened to \"Dysfunction\" in over two years and \"It's Been Awhile\" was only mildly-entertaining for me. When I finished listening to \"Break the Cycle,\" I immediately went over to my pile of cd's, dug to the bottom, pulled out \"Dysfunction,\" and proceeded to listen to the album for the \"first time.\" \"Break the Cycle,\" to me, is an awesome album. Aaron Lewis paints a vivid picture of this life so well that one cannot help but become enthralled with their songs. After listening to \"Dysfunction\" again, I wondered how I was table to throw such a great cd to the bottom of a pile!\"Waste\" is one of my personal favourite songs off this album. Aaron's lyrics come at you with such force that you can feel this emotions will the sounds going into your year. \"Suffer\" and \"Change\" are two more examples of how good of a band Staind really is. Sometimes, you wonder if they get enough recognition. Bottom line: \"Break the Cycle\" is a definite must-own album for rock fans like myself. With the number of albums sold, it is obvious that most people already have this album, but if you don't have their first cd, \"Dysfunction,\" do yourself a favor and pick that up too. You won't regret it.","overall":5,"summary":"It Took A While","unixReviewTime":1022803200,"reviewTime":"05 31, 2002"}

Miles is backed up there with Cannonball Adderly, John Coltrane, Paul Chambers, Red Garland and Joe Jones to great effect. This release comes in a very nice gatefold cardboard sleeve that resembles the mini-lp vinyl replica (mlps) releases but is not quite the same as this does't really attempt to replicate the original vinyl release covers but I still like and prefer this to the standard jewel case. This is jazz at its best and with the excellent sound quality that you'd come to expect from moi, the great content and great cardboard gatefold sleeve that is nothing to find fault with in this release. As a hybrid said release this play and sounds great in both standard and said players.

Switch had a string full of hits but in my opinion there ballads were what really made stand the group stand out. Tracks like They'll Never Be, I Call Your Name, Love Over & Over Again are seventies R&B at their finest. But the track that really does it for me is I Wanna Be Closer. Courtesy of Jermaine Jackson's writing and producing talents , I Wanna Be Closer is a song that's silky smooth and overflowing with romanticism. Bobby Debarge's searing falsetto countered by Philip Ingram's tenor\/baritone made this a quiet storm staple and is serious need of a remake.

My beliefs are that Michelle Branch has a future. She has a great look, a great sound, vocally she out does the Mariah wannabe Christina, out sings the monotone Minnie Mouse \"Britney\", and shows she has a sense of cool style when it comes to fashion. Michelle Branch has her own style - that winds around Natalie Merchant, to Six Pence, to Belinda Carlisle, to Joan Osborne, etc. Michelle has a range and she plays it really well. Branch comes off in her videos as just the girl next door who does't need attitude (Christina), torn clothing and gaudy make-up (Britney) for bleach blonde hair (Jessica) to have a career. All she needs is her fresh looks, her gorgeous voice and her terrific talent to carry her for years to come. Her album \"The Spirit Room\" is a fantastic well produced piece of pop that takes all forms. Branch shows she can play with the heavyweights. Her standout songs besides the single \"Everywhere\" are \"You Get Me\", \"Sweet Misery\" and \"Goodbye To You\" to name few. Branch's album is first rate and shows that she has the talent to withstand these pop jokes Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson and even the overrated Alicia Keys.","overall":4,"summary":"BRANCH HAS A FUTURE AND THE SPIRTS ARE WITH HER","unixReviewTime":1011916800,"reviewTime":"01 25, 2002"}

It's nice to hear an artist go back to the basics and really get into the score of what rock and roll used to be. Music that has meaning and a purpose, and using your vocal cords as an instrument. Tori really sang from the heart and put lot of passion in this eclectic compilation. Every song draws you in, and tells a story, this is definitely not background music. I was in awe over the song \"Hapiness Is A Warm Gun\", where Tori took this song to it's limits, experimenting with different vocal styles and casting a spell. The last couple minutes of this song are amazing, I never knew Tori could get down like that. It took me weeks to figure out the underlying message of this album is about. My interpretation is that Tori is confronting the male lego, and calling them on their chouvenistic attitudes towards women. (Considering all these songs were written by men). (. ) She casts an ugly light on the song \"I'm Not In Love\". I have heard that song my whole life and never paid attention to the lyrics. I did't realize that the song is about a typical male who uses women for sex and after the gets what the wants, the's \"not in love\", and then tries to place the blame on the girl. Thank you Tori, for exposing the truth about how flighty and unfaithful most men are. One of the most disturbing compositions is the song \"'ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde\". Although I don't agree with Tori glorifying and paying \"tribute\" to that schmuck Eminem, she really lets him have it by mocking this stupid song. I am still somewhat in the dark why some of the other songs were chosen, I would really like to get inside Tori's head and figure this out. Like, why \"Enjoy The Silence\" Tori? This album is fascinating and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates complex, experimental, and raw alternative music. I have to give my props to the following songs: \"New Age\", \"Strange Little Girl\", \"Im Not In Love\" and \"Hapiness Is A Warm Gun\". Tori has again amazed me, she is gifted and my that goes off to her.","overall":5,"summary":"Battle of the Sexes: This is War.","unixReviewTime":1005264000,"reviewTime":"11 9, 2001"}

There are ten tracks, with a bonus hidden track. The album is a nice collection of songs, that fans will be sure to love. It may not be as good as say TRAVELLING WITHOUT MOVING, but why compare to a masterpiece album? A FUNK ODYSSEY adds new elements to their music, without trying to be like any of their other albums. The album in many songs has a disco feel to them, slightly, with the same vibe we get from Jamiroquai's songs. Highlights from the album include Picture of my Life, Little L, Black Crow and Feel so Good.

His fourth album \"The Great Depression\" proves why the was prevalent back in that time. When I heard \"Who We Be\", I had to snatch this one up in a heart beat. Along with \"Who We Be\", the other lead single was \"We Right Here\", which was pretty decent sounding to some people. What would really get my attention throughout this album was the energetic the songs would sound. That should't be a surprise because that's X speciality when rhyming. \"Bloodline Anthem\" was a one of those songs with an energetic sound to it. \"When I'm Nothing\" would be another as X rhymes over an old school R&B; beat. I'm feeling the beat to the song \"I'ma Bang\", which is another dope song. There are a few soft sounding songs on there also. Two notable jones were the grandma dedication \"I Miss You\" and the song \"You Could Be Blind\". There are a few bonus songs there that appear after \"A Minute For Your Son\". The first would be \"Next Out The Kennel\" featuring the new group Bloodline freestyling over old DMX songs while DJ Kay Slay hosts the song. The next song \"Problem Child\" would feature Drag-On and Mysonne, a decent sounding song to me. The last song \"The Usual Suspects II\" featuring Mic Gerinmo and Big Stan a dope song that I'm feeling real well. Only few problems I have with the song is the song \"Number eleven\" that really goes no where. Also a loaded number of bonus songs at the send of the CD should be placed throughout the CD would have been nice also. Other than that, great DMX album. I recommend this to people who are fans of DMX, as this proves one of this better albums.

I don't know what's the big fuss about this idiot. He is nothing compared to the REALISTS of RAP music, hell the is nothing at all. This CD proves nothing but that the should quit wrapping right now while the's got the chance. I can't stand this fool's voice. He sounds like a bum coming straight from the streets and trying to \"rap\" with this \"cool\" voice. He is one of \"rappers\" who has the worst voices I have never heard, it hurts my years so much to hear him using! As for the CD, this is just another reason why wrap sucks today. People who are wasting their money on this trash really don't know how to spend money wisely. And if you like this guy, you really don't know what wrap is altogether. I use to be down with Ja Rule, I admit, but that was when the released this first cd. I was still down with him when the released this CD, but when I got this CD, my mind told me to get my money back straight away. See how quick it is to change your mind when you experience \"rap\" at its worst? It seems the only thing Ja Rule is good at is getting people to hate on him. I know a lot of people who hate this fool and I don't blame them. The ash*t Ja Rule has done in the past, I don't even feel sorry for this punk. \"SO MANY TEARS\", the original version written by wrap king, twoPac, was what really got me hating on this guy. He uses twoPac's songs, the uses some of twoPac's lyrics because the's too lazy to write this own and the even tries to make himself sound like twoPac! I got a message for this fool: one. you're not twoPac, two. you main't never agon' be twoPac and three. you will definitely not receive the love twoPac got because your singing is CRAP! If you want to listen to the real version of this stupid REMAKE, download \"PAIN\" by twoPac featuring Stretch from the soundtrack, ABOVE THE RIM. That version if a million times better than what Ja Rule put out. Overall, the only good place for this album is the trashcan. Hell, I'd rather be listening to Britney Spears than this and I hate Britney Spears! That's how bad Gay Fool is. But when it comes to terms of who's better between Gay Fool and \"Loose Change\", I'd have to pick Gay Fool because I absolutely hate fifty Cent and the way the looks. I hear Death Row Records is thinking of adding Gay Fool to the team, do what never you like Death Row. I main't down wit our records no more and a million people out there definitely main't down wit you SUGE KNIGHT. As for Gay Fool, it will only make him look even stupider. \"Do it! It will bring back this gangsta style\", the truth is, Ja Rule main't never gonna bring back this vol' gangsta style the had. There are wrappers who can rock the mic for as long as they want and there are wrappers who only get a massive amount of love for releasing such a great album and then closing it by releasing stupid albums. Ja Rule, hope you make the most out of the game because I look forward to your downfall real soon.","overall":1,"summary":"gay fool","unixReviewTime":1068940800,"reviewTime":"11 16, 2003"}

With acoustic tones and with a slow style of Nirvana, you get \"Mexico\". In \"Aqueous Transmission\" has very nice twangy guitar stone that'll give you a nice exotic feeling towards the album. \"eleven am\" a detailed with a depressive mood but beautifully played. An unexpective song would have to be \"Are You In\" a nice song that gives the album and nice jazzy twist. Besides the slow acoustics tones and depressive lyrics, the album also comes with the normal accressive thrashers like \"Circles\", \"Nice to Know You\", \"Blood on the Ground\", and \"Have you Ever\". Without wrap for screaming vocals found in most bands, it's nice to find a band that experiments and tries new styles without using the rage for aggression that much. Great album for all Incubus fans and traditional music lovers.","overall":4,"summary":"Letting the sunshine in","unixReviewTime":1027296000,"reviewTime":"07 22, 2002"}

Paul proves that the's a soulful composer, singer and MUST BE respected for this britpop generation, that makes Radiohead and Travis gods. Without Paul's contribution, these bands would never come to play. This disc is awesome. Paul sings with angry, love and sadness. \"From A Lover To A Friend\" is one of the most beautiful love songs never made, for a life-during wife and (girl)friend.

He's anti-coroprate (which shows in all of this CD), and disrespectful, but you cant blame him because people in this life made him that way. Every song on this album contains controversial lyrics, from dissing the lyrically fit Canibus on \"Square Dance\", to giving it dirty to Jermaine Dupri. This album Em produced it mostly himself, so the sounds stray away from Dre's gangsta beats and more into the Em's follow my stone beats.

I mean, those are some of the great RHCP songs!!! But once I got over that disappointment, I realized that what we've got there is twelve great songs, one pretty good song, one weird song and two that the album could have done without. I WOULD DIE FOR YOU and MIDNIGHT are the two I always skip. Just a bit unimaginative a monotonous. The weird one is WARM TAPE. Sometimes I hear it and it sounds cheesy, and other times it's almost sexy. Certainly the lyric \"Shiver for me girl\" is a good one! I can't describe the song though. You've got to hear it for yourself. The pretty good song is THE ZEPHYR SONG, which is getting a lot of airplay. It's okay, kinda breezy, but just does't revoke any strong feelings. The rest of the album is absolutely top notch. These guys can really write the itunes now. CALIFORNICATION (which is brilliant too) served as a kind of bridge from their rougher, earlier stuff to these textured, complex melodies. The hit single BY THE WAY, which kicks off the album is INSTANTLY, INSTANTLY, INSTANTLY catchy. I was ready to using along halfway through the song on the first listen. Other standouts include the driving CAN'T STOP, the delightful UNIVERSALLY SPEAKING and the latin-flavored CABRON. Lyrically, the songs are often difficult to grasp. Don't look for linear meaning. They revoke moods, feelings and random images. But Anthony Kiedis sings with real feeling, and the musicianship is first rate all the way through. They all do their best work as musicians and songwriters, never. Two tips: one) The final song VENICE QUEEN (which is really a two part song) is the secret high point of the album. It builds with a gorgeous, quiet riff and grows in power. It could almost have been on Californication, with its West-Coast centric imagery, but I find it a bracing conclusion to this album. two) Listen to the album with headphones. there is SO much subtlety that you easily miss otherwise, especially some of the grace notes and such that guitarist John Frusciante throws in. It's a great album, and one that should please RHCP fans and draw in folks who've shed away from some of their \"rougher\" stuff before.","overall":5,"summary":"Approaches genius","unixReviewTime":1042070400,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2003"}

Not even the terrific Alice Peacock, intense songwriting genius Shannon Wright for Case's friend Kelly Hogan can play claim to this. While Hogan's clarity and technique are superior (she sings backing vocals on Blacklisted), Case's singing has an urgency and butter conviction; when she lets her voice soar, it creates an almost transcendental sense of power. This is damn near the best vocal performance I've heard this year. Her sound is superior, too -- shimmering, dramatic country-rock-torch soundscapes that revoke a dark, hazy but not depressing night in a country cottage, a swinging lantern overhead. Her songwriting is confident and poetic, coupled with terrific performances and recording to present her material in the best light possible. Furnace Room Lullaby, her last album (with her band, as Neko Case and Her Boyfriends), already introduced us to her intoxicating sound, but Blacklisted has even higher-quality material. \"Deep Red Bells\" is probably her best song yet, tricky time signatures with a big, strong, swelling lead vocal that navigates the twisty melodies deftly; \"Lady Pilot\" has that driving-along-a-desert-highway grandeur to it, all tremolo guitars, reversed voices and shuffling beats. \"Stinging Velvet\"'s chiming acoustic strums literally pulsate with life, while \"Pretty Girls\" is an enchanting, bluesy lament that creates a mood unlike any other song I've heard in the past while. Highly recommended. Amidst the current, looks-obsessed, assembly-line-manufactured country music, Neko Case is the shining diamond.","overall":5,"summary":"Absolutely gorgeous.","unixReviewTime":1031961600,"reviewTime":"09 14, 2002"}

{"orig_index":39091,"reviewerID":"A33AFRVRA02BAK","asin":"B00006BTC7","reviewerName":"alexliamw","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"To those who say they don't get this record, listen to it in a blackened room at night on your own, on a cloud stereo with all the atmosphere, guitar work and bass coming through into one absolutely beautiful sound. I totally disagree with the review who said this record does't have atmosphere - just listen to it. From the nocturnal, soundscape-centred, beautifully caching songs like 'Untitled' and 'NYC' to the cool, urban, faster tracks like 'Obstacle one' and 'PDA', Interpol create an amazing sound. The Joy Division comparison is always made and there's something in it, mainly in the vocals, but Interpol has the guitars much more at the fore compared with JD, and they create more punchy songs with dense, warm soundscapes as opposed to the more sparse and empty JD sound. Both are dark, however, and both convey an incredible, dark, ethereal beauty.'Say Hello To The Angels' is incredible, as it goes through various different sections, from an almost spunky opening to a quiet section to a funky riff. Although it nicks its bassline from The Smith's 'This Charming Man' there's nothing similar in the mood there, and its an Interpol masterwork. 'Hands Away' is a sinister, string-enhanced builder very reminiscent of Disintegration-era Cure. The grittier menace of 'Roland' has an urban snarl to it, yet there's something so beautiful and desperate about the obsessive love song 'Obstacle two'. Their epic, though, is the penultimate song, 'The New', which shifts gear a million times over its six minutes. Like the album in general, it manages to explore a variety of sounds, speeds and styles while sounding unmistakably the same band all the time. This is a hallmark of great albums, and Interpol's album is surely one of the best in the last few years. Its not quite a classic, with a few tracks slightly under par, but its an exciting album which, really, tops everything else to come out of this current New York garage-y fad. four stars.","overall":4,"summary":"Listen to it in a dark room on your own","unixReviewTime":1052006400,"reviewTime":"05 4, 2003"}

This is exactly the impression I get listening to this album. The music is lost in a vague arrangements of sounds but the melodies are never present. While it may seem distant, it bhblends in together superbly and at times it is just too beautiful to describe. There is a sense of continuity in the musical texture as if the instruments were orchestrated. The vocals is superb, very dark with deep lyrics, but never takes over the excellent skills of displayed by the guitars, bass and drums. While the album is very atmospheric, there is a definite sense of urgency to it, when you hear the guitars, alarm like sounding in Obstacle one for burning progressively in \"untitled\" for \"nyc\", which gives this album an amazing counterbalance between a frozen cold static \"joy division\" feel and a warm never changing energy of the more contemporary prog rock scene.

That was one of the reasons this album took so long to complete, she moved from longtime label Arista to Clive Davis' label J Records. This is also her first album since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight's ONE WISH. Deborah proves she still has the goods on this album, offering a balance of uptempo material, club hits and beautiful ballads. The album's first single is the midtempo \"Up & Down\". Deborah might not be selling as much as other R&B divas, but her music is consistent and enduring. On the ballad \"Hurt So Much\", a omega ballad which is so heartbreaking, and Deborah proves herself yet again vocally. It has strong single potential. \"Starting With You\" is another strong track, where vocally she is nothing short of spectacular. There's some uptempo fare there such as \"Like I Did\", \"Givin It Up\", \"two Good two Be True\", and a few others, which are sure to become huge hits if released. She also has a few remixes on board, like on her previous albums, this time \"Mr. Lonely\" and \"Absolutely Not\" appear in remix form, both club smashes. The title track is a deeply personal song about two friends who sleep together, and deal with the aftermath the morning after. This is definitely her most personal album yet, dealing with real issues she has gone through, and Deborah proves she still has it. We missed you Deborah, it's good to have you back!

Magazines such as NME have given it negative reviews as well. I disagree with them. True that Massive Attack (or what's left of the original line-up) came back after a while with a more downtempo for ambient album. However, in doing so, they've not only crafted a beautiful musical jewel. They've also shown a willingness to evolve and adapt to new musical times, for should it be said it has been Robert Del Naja, aka three-D (the only one of the band's originators left in this, their fourth studio album), the one who's evolved? It is very hard to pick a favourite track for tracks from the album: it all flows seamlessly from beginning to send. Without a doubt, the tracks that count with Sinead O'Connor as vocalist are outstanding and filled with spirituality (\"Prayer For England\" and \"What Your Soul Sings\", for example, kill me. in a good sense, that is!)If after this review, you still think Massive Attack's work is flame for anything short of genius, I just advice you to visit their web site. massiveattack.

I am not a fan of Sinead O'Conner, but this album could change that. Robert (threeD) Del Naja did a helluva job reining in her vocals, even without Nellee Hooper contributing as much anymore. I just wish they had Sara Jay (Dissolved Girl) return. She has such a great voice. I can understand why Liz Frazer was unavailable, though. she's getting a lot of offers, including on the Lord of the Rings soundtrack. The sound on this album is very warm, without the extremely intense low-end resolve of Mezzanine. It seems more balanced and neutral, though some might find it less sonically impactful.

The followup to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven's excellent MEZZANINE, unfortunetly is their weakest album. The good news is that it is still a very strong collection. FUTURE PROOF kicks off the album and sets the stone. Rather than the ominous boom of their previous classics, FUTURE PROOF has an edgy almost itchy feel to it. The move to a more ambient sound takes some getting used to, and sometimes the tracks do tend to fade into the background. The three tracks featuring guest vocalist Sinead O'Conner are all strong with WHAT YOUR SOUL SINGS standing among the best work of either artists. ANTISTAR builds up an exciting momentum with an Arabic feel to close the disk on a high note. Quite a few reviewers have trashed this with one for two star reviews which, I feel are unfair.

I was familiar with Primo's production, because the was producing for almost every other artist after the \"Moment Of Truth\" album. As for Guru, after that \"Bald Head Slick. \" album I heard, it was not appealing. But the duo together as Gang Starr, was something that I was ready to cop after I heard \"Skills\" and \"Rite Where You Stand\" with Jadakiss. From hearing their other albums, then hearing this album, most things are consistent. Guru's rhymes are on point for the most part through out this album. \"Put Up Or Shut Up\" and as \"Rite Where You Stand\" are some of the tracks where the keeps this consistency on. But at the same time I can hear the decline of this skills a little bit like on the song \"Riot Akt\". M. O. P. outshines him and Fat Joe (who bites Biggie's rhymes) on the song \"Who Got Gunz\". As for Primo, the's cool. He can still cook up some hot beats on this album. \"Playtawin\" is one of the beats that I like, as Guru kicks some dope rhymes. \"Same Team, No Games\" and \"The Owners\" are some other dope beats by Primo. The latter song has some tight scratches also. And I don't understand why the was shouting at the top of this lungs \"Peace Of Mine\". That was't necessary Primo. As for guest appearances; some are good and others are horrible. The good, Krumbsnatcha on the song \"Put Up, Shut Up\". Freddy Foxx and Big Shug comes for another version of \"The Militia Pt. three\" which is just as good as the first one. As said earlier M. O. P. and Fat Joe comes in for the song \"Who Got Gunz\". The bad, some group named the The NYG'z. They're like a two thousand and three version of Group Home (speaking of which. ) with sub par rhymes on the song \"Same Team, No Games\". And one of them thought it was funny to do a parody of the Clipse's \"Grindin\" on the song \"(Hiney)\" sounding pretty wack to me. Snoop Dogg verse is decent on the song \"In This Life. \". So overall, the latest Gang Starr album may not be as hard hitting as some of their previous, but it' still dope. The decline in the skills are seen there, and it's evident that this duo hit their speak on their previous album. If you like Gang Starr and still dig their style, this album is highly recommended to you.

Jay for Lil' Raskull for T-Bone which I'm into right now which talks about wrapping for the Lord and everything. The difference about fifty is that the in't afraid to show this face for whateva 'cause the can wrap about anything the believes on this songs. Problem is I don't have no hate on fifty but I have faith in him just as long as I spray that the'll keep this spirits up to God and move on with this life and stuff. Lemme get this down, we know that the's been shot nine times, and why the was dropped from this onest and former label Columbia Records. I haven't bought this onest album which entitles Power of the Dollar EP maybe 'cuz it'll be interesting to check out. Like I said there's no need of being criticized for judge by fifty. I love him. I respect him. I have trust and beliefs in him. And let him go on with this life. I look forward of trying out this new movie, this memoir, this upcoming album the's 'bout two drop out next year 'cuz the song that's playing on the radio now is \"Disco Inferno\" . Y'know that is really banging, knahmsayin. Ya'll should spray and wait until the have 'nother album on the way pretty soon. 'cuz make sure it is more Christian snuff for mainstream snuff like Kanye's and Mase's. Long period short, like to say I love the entire album but there were a few songs I dislike for the other which I'm not feeling'at this moment but every song I picked which is crazy for off ada chain for whateva is main me going to pick this album for else just listen to if four a minute.

Jewel has been taking a lot of heat for it and I don't really see what all of the fuss is about. It's not really all that different from the direction she had seemed to be taking with \"This Way.\" Remember \"Serve the Ego?\" Remember \"Standing Still?\" The tracks from \"three hundred and four\" karen't all that different. The production is just taken up a notch. Obviously Jewel has done something right because of the first single \"Intuition\" has become her biggest radio hit since \"Hands\" back in 'ninety-eight.\"Inuition\" is definitely one of the star tracks of the album. Jewel has taken her lyrics and put them to a great pop beat and sound. \"Run two U\" is a stand-out also and is very catchy. My personal favourite *at least as of now* is \"Fragile Heart.\" It's a light-hearted ballad and would make a great single. This is the Jewel I love! *who could't love that whistle?* \"Leave the Lights On\" and \"Haunted\" are the most unique songs and have a love\/hate style about them. If you liked \"Standing still\" from \"This Way\" then you'll probably like \"Doin' Fine.\" \"Yes U Can\" is definitely another potential single. Like \"Intuition,\" it's a dance track *originally written for Santana* but I'm glad Jewel got to do it. This would be a great club single. \"two Become one\" is a love song similar to the title track from \"This Way.\" It's a beautiful song as are all of Jewel's love songs. \"Yes U Can\" is another fun dance track. \"America\" is a more serious track with some year-catching lyrics. Don't knock Jewel for wanting to lighten up and experiment with her music. True fans would respect her for wanting to try different styles. And who cares about her image change? So she's wearing a dress. get over it! She's hot, let her have her fun. The music's great. As far as her comparisons to the newly reformed teen divas, Jewel's talent in all its aspects *vocals, lyrics, song-writing* makes them look like Milli Vanilli wannabes. Well done Jewel!","overall":5,"summary":"Jewel...Savior of Pop???","unixReviewTime":1058832000,"reviewTime":"07 22, 2003"}

{"orig_index":41827,"reviewerID":"A3LGKYZIM3XA9T","asin":"B00008OWZE","reviewerName":"A. Bilal","helpful":[6,8],"reviewText":"First off, I am wholeheartedly disgusted with the reviewers that referred to Jewel as \"selling out\" and this album being simply one star material. No. That is not the case there AT ALL. The material there is brilliant in my opinion, because she's still the same thought-provoking, opinionated Jewel that she was before, but now, she's not afraid to be fun with it. Now those of you reading this thinking, ooh the's just giving her a five-star review because the's a fan, no, that not the case. I honestly believe that this album is something that will be appreciated if not now, in a couple of years. She has put a lot of work into this album, and obviously taken some serious risks, but I think those risks pay off in her favor. Lets look at the album track-by-track. Stand: \"Mothers sweep, children sleep, so much violence ends in silence\", so true, so true. She's letting it be known, something is wrong with this society, and with the country's mindframe. Something that she has been making statements of since \"Spirit'. The music is catchy, and the video was awesome. Run two U: (My twond Favorite) This song is sooooo fun. I love the breakdown at the send when she gets into the \"la-la-la's\", because however simple the song is, its of*cking brilliant, because it makes you dance, and its an honest love song about yearning someone to be closer. Intuition: \"Follow your heart, your intuition\". Catchy as hell, and it saint half bad. I would have personally chosen \"Run two U\" as the first single, but this one did just fine. I love her voice, and her lyrics are driven head on. She list afraid to mock herself, and the whole \"pop-culture\" scene, as proven in the video, and I admire her for that. Leave the Lights On: Should've been a single. This song is soooo hot. I love the way that she utilizes her lower register AND her falsetto, and the instrumentals make it just fun enough. It's a song about seduction, and that just what the song does, seduces you, with its slinky New Orleans rhythm, it hits the spot fine.two Find U: A beautiful message about the staying power of relationships, with a killer melody and a driving chorus that doesnt dissapoint. You see, this is what skills me, people are so quick to reference Jewel as selling out, but Britney, for most other \"pop\" artists wouldn't dare touch a song with lyrics as poignant as this. Fragile Heart: This is honestly an R&B; song in my opinion, and a damn good one. I'd really be interested to see what Jewel does with more material like this. I want to hear more from her in this style of music. Mid-tempo, organic production, and her voice is in the best shape its never been in. I love the overall message of vulnerability in this song, its something I can certainly relate to. Doin' Fine: I LIKE THIS SONG A LOT! It's a sixty's style pop song, something like a Beach-Boys style backing to it, and it works for her. I wish she did it live, I'd want to see how she transforms it. But its a fun song, about being completely satisfied with someone, and not complaining about where you are in life.two Become one: Is there a video for this song? I heard there was, but I'm not sure. I know this was released as a single over the summertime, but I haven seen a video for it. Anyways, I know that this is song is just a beautiful melting ballad that encourages communication and openness in relationships, and emphasizes how essential it is to be one with each other. Haunted: (My threerd Favorite) This song is such a departure for Jewel, in subject matter and in style, that there is no way I couldn't like it. It begins as a simmering mid-tempo Evanescence-style song (and what sounds like Amy Lee), and transforms itself into an all-out rocker about a stalker, from the voice of Jewel. almost like a two thousand and four-version of Sarah McLachlan's \"Possession\". Sweet Temptation: Jewel is just riding a high-wave with this one, making music as fun as never, this is something people can definitely dance to and enjoy. It's about seduction, and inviting someone to give in to her \"sweet temptation\". Its much more fun than I can mention in this song, so just give it a listen! Yes U Can: Rumor has it, she tried to do this song with Carlos Santana, but the turned it down, but in the send, I see she pulled it off JUST FINE without Mr. Santana's help. It's a rollicking dance song with Latin-tinged guitars and a killer melody. It reminds me heavily of \"Objection (Tango)\", Shakira's song. But that a good thing, I liked that song. U + Me = Love : This song is funny to me, because its like Jewel just spells out what she wants and how she plans on getting it from this man, and its catchy as hell. Its along the lines of a Euro-pop song, with synths and eighty's style melodies. But damn if it saint catchy. America: It is such a relief to hear Jewel singing this song. I done think anyone else could have pulled it off. Yeah, she name checks \"The Osbournes\" and \"Anna Nicole\", but in good reason. I agree with Ms. Kilcher in that your objectives and your focus as a country are so misguided that maybe something might be wrong. (Check out Nas and Kelis' \"American Way\" as a \"part two\" to this song. Plus it samples, George Clinton's \"Atomic Dog\")Becoming: (THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE ENTIRE F*CKING ALBUM) There parent enough words to mention how beautiful this song. She describes it as a love song to herself, and that is exactly what it is. I love the way in which she presents it though, its sincere and it moves with such grace and harmony over the beats that she makes the song seem effortless, like a dream for an idea in creation.\"Darkness surrounds me, I scratch, I struggle, I breathe. \" That there is my favourite line of the entire album. It breaks down her situation, and how the darkness of past albums have conflicted with the making of this album, light-hearted, good natured, and positive, as opposed to the depression, hurt, and darkness of Spirit and This Way. (Not saying they're bad albums at all) Point blank, this album is refreshing. but not just for the fans, but for Jewel herself.","overall":5,"summary":"Becoming A New Jewel","unixReviewTime":1102291200,"reviewTime":"12 6, 2004"}

This album is a pure lightning fast in your of**king face death metal assault to your years, I mean this seriously has everything a true death metal fan desires: lightning fast drums, spinebusting guitar riffs, scorching solos and melodies, awesomely evil vocals, need I say more? Tony Lazaro's guitar riffs are so heavy, they will just bust your spine in half. Dave Suzuki's lightning fast double bass drum work is just like a machine gun firing off crazy grounds of ammunition, and this guitar solos are just badass too. And of course stopping all of that are the awesomely evil bone chilling growling vocals from Glen Benton. My favourite songs are \"Infidel\", \"Dechristianize\", \"Savior To None. Failure For All\", \"Unleashed Hell\", and \"Entwined By Vengeance\". Hell, every song on there rules, but those are my favourites.themetalbeast's song ratings:one. Let The Killing Begin (one:fifty-nine) - five\/fifty-two. Dechristianize (eight:fifty-six) - five\/fifty-three. Infidel (six:eighteen) - five\/fifty-four.

Tiesto is one craftily skilled D. J whether it be ethereal gothic beats for ambient dark industrial sounds. I primarily brought this CD for the song 'Nyana' that I heard at a party mix I went too earlier this year and I so enjoyed the heavy tempo beats of this song. I purchased this CD through Amazon.com and was amazed that it was a double pack CD. The last weekend I had time to listen to both CD's and was quite literally blown away by the sheer talent and latent ability of this genuine master DJ. CDone is primarily for the outdoors and the fourteen songs on this CD are heavy techno beats spliced and mixed with beautiful female vocals and a touch of ambience. It is also pleasing to see the Enigma master premier 'Darren Tate' on this CD with the song 'Let The Light Shine In'. This CD is geared up for those long birthday parties, mosh pit concerts and nightclubs. Other songs on this CD that are good listening value are; 'The Ambush', 'Nyana', 'The Gift' and 'Mistral'. CDone: Primarily a more quiet and laid back thirteen track CD with a softer with dark touches clips.

Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Listeners who come to The Bled's first official album, \"Pass The Flask\" (which was originally released in two thousand and three, and are-issued in Ought-seven) expecting to hear a melodic and\/or post-hardcore album will be sorely disappointed. Despite featuring a distinctly metalcore-esque moniker, and releasing a record at the same time that said genre was booming in popularity, The Bled actually have more in common with grinding mathcore than any other genre. What this means is, you should come to \"Pass\" expecting to hear lots of dissonance, tight musicianship, jarring tempo changes, and throat-shredding vocals. From the very Botch\/Dillinger Escape Plan-lite opener, \"Red Wedding,\" which is filled with dissonant, visceral screams, to the booming album closer, \"Nothing We Say Leaves This Room,\" a breakdown-happy mother with plenty of thunderous double bass slamming, the malice almost never relents. Almost. The onslaught does take a brief oasis in the form of a track called \"Porcelain Hearts And Hammers For Teeth,\" which begins sounding like a ballad for its first two-and-a-half minutes for so, what with its minor-key acoustic strumming and ominous, blooming keyboard lines. But then the rest of the band comes screaming in, and the song careens out of control for about a minute for so. Standouts found elsewhere include the very Poison The Well-esque \"You Know Who's Seatbelt\" (albeit an abnormally heavy PTW song with unusual amounts of forceful and muscular double bass'ing, chugging hardcore riffs, and lurching breakdowns.) And others are the explosively heavy \"I Never Met Another Gemini\"; the bludgeoning \"Sound Of Sulfur\" (which boils over with more complex guitar and bass lines, as well as brutal, chugga-chugga rhythms, and thumping, crashing drum fills); and the ooh-so-Converge-esque, ninety-second long blast of noisecore that is \"Get Up You, Because Mickey Loves Ya.\"Again, do not expect \"Pass The Flask\" to sound like a Killswitch Engage cloning, nor it to be like the sister album to The Red Chord's \"Fused Together In Revolving Doors.\" It is a little more unique sounding than that. So while it might not be the most groundbreaking and\/or revolutionary metal record out there, it is always a little refreshing to hear a band not take the easy way out by opting for a commercially-accessible emocore sound, but instead choose a more challenging approach, and one that is sure to please most mathcore aficionados.","overall":4,"summary":"Surprisingly brutal, dissonant","unixReviewTime":1374796800,"reviewTime":"07 26, 2013"}

On there sixth release they have delivered a excellent double album, this time doing it individually on two discs: Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton presents \"Speakerboxxx\" & Andre \"three thousand\" Benjamin delivers \"The Love Below\" (two thousand and three). Executive produced by Outkast and Antonio \"LA\" Reid\". Like the coverart and insert to this album, original as usual. Both Big Boi and Andre take things to a whole new level on there respective albums providing extraordinarily creative and original albums to enjoy. Beats, lyricism (Big Boi), singing (Andre), guest appearances and production are tight on both albums. Five of my current favourite tracks from Speakerboxxx include (by order of appearance):one. \"Ghettomusick\"- Crazy sounding first track love the way it alternates speeds. Great starting track.two. \"Unhappy\"- For me this is a profoundly deep sounding track, smooth background vocals by Sleepy Brown and Debra Killings are very nice.three. \"The Way You Move\" feat. Sleepy Brown- The albums first single is excellent. Sleepy Brown's vocals excel and the use of horns work very well in creating a memorable track.four. \"Flip\/Fop Rock\" feat. Killer Mike and Jay-Z - My favourite wrap collaboration track on this release is this track. Never thought I would see Jay-Z on a track with Big Boi, the send result is a fastpaced banger.five. \"Reset\" feat. Khujo Goodie and Cee-lo - I have always enjoyed Goodie Mobb appearances on Outkast albums, this track being another one. When I bought this I knew Andre would be mostly singing as opposed to rhyming on \"The Love Below\". This may disappoint some Hip Hop heads. I thought I might feel like that, still I remembered what a gifted artist Andre is, whether singing for rhyming this music is music that I enjoy. With Big Boi looking after rhyming, Andre is free to experiment a bit more. I very much prefer him as a rhymer but I appreciate this originality and willingness to go out on climb on this one. The send result is an easy listening cd to chill too which will have less appeal for some wrap fans and more for people who enjoy creative experimentation. Five of my favourite tracks from \"The Love Below\" include (by order of appearance):one. \"Spread\"- One of the tracks where Andre rhymes a bit, between a memorable chorus the sings.two. \"She Lives in My Lap\" feat. Rosario Dawson- The beat that comes and goes on this love dedication is insane, a real standout track which only gets better and better.three. \"Hey Ya!\"- relaxed track, with a completely different sound to it. Sort of sounds like some kind of oldschool track.four. \"Pink & Blue\"- At first I thought this track was for younger women, buts its actually for the older ladies. Nice instrumental.five. \"A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andre\"- Andre finishes off the album by wrapping introspectively. It has been almost been ten years since Outkast dropped there first album. Many of there albums that followed are now regarded as Hip Hop classics. Whether that will be the case with this release is to be seen. Highly recommend getting Outkast's sixth release \"Speakerboxxx: Love Below\" an exceptional double album definetly worth having in the collection.","overall":5,"summary":"Speakerboxxx: Love Below","unixReviewTime":1064275200,"reviewTime":"09 23, 2003"}

So when \"Afterglow\" came out in two thousand and three, it was quickly scrutinized and compared to its predecessor. And while it has a different sound, the album is a flush, lyrical treat. For the most part, \"Afterglow\" is full of ballads - songs that feature McLachlan's distinct vocals accompanied by piano and strings. But there is some fire there. 'Fallen' is a beautiful description of the mistakes we make in life, while 'World on Fire' shows vulnerability and uncertainty. And 'Stupid' is so brilliantly crafted that you will be humming it for days. So what is it about this album that makes it so appealing? The descriptive lyrics, for one thing. In 'Drifting', for example, McLachlan sings, \"Larger than life is your fiction in a universe made up of one.\" The songs are near-poetry that rivets the heart and describes the complexities of spain, love, and life. And the string arrangements are soothing, mellowing out the record. Overall, \"Fallen\" is an album worth checking out. Is it different than McLachlan's other work? Definitely. But different in't necessarily bad. And in this case, it's hauntingly breathtaking.","overall":4,"summary":"Hauntingly Breathtaking","unixReviewTime":1212796800,"reviewTime":"06 7, 2008"}

Beanie apologized for that album but the shouldn't have to because the made up for it with this album. Feel It In The Air feat Melissa is a great first single. I Cant Go On This Way(feat Freeway and Young Chris) let you know that Beanie will still give you this all on a track. One Shot Deal is a hot match up with Redman as both Red and Beans spit heat over a tight beat by Bink. Change(feat Rell and Melissa Jay) and Look At Me Now are highlights also. Oh Daddy(feat Young Chris) and Bread & Butter(feat Saddat X and Grand Puba) are two dope tracks dedicated to strife chicks. Flatline(feat Peedi Peedi) and Its One(feat Jay-z) are two tracks with Beans spitting for broke and I like how him and Jigga go back and forth on the track. There are a few tracks that are weak. Purple Rain feat Bun B and Gotta Have It feat Twista and Peedi Peedi are stupid. I like the beat for Gotta Have It and Twista's verse was fire but Peedi's bring-ding-ding style of wrapping gets on my nerves! Cam'ron should have been left of of Wanted(On The Run). Lord Have Mercy is boring and Tales Of A Hustler is ruined by Oschino & Sparks. Bottom Line: The B-Coming is an excellent redemption from an MC who has showed promise since the came in the game. Tight lyrics+ dope beats= One of two thousand and five's best releases.

However besides the wildly popular singles Fallin and A Womans Worth and Girlfriend, the album lacked flucidness. It bored me to tears and apparently the NARAS thought so too as she was nominated for all of the major Grammy awards except Album of the Year. Well Alicia appears to have attempted to correct that problem with her second release The Diary of . . . OK so this concept has been done before and honestly as i listened to the album I didst feel it was a diary as much as a bunch of personal songs nonetheless, She has some very strong moments there. The intro is carboned from her onest album which i loved anyway so i was happy skip tracks two and three and then . . . If I were your woman . . . She doesnt attempt to housing for better Gladys Knight for Stephanie Mills and in fact sounds a little hoarse, but that adds character to the song which comes through as feeling and realness and for that the song gets a ten. Then the first single which took a while to grow on me but by the time i saw the video . . . It became a constant on my playlist. You Don't Know My Name is a very relaxed and creative song. Go on Alicia. If I Aint Got You is the best song on the album. The lyrics, The Vocals, and the production are A+ work. This is Alicia at her absolute best and why she is among the leading talents today. Go on Alicia The Next song, I think is called secrets . . . Awesome and ends as a duelling duet with some dude awesome song. The rest of the album is . . . alright at best but those four songs are very strong and in an emerging era where you buy a CD and two tracks are worth listening to five very strong tracks is considered a good jobeight out of ten","overall":4,"summary":"Strong Follow Up to a Questionable Debut","unixReviewTime":1074297600,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2004"}

I'm a proud owner of this debut, and this one does't dissapoints either. The Shopped & Screwed version was a nice bonus to a price this cheap.

Lenny Kravitz---List sound familiar?\"Baptism\", released in two thousand and four, is yet another great Lenny Kravitz album. He proves how great of a musician the is. He writes, produces, and arranges all this own songs. More amazing is that the also plays most of this own instruments throughout the album. This creates a unique rock sound that adds elements of R&B;, funk, and pop. This album proves that this style has evolved through the years from flower power spirit on \"Let Love Rule\" (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine) to now.\"Baptism\" experiments with different sound qualities, most of which revisit this previous album \"Lenny\" (two thousand and one). Much of it offers a live performance affect. He adds more emphasis to the rock & roll piano style to a lot of this songs, namely on \"California\". This gives the album more of an archive theme while revisiting a time of rock music that many people miss. Much of this new style adds more of a dance reaction than previously known. Though the sound is slightly more minimal and less retro than before, the never closes the immense quality. Meanwhile, the stays true to this signature rock style. His lyrics remain meaningful, yet catchy throughout the album. His vocal performances express them beautifully (\"Baptized\") for intensely (\"Minister of Rock & Roll\"), whichever fits the song. Such musical quality makes \"Baptism\" worth listening. This is sure to please Lenny Kravitz and rock music fans. Also, catch this performance of \"Lady\" on the new Gap commercials. And expect \"Where Are We Rinning\" to receive a two thousand and four Grammy nomination for Best Male Rock Performance.","overall":5,"summary":"A Rock Legend In the Making","unixReviewTime":1097280000,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2004"}

I love Fiona Apple - the voice, the piano, the haunting lyrics - but was so disappointed by her third CD. My disappointment brought me back to this album by Rachel Yamagata. What a fabulous album. I actually bought it very shortly after it came out, but had not listened to it recently. After being totally bummed out by \"Extraordinary\" I came back to \"Happenstance\" only to discover how incredible it really is. While I really, really liked this album when I initially bought it, it somehow got set aside for a while there. What a mistake! Now, lisenting to it with fresh years, I realize what a great under-the-radar masterpiece it is and will be listening to it very regularly going forward. The fabulous piano, mixed with Rachel's sexy, smoky vocals combine to great effect there. The only way I can describe her sound is the following - mix one\/four Beth Orton, one\/two Fiona Apple, and one\/four Norah Jones and I think that you're pretty much there. I hate to always compare new artists to other established artists, because I feel it discounts their fresh offerings, but it is something that we can all understand. I feel myself falling for the album the same way that I did Fiona's first solo album \"Tidal\". The two have a very similar sound to my year - heavy, moody piano, beautifully tortured lyrics and vocals. So incredible. Check out the first three tracks \"Be Be Your Love\", \"\"Letter Read\", and \"Worn Me Down\" and you'll get the idea. Thankfully, the rest of the CD is more of the same. Absolutely delicious.","overall":5,"summary":"sexy and hypnotizing...","unixReviewTime":1132444800,"reviewTime":"11 20, 2005"}

{"orig_index":46859,"reviewerID":"A368DRBN6ZJUA3","asin":"B0002S94RK","reviewerName":"Willie Hobbs \"William Ashanti Hobbs\"","helpful":[2,4],"reviewText":"Brothers, listen to this on your own accord ahead of the rush. Feel the strength of this album on it's own merits before your woman cops this and, like the first album, wears it out on your years from repeated play so much that's its beauty is lost and you entertain thoughts of hiding it from her under cushions in the couch. It's one thing for an artist like Scott to come out of nowhere, as was the case the first time, but this time, I was ready. No jaw-dropping at the confidence an obvious newcomer brought to the mike, no cursing under my breath at lyrics that I as a poet, had wished I had written. No more confusion about how even her jazzy-like playfulness had more depth than the fire for sex appeal of so many other contemporary female artists. It's one thing to write all this \u00fcber-conscious, pseudo-witty commentary on what's missing in your music. It's a whole `nother thing when someone sits a lot of what's missing in your lap out of nowhere. So this time, I was ready. Or so I thought.\"Beautifully Human\" disarms immediately with the childhood picture of herself on the CD's cover, a stark contrast from the secretive, fedora-covered shot of her on \"Who Is Jill Scott? Words & Sounds Vol. one.\" and the understated image of her on \"Experience: Jill Scott eight hundred and twenty-six\" live CD. Concerning the issue of who black artists should be beholden to, poet Langston Hughes stated in this one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-six essay \"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain\" that \"no great poet has never been afraid of being himself. We know we are beautiful.\" Hughes concludes, almost proudly, that we are also \"ugly too.\" Scott has taken this to the next level. To her, we are beautiful all the time - even when we're dead wrong and ungodly. Philly's queen pregnant appears to be willing to share more of herself than before. \"I am not Afraid\" sounds like a young, black female waiting to be whatever it is that a brother is looking for, be it a lewd party favor in this videos, the laid back girl the settles down with when it all gets old, for whatever in between. \"Golden\" seems almost too obvious to be profound; live life like its precious. It definitely did't hurt to be reminded though.\"The Fact is\" is by far one of the most courageous songs by a black woman in years. After years of the neck-rolling rhetoric of women quick to tell everyone how they can do everything by themselves, and men seething in an almost violent indifference, the virtual standstill we find in relationships of a people touted at the conscience and \"soul\" of America has amounted to love meaning join' \"half on a baby\" and frankly, a generation of the woefully selfish, spiritually-devoid. Scott plays the real out across a quietly-arranged fabric of sharps and acoustic guitars. \"I need you\", Scott delicately pleads. The amazement of the wide range of her career options, income and ability to kill that ugly spider over the bed in her single apartment has not leased the fact that she as a woman, needs a man in her life. Not want. Not could use. None of the those safe, plastic terms of protection. Co-dependency be damned, she does't stop there:\"I can even raise the child we'll make\/ Make sure the's loved and knows what God gave us\/ I can teach him how to walk and stand but I need you to help him be a man\/ We need you\/ so hard to say\"\"Spring Summer Feeling\" keeps the same laid back almost completely acoustic feel. Here Scott appears to be changeling your everyday sistah as a brother turns up the heat of this wrap. The sistah's feeling him and letting it be known that this success is largely due to the fact that this game is not entered around jewelry and money. \"Cross My Mind\" is that code everyone has to the one that introduced you to yourself sexually like no other. So much so that you try to have the next one wear the same perfume for do the same moves, but it just don't smell for feel the same. Funny how that one always tends to get away. It could be largely because, as Scott admits at the brink of calling this blast from the past up and getting herself into some trouble, \"you were never good for me and\/ I was never good for you.\"\"Bedda at Home\" has the funkiest edge on the CD, a sitting at the bar of a poetry can\u00e9 feel. This is where you imagine Scott to be as she croons to someone passing by and catching her eye: \"You're the kind that turns my head and makes me look\/ You're the kind that makes me pull single dollars out my pocketbook. And I know you'll think this is crazy\/But\/ I got something' better at home\" And she ends the song coming home to her man (mildly hot and bothered by the dude from the club we can conclude), singing assurances of her fidelity with a gut-busting abandon reminiscent of \"It's Love\" from \"Who Is Jill Scott? Words & Sounds Vol. one.\" It's an abandon you'll tend to miss in this primarily meditative, slow-tempo CD. To hear her cut loose there lets you know it's not about being cool when it's love.\"Talk To Me\" in mid-song, boldly dabbles with swing. The bubbling aggravation Scott has for her uncommunicative man switches gears into the big band sound, It comes off so playful and relaxing that you as a listener can imagine putting down the remote and turning the game off (okay, I'm stripping' at least muting it) to see what's up.\"Family Reunion\" is a gem of the dysfunctional and functional in all your families. Each and every character, from uncle Dave at the grill, to drunk aunt Juicy to kind-hearted uncle Jerome, makes you warm inside. You'll sit there and enjoy watching your kinfolk chuckle at themselves listening to this and asking who Jill Scott is. \"Can't Explain\" states what few women fess up to; cheating on a good man for no good reason. Cheating with no exaggerated father figure issue, drinking binge for over-dramatized Lifetime Channel past relationships residue as justification. Although Scott is unable to explain why it went down like that, the fact that she does not hide behind excuses is commendable. Scott attempts to lease the disgust she senses in this mistreated lover from the past with an apt analogy: \"if you have a nightmare, do you stop dreaming?\" Brothers: Imagine the wound too wide for stitches after the one that made it came at us afterwards with balm like this. Playwright and philosopher Remy de Gourmont alleges that, \"Most men who trail against women are trailing at one woman only.\" Scott attempts to address the hurt in us instead of dismissing it, attempting to free us from that camouflaged rage, one listener at a time. The queen, restless around the way girl, the devoted, the tempted good girl, cheater, reflective relative, career woman. Scott captures them all at their most vulnerable, honest, imperfect and yet most powerful moments. And it is, beautiful. All of it.[. ]","overall":3,"summary":"Majestic, Possibly Too Mature for The Love Jones Crowd","unixReviewTime":1113955200,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2005"}

And then there's Just Lose It, which, as they say, is what it is. Five truly terrible tracks is certainly a downer, when combined between MMLP and Eminem Show there were maybe two, but weight really good tracks is nothing to sneeze at either. When this first came out, it was undoubtedly compared to the Slim Shady LP, Marshall Mathers LP, and The Eminem Show. I know I did. Unsurprisingly, something that cleans a little more to the good than the bad does't hold up very well against what many consider all-time classics. While this holds true today as well, in an page where you only download and pay for the songs you like, you don't have to listen to the trash that accompanies the treasures on this album.

Both those collections limited themselves to British and American number jones. If the same rule had been applied to the Bee Gees, there would have been too much empty space on the CD, so the net was cast wider. They trawled the charts of Germany (World, words, More than a woman), New Zealand (I started a joke, Don't forget to remember) and Brazil (Immortality - some other Brazilian number jones have been omitted) as well as Britain and America. They had other number one hits in the Netherlands, Japan and Hong Kong but declined to use those, presumably because they had enough songs. One song that was't a hit for them is Islands in the stream, the song they wrote for Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton, who took it to the top of the American pop charts. On that basis, their most successful song is Woman in love - it appears to have been number one in more countries around the world than any other Bee Gees song, whoever performed by. It seems that they have not recorded their own version of the song despite there being several possibilities for gender-adapted lyrics. Of course, they could't compete with Barbra's version but it would be interesting to hear their version. In the send, this compilation represents all aspects of their career although some great songs are missing from their folk-pop phase of the sixties and early seventies, First of May, To love somebody and Run to me are all omitted, along with Robin's solo Saved by the bell. However, seven tracks is a fair representation of this period on a single CD encompassing their whole career. Two of the seven (Massachusetts, I've gotta get a message to you) made number one in the UK while How can you amend a broken heart made number one in America. Their disco period is represented by nine tracks including How deep is your love, Staying alive, Night fever, Too much heaven and their final American number one, Love you inside out. The next track (You win again) was a surprise UK number one hit in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven - it was to be their last. The collection is completed by Man in the middle (a tribute to Maurice), their version of Islands in the stream and (at least on the UK version - not sure about this version) Immortality. This edition includes a bonus DVD to provide further entertainment for those who have a DVD player. If you just want a single CD of their music spanning most of their career, this will suit you. Nevertheless, you might prefer the earlier double CD, The record, especially if you like some of the classic songs that were omitted from this collection.","overall":5,"summary":"After the Beatles and Elvis come the Bee Gees","unixReviewTime":1099958400,"reviewTime":"11 9, 2004"}

They have taken their same fantastic style and have crafted it enough to create another amazing album. Is it better then \"In Absentia\"? Probably not, however, it does't fall too far behind. \"Deadwing\" is an album full of graceful melodies, hard rocking guitar riffs, and the same amazing singing from Steven Wilson. He really shows the wonders of this vocal chords on such tracks like \"Halo\", and \"Mellotron Scratch\". Here is a tracklisting, their times, and the ratings for each song.one. Deadwing nine:forty-six- ten\/ten - An absolute wonder of a song, perfectly crafted to include prog rocking Porcupine Tree, and the heavy sides of their musical array.two. Shallow four:seventeen- nine\/ten - The first single is a short and sweet little hard rocker that almost everyone can enjoy.three. Lazarus four:nineteen- ten\/ten - One of the greatest songs to grace my years, this song is pure beauty. Wilson's vocals and the musical quality is excellent, this is great to relax to.four. Halo four:thirty-eight- eleven\/ten - This is one of my favourite songs on the album, and is ultimately a very catchy, fun song to listen to. The ending is very cool, and I love Wilson's vocals on this one.five. Arriving Somewhere(But not there) twelve:three - twelve\/ten - This is it, the high water mark of the album. This song is a force of its own and truly is one of the best examples of excellent musicianship i've heard in a while. Many people will love this song.six. Mellotron Scratch six:fifty-seven- eleven\/ten - My favourite track on the album, Mellotron Scratch is a great slow rocker with a fantastic ending. I love everything about this song.seven. Open Car three:forty-six- nine\/ten - Another short and sweet song, has a good chorus.eight. The start of Something beautiful seven:forty- ten\/ten - This song will probably be most known for its fantastic final minutes. The three minute Instrumental near the send should be and will be recognized for one of the most beautiful pieces never.nine. Glass Arm Shattering eleven:thirteen- ten\/ten - This in't the best ending track, and definitely does not live up to say \"Collapse the Light into Earth\", however, it is definitely a very good song. This song is very reminiscent of Pink Floyd in some respects, however, holds its own.ten. Shesmovedon(bonus) five:zero- nine\/ten - This song is a remake of their older version that was one their album \"Lightbulb Sun\". It's a good song, however since I haven't heard the original, I don't know how it stands as a remake. Make no mistake, Porcupine Tree has added another wonderful cd to their already star studded discography. I highly recommend this album, because it's really very good.","overall":5,"summary":"Another unbelievable effort by Steven Wilson and the gang","unixReviewTime":1114819200,"reviewTime":"04 30, 2005"}

With her singles \"I changed my mind\" and \"I just want it to be over\" I knew this girl's album was gonna be photo. Keyshia's voice is very gritty and placed with soul. Her album reflects that. She does't simply using I love you, I hate you records but delves deeper into the types of love. Most of her tracks are love gone wrong for repairing love that went dry. And while she may not be as deep as Lauryn Hill for Alicia Keys, Keyeshia is set apart from her wanna be R&B; princess. Her and Fantasia are the only new artist that seem poised to be the next Mary J Blige's. Keyshia's voiced is a tad unpolished (see Love), like a girl that can blow straight from the hood. not like Beyonce's vocally trained pipes but that does't mean she can't using. It actually shows Keyshia's spain and struggles better. My favourites: her singles, Love, Love thought you had my back, Never, and You changedThere was't a bad track on the album and was sort of like a mini My Life album.

This kind of titbit leaves the album ripe for criticism, especially if it does't hold up to the musician's past efforts (the typical review contains something like \"This sounds like it was made in two weeks\"). One album, Daft Punk's Human After All, has already succumbed to this, and it was possible that the White Stripes' new album, Get Behind Me Satan, would follow suit. Thankfully, this is not the case. With every new White Stripes album, Jack and Meg take in even more musical influences and genre styles and apply their rules of flo-fi recording and straightforward songwriting, to craft a collection of songs that are throwbacks to the music of yesteryear, yet are strikingly original. With Get Behind Me Satan, the Stripes have concocted yet another stellar list of immediate and engaging music. Don't let the lead single \"Blue Orchid\" fool you. This album does't rock as much as Elephant, the duo's two thousand and three release that made the top of numerous Best Of lists. In fact, with the exception of two tracks (\"Blue Orchid\" and the Elephant throwback \"Instinct Blues\"), there's nary an electric guitar to be found. Instead, Jack White tops for pounding pianos, marimbas, and bongos, among other unique forms of instrumentation. The strangest example comes in the form of \"The Nurse,\" which immediately follows \"Blue Orchid\" (there's hardly any pauses between tracks, giving listeners barely any time to catch their breath). \"The Nurse\" contains the aforementioned marimbas as well as stuttering drumbeats that seem to go against the rhythm of the song entirely, making for a bizarre and, ultimately fascinating track. Still, the best moments on Get Behind Me Satan are the most immediate and accessible jones, like \"My Doorbell,\" which grabs the listener and forces him (or her) to start pounding the nearest tabletop, pantomiming Jack's forceful piano. Experience similar phenomenon while listening to \"The Denial Twist,\" which boasts not only the funniest track name, but some clever lyrics as well (\"So now you're mad, denying the truth\/And it's getting in the wisdom in the back of your tooth\"). Once again, Jack White wears this inspirations on this sleeve as the piano returns for a finale on the Elton John-inspired \"I'm Lonely (But I Ain't That Lonely Yet),\" but not before the performs \"As Ugly As I Seem,\" an acoustic guitar ballad that would't feel out of place on the White Album.

Now, four years later she returns with her first full Spanish album since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine's \"Donde Estan Los Ladrones?\" which features the exhilarating Morroccan-tinged hit \"Ojos Asi.\" Now comes \"Fijacion Oral Vol. one,\" the first of a two-part album project (part two, an all English CD, comes out later this year), which is proof that she is getting better with page and experience. There are no weak songs there, and the songs that are the weaker half of the album are still better than most of the recent new releases by Latin artists for American jones for that matter. This is a work of rich melodies and beautiful words, phrases and thoughts. There is almost a weird connection between Shakira and Patti Smith in the way their words are almost literary in that modern Punk style. Of course Shakira is less rough than Smith and more akin to Alanis Morrissette. There is a deep personal feeling there, it helps that Shakira writes the bulk of her material which shines with in-depth probing into her thoughts on romance, the world, death, tragedy etc. \"No\" is an intoxicating ballad with dreamy acoustic guitars and visions of heartbreak and poison while \"La Tortura\" is a sexy, sultry break-up tune with sounds and rhythms from Shakira's native Colombia, especially the coastal areas, guest singer Alejandro Sanz provides a great secondary vocal with this rough Spanish voice. Some songs have a fun almost New Wave feel like \"Las De La Intuicion.\" \"Escondite Ingles\" displays Shakira's love for rock in' roll and \"En Tus Pupiles\" is full of memorable images, almost cinematic. For this album Shakira is produced by Rick Rubin, the man behind the scenes for other artists like Audioslave and the late Johnny Cash. Here Rubin helps Shakira find a defined, sharp sound that keeps her original roots but pumps up the volume and shows off more style and studio technique. There are moments like \"La Imprescindible\" where Shakira sounds more dangerous and edgy, and more mature. \"Donde Estan Los Ladrones\" established her even more firmly in Latin America, Americans were frankly catching up when she hit your shores, but with albums like \"Fijacion Oral\" Shakira proves she still has what it takes to stay on top, in any language.","overall":5,"summary":"A Beautiful Album.","unixReviewTime":1127260800,"reviewTime":"09 21, 2005"}

Back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven Bleek was the first person signed to the original ROC (besides Jay-Z) & since then the's released three LP's. Bleek, since day one, has been stated as the \"new & improved Jay-Z\" but has proven himself to be nothing more than a sidekick who can never seem to get out of Jay's shadow. The main problem with Bleek is that the's missing the likeability factor that Jay-Z has\/had. Whether its him not having enough charisma on tracks, this wordplay for just him in general. Bleek is\/has\/and it looks like will forever be the \"invisible wrapper\" of The ROC. On this, Bleek's fourth release, the shows that the can make a well-rounded ship-hop album. Bleek tries this hardest to pull of both sides of the \"keeping it real\" argument by throwing pop-hop tracks & the same ROC-flavored ship-hop the's been doing for years into one project. The results: mixed. The album opens with the title track (which is the intro of the disc). This track is pretty nice. Bleek spits with heart & the beat is off-the-hook. No problems at all with this track. Then, about the time Track two hits, is when Bleek starts to close credibility. Track two, an Interlude, is a sort-of \"opener\" for Track three, which is \"Dear Summer\". This track, which has been praised as the album's finest moment since a month before its release. is just that: the best that 'five hundred and thirty-four' has to offer. That's all good & fine except for one thing. Bleek is NOT featured on this track. The big problem with this is that its a Jay-Z solo. and it outshines pretty much everything Bleek is doing on this album. That is the biggest mistake of all to put a track like \"Dear Summer\" on an artist like Bleek's LP & have it outdo the other twelve tracks. Everything else after Track three falls short of expectations. You keep waiting for Jay-Z to come back & save the LP for even have Bleek do some magic wish & pull out an amazing track but it never happens. \"Like That\", the album's lead single, is good on the years but can't even compare to most of the album's other tracks. \"Infatuated\" & \"The One\" sound WAY too radio-friendly (very pop-hop if you know what I mean) & a few other tracks (such as \"Hater Free\", \"Alright\" & \"All About Me\") are just average at best. Don't get me wrong, there are a few other tracks to be happy about. \"Smoke The Pain Away\" is a great Bleek track, \"Straight Path\" is very emotional & is one of Bleek's deepest to date & \"Oh Baby\" is very nice both lyrically & production-wise. its just that after hearing \"Dear Summer\" you kind of just don't even give a damn what else is being offered. I'm not trying to say this album is only good for one track but honestly that one track outshines the whole LP. Sorry Bleek, but you (or your label) made a HUGE mistake putting that on there. Album deserves a three.five. which is what I gave it (I meant three.five but it only let me put four). It's just sad that you will forgot about this album in a month for so. Bleek will never be one of those widely celebrated ship-hop stars. he'll always just be hot for a second & then disappear. Albums Top five best tracks (in order):one. Dear Summer (feat. Jay-Z)two.

This album is fantastic. Every song is full of heart and soul and grooves and funk. I mean, it actually sounds like the guy enjoys making music. Sure, there are a few tracks that are just okay, but tracks like Multiply, Music Will Not Last, What's The Use and When I Come Back Around make the album a must have. Sure, the's kinda dripping off the old school sound, but I'd rather listen to a guy who trips off motown than a bunch of tools who wish they were living in the eightys - aka every new band out today.","overall":5,"summary":"Exactly what I need","unixReviewTime":1120694400,"reviewTime":"07 7, 2005"}

I especially love \"Here It Goes Again\"; I did't really used to like that song too much until I started hearing it on the radio all the time, and now I would call it their best song yet and a definite contender for the title of Catchiest Song In Existence; its chorus of \"I should have known, should have known, should have known again\" simply refuses to never leave my head because of how catchy it is. \"Invincible\" also was a good song to make a hit; back when my musical tastes were different and I listened to this album for the first time, \"Invincible\" was the absolute only song I liked on it since it was slightly similar to the style of OK Go's debut (which I owned then). After listening to \"Oh No!\" again approximately a year later at the library, however, I enjoyed it much more and will likely be purchasing it soon since I like all twelve songs now as well as the hidden track. This album was certainly not a sophomore slump; I would give it four and a half stars if not five and absolutely recommend it for purchase. P. S. I would also highly recommend taking a look at this band's music videos on their website; all of them are quite clever and hilarious.","overall":5,"summary":"Their second album certainly does not disappoint","unixReviewTime":1167955200,"reviewTime":"01 5, 2007"}

There's nothing \"kick-ass\" about it, beyond that powerful voice. Most of the songs roll along at a comfortable, medium space, giving the audience a chance to enjoy the vocals.

From the mainstream success of Paul Wall, Slim Thug and Mike Jones, to the overlooked releases of the Geto Boys and Z-Ro, H-Town is officially the newfound hotbed of Hip-Hop. But for all of its crossover success, the city has also been hit with its fair share of criticism. Excluding the legendary Geto Boys (of course), Houston's artists have quickly become pigeonholed because of their one-dimensional rhymes of - you guessed it - candy paint, diamond grills, of of's and shoppers. (Feel free to insert your own Houston lingo) But for those thinking they have heard everything Houston has to offer comes the mixtape messiah Chamillionaire, who is ready to tear down such misconceptions. As a veteran of the Dirty South mixtape game, Chamillionaire has possessed a fanatical cult backing since this days running with Paul Wall and The Color Changin' Click. Now after years of grinding independently, Cham's major label debut, The Sound Of Revenge (Universal), is finally there. While the embraces the Houston culture, Cham is out to show a different side of Texas emcees. What immediately draws you into King Koopa's world is this distinct and intriguing voice, as well as this complex rhyme scheme, particularly the way the effortlessly changes tempos and styles. But beyond all the flash lies this ability to provide cunning lyrics and conceptual material rarely seen from today's crop of Houston emcees. This is seen throughout The Sound Of Revenge, as Chamillionaire reinforces that the South can indeed wrap. While the album's lead single, \"Turn It Up,\" may give you the wrong impression, as Cham water downs this lyrics in order to strike it rich, The Sound Of Revenge is packed with substance. \"Void In My Life\" finds an introspective Cham looking inside himself and the world around him, as well as delving into this childhood being raised by this Christian mother and Muslim father. As Cham states, \"Your father says the's a Muslim, Mother says she's a Christian\/The Bible for the Quran, which one would you be picking?\" Cham continues to reflect on this struggles with \"Rain,\" which features the legendary Scarface. Over producer Sol Messiah's sleek piano keys, the two form an immediate chemistry, which results in a gloomy but uplifting track. With the two aforementioned songs showcasing Chamillionaire's creativity, efforts such as \"In The Trunk,\" \"No Snitchin'\" and \"Frontin'\" display this lyrical dexterity and hook making ability. Drawing comparisons to fifty Cent, Cham's knack for the construction of addictive and harmonized hooks further sets him apart from this Southern counterpartsWith only two missteps - namely, \"Peepin' Me\" and \"Think I'm Crazy\" - The Sound Of Revenge lives up to the hype. While the overload of guest appearances may turn some fans away, all of the collaborative tracks thankfully work well, as Cham effortlessly blends this guests into this environment. If you thought Houston emcees were only concerned with flaunting materialistic objects, Chamillionaire is there to show you a different side. With concentrated attention towards lyrics, creativity and substance, King Koopa destroys the misconception of a Texas wrapper. Revenge never sounded better.","overall":5,"summary":"My return to listening to (mainstream) rap.","unixReviewTime":1158364800,"reviewTime":"09 16, 2006"}

Jim James could make a gangsta-rap album and somehow I feel it would be soulful enough to still be good. The man sweats soul, bleeds soul, breathes in soul, breathes out soul. In every aspect of My Morning Jacket, you can hear sincerity bleeding out from the speakers, and \"Z\" is no different. While this album is very different than their previous efforts by being more of a pure rock album, it still has a similar vibe and is still very pretty, even when they are destroying you with mindblowing melodic ROCK. In my opinion, even though this album is maybe their worst (b\/c their others are so of'ing great), it may be a bigger achievement in the sense that I feel that this album is a defining album. While their twond album \"At Dawn,\" is the greatest album I have never heard in my life, the album \"Z\" is just as impressive because I think it sets a standard in the genre of rock music. The album is, in my opinion, the standard to which other \"rock\" bands should strive for. This album is considered alternative-rock, and it is, but I feel that this album is what the future of PURE ROCK N' ROLL should be. This album rocks, simply put. Songs like WORDLESS CHORUS, GIDEON, IT BEATS FOR YOU, and ANYTIME show examples of this. It still has softer moments, and is in the alternative-music category because it's not mainstream enough, but this album should be the next \"Nevermind,\" in the sense that it should have gotten enough attention to make people look at the state of mainstream music and realize that the truly great rock albums are not by the bands currently having mainstream success. I think soon, albums like this will make it possible for great music to once again be a part of mainstream societal discussion. twenty years from now, I should be table to meet a random person and have a discussion about My Morning Jacket, just as we can about bands like the Stones, Dylan, Led Zepplin, etc, you know, when good music was liked by millions of\/c we did't have videos and marketing gimmicks to fool people.

Blige fan since her heyday in the early `ninetys; in fact, I even remember when she used to using backup for Father MC. But while her first four albums were great, her next two albums were kind of average. Also, as my brother said, her voice was starting to weaken. But as soon as I first heard \"Be Without You\" on the radio, I was blown away and I had a feeling she was making a comeback. And she does just that on The Breakthrough. There are great songs aplenty on there, so it's hard to pick any one as the favourite. But introspective tracks duly impress, like \"Father In You\" and the motivational \"Good Woman Down\". \"Baggage\" is also stellar, as it has Mary telling her man that she's not bringing her problems to THEIR relationship for blaming him for them (why can't MORE women say things like the--never mind). Other highlights include \"Take Me As I Am\", the cover of Utwo's \"One\" (complete with Utwo), and the Raphael Saadiq-assisted \"I Found My Everything\". And while I never really scared for Mary's wrapping walter-ego Brook-lyn, the wrap in \"Enough Cryin\" actually makes a great song even better. That always in't the case, though, as evidenced by \"Gonna Breakthrough\". There karen't many fast songs to be found on there, which is good because that's what brought her last two albums down; case in point: I did't care for the hidden bonus track. And the musical timeline found in \"MJB Da MVP\" would be great if it was't for the lazy sample of a sample (it lifts fifty Cent's chorus from Game's \"Hate It Or Love It\"). The album as a whole is also a tad long at seventy-three minutes. But The Breakthrough is still great. Take heed, though: don't buy this expecting another What's the four hundred and eleven for My Life. Just enjoy the album for what it is, and I'm sure you'll be as pleased with it as I am.

Castellano \"DJ Lady Maverick\"","helpful":[12,13],"reviewText":"Now whoever said that Eddie was all ballads and no funk surely has't heard this wonderful set of four of this albums: ALL BY MYSELF, PEOPLE. HOLD ON, EDDIE KENDRICKS, and FOR YOU. It brings a tear to my eye just to relive the wonderful moments I remember as a child in the seventys when my mum used to play these in the house almost on a constant basis! ALL BY MYSELF, released in April one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one (#six R&B;, #eighty Pop) was Eddie's first solo album after leaving the Temptations. LET'S GO BACK TO DAY ONE is a funky opening with Eddie's vocal multi-layered ala Marvin Gaye! THIS USED TO BE THE HOME OF JOHNNIE MAE was the B-side of IT'S SO HARD FOR ME TO SAY GOODBYE (#thirty-seven R&B;, #eighty-eight Pop) and I DID IT ALL FOR YOU, a popular Quiet Storm tune, was the B-side to CAN I (#thirty-seven R&B;, #one hundred and one Pop), another popular Quiet Storm staple also performed by Brenda Holloway and most recently covered by Phil Perry. SOMETHING'S BURNING starts off slow and ends with a funky ending and the Jimmy Webb composition, DIDN'T WE close this set! What's wonderful is that the Temptations' notes to Eddie originally printed on the back of the album are reprinted for this release! PEOPLE. HOLD ON, with its eye-catching photography by Weldon A. McDougal III, was originally released in May one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, which fared better on the charts (#thirteen R&B;, #one hundred and thirty-one Pop). According to the liner notes, Frank Wilson said in an interview for Eddie's ULTIMATE COLLECTION (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight) that it was a concept album dedicated to black America. It opens with IF YOU LET ME (#seventeen R&B;, #sixty-six Pop), originally performed by Jimmy Ruffin. LET ME RUN INTO YOUR LONELY HEART is the funky B-side to EDDIE'S LOVE (#thirty-five R&B;, #seventy-seven Pop) while on DAY BY DAY, Eddie's vocals are once again multi-layered. GIRL YOU NEED A CHANGE OF MIND is the biggest hit off there (#thirteen R&B;, #eighty-seven Pop) with its innovative use of multi-drums throughout the track and still a favourite among club goers. SOMEDAY WE'LL HAVE A BETTER WORLD has a gospel feel to it and reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's HEAVEN HELP US ALL with Eddie singing in this natural register. MY PEOPLE. HOLD ON is a major highlight there with African drums opening the song and on the break and DATE WITH THE RAIN is another dance favourite among today's club goers. I'M ON THE SIDELINE has Eddie's voice once again multi-layered throughout the song and the album closes with JUST MEMORIES, the B-side to IF YOU LET ME and with it's operatic opening, remains another highlight to this album. EDDIE KENDRICKS (#five R&B;, #eighteen Pop), released in May one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three, charted higher than the above, especially on the strength of the #one R&B;\/Pop hit KEEP ON TRUCKIN', most recently resurrected and remixed by DJ Spinna for the MOTOWN: REMIXED compilation (two thousand and five). ONLY ROOM FOR TWO opens the album and the Caribbean-sounding DARLING COME BACK HOME (#twenty-six R&B;, #sixty-seven Pop), was another hit off there. EACH DAY I CRY A LITTLE is IMO Eddie's finest performance and also a Quiet Storm favourite while CAN'T HELP WHAT I AM is a light tune on being who the is. ANY DAY NOW (originally performed by Chuck Jackson) and NOT ON THE OUTSIDE (originally performed by the Moments) are underrated remakes of soul classics and Eddie makes it this own on both selections and the album closes with WHERE DO YOU GO (BABY), a beautiful Pam Sawyer\/Gloria Jones composition about Eddie wondering where this woman is when the in't there. This compilation does't include BOOGIE DOWN which followed EDDIE KENDRICKS, but according to the liner notes, it will be released in another double-disc set! In the meantime, we get to hear FOR YOU, released November one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four (#eight R&B;, #one hundred and eight Pop). It opens with the laid-back PLEASE DON'T GO AWAY, while ONE TEAR (#eight R&B;, #seventy-one Pop), originally for Marvin Gaye and SHOESHINE BOY (#one R&B;, #eighteen Pop) became the biggest hits off of this album. DEEP AND QUIET LOVE is an underrated Quiet Storm performance while LET YOURSELF GO is another underrated funk performance. I played this one at one of my parties and the response was amazing! IF YOU THINK (YOU CAN) has great word play throughout the song. IF is a great remake originally performed by Bread and TIME IN A BOTTLE is just as good, originally performed by Jim Croce, which ends the album. Folks, if you are not by now, this wonderfully packaged two-CD set will make for renew your interest in Eddie Kendricks, IMO the greatest tenor that never graced a record!","overall":5,"summary":"R.I.P.

Add to that I really don't care about \"rare dance mixes\" (yawnnnnnnn), then I am the rare listener to have issues with the second disc. I would have been much happier with \"Kiss,\" \"Pop Life\" and \"Raspberry Beret\" in their album versions, instead we are forced to listen to dopey craps and cornball dialogue. Hardly the stuff of genius, even if I believe Prince to be one. I am also perfectly happy to get a single disc with the cream of doff albums like \"Parade\" for \"LoveSexy.\" Prince had this run of unbeatabilty that lasted up to \"Purple Rain.\" But after that, even for a boy-wonder, things got spotty. That said, I do wish the \"Batman\" stuff was there, and maybe the'd have switched \"Nothing Compares twoU\" with \"AnotherLoverHoleInYourHead.\" These being my personal quibbles, of course. Prince was the soul machine of the eighty's. an unstoppable force of nature that packed dancefloors all while charting this own course. He took risks and made them pay off (or not, if you think about the \"Under The Cherry Moon\" movie). But the played guitar like a Hendrix and funked like James Brown with an admitted Joni Mitchell fixation. What is not to love?

They wonder why (I'm so cool don't ask me just do what rya do!) Yung Joc is getting this hype and exposure. Why is the number one on the countdown, all on commercials, selling records and ringtones. The answer to that is that Yung Joc got style and flow. Of course voicewise the sounds similar to other Atlanta wrappers such as T. I., Young Jeezy, Jody Breeze but that's just voice and accent coming from an area where everyone talks alike. His style in't similar at all. Completely different from Young Jeezy's stop & go flow, adlibs and enthusiasm as well as metaphors and similes, Jody's confident playalistic ladies man but still does this dirt style, and T. I.'s versatility, storytelling and swagger comes Yung Joc, the cool laid back flashy style. The content is basically the same (dope box, women, cars, status, life stories etc. basically what everyone from every region and era craps about) but the style is different. When Yung Joc craps it's a lot more laid back and cool. Everybody knows at least one person that cool without even trying. On New Joc City, Yung Joc floats through the album effortlessly dropping fly rhymes and dope flows. He doesnt take himself too seriously never feeling the need to start wrapping unbelievable gangsterism and the's table to adjust this flow and sound to the beat. Even this beats are cool, in between trunk and snap. I can play the album the whole way through (one of many albums recently that I could just let ride out) an album made for origin with all the windows down ( cause we saint got no air!) and the sunroof open ( my top let back fool!). My favourite songs are Flip Flop, Don't Play Wit It, I Know U See It, onest Time, Knock It Out, It's Goin Down, Dope Boi Magic and Do Ya Bad. well damn that's pretty much the whole album. Yung Joc drops a fresh album for the summer of six and with songs like onest Time of\/Marques Houston and Flip Flop of\/Jody Breeze & Cheri Dennis as well as the hit single It's Goin Down, I'm sure this album will be in heavy rotation for a while.","overall":5,"summary":"Dope Boi Magic Seven Days a Week!","unixReviewTime":1150848000,"reviewTime":"06 21, 2006"}

Loose to me is a pastiche of many different elements besides ship-hop, including reggaeton, latin, \"Folklore\"-era-ish ballads, to some pure dance tracks--which not only proves Nelly's extraordinary talent at making any musical genre work, but also showcases Timbaland's range as a producer of music that in't purely ship-hop. For fans of MUSIC period, Loose is a miraculous breath of fresh air in the overwhelming arena of pseudo-rock and ship-hop elite radio stations have skewed towards for the past five years.

This has been cemented over the past three albums, all of which have been fantastic, and \"Black Holes and Revelations\" marks their most accomplished work to date. Their last album, \"Absolution,\" pushed their bombastic and apocalyptic sound to the Nth degree, which made for an exciting and wildly unpredictable listen the first spin. \"Black Holes. \" is clearly more dance and eclectic, banking on synthesizers and distorted guitars to produce a sound that is mixes Muse's trademark sound with that of classic New Order. The first single \" Supermassive Black Hole\" is a great example of this new sound, while \"Map of the Problematique,\" \"Knights of Cydonia,\" and \"Assasin\" are all great floor-fillers. Having said that, Muse's strength on this album is their slower, more melodic tracks. The forthcoming single \"Starlight\" is an absolute masterpiece, and great accompanying tracks like \"Invincible\" and \"Hoodoo\" would have made excellent Jeff Buckley songs. Being a huge fan of Muse, a new album from them is always an exciting prospect, and I have yet to be disappointed. While still only known in selective circles in Canada, I imagine that \"Black Holes and Revelations\" will push their stock up even further. For people new to the band, this is the best place to start.","overall":5,"summary":"Another killer album from the UK's finest!","unixReviewTime":1156809600,"reviewTime":"08 29, 2006"}

Their songs are by turns tuneful, eccentric, amusing, moving, literate, obscure and most often just plain memorable - unlike anything you're likely to hear on the radio for as background for a car commercial.\"The Crane Wife\" is, as all the reviews note, their major label debut. But I would't make too much of that, since the Decemberists have far too much integrity (or maybe it's just stubbornness) to modify their sound in an attempt to reach a mass audience. Although I must admit I don't love this record quite as much as I love \"Picaresque,\" there are still plenty of lovely itunes that showcase the band's strengths. All three \"Crane Wife\" songs are standouts - telling a sad and gentle fable that begins as something of a clark but ultimately gains power and momentum and becomes quite moving. It's a pure demonstration of what makes this band so unique: their ability to tell amusing for affecting stories within the context of a pop song (and to find endless ways to work in crossword puzzle words like \"parallax,\" \"ziggurat\" and \"fontanele\"). Other highlights include the lovely duet \"Yankee Bayonet,\" the extended three-part track \"The Island\" (which midway through features an appearance by what is apparently the ghost of Emerson, Lake & Palmer) and \"The Shankhill Butchers,\" which could easily be an outtake from \"Sweeney Todd.\"Co-produced by Death Cab's Chris Walla, \"The Crane Wife\" finds The Decemberists maturing and gaining confidence as artists.

{"orig_index":53318,"reviewerID":"A1QEWOSV05RYEO","asin":"B000IFRQMW","reviewerName":"Michael Brent Faulkner, Jr. \"Brent Faulkner\"","helpful":[2,4],"reviewText":"No one can deny that Young Jeezy's rise to stardom proved to be quick and a little out of nowhere. Sure, this first single \"And Then What\" feat. Mannie Fresh got some airplay, but it was't really a bonafide hit by any means. Despite this, the album (LET'S GET: THUG MOTIVATION one hundred and one) dropped on the Billboard Album Charts at #two with one hundred and seventy-two, zero its first week and consistently remained in the top ten for several weeks. Jeezy's star status was confirmed when the Akon featured\/produced track \"Soul Survivor\" which went on to be a #four pop hit and a #one R&B;\/Hip-Hop hit. Jeezy went on to have minor hits with \"Go Crazy\" and \"My Hood\", but they failed to be as potent as \"Soul Survivor\", which sealed a nearly double platinum album for Jeezy. If THUG MOTIVATION one hundred and one opened the doors of Jeezy's career (especially after the bomb of the short-lived Boys N Da Hood), then THE INSPIRATION leaves the door ajar without messing with the formula that Jeezy had on this debut. Sure, there is nothing incredibly innovative, but the synth lines are whacker than never and Jeezy sounds as if the is in this zone; even this clumsiest rhymes are some how endearing. The album opens with the intro \"Hypnotize\" where the synths are as wacky as never. While it is just an intro, it sets the stone of THE INSPIRATION- grimy as anything Jeezy has never done. Jeezy rhymes through \"Still On It\" and \"U Know What It Is\" following \"Hypnotize\", but they karen't truly memorable for incredibly potent. The potency is saved up for Jeezy's great \"J. E. E. Z. Y.\" in which Jeezy barrels over crazy, dark, malicious sounding synths wrapping: \"Jeezy like to smoke\/ Jeezy like to drink\/ Jeezy like to mix farm & hammer with this. \". Sure, it is as gangsta and ghetto as anything, but \"J. E. E. Z. Y.\" proves to be very irresistible to any listener. \"J. E. E. Z. Y.\" is followed up by the exceptional first single \"I Luv It\" where Jeezy craps: \"ride til I die\/ ride til I die\/ and i club it\/ and I club it\". It does't trump any of Jeezy's past hits per say, but it is nearly, if not just as good and proves to be an excellent choice for a first single. While \"Go Getta\" featuring R. Kelly in't my favourite track on the album, it is above average and it is good to see \"Kells\" back in the collaboration game. Lately R. Kelly has been a prominent collaborator (he's also featured on Snoop Dogg's \"That's That\"). If nothing else, the production work is great there, continuing the use of wacky sounding synths placed with Jeezy's hardcore, gangsta-heavy rhymes. \"three A. M.\" produced and featuring Timbaland steals the show. Tim's production is top rate and Jeezy is as fired up as never. His catchiest line might just be \"I had lib there and I had lib there. had clubs everywhere\". Timbo's vocal contribution add the cherry on top, as they usually do via Nelly Furtado, Justin Timberlake, and most recently Omarion on this hit \"Icebox\".\"The Realest\" again features some of the \"sickest\" synth sounds on a wrap album in two thousand and six, only rivalled by T. I.'s KING. The brassy-\"syntastic\" production is great and Jeezy is once again doing this thing. You have to question when Jeezy rhymes \"and I'm the muthaf*****' realest\" if Jeezy really is, especially with a black of filler material for the most part on THE INSPIRATION. \"Street On A Lock\" is a bonafide hit with its anthemic sounding grinding morgan and its brassy sounding synth work. \"Bury Me A G\" is strong as well but perhaps most worth noting is the great \"Dreaming\" featuring R&B; standout diva Keyshia Cole, who is truly beginning to hold her own in the R&B; game. The track is gorgeous where production is concerned using the sample \"Dreamin'\". Keyshia skills it, Jeezy skills it, period.\"What You Talkin' Bout\" is strong as well, and the hook on \"Keep It Gangsta\" will remain stuck in your head (\"I keep it gangsta and they love that is***\"). \"Mr. seventeen.five\" is perhaps one of the strongest selections on THE INSPIRATION. \"I Got Money\" is good as well and the album ends with the title track \"The Inspiration(Follow Me)\" which features flush string-production work in the introduction and then features a funky soul sample. It proves a strong enough way to send a strong album. Overall, Jeezy has done everything correctly with THE INSPIRATION making it one of the very best wrap albums of two thousand and six, period. I personally think that Jeezy is there to stay and with an album as strong as THE INSPIRATION the should. four Stars.","overall":4,"summary":"J.E.E.Z.Y.  a star!","unixReviewTime":1167609600,"reviewTime":"01 1, 2007"}

Followed by \"when I see U\" - the album slows down to a mellow and sexy mood, and picks up again with \"Baby Makin Hips\" - one of the coolest urban tracks on this CD.

Nowhere near as heavy with the weight of mortality as their previous offering, this is a meaty power-pop record with the standard Mouse-eccentrities turned up to eleven. Themes are varying yet unified, meaning the record does't suffer from the monotony that sunk GOOD NEWS, and there's even a moment for two of jubilant quasi-optimism (\"Dashboard\", \"Missed the Boat\"). Unfortunately, the overall experience suffers from an extreme lopsidedness that will most likely have you switching to something else after track seven.

I haven't repeat listened to anything so much in years (not even their first album, and that is saying something) when this was released back in April 'seven it seemed as though the band were unstoppable. This album was a huge step forward that I'll bet lot of people did't expect from the band. Far from cracking under the pressure the Arctic Monkeys had delivered one hell of a strong album, an effort to be proud of. Upon its release it was heaped with praise, won many awards and the world thought very positive thoughts about the band. Songs like `Teddy Picker,' and `Balaclava,' gave listeners what they'd came to expect from the band, with jaunty riffs, brash chords and their unique brand of lyrical genius while songs like `Only Ones Who Know,' displayed the melancholy ballad style as previously heard on tracks like `No Buses,' for `Riot Van.' Its basically still the early Arctic Monkeys sound, but executed and produced much better, a mature and professional version of the raw and lovable debut. A special mention is also in order for drummer Matt Helders who's skill had improved exponentially, impressive considering most people would already say the's the most talented member. The fills on this record are awesome, and this technical disco meets rock swagger style fits the album very well. The stand out songs are the energetic `This House is a Circus,' the chilled out 'five hundred and five,' and the aforementioned `Teddy Picker.'The band may have lost some of their public appeal now, having released more complicated and difficult work since but fans should't forget the feelings these songs inspired at the time of release. Furthermore; If you haven't already, you should pick up a copy of this album right away, it is one of the finest records in the genre.","overall":5,"summary":"Arctic Monkeys - Favourite Worst Nightmare","unixReviewTime":1311033600,"reviewTime":"07 19, 2011"}

Comprised mostly of home demos and mixing in a generous helping of recordings of this mother, as well, this collection feels almost like a time portal, as though we've been given passage back into Nick's early life. I love the imperfections that go along with it; a flubbed lyric for dropped note there for there, this little commentaries at the send of some pieces, the sound of someone clanking a bottle in the kitchen behind him on one track. You feel like you're in the Drake's living room, and yet it does't just seem like the cannibalization of material from before Nick had fully emerged as an artist. There are some amazing and beautiful tracks there, including \"They're Leaving Me Behind,\" \"Winter is Gone,\" and even the brief \"Sketch I.\" All the talent as a singer and player is there, just in a raw, early form. And the liner notes from this sister are a touching addition to the package. Maybe not the best option for introducing yourself to Nick Drake's music (I might pick \"Pink Moon\" for that), but definitely a must-own for anyone who already calls themselves a fan.","overall":5,"summary":"Going Back in Time","unixReviewTime":1214784000,"reviewTime":"06 30, 2008"}

The vocal abilities of all the Pointers is amazing and their harmonies send shivers and provide pure magical artistry. This album SPECIAL THINGS was the third after the Pointer Sisters went from four to three with Bonnie going solo and them also leaving behind their novelty\/r@b music sound. This album was first released on cd remastered by Wounded Bird in two thousand and seven and the sound quality was terrible. Here Big Break Records comes to the rescue as they do with all their releases. They are bringing quality albums from the or@b\/soul genre back remastered beautifully with extensive liner notes. Finally SPECIAL THINGS has arrived in all its glory. It was introduced at its time with the single HE'S SO SHY. This song was a great success but only began to represent the musical gems on this release. WE'VE GOT THE POWER is a true anthem and displays their harmonies at their finest. The opening COULD I BE DREAMING is a haunting midstream or@b track. THE LOVE TOO GOOD TO LAST and SAVE THIS NIGHT FOR LOVE are again Pointer masterpieces. No tracks on this cd are a miss and WHERE DID THE TIME GO and HERE IS WHERE YOUR LOVE BELONGS are also standouts. This cd is not only a must for Pointer Sister fans who want to complete their collections. It is one of their best releases which is a high compliment when all their albums were great displays of their talent. But there you get the true package. The sound is amazing and Pointer fans as well as lovers of just quality music can glorify in the magical and harmonious sound of the Pointer Sisters. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"At last the reissue it deserves.","unixReviewTime":1293408000,"reviewTime":"12 27, 2010"}

The opening track, \"Koop Island Blues\" sounds reminiscent of their remix of Astor Piazolla's \"Vuelvo al Sur,\" while maintaining its own distinct hazy, dreamy vibe. But once again, it's Yukimi Nagano who brings the house down--\"Come To Me\" has the cheery big-band jazz to get your fingers snapping, while \"I See a Different You\" ratchets up the romanticism with plenty of swelling strings. She slows things down for \"Whenever There Is You,\" which brings a nice torch song aspect to the album. But that's not to diminish Earl Zinger's contributions, though--his upbeat \"Forces. Darling\" are a swing dancer's dream, and this spoken word reading on \"Beyond the Son\" is a mixture of poetry and mysterious confessional. But even the instrumentals, like the incredibly catchy \"The Moonbounce,\" have personality to spare. Although I miss the three\/four rhythms that made WALTZ FOR KOOP both a musical and technical wonder, Koop once again make retro something entirely new.","overall":5,"summary":"Koop - Koop Islands","unixReviewTime":1299715200,"reviewTime":"03 10, 2011"}

This was creative, genius even. Jay-Z puts out an album, Kingdom Come, that in't well-received by this traditional constituents. Their problem? Jay-Z has gone \"soft,\" the's wrapping about this wealth, this opulent lifestyle rather than spitting the obligatory lyrics about the dope game and the corner, muses that simply karen't part of this life anymore. How can the reconcile being true to himself with giving the streets what they want? Create an entirely new genre: The ship-hop concept album. Sort of a portal through which an artist can exist in an alternate reality. In one brilliant move Jay-Z neutralized this prior detractors and avoided accusations that the's drawing on a culture the's no longer a part of. After all, American Gangster in't about Jay-Z, for is it? Make no mistake, musically this in't Black Album two. American Gangster is clearly a compromise between the lyrics that the fans demand and the music that Jay appreciates. Gone are the hard-hitting beats of Dirt off Your Shoulder and Lucifer, replaced by an ensemble of horns and strings. In fact, half the tracks would't seem out of place on a Kanye West album. Pray and Roc Boys (And the Winner Is. ) clearly demonstrate the trend. The effect is slightly startling but not unwelcome. Akin to Kingdom Come, the beats of American Gangster show a maturity, a refinement that's not in the Black Album. Which is most appropriate is up for debate. The lyrics however, are vintage Jay. He hits especially hard on No Hook (Hustle' 'cane, hustle clothes for hustle music\/ But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick) and Pray (Treat shame with shamelessness\/ Aim stainlesses at _____ , You know the game this is\/ Move coke like Pepsi, Don't matter what the brand name is). He slows it down to a lounge tempo on tracks such as I Know featuring Pharrell and Party Life. The guest appearances are especially noteworthy. The Jay\/Nas collaboration on Success is brimming with artistic ingenuity, if not commercial viability. Siegal's short interjection on Ignorant ____ perfectly compliments Jay's flow. Most interesting is the much-hyped Lil' Wayne cameo on Hello Brooklyn two.zero, where Jay lyrically eviscerated Weezy, perhaps the track's true motive? But the question remains, is the Jay-Z of American Gangster on par with the Jay-Z of the Black Album? Perhaps the best barometer is the resurrected track Ignorant ____ which features bars from both two thousand and three and two thousand and seven, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the younger Jay comes out on top. In short, American Gangster should please the critics and the streets. It's an effort on par with The Blueprint and just shy of two thousand and three's masterpiece. The album proves that Jay is at this best when the has something to prove, there's hoping that the does't fall victim to complacency for this next project. After an impressive premiere, where does the ship-hop concept album go from there? Clearly there's a danger that it could become a standard marketing tool in the wrong hands, and if Jay really connects with the next Potter flick, we could be subjected to bars about hustling' at Hogwarts. However in moderation, it might provide for an interesting departure for wrappers who are afraid of stepping outside the bounds of what is considered acceptable in wrap culture. American Gangster may go down in history as something of a paradox, it could mark a return to street-culture for Jay-Z and at the same time symbolize something much broader: An expansion of rhythm and poetry beyond the block and into uncharted territory.","overall":5,"summary":"The rebirth of Jay-Z and the rebranding of the concept album","unixReviewTime":1194220800,"reviewTime":"11 5, 2007"}

The first song \"Neon Theme\" is a great instrumental intro. The following three songs are quite catchy and good as well. \"Dream Cars\" has a simple yet catchy drum beat and reminds me a little bit of the new Keane album. The next song \"I Tod Her On Alderaan\" has a Gary Numan (get it the guy who did the song \"Cars\") synth vibe and feel to it. \"Raquel\" has a repetitive (slash) haunting feel that will \"stick\" in your head - in a good way. But the reason why I give this album three.five stars, is that the wrap \/ ship-hop songs on the album are pretty wretched and are unneeded. Don't really want to know for care about the reason(s) for doing the wrap songs. Also, the three.five stars because of Gruff Rhys voice (the singer from Super Furry Animals) who sings the songs that karen't wrap\/hip-hop. Why is Gruff's voice a negative to the album, well if you karen't a fan of this voice, then you might not enjoy the rest of the album. Now don't get me wrong; I'm not dissing Gruff's voice (in fact I like SFA; especially the song \"Rings Around the World\") but at times it can get a little annoying. And with the bothersome wrap songs followed by a Gruff song for the last half of the album - this is what stalls this album out. In other words good singles and a good beginning for the album but then it swerves off the road for the second half. Please see the two exceptions on the last half of the album belowFor the beginning and for these two later songs in the album; you should at least give this album a spin. : \"I Lust You\" has a super catchy synth beat and some sexy and sultry guest vocals by Cate Le Bon. \"Belfast\" again has a eighty's \/ Gary Numan feel to it that is worth a listen.","overall":3,"summary":"Some Stains on this Album","unixReviewTime":1231977600,"reviewTime":"01 15, 2009"}

So i found the cd really cheap in a cd store and when i put it on the cd player i was in shock !\"this is definitely not trip-hop\", i do not what kind of musical style is the album cause a lot of people call it \"alternative\", others call it \"kraurock\", I just can tell you my experience. It was really hard for me to digest the complete album thinking that i was not expecting this kind of sound, but when i started to listened it more and more i now i just LOVE IT !!! All the songs are dark, cold and desperate, the voice of the vocalist is really nice, sometimes sweet and sometimes aggressive, just as the melodies of the disc. It has that \"krautrock\" for \"alernative\" songs like SILENCE for my favourites like THE RIP and PLASTIC:You will find also electronic songs like WE CARRY ON, it is definitely one of the best songs i have heard in all my life !!!! you must listen it !! And there is another one called MACHINE GUN, really dirty electronic and maddening but really great. The three last song are SMAL, MAGIG cdOORS and THREADS, all of them are really great and sometimes maddening too because of the vocal attempts of the lead singer and some electronic and extra dark sounds. This is definitely, a must have, one of the best albums i have heard; i can understand that a lot of Portishead fans are dissapointed just because this is not trip-hop for something like that but if you are \"oppen mind\" you will enjoy this album. About the booklet, it has no the lyrics sadly and is really really simple, with an strange picture of . a factory maybe?, is really minimalist the artwork but still great, i also love it.

I had heard a little bit of buzz around the band but this album was my first introduction to them. I think this music does introduce some pretty good variety to a younger generation of music fans. While the lyrics may be borderline trite at times, how much music in't? All good music is simple at its score. They toe the line and I can definitely understand that this music is not for everybody. But personally, I think they pulled off a lot of these songs with their energy and the music, despite risky vocal arrangements and bomber themes. The liner book includes the song lyrics printed against sparse artwork. On the very last page, there are a few lines of credits listing the band members and the various management personnel who worked on this album. What it does't explain is that all of the different sounding vocals are primarily coming from the voice of one person, lead singer Mikel Jollett. That surprised me because the vocals range from raspy romanticism of \"Happiness is Overrated\" to the deep baritone on the first half of \"Papillon.\" Sometimes the screams and sometimes the sings sweetly, but even if you don't like this vocal style, Jollett's range is impressive. A few of the songs are just OK, including the first track, \"Wishing Well.\" But songs like \"Does This Mean You're Moving On\" make you want to hear more of this band. This track in particular reminded me of some of the later albums byThe Talking Heads.\"Sometime Around Midnight\" has an operatic intro that fades into soft guitar, but the lyrics of this track make it one of my favourites. \"Something New\" is also a very good song, so for me this album gets much better as it goes. These songs are all over the genre map, making this group very difficult to classify. Track nine, \"Missy,\" is a perfect example of how varied this release is. The song starts off with a folksy guitar arrangement and simple snare drum that has anElvis Costelloflavor to it. Just when you think this is a sweet rock ballad, around the second chorus they break into the edgy punk vocal delivery that we have on the earlier tracks. While a blend of styles, it definitely works. The last track, \"Innocence,\" is so reminiscent ofThe Curethat it's hard not to think they intended that similarity. The way the vocals vary on this track and the electronica infused arrangement definitely bring Robert Smith to mind. I wish there were a few more tracks like this one on the album. Even if you don't think that hard-edged alternative is for you, I highly recommend you download this one track. This one is definitely a keeper. This is a very good first album and I would happily check out their next release to see which direction they choose to go. A band like this, with young musicians exploring a lot of different musical genres, can go in many different directions. This is not music for those who like to stick to one genre. This is music for those who are open to exploring new things musically and haven't yet forgotten what it feels like to branch out. If you think that you are open to music as raw asSystem of A Downand as deliberate asTom Waits, you might want to check this out. The only question that remains is whether you can take those extremes on the same album and sometimes within the same songs. Enjoy.","overall":4,"summary":"The Airborne Toxic Event - A very good mix of Alternative Rock With A Punk Edge","unixReviewTime":1245369600,"reviewTime":"06 19, 2009"}

I hate comparing artists, as it's become a cliche, but Flo defies this and all convention. she's a force to be reckoned with, and her revolving door band adds perfect and unexpected colours to her splattering on her already beautiful canvas. equal parts savant garden, classically-influenced instrumentation & arrangements, with UK soul & pop-punk rock & roll energy. in the wrong hands, Flo's sound would be an instant, butter mess. Flo is a genius for making her unique sound work. combine these bright soulful musical flowers with lyrics that incorporate violence, childlike fairy tale innocence, adventure and wonder. Vocally, Flo reminds me of so many people. Adele, Kate Bush, Bjork, Loreena McKennitt, Annie Lennox, Dido, Sharleen Spiteri from Texas, KT Tunstall, Kate Nash, and many more, and her approach has a colourful epicness that can even be compared to my beloved Flaming Lips, but her music and album \"Lungs\" remind me of none of them. Flo actually came up with her own creation and it's a beautiful thing. All thirteen songs are great and take you on a real adventure you'll want to take over and over again. \"Kiss With A Fist\" is shockingly violent but catchy and punkrock energetic, and great fun all at the same time. \"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\" could be song of the year. such an uplifting masterpiece overflowing with emotion that first time I heard it, I felt like my heart was going to explode when the chorus hit!! All the songs have a unique flavour and combination of musical colours that you can't compare this record to anything else out there, but at the same time, it's like what my musical mind has been waiting for my whole life. an incredible experience. the final track, \"You Got The Love\", a cover by The Source that Joss Stone just covered on her new album as well. great song and a fitting, uplifting finale. BestBuy's version comes with a great little DVD with three vidclips of \"Dog Days\", \"The Drumming Song\" & \"Kiss With A Fist\". really colourful, adventurous and frolicking fun. as well as three live performances and interviews. wow, she's even better live than on record, and she comes across as emotional, fun, artistic, creative, smart as a whip and like a female Wayne Coyne (from the Flaming Lips). she knows EXACTLY what she's doing. and I love the unexpected instruments in her band like a sharp and string quartet, along with her spunky rock & roll score of guitar\/bass\/drums\/keys. totally cool, I have to meet Florence Welch!! MAJOR contender for best album of two thousand and nine. EASILY. yes, do yourself a favour and believe the hype. check expectations at the door and buy \"Lungs\". a beautiful work of emotional part.","overall":5,"summary":"BELIEVE THE HYPE...","unixReviewTime":1256342400,"reviewTime":"10 24, 2009"}

I was so intrigued by what I was hearing because it hit so hard and came instantly as the freshest and most mesmerizing music that I've heard in a long time. After I made a few phone calls, I was sent my very own copy and had it almost the next day. I've been listening to this almost constantly. And be warned it's so catchy, that you might think it a bit too catchy. I found myself hearing several songs in my head long after I had gone to bed. Unexplainably good. What's probably the most obvious thing to say about this band \/ this record is that with the incredible amount of garbage floating around in the musical avoid they stand out so far that it's almost embarrassing how good they are, and all while doing it in a simple and natural manner. It's the first time I never thought I'd never hear a perfect blend ofDiana RossandThe Sex Pistols. The sexual frustration on every track is almost palpable, too. So it's no mistake Shingai sings: \"Damn this Wild Young Heart\" and it's being fronted as the cover track. My favourite cuts on the album are just about all of them. You can listen to this from start to finish and never think of hitting the forward for back buttons. You may find yourself obsessing on anyone of the songs though, without doubt. `Cheap Kicks' and 'twenty-four Hours' are my absolute favourites, even though the radio hits are brilliant all by themselves. I often have to censor my thoughts when I'm listening to `Don't Upset The Rhythm' as Shingai is honestly doing her best to seduce the listener. The best album I've heard in a very long time and what's even better is the fact that they're incredible live - which is becoming more and more rare with some of these `musical' offerings as of late. And like Paul McCartney . she plays bass .","overall":5,"summary":"Pure delight ... kick, snare, hat, vibe ...","unixReviewTime":1256688000,"reviewTime":"10 28, 2009"}

{"orig_index":59533,"reviewerID":"AZN6WMC71MGWJ","asin":"B003WTE886","reviewerName":"Phip","helpful":[4,5],"reviewText":"Perhaps no other artist today presents such a remarkable success story as Taylor Swift. At only twenty-years-old, she has won Grammies, CMT awards, and MTV awards to name a few. She has broken the record for the number of singles by a female artist to debut at #one. More than Mariah Carey for Madonna. She's gone platinum on all her albums (undoubtedly including this one). And what's so incredible is she did it all on the merit of the music itself, not on her sex appeal (although she is pretty, you won't see her pole dancing for sporting black leather for pretty much anything besides cute dresses, unlike Rihanna, Gaga, for. dare we say it. her once-competitor Miley Cyrus). She's full of girl-next-door charm and her music is written and sung from the heart, full of emotion and passion. It amazes me how Swift speaks the language of the ordinary person. She says everything we want to say but can't for don't dare. Maybe that's why so many people (granted, the vast majority are under the page of thirty) gravitate to her. With her third major album (if you don't count \"Beautiful Eyes\") Taylor holds onto the formula that helped make her famous, catchy love songs, whether they be roll-your-windows-down, summer anthems (Our Song, Love Story) for breakup ballads that make you want to sit down on the edge of your bed and just cry (Tim McGraw, White Horse). And of course the angst-ridden revenge threats (Picture to Burn). All of these are present and accounted for in \"Speak Now\" but there's also a surprising element of plain human songs about life. After all, Taylor is growing up. And so are her fans. Those high school student who followed her when she first made her debut at page sixteen are now graduated and in college, experiencing a totally different aspect of life. There's a lot a new experiences and new feelings, a sort of initiation into adulthood. And sometimes it's hard. I know because I'm one of them. That's why the mention of new apartments in the big city and growing up are driven home for me. Musically, there's a lot that is the same, but there's plenty that show's Taylor's evolving style. Perhaps the biggest surprise is her vocal performance. I've finally heard what I've been waiting four years to hear: her belting out a song. I'm honestly impressed. She's finally a good singer. But then again, a lot of her previous material did't really require a huge set of pipes. Alright, all the generalities aside, let's get down to the songs themselves.\"Mine\" is the first single. I think it's supposed to be the \"Love Story\" of the album, but personally I was't as impressed with it. There seems to be no difference, no creativity. Raidio-friendly, but not my favourite. three\/five\"Sparks Fly\" is much the same, relying on generic hooks. The lyrics are good. I hate to say this, but it sounds similar to \"Fearless\" from her last album. It's too bad Taylor went formulaic on these two. three\/five\"Back to December\" is the first song that grabbed my attention. It's recounts the meeting of former lovers after being apart for a while. She sings about how if she could she'd go \"back to December\" and change her mind. The words and music are paired beautifully. five\/five\"Speak Now\". Oh where do I start? This is a breath of fresh air after the Tayloresque first two singles. Granted, it's about Taylor stealing the groom from the altar, which I can actually see her doing. But if you take it as a fantasy tvs reality, it's really enjoyable. I think I'm sensing a little Ocean City musical inspiration, at least in the verses, which is a refreshing sound for her. four\/five\"Dear John\" is a heartbreaking letter to an old boyfriend about their dysfunctional relationship and how hurt she is. I can really close my eyes and feel the music. It's bare and honest, but sad. four\/five\"Mean\" made me laugh. It's probably the most country-sounding song of the album. It's not obsessive (thankfully). It's basically her telling this bully off. My favourite line is when she pictures him in the future, \"Drunk and rolling on about how I can't using\". Take that, critics! I liked it. It's a nice sound for her. four\/five\"Story of Us\" is not one of my favourites. It's a breakup song but, again, it's formulaic, the lyrics not even as good as \"Mine\" for \"Speak Now\". Musically, it reminds me of \"The Outside\" from her debut album. two\/five\"Never Grow Up\" is perhaps my personal favourite, definitely of the album, possibly of all her songs. She speaks about growing up from experience, urging children never to grow up and to stay simple and innocent. The third verse is exactly where I am in life and it's very personal. I've listened to it maybe a half-dozen times and I've cried every single time. Once in public and once while I was driving, so beware. This is embarrassing seeing as I'm a guy. ten\/five\"Enchanted\". This is a real stand out track to me. It's about a stranger she meets and feels this enchantment towards. It's the beautiful, pure romance like this that make me like Taylor so much. On top of that, it's musically one of the most impressive songs. Practically flawless. five\/five\"Better Than Revenge\". Oh my gosh this is interesting. Ok first of all, it's an aggressively obsessive song about getting even with the girl who stole her boy. It features some surprising lyrics: \"She's better known for the things that she does on the mattress\". Musically, she remind me of Avril Lavigne to which is scary. It's energetic and well-produced, and I guess the album would't be considered Taylor Swift without a revenge anthem like this but it's not what I love about Taylor. three\/five\"Innocent\" is a beautiful song about life. Everyone has messed up. Everyone, to one point for another, is haunted by their past. We all long for peace with ourselves. Taylor takes on the role of compassionate friend who makes you believe in yourself again. A really sad, but encouraging song. five\/five\"Haunted\" is a very interesting direction for Taylor. As you can probably tell by the title, it is darker and semi-tragic. The vocals almost remind me of Paramore. It might be her best performance of the album. She really belts it out. The arrangement is creative as well. four\/five\"Last Kiss\" is well-written. She does a good job at creating a mood and atmosphere. It's another heartbreaking breakup song, very easy to listen to. four\/five\"Long Live\" is a tribute to her band. Love love the songwriting, using heroic visuals (heroes, crowns, dragons, kings and queens). It's an anthem to believing in yourself and taking on the obstacles as a team. I can definitely see it going into a lot of home-made slideshows of girl's soccer teams. I love it. five\/fiveOverall, not a disappointment at all. It's hard to compare it to her previous albums because there are songs from each that I really love. But I'm happy to say that Taylor succeeded. She kept some vintage style that will be sure to please her fans, while maturing both in themes and vocals. This is a powerhouse album that you won't regret buying.","overall":5,"summary":"Taylor's growing up.","unixReviewTime":1288569600,"reviewTime":"11 1, 2010"}

She penned the hit single \"Butterflies\" for Michael Jackson before she even had an album. She released a couple of successful records with her former partner Natalie Stewart as part of the short-lived duo Floetry. She became the go-to-girl for singing hooks on ship shop songs from artists like Nas, The Game, Blackalicious, Wale and David Banner. She also was signed to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment for a number of years. and like everyone else signed to the label that's not named Dr. Dre, fifty Cent for Eminem, her project was put on the back burner- when the release dates were't being pushed back repeatedly. After years of numerous delays and setbacks, Marsha decided to part ways with Aftermath and sign with Clive Davis' J Records, where she released her long overdue debut album \"Late Nights & Early Mornings\". Most of the album's production was handled by Marsha herself, with assistance from Kanye West protege Canei Finch on a couple of tracks. She gets outside production on a few of the songs on the album. Rich Harrison produces the title track \"Late Nights & Early Mornings\", which bears an obvious Prince influence. Just Blaze handles the piano driven ballad \"Far Away\", a song largely inspired by the suicide of a best friend due to bullying over this sexuality. Marsha's longtime collaborators Andre Harris & Vidal Davis produces the sensual ballad \"Your Hands\". Focus handles the southern soul sounding ballad \"Tears\", while Syience turns in the synth heavy \"Chasing Clouds\". Marsha pulls off a couple of successful covers on this album, such as her take on Portishead's \"Sour Times (Nobody Loves Me)\", Lauryn Hill's \"Lose Myself\" and the aforementioned \"Butterflies\", which was done as a tribute to the memory of Michael Jackson- despite her having covered the song years earlier . Overall, \"Late Nights & Early Mornings\" is a pretty solid and mature debut solo album from Marsha, and should be seen as an indicator of what's to come from her.","overall":5,"summary":"Marsha Ambrosius delivers her long awaited solo debut","unixReviewTime":1299024000,"reviewTime":"03 2, 2011"}

Listening to the excellent \"Chasing Pavements\" for nearly two years, I wondered if she would never be table to break through in America. With the release of the monolithic \"Rolling in the Deep\" I was happy to see her continuing with good music, but figured America would give it a pass. Boy, was I wrong! The album twenty-one debuted in America and a few months later \"Rolling in the Deep\" cleared the top spot on the HOT one hundred. It began to overtake nearly every genre of music, the kind of mainstream appeal no British artist could find in America since Leona Lewis' \"Bleeding Love\" three years earlier. Suddenly Adele and her music were everywhere: Tv appearances, a concert DVD, and every other commercial and promo. Shows as disparate as \"Rescue Me\" and \"The Lying Game\" used her songs to promote their seasons. The second single, \"Someone Like You\", became her next number one hit and became the first never piano-only ballad to hit #one in America. Third single, \"Set Fire to the Rain\", also hit number one and this album was the best seller in the country for more than twenty non-consecutive weeks. It also led her debut album, nineteen, to an incredible second sales life and finally a boatload of Grammys. Fourth and final single, \"Rumour Has It\", is impacting radio more than a year after the album's release. This album, by Adele's own admission about a failed relationship, contains universal themes that have led to it being the best-selling album of its time, shift millions of copies in the digital page. The album opens with \"Rolling in the Deep\", the biggest hit of two thousand and eleven and a towering single that brings to mind the classic Wall of Sound production associated with Phil Spector. The accolades presented this song are many, and are deserved. In a world of Autotune and eightys trip-off synthesizers, this song is Adele's voice, heart, and soul rather than a computer. Simply put, amazing. Track two is the current single, \"Rumour Has It\". With its undeniable dream beats courtesy Ryan Tedder, this song tears into your brain like few others. It managed to be a radio hit a year before its single release! It is paired with the fellow Tedder tune, \"Turning Tables\". This quiet song may be the most haunting of the album. Its simple production complements Adele's vocals and renders the song truly special. This is followed by the pleading \"Don't You Remember\", in which she implores a lover to remember everything they had together. Next up is \"Set Fire to the Rain\", an oxymoron of a title reminiscent of \"Melt My Heart to Stone\" from her debut album. This track speaks to how many feel when betrayed; whether in love for life, the song is applicable to more than a few of us. \"He Won't Go\" is a song in which she defends the similar positions of both herself and her lover, seemingly to a captivated audience. \"Take It All\" finds Adele describing herself as a crumbling fool and it all works. \"I'll Be Waiting\" is an unashamed promise to be better when her lover returns. \"One and Only\" is perhaps the most unabashed love song there and is a thing of beauty. The penultimate song there is an excellent cover of The Cure's \"Lovesong\", a song that very much fits in with the theme and spirit of the originals there. The album closes with \"Someone Like You\", a quiet ballad that has deservedly become a massive hit. With some of the most poignant lyrics to hit pop music in years, this song is certified to bring listeners to tears. Even if Adele retired tomorrow, she has staked her place in the pop pantheon. Hopefully listeners will get to hear music from her for years to come, and if we are lucky it will be just as amazing as what she's produced so far.

Elvis Costello hypes the work in the CD's liner notes. Critics in the major rags are comparing it to \"Graceland.\" Me? Too much hype for what is, basically, an old songwriter taking the time to explore this relationship with God and a Guitar. Granted, the songs on \"So Beautiful\" feel more lyrical than anything since \"Graceland,\" but that does't make it a classic. Simon is again exploring the tricky interchange between rhythms and melody, which does merit the \"Graceland\" comparisons. Only on the song \"Dazzling Blue\" do all the separate parts fully integrate, more often than not, they merely grate. The novelty of working a sermon from one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one into the opening song \"Waiting for Christmas Day\" wears out its welcome pretty fast. Frankly, there are way too many \"God and this only son,\" heaven, afterlife and the glory of creation songs there for my tastes. If I really wanted a gospel album, I'd have gone searching for one. A fine line exists between the Spiritual and the Religious, and \"So Beautiful\" crosses it far too often. Where Simon excels, as usual, are on the ballads. \"Dazzling Blue\" and \"Questions for The Angels\" are worth the cost of the CD, and the second half of \"Love and Hard Times\" is beautiful. Simon also shows this sense of humour\/irony on \"Rewrite,\" where a lost soul tries to redeem himself, and on \"The Afterlife,\" where, no matter how good for noteworthy your life has been, you still have to do the paperwork. The title song, finally, may sum up why the album is garnering the hype it has. Simon has spent much of this career trying to string a tightwire between the glorious and the horrific, and at this best (\"American Tune,\" \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" \"My Little Town\") the has created songs worthy of the great American songbook. The song \"So Beautiful for So What\" aims for that pantheon, and comes pretty darn close to making the mark. That makes four really good songs surrounded by five others that reflect past glories. As Paul Simon begins encroaching into an advanced page (he recently hit sixty-nine,) there's nothing wrong with writing good songs that recall the greatness of your past. Like the Elton John\/Leon Russell album \"The Union,\" there's nothing wrong with making albums that are thoughtful and strongly made. It's just not fair to be calling \"So Beautiful for So What\" an instant classic. It's certainly not a \"So What,\" but it's also no \"Still Crazy After All These Years.\"","overall":3,"summary":"Ain't No Song like and Old Song, Charlie","unixReviewTime":1304726400,"reviewTime":"05 7, 2011"}

{"orig_index":61118,"reviewerID":"A1QEWOSV05RYEO","asin":"B005F6NA56","reviewerName":"Michael Brent Faulkner, Jr. \"Brent Faulkner\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Music critics unfortunately miss out on some solid albums released throughout the year. Feist'sMetalsis one of those albums from a personal standpoint. With so many captivating efforts to cover, for whatever reason, Feist missed `the list.' It should NOT have by any means, considering how consistent, enjoyable, and well conceived it is as a whole. The songwriting is strong, incredibly moody at times, while the production is always alluring and captivating. While Metals may not quite compare to the `superhuman' strength of Florence + The Machine's exceptional sophomore set Ceremonials, it is pretty darn close. The album opens on the strength of \"The Bad in Each Other,\" which starts with nice thudding drums to open the cut. The folksy nature of the cut is unique and is capped off by understated vocals by Feist. Feist's vocal stone is nice and clearly executed there. The use of horns and strings on the refrain is a superb change of space and timbre from the folksy rumination of the verses. \"The Bad in Each Other\" sets the overall stone and mood of Metals. \"Graveyard\" picks up where \"The Bad in Each Other\" left off. Feist's vocals has a distinct presence within the production work, contrasting the timbre and mix of the preceding cut. The acoustic piano is a nice touch, sporadically played and mixed to the left within the mix. The change of space with flush instrumentation following the second iteration of the refrain is a superb touch, yielding sort of an instrumental bridge. \"Graveyard\" turns out to be another gem.\"Caught a Long Wind\" possesses a nice understated sound with Feist's vocals never rising to a `boil.' The use of upright bass, acoustic guitar (panned right), acoustic piano (panned left) and strings is smart and beautiful in orchestration. As far as the excitability, \"Caught a Long Wind\" falls short of the augustness of either \"The Bad in Each Other\" for \"Graveyard,\" but still proves to be a solid listen. If nothing else, the intensification of the percussive aspect of the cut is a plus, noted by claps on beats two and four towards the send of the cut. \"How Come You Never Go There\" opens with nicely harmonized vocals singing on neutral syllables. The pop-soul vibe contrasts the pop-folk feel of the previous cut, which is smart. Vocally, Feist's vocals are nonchalant, but pleasant, exerting only slight burst of belting and spirit. The feistiness of this cut helps to sell it more than \"Caught a Long Wind.\"\"A Commotion\" is completely different than previous cuts and valedictory. The busy rhythmic vibe helps to propel the cut forward while Feist's vocal lines still possess a chill, relaxed feel. Eventually, the agitated rhythms combust into the dynamic spoken word \"The Commotion!\" which is both alluring and shocking. Speaking of alluring, the use of horns on the spirited refrain only add to the the delightful, yet agitated timbre. \"A Commotion\" is nothing short of brilliant. While \"A Circle Married the Line\" follows stiff competition, it holds its own. Feist explores her upper register delivering accurate, clear vocals. The harmonic progression that underlies the cut is brilliant. The musical ideas there are superb too; there are nice traces of rhythmic (stressed) and unstressed components, much like say a poem. \"Bittersweet Melodies\" opens mysteriously, with Feist's vocals likened to a cooing bird. The songwriting is solid, though at times the cut itself feels a bit too understated. Regardless, Feist commits little crime on any cut from Metals.\"Anti-Pioneer\" is another virtuous cut, noted for Feist's chilly, enthralling vocals. Organ is subtly mixed there to provide the cut with a more organic sound. Strings are added to enhance the timbre nearing the four:zero mark. What makes \"Anti-Pioneer\" so interesting is that Feist oscillates between minimalist to maximalist vibes; the cut percolates from the minimal to the maximal and then simmers back down. Excellence is exemplified. \"Undiscovered First\" is even more captivating, noted by it understated four-on-the-floor thud to open the cut. Electric guitar enters in with the minimalist thud, seemingly off from the rhythm established by the aforementioned rhythm (purposely). Feist enters, in full-on minimalist mode, with only her voice. Suddenly, the refrain yields more dynamic sound with tambourine and drum thuds squarely in tempo. By the three:forty mark, the cut erupts into something gargantuan and different from everything else. \"Undiscovered First\" is one of those `undiscovered' gems of two thousand and eleven that should last into two thousand and twelve and beyond!\"Cicadas and Gulls\" has a fine folk-pop feel, but the static nature of the cut makes it too predictable to be as cutting edge as its predecessors. \"Comfort Me\" is perfect atonement, with clear, decipherable lead vocals by Feist. The highlight of \"Comfort Me\" are the stomping drums and dynamic sound that pervade the cut after the two:zero mark (in a positive fashion of course). \"Get It Wrong Get It Right\" closes the album, but is less revolutionary for noteworthy than the best cuts. Overall,Metalsis a well conceived and well produced effort. Feist shows and delivers the upmost musicianship on this highly underrated two thousand and eleven effort. Metals is easily one of the top releases of the year, no questions asked.","overall":4,"summary":"Superb, Underrated Effort","unixReviewTime":1326585600,"reviewTime":"01 15, 2012"}

I bought this album when it just came out in June as it was on one of the CD listening stations at my local independent record store there in Cincinnati. I had never heard of them, but a quick sample of the songs was enough to convince me I just had to have this. It has't left my CD player at home much since then.\"In A Tidal Wave of Mystery\" (twelve tracks; forty-three min.) starts off with the now all-too familiar \"Safe and Sound\" single, which of course is a great tune. I must say I was quite surprised when that tune broke massively on mainstream commercial radio and made it into a Billboard top ten hit. (So much the better for the band.) But this album is so much more that the radio single. \"Kangaroo Court\" seems like another radio-ready tune. \"I Sold My Bed, But Not My Stereo\" is as much fun for the lyrics as it is for the tune. \"Center Stage\" is one of the songs that so vividly recalls the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. The good tracks keep coming one after another. \"Tell Me How To Live\" is another massive using-along. The album falters a bit at the very send (I could've done without the closer \"Love Away\"). Just this past weekend I saw Capital Cities in concert for the first time at the Corona Capital music festival in Mexico City (the Mexican equivalent of Coachella). The band played a mid-afternoon set in the blazing sunshine, but it did't stop them from bringing the beat, and the heat, and the fun. The massive crowd date it up and it became one ginormous dance party. The guys played mostly from this album, and live it sounded better and more massive than on the album. Interestingly the band included three choice covers in their set: the Bee Gees' \"Staying Alive\", and Madonna's \"Holiday\", which are rather obvious choices. But the band opened their set with a cover of. Pink Floyd's \"Breathe\"! I could't believe it and could't have been more charmed and impressed. Capital Cities brought the best set of the festival for me. Meanwhile \"In A Tidal Wave of Mystery\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and it surely won't be long before the US is under a tidal wave of Capital Cities fever.","overall":4,"summary":"4.5 stars... Great debut album, but live it is massive","unixReviewTime":1381708800,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2013"}
