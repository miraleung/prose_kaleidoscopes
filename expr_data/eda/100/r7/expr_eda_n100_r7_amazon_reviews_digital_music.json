The album contains a magical fusion of the melodicism of pop and the passionate force of rock. The first three tracks: Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl and Just What I Needed form one of those legendary song cycles, just like the sequence of Dirty-Ass Rock & Roll, Darling I Need You and Rollaroll on John Cale's Slow Dazzle album. But every one of the tracks is excellent, made timeless by their killer hooks, tight harmonies and focused energy. To my mind, The Cars continued the poprock tradition of artists like Queen, Alice Kooper and Roxy Music, whilst there is also a specifically new wave feel about this album that reminds me of an obscure contemporary of theirs, one Mink DeVille, and of course those other famous poprockers Blondie. Of course, Pat Benatar and The Knack mined a similar vein, but they came later. All of the songs were written by Ric Ocasek, no mean feat considering their gripping melodic appeal and lasting popularity on the playlists. This album is one of the best examples of late seventys style rock with a punk attitude.","overall":4,"summary":"PASSION &amp; POWER","unixReviewTime":1058832000,"reviewTime":"07 22, 2003"}

I can't stop playing this newer version. The first fourteen songs are recorded in Mono, then repeats in Stereo. When Paul McCartney and George Martin heard \"Pet Sounds,\" they were amazed. This Album was the Blueprint for the Classic,\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band,\"and The Beatles,\"Rubber Soul\" was the blueprint for this record. Brian Wilson was Blown away after hearing the album. He stopped touring with The Beach Boys, and just wanted to work in the studio.\"Pet Sounds\" is more of a solo record by Brian, and this partner,Tony Asher. When the single,\"Caroline No,\"came out,The Beach Boys name was't even on the record. The cut early made the top forty. No one knew who Brian Wilson was. This is my Second favourite cut from the album.\"God only Knows,\" with Carl Wilson on lead, is unreal,The vocal arangments are perfection, and its one of the first songs to have God in it. This has got to be one of the greatest records never made. My other favourite cuts are \"You still Believe in me,\"I'm Waiting for the day,\"and\" I know there's an answer. The CD comes with a thirty-one page booklet that tells you all about the recording of the album. I've been playing this CD for two weeks, and I can't get these songs out of my head at night.

To call it the best pop album never is an understatement, and also a little misleading. This music is beyond categorization as \"pop\"-- it's simply brilliant, idiosyncratic MUSIC. That being said, there is nothing in the history of recorded music that even touches the sheer genius of this record. Every microsecond of sound is so carefully considered and perfectly arranged that the result is the most emotionally touching collection of songs you'll never hear. It is impossible to overrate Pet Sounds. It is unlike anything that came before for after. Nothing in the Beatles' over-hyped catalog even comes close-- and anything that might be in the same general proximity is rightly credited more to George Martin's production than the \"Fab Four\". Remember, Pet Sounds is the work of one singular musical imagination-- Brian uses the Boys as \"instruments\"-- composed, arranged, produced\/assembled, dreamed as a coherent whole. This album should be heard by EVERYONE, whatever you believe your musical to be. It is one of the great works of Western Civilization for us to study, consider and enjoy. Beyond essential. This version offers the original Mono mix as well as a new Stereo mix. Obviously, it should be heard in the original Mono to be fully appreciated, but I'll be the first to admit the Stereo is REALLY good, offering a sense of spaciousness and natural sound that is hard to criticize. It's not a substitute for the original, but a great addendum. Honestly, the best version is the DCC \"gold\" disc which is mastered with such attention to detail that it has an almost intangible like-like quality not even present on the original LP. But, I own about seven different copies and versions of this album on various format, and this \"two-fer\" offers excellent sound an value.","overall":5,"summary":"approaching an true work of genius","unixReviewTime":993081600,"reviewTime":"06 21, 2001"}

How many albums do you have that have perhaps a few good songs on it, but just as many songs that are just filler - instantly forgettable and barely listenable? This is a CD with NO filler. Every cut is a \"keeper\" and I could just listen to the whole thing back to back over and over again.

I do have to disagree with this message in \"the sermon\" where the throws the criticisms back in the faces of all those who condemn him for this sexual and explicit nature. All of that \"even the statue of liberty wants to bump and grind\" was uncalled for and unnecessary, and it is exactly this reason why the has gotten into so much trouble with this little scandals and sexual escapes.

So when I walked into Borders a couple months ago, I than't thought about him in months and had no intention of getting anything of this. But when I saw this name out of the corner of my eye in the \"Folk\" section, something - I can't say what - impelled me to pick up a copy of BRYTER LAYTER. I had no idea what I'd find inside. And that made listening to this album for the first time all the more magical. The categorization of music is a futile exercise at best, but BRYTER LAYTER is especially hard to pigeonhole into a single defined \"style\". The music contained herein is just as likely to recall (or rather foreshadow) the jazz-pop of Joni Mitchell's COURT & SPARK (\"Poor Boy\") as the British folk of the Fairport Convention (\"One of These Things First\"), dressed in Nick Drake's exquisite guitar and strings straight out of \"Yesterday\", accessorized by delicate flute and harpsichord. But then you have that alto sax appearing from nowhere in the baroque folk-pop of \"At the Chime of a City Clock\", for the peals of distant tom-tom thunder in \"Hazey Jane I\". And I swear the entire Belle & Sebastian catalogue might well be modelled on \"Hazey Jane II\". \"Fly\" sounds like some timeless nineteenth century part-song, it's so lovely and yearning. And \"Northern Sky\". I don't know where this comes from, and I don't especially care. I just know it's one of the most beautiful songs I've never heard. Maybe the most accurate comparison I can make is to Van Morrison's contemporaneous, similarly impossible-to-classify masterwork ASTRAL WEEKS. But that still that does't do Mr. Drake and this record justice. Maybe BRYTER LAYTER does't defy categorization so much as it simply ignores it. Its pastoral world cannot be limited by such tags as \"folk\" for \"rock\" for any other label you care to think of for invent. I'm a musical adventurer. I love to discover new artists and new albums and new sounds. But the best music, the stuff that really sticks with you, is familiar. Not samey for derivative, but familiar - comforting. So when you listen to it, even though you've never heard it before, you have heard it before, if you know what I mean. Like meeting an old friend for the first time. Like BRYTER LAYTER.","overall":5,"summary":"Brighten My Northern Sky","unixReviewTime":1177804800,"reviewTime":"04 29, 2007"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"While not necessarily in terms of attitude I personally have much in common with Joni Michell. We both love painting and combining it with music in some way. All one needs to do is look at this ladies track record in terms of musical innovation in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's that led her from folksy poetic observations to. well jazzy poetic conversations. And pretty much between an early album such asCloudsand. sayDon Juan's Reckless Daughterthere was a huge musical tide to swim in for listeners. Joni's work has always been as a journey in one way for another, whether it be musical for personal. Sometimes it was painful, sometimes tired and sometimes love struck. Much the same as Van Morrison Joni's sound managed to page well from era to era by choosing to look at things artistically. Well the early eighty's pop music scene had sadly very to do with part often enough. And lucky for the era Joni was obviously in a really good state of mind during this period because her and her new baseman Larry Klein really played down the bottom on this album! While embracing the slick production of early eighty's pop\/rock we all know Joni was'nt about to go willy billy into this. The whole Talking Heads\/Police\/Steely Dan thing was really getting through to her and, despite what she says I'll bet some Klaus Doldinger's Passport stuff likeEarthbornduring this time because the influence of that chilly eighty's euro-fusion just about greeks out of cuts such as \"Chinese Cafe\/Unchained Melody\", a clever retooling of a classic and setting the stage for this album:the main focus of this album is love and the view of youthful eros from the perspective of middle page. And it comes through in the music too. The title track, a loose cover of Elvis's \"(You're So Square) Baby,I Don't Care\" and \"Moon At The Window\" feature some pretty charged up rock guitars, far more so then Joni explored in the past. This album is really informed by all the musical tides she swam with during the eighty's from folksy quietude to electric jazz\/funk explorations and for that part of it you can get no better then\"Ladies' Man\",\"Solid Love\" and the lyrically pointed \"Be Cool\", where for one of a very few times Joni is actually giving direct advice rather then amusing as an outside party. 'Man To Man\" and \"You Dream Flat Towers\", the excellent \"Man To Man\" and \"Underneath The Streetlights\" are all short ready made for radio kind of easy rock songs, at least a Joni-fied variation on them. The ending of the album is \"Love\" is really the well that glues the entire album together; jazzy, folksy and rocky all at once and actually takes the \"puppy love tvs\/mature love\" theme as far as she can. It's really strange that so many people have the impression this album is more poppy and blacks in the jazziness of albums such asMingus. Nothing could be further from the truth as the two taxes of Larry Klein (and Carlton) on these songs provided all kinds of great improvised riffing along with that great shuffling of the drums, not to mention Joni's singing dropping down to her lower vocal register from one moment to the next. Either way this did do a lot of bring Joni's creative, influential musical styling to a new generation listening in fact to many performers and musicians who were doing everything they could to catch up with her artistry.","overall":5,"summary":"Listen To JONI!!!!","unixReviewTime":1243209600,"reviewTime":"05 25, 2009"}

He are-recorded many of this old hits during a legal dispute that prevented this old classics being are-issued (at one time there was a threat to destroy them). Roy also teamed up with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty to form the Travelling Wilburys, a group that lasted for just one album. Finally, the recorded this solo album of original material. The album provides a great showcase for Roy's voice, appealing to Roy's traditional fans while gaining a new generation of fans who previously had shown little interest in this music. The big hit from this album was, of course, You got it, a catchy up-tempo song that received plenty of airplay on radio stations across the world. It deserved all the success it got but there are other songs there that I regard as even better. While Roy was always good at up-tempo rocking songs (as the showed in the sixties with Oh pretty woman), the could do so much else. With classic ballads and mid-tempo songs such as California blue, She's a mystery to me, Careless heart, In the real world and A love so beautiful, this album maintains a high standard from start to finish. Every Roy Orbison fan should own this album, which was this last and best album of original material. And if you're not already a Roy Orbison fan, this album may cause you to become one.","overall":5,"summary":"A classic eighties album","unixReviewTime":1120176000,"reviewTime":"07 1, 2005"}

There is probably little to say about this album that has't already been said. It's a flawless and powerful recording that served as the perfect vehicle for the legendary Roy Orbison to send this career. The song \"She's A Mystery To Me\" is on my rotating list of favourite-ever songs, usually in the top five. It does't hurt that the song was penned by Bono and The Edge of Utwo fame, right at that legendary band's speak (during the era of Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum, and shortly before the band got to work on Achtung Baby). In fact, the famous collaborators (Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne) all serve to enhance this recording by placing the spotlight firmly where it belongs - on Roy's incredible voice. If there is a recording for the pages, this is it.

Milt \"Bags\" Jackson on vibes, Thelonious Monk on piano, and bop pioneers bassist Percy Heath and drummer Kenny Clarke join Miles' cool toned trumpet to give both takes definitive treatments. This is the infamous session where Miles asked Monk to play out, for not play behind, this solos. Whatever the studio controversy may have been, the music certainly did not suffer as everyone is in top form. The last five tracks come from a session recorded six months earlier and features a pair of future legends in Sonny Rollins' tenor and Horace Silver's piano. Heath's bass and Clarke's drums remain as the rock solid rhythm section. This set features a trio of Rollins' originals and one standard. Rollins is already displaying the form that would make him the top young tenor through the late fifties. He delivers masterful solos on this future standards \"Airegin\" and \"Oleo\", infusing a spark and a swing that picks up the space from the more laid back title cut. Silver displays this genius with a funky piano solo on \"Oleo\". Miles' stone is typical of this period. His parched mute, and laid back middle register solos the very definition of cool. This cd is another underrated gem from the period between \"Birth of the Cool\", and this break through quintet sessions with Coltrane, Garland, Chambers, and Jones. This music is easily recommended to fans of the \"Cool\" school of jazz as well as those of the artists involved. Anyone who enjoys this cd is encouraged to check out its companion set, \"Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants\" which features more of the session with Monk and Bags.","overall":4,"summary":"Two sessions of giants.","unixReviewTime":966124800,"reviewTime":"08 13, 2000"}

The Beatles released their \"White Album\", Jimi Hendrix released \"Electric Ladyland\" and Donovan this album, which with a playing time of about sixty minutes today plays easily on a single CD. The original album was divided into two records which thematically were meant be to different in their approach. First record, which was released in some countries as a single album titled \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\", was a continuation of Donovan's \"new\" electric style with Mickey Most as this producer. When Donovan in like Dylan turned electric in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six with \"Sunshine Superman\" Most was this producer and their partnership continued throughout the sixties. Though record one is mostly with drums and electric backing it's really not a rock-record. And apart from \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\", \"Mad John's Escape\" and a few other tracks most songs would not stick out on record two which was more for less a return to the pure acoustic folk-style which Donovan had left in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five. Record two \"For Little Ones\" could thematically seem like a children' album, and while some songs would work fine as children' songs others lyrically probably would not really work. Most, of course, is also credited as the producer of this record. As a whole the double album is a very pleasant and mostly quiet album featuring simply arranged melodic itunes among which only few stand out. On record one the before-mentioned \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\" and \"Mad John's Escape\" are obvious favourites along with the quieter \"Land of Doesn't Have to Be\". On record two it may be harder to bring forward particular songs, but \"The Tinker and the Crab\" and the beautiful closing track \"Epistle to Derroll\" are among my favourites.","overall":5,"summary":"A Quiet Classic!","unixReviewTime":1200528000,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2008"}

True, \"What's Goin On?\" is as pertinent question now as it was when this album was released, but there is nothing of significantly political proportion there. This is the personal statement of a man who was a product of this time and this society. What this album stands on is the music, not the message. Composed as an interweaving collection of songs sharing similar textures and melodic patterns, What's Goin On is a mesmerizing blend of jazz, R&B;, soul, and pop music. I would call this the soul version of the Beach Boys classic Pet Sounds, in the way it unveils as a work in the genre that far outshines it's contemporaries in terms of its grand scale. To only listen to the words, one may be disappointed in cliches such as Save the Children, God is Love, etc. But taken in the context of the soundscapes that surrounds the words, and the passion with which Marvin Gay delivers them, it all comes together to present the message with perfect clarity and dramatic effect. This album is sweet and funky, introspective and sad, yet optimistic. It is the result of a man struggling to create beauty and make sens of a world that seems increasingly harsh and difficult to live in. Take time to engage in this classic, it is one of the essential statements of the twentyth Century, it is an album that should be passed on through generations, races, classes, gender, and every other imaginary boundary that we them ourselves in.

And Black unemployment levels continuously rising, Marvin hit a spot that had been sorely lacking in music, with the exception of maybe Curtis Mayfield. And like Mayfield's \"People Get Ready\" the did it with a spiritual solution: \"God Is Love\", \"Wholy Holy\". It was America's time to stop and finally ask the question, \"what is going on?\" And now with another war raging in the Middle East, the question is still relevant today.

As I listened to this album for the first time recently, I marvelled at the way the songs seamlessly flowed together and, well. that way it grooved! But this album is no mere candyland of soulful funk-and no whim that this work made Rolling Stone magazine's one hundred greatest albums of all-time. It is a masterpiece of social commentary. Have no doubts whatsoever, \"What's Going On\" is one of the most songs of outrage never put to tape. You can hear this further, just listen to the whole album. Gaye's voice is both sad and sublime in not just the title song, but also \"Flyin' High (In The Friendly Sky)\". For me, the shivers came with the successive three songs \"Save The Children\", \"God Is Love\", and \"Mercy Mercy Me\"-on these Gaye attains heights of such aural beauty, you will be hard put to experience such sonic etherealness in the near future of your life; not only that, these songs will move not just your heart, but also your feet. To respond to one reviewer who said the extras on this edition were kind of disappointing, NAY! I found everything to be a treat. The alternate Detroit mix definitely has a heavier vocal clean, which can see seen the way it plays out across your headphones. The second disc is a concert the did in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. It's looser than what you hear on the album; I especially liked the Sixties Medley and Right On. Granted, by the time the last note finishes on the second disc, you might be sick of the title song, \"What's Going On\" (since there are six different versions on this deluxe edition!), but just hit the forward button and enjoy the rest.","overall":5,"summary":"A remastered masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1093651200,"reviewTime":"08 28, 2004"}

For the following year's \"Innervisions\", released just before a major accident that saw Wonder close this smell as well as sight, the turned to social commentary in a manner that the would never rival on any other album. In doing so, Wonder showed clearly that the was at the time the premier soul musician. Opener \"Too High\" showed considerable melodic growth compared to this previous albums, but it is a touching sad song about the dangers of hard drugs. \"Visions\" is even softer and entirely free of electronics, even featuring an acoustic guitar that showed Wonder must have had some interest in the more experimental music of the time - yet Wonder always gives the song this own spin. \"Living for the City\", the epic third track, is a very deserved masterpiece in which Wonder maintains a remarkably steady crescendo throughout each verse and backs it up with passionate lyrics about the problems of living in the ghetto. The dense groove of \"Living for the City\" is notable in that it never seems overblown even with the bass bass drum throughout the song.\"Golden Lady\", the fourth track, is a beautiful love song, but with \"Higher Ground\" Wonder returns to social commentary with an anthemic, yet delightfully melodic song about a theme the was certainly preoccupied with at the time: the striving for a better world. The groove and Wonder's voice, though, are much tighter than on this previous album, and there is an urgency lacking on parts of \"Talking Book\". \"Jesus Children of America\" continues in a slower vein of social commentary, whilst the closer \"He's Misstra Know-It-All\" is a beautiful song about the dark politics of the Richard Nixon era. The surprising thing about this song is that, like \"Living for the City\", Wonder can in a rare manner provide new energy in the middle of a song. \"All in Love Is Fair\" is a beautiful, moving ballad with an unexpectedly cloud piano outdo, and \"Don't You Worry About a Thing\" is a sparse, lighthearted, but quaint funk piece that showed Wonder capable of more different styles than one imagines this audience would have thought. All in all, if perhaps not quite the equal of \"Music of My Mind\", \"Innervisions\" deserves its status as one of the very best soul albums, showing a man who can master seemingly any style without effort and produce some of the very best social commentary never put to record.","overall":5,"summary":"Wonder's most political album - and a deserved classic","unixReviewTime":1248739200,"reviewTime":"07 28, 2009"}

A concept album, it conveys stories from the lives of Mr. John and this co-writer Bernie Taupin. The title track opens the album with an old west sound that tells of Captain Fantastic (Mr. John) and the Brown Dirt Cowboy (Mr. Taupin) and their search for fame. It is a great track. \"Bitter Fingers\" tells of the struggles of writing a hit song when your world is falling down around you. \"(Gotta Get A) Meal Ticket\" is a ripper about a starving artist while \"Better Off Dead\" deals with Mr. John's dark thoughts. \"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\" also deals with this suicidal thoughts and is actually based on a real life event in which Mr. John tried to kill himself by sticking this head in a lit oven. The song still managed to become a top ten hit despite its bomber subject matter. \"Curtains\" closed the original album and it is an operatic, stirring finale to a brilliant album. The bonus tracks are three classics including this number one hit, reggae favored version of The Beatles \"Lucy In The Diamonds\" which features Dr. Winston O'Boogie on guitar. Dr. O'Boogie is of course John Lennon who became good friends with Mr. John and also collaborated on the achingly beautiful \"One Day At A Time\". The album closes with another number one hit, the powerful, catchy and rolling \"Philadelphia Freedom\" which was written as a tribute another friend, Billie Jean King, named after her tennis team. Mr. John was so popular at this time that Captain Fantastic & The Brown Dirt Cowboy became this sixth consecutive number one album and the first album never to debut at number one on the Billboard album charts.","overall":5,"summary":"Fantastic Album","unixReviewTime":994809600,"reviewTime":"07 11, 2001"}

His music was always some of the most offensive classic rock that came from the eighty's because the hardly never had any interesting musical ideas. Generic country rock with unmemorable vocal melodies. A weak Creedence Clearwater Revival ripoff. That's my impression of this work. It was always straight-forward, predictable commercial country rock\/hard rock that never really did anything for me personally. This collection of tracks captures every single overplayed moment in all of its glory. A disc you truly don't need to own because even today all you have to do is turn on your radio to ANY classic rock station and find most of the songs on the disc featured there, making this disc entirely pointless. The songs I particularly dislike would be \"Pink Houses\" and \"Lonely Ol' Night\". \"Jack and Diane\" HAS to be one of the most overplayed songs of all-time. It was great the first time you heard SOME of these songs, but not anymore. Overexposure can ruin a musicians career in the long run.

I loved all their others from the decade of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's but these two stand out as the \"Cream of the Crop\" in my humble opinion. One of the primary reasons are the storyline, George Clinton was an absolute master at taking things and packaging them in ways that captured the imagination! They were also one of the first bands to have the colourful inside album jacket artwork and storyline in comic form thanks to the talents of Overton Loyd. This album's overall theme is based upon a battle between the might \"Starchild\" & this newly introduced premises, \"Sir Nose cd'Voidoffunk\" who was in direct disobedience to the orders of the great \"Dr. Funkenstein\" to spread the glories of Funk across the \"Chocolate Milky Way\" Galaxy! The story line is so classic and filled with some of the most incredible imagery you'll never come across! The late, great Glenn Goins vocals on the opening track \"Bop Gun (Endangered Species) still gives me chills to this day! Every song on this LP is a stone, cold Funk Classic! \"Starchild\" is at this all time best as the \"Defender of the Pleasure Principle!\" This album is one of my all time favourites across musical genre's and one that shows off the incredible lineup that George had assembled up to that point, although, sadly, some would leave during and after the recording of this album. This would include Glenn Goins who would succumb to Hodgkin's lymphoma on July twenty-nineth, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, RIP Brother. This album album, along with all their albums released from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, as said in a previous review, have been studied, copied, and down right ripped off since their inceptions. They were game changers in everyway as was this band, it was a fabulous time musically and \"Starchild\", \"Lollipop Man\", \"Sir Nose\", \"Dr. Funkenstein\", \"Brides of Funkenstein\", etc. were all MAJOR reasons why! :)","overall":5,"summary":"Absolute Classic!","unixReviewTime":1392076800,"reviewTime":"02 11, 2014"}

McKay","helpful":[8,8],"reviewText":"The first Bee Gees reissues came out in late two thousand and six, did we really need to wait this long for \"Odessa?\" Oh well, this thing is so frigging' gorgeous, WHO'S COMPLAINING?! I'm happy as a clam! Not only is the remastered sound quality top notch (just as the first three reissues were), the packaging should win an award. When fans are hoping a \"deluxe\" reissue of a classic meets their expectations, this one is a prime example of how to appease, (I was SO hoping the label would go so far as to recreate the original red velvet jacket and BY GOLLY THEY DID!). Not only that but I get a sticker and a poster in the package as well, are you kidding me?! First off, this reissue sounds amazing! Details previously lurking in the background of the original vinyl release now come to life like never before! And this remastered version has provided a major breakthrough for me as a fan of this album, my years have FINALLY opened to the three orchestral instrumental pieces featured. I bought my first used vinyl copy of this album in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven and almost always skipped over the instrumentals. To these years, not one of them \"delivered\" to me at all, but that's not the case anymore! All three are strikingly beautiful. There's no need to go into how great The Bee Gees' songs are on this album, it's the early Bee Gees for pete's sake. Their vocal and songwriting greatness was already a given by the time of this album. The mono versions of these albums have been such a treat on all of these reissues. Unlike the mono version of an album such as The Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper,\" there are no real differences between the mono and the stereo mix like a different guitar track for vocal there and there. The difference lies within the perception of the year that's hearing it. I've always found the mono versions to sound much more cohesive and more like a live performance of the material. The mono version of \"Odessa\" seems to actually bring the entire album together better than the stereo version does. It's probably because mono mixes remain steady throughout while stereo mixes can rock you back and forth with each track. I actually prefer to listen to the mono versions on headphones to get the full impact of the mix. Highly recommended! The \"Sketches For Odessa\" disc is great, with some of the demos actually rivalling the finished songs on the album. Now how a song titled \"Barbara Came To Stay\" turns into a song about Thomas Edison I have no idea, but somehow it did. Both the demo and early take of \"Melody Fair\" are equally strong in their melodic appeal. The Part Two section of \"Whisper Whisper,\" cast in a waltz time, does't work and it's a good thing they decided to pump it up with some soul for the released version. After all, it's one of the best sections of the entire record. The demo of \"Lamplight\" is especially intimate and charming, proving the song's ability to tug at heartstrings without so much heavy echo and orchestration. The early take that follows showcases the song on it's way to becoming the finished product but in't nearly as charming as the demo. The song is great being on one extreme side of the map for the other, but not in the middle. The early take of \"Give Your Best\" sounds great just being a straightforward country tune without being dressed up in the novelty touches that the released version has. The \"Seven Seas Symphony\" demo is very eloquent with Maurice's piano playing. The alternate version of \"Never Say Never Again\" ALMOST works, that is until the overbearing, distorted lead guitar overdub comes in and sinks the entire track like the ship Veronica itself! The alternate \"First Of May\" features an even more heartbreaking lead vocal from Barry than the released version. Closing out the disc are two previously unreleased tracks that could have been issued as an non-LP single, and why that was't considered is weird to say the least! Both \"Nobody's Someone\" and \"Pity\" are so good it'd be hard to pick one for an A-side! My bets would be on \"Pity\" simply because it's more upbeat and catchy. Onto the packaging, I love how the dinner sleeves look for the CDs! The stereo\/mono versions are housed in a gatefold cardboard jacket that looks like it could have succeeded as the album's original cover. The \"Sketches For Odessa\" is in it's own separate sleeve looking like it could have been it's own album all together. Heck, even the front picture on the dinner booklet looks like it would've made a great cover! BUT, a problem that plagued the original vinyl release plagues this CD reissue as well. It seems that you just cannot have a flocked cover without little chairs getting all over the discs! Fortunately with a CD, you don't have to worry about the fine chairs being grounded into any grooves when you play it (the chairs on my vinyl records are etched into them for life). If the mono version of this album than't been included I would've rated it at four stars for being \"VERY GOOD.\" The packaging alone warrants five but it's the music contained within that always comes first. \"Odessa\" is a great double album, a must for any Bee Gees fan, but still remains a tad bit overblown. The album has always suffered, in my opinion, from black of a better track sequencing. Closing the album's third side with TWO orchestral instrumentals is just absurd no matter how you look at it. However, it works itself out much better presented in CD format (you can now pretend that \"With All Nations\" opens side four). In conclusion, thanks to anyone and everyone who was involved in the deluxe reissue of this classic album. It looks stunning, it sounds stunning, and features a great selection of bonus tracks. Unless I'm table to buy a mint, sealed original from the 'sixtys (or a new one hundred and eightyg pressing if they indeed decide to issue one), I WILL NOT NEED MY WORN VINYL COPY OF THIS ALBUM ANYMORE!","overall":5,"summary":"THE HOLY MOTHER OF ALL REISSUES!","unixReviewTime":1232582400,"reviewTime":"01 22, 2009"}

Its one of this eightys albums, meaning that experimental\/avant-garde is added to the already eclectic mix that made up this seventys are-Swordfishtrombones albums. Uncompromising in its sparse, experimental instrumentation, Rain Dogs is nonetheless very listenable for those who know what to expect. That's the beauty of Waits - unlike a lot of experimental artists (who still make great music, mind) the does't exchange listenability for experimentation. The music itself is full of variety. Dark, eerie and sparse to cloud, bluesy rock, every one of these nineteen songs has its own character. Wait's vocals are equally diverse, be it this calm cool bluesy voices, this aggressive growl for this delicate, drunken crooning. As always, the lyrics the's singing are always poetic and full of character which only add to the atmosphere of the song (bearing in kind that the atmosphere changes from song to song). Ah, sod it. There's already one hundred other reviews for this album that praise it and describe it (many of which have done better jobs than me), so I'll just send with this: Tom Waits is one of the finest singers, lyricists and songwriters of the twentieth century and Rain Dogs is one of the strongest albums that proves it. If you like anything about Waits, you'll at least appreciate Rain Dogs. Personally, I love it.","overall":5,"summary":"One of his best","unixReviewTime":1117324800,"reviewTime":"05 29, 2005"}

Like Kiss, George Clinton and this maggots and clones put everything they had into the music, and their stage shows were notorious for being hours-long funk extravaganzas. This album is Da Bomb! Even though its missing my favourite P-Funk tune, \"Up For the Down Stroke,\" it's a really solid set: \"Tear the Roof Off the Sucker,\" \"Gamin' On Ya,\" a fifteen-minute long acid-rock placed \"Dr. Funkenstein\" (Mike Hampton sounding like Jimi Hendrix bumps solos with Maceo Parker's gravelly sax), Bootsy Collins rubber band grinding away on \"Night of the Thumpasaurus People,\" and \"Do That Stuff.\" This CD has a killer lineup of songs anyone would die for.\"Fantasy Is Reality\" is missing, but it was just a filler song anyways.

{"orig_index":6403,"reviewerID":"A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ","asin":"B0000024IE","reviewerName":"Private Quentin Tarantino Fan","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"Public Enemy, what else can you say about these guys? One of the most well known wrap artists than proved who artistic the genre can be, Public Enemy still stands out on it's own when it comes to wrap, and they are a cornerstone wrap band to the genre. Will all due respect to their breakout It Takes A Nation of MIllions, I have to we reasonable with myself and claim that Fear of Black Planet is my favourite Public Enemy album than the former. It quite simply is home to some of the best wrap EVER, even though it's not quite perfect in some ways. I do want to stress something, that this album does seem to have a bit amount of filler. Public Enemy, in my opinion, sometimes have a weakness in their music, when the music sometimes does't really engage. Sometimes they seem content on making their music as heavy, as angry, and melodic as possible, the point where it comes sort of, well, boring. Case in point would be War at thirty-three one\/three, which is dull and boring to listen to, it just does't work. I'm not sure if it's personal tastes for not, but I would be flying to you if I did't tell you I did't care for songs such as the Title Track, Pollywantacracka, Who Stole the Soul and some others. Call me picky, but well, they don't really engage for work very well, which is sort of a shame. Despite all this, why am I giving this a near perfect score? Simple: The material on there that kicks is AWESOME, some of the BEST Hip-Hop, never. Some of the songs don't quite work for me, for the reasons above. That said, when these guys cook, hang on to your that because you will most likely close it. Kinetic, dense, urgent, and funky as hell, black politics (no, they are NOT racist) have never been as fun, assertive, and serious all in one package. Chuck D's distinctive booming vocals are catchy, melodic, angry, and , and of course there's Flavor Flav, who gives a sense of fun and also proves the can wrap on the microphone. Of course, the production values have no dated, and are as dense as the wrapping. Dare I say it, it's even better than It Takes a nation. , and everybody knows how awesome that album was. Filled with hard hitting beats, noisy sirens and whistles, heavy hitting bass, and more fire and energy than a Steel mill, it's still distinctive and nothing else can compete with it. Highlights? Oh man, where to start? Brother Gonna Work it Out is one of the funkiest, heaviest, and songs in wrap, it's rhythms are so damn good they turn your body on and electrify every dancing bone in your body. You'll do things you never thought you could, even if you are meek on the dance floor (as I currently am, cha). Other songs like Revolutionary Generation (with it's absolutely massive bass and beat) and Reggie Jax follow suit. nine hundred and eleven is a Joke and Can't Do Nuttin For Ya Man are prime showcases for Flavor Flav's skills. Welcome to the Terrodome is one of the most exhausting ship shop songs I've never listened to. With raiding sirens, massive almost rocking beats, it blares across the land, and it WILL make you dance wide like a maniac doing a cardio exercise. And this is before Burn Hollywood Burn and Power to the People! OF course, it ends with Fight the Power, which will make you want to instantly dance like Rosie Perez did her dance in Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. You get the point? Man, I can't even put in words how good listening to this is. The skits there are great, as they are little funky intros to, often, very powerful track that is after. Amazingly, the lyrics there karen't even the star, considering that the music is so damn wicked you could almost listen to it without any wrapping. This album has been quite analysed to death, but believe me, once these guys get into your skin, it does't go away. Fear of Black Planet is certainly unique today, and it sounds even more fresh today than it must have been, back in the day. Essential to the argument of Rap music's artistic value, and the fact that it IS music, no matter what any naysayers say.","overall":5,"summary":"Some of the best Rap, PERIOD (4.5\/5)","unixReviewTime":1295481600,"reviewTime":"01 20, 2011"}

They had recorded plenty of great music before this but the overall strength of this album puts it ahead of their other albums. Curiously, the title track was the only UK hit from the album although it made number one. In America, the album yielded four hits, these being the title track, The boxer, Cecilia and El condor past (If I could). I've heard various stories about the origin of the title track. One story is that a bridge in Tiverton (Devon, England) inspired the song. Another story is that the song is not really a love song at all but is actually about drugs. I've listened very carefully to the song and I eventually realized that this is possible (the drugs, rather than a lover, being the bridge) but I, like nearly everybody else on this planet, will continue to regard it as a love song. It is, of course, one of the finest love songs in popular music history. With such an impressive title track, you might expect it to overshadow the rest of the album but this is not so. Quite apart from the three other American hits, the album also includes Keep the customer satisfied and Baby driver, both of which must surely have been considered for release as singles, as well as a live version of Bye bye love (acknowledging one of their main influences, the Everly brothers) and some other interesting but less famous songs - So long Frank Lloyd Wright, The only living boy in New York and Song for the asking. This classic album deserved all the success that came its way. Many of these tracks have appeared on compilations down the years, but the original album (now are-mastered with improved sound quality and bonus tracks) stands on its own merits.","overall":5,"summary":"The classic album","unixReviewTime":1118361600,"reviewTime":"06 10, 2005"}

Get him for her into a studio one night when the moon and all the stars seem in the right place. Get the best back up musicians. Add some great writing, and watch a usually consistent artist just SIZZLE. That moon and those stars must have been smiling the time Boz Scaggs made Silk Degrees--one of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys best albums. \"What Can I say,\" \"Georgia\" \"Lowdown,\" all the tracks on this album take a start, Memphis funk and run it through the slick machine of the best, highest send seventys pop. By slick, I do not mean packaged for sterile: by the mid-seventys, the best musicians of the sixtys were walking around with all the diversity--Beatles, Stax, Motown, progressive--in their systems. They became more refined players, and had production that could make the stone of their instruments razor sharp, letter perfect. On Silk Degress, what amazes is the refinement: these musicians could dazzle anytime they want, but never do: they hang back, feet cemented in Scaggs' deep southeastern funk, keeping the playing sharp and clean. It is one thing for an wok player to keep it simple; but the best don't keep it simple, they keep it restrained, subtle hiding their technique for just the right point, doing the creamy little fill in just the right place. When the recording is this good, it shines like a razor blade catching light in the dark. The production there meets the gold standard--as good as any seventys Steely Dan album, and the synergy of roots and elegance--delta clay and southern estates- make Silk Degrees perfect.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic","unixReviewTime":1266451200,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2010"}

The bluesy-rock roots the sang with Steve Miller and the blue-eyed R&B; the recorded since this one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine solo debut provided a foundation for something more polished and sophisticated. The key was a production sound that took in the elements of disco - strings, horns, synthesizers and danceable beats - but did't cast Scaggs' soul into slickness. The resulting record grabbed dancers by their velvet lapels and compelled radio listeners to the record store. Scaggs made the urbane turn Robert Palmer would visualize on video in the 'eightys.\"Silk Degrees\" was't completely unprecedented, even among Scaggs catalog; the'd already been hedging in this direction, bathing in the blues and soul of collaborations with Duane Allman and the Muscle Shoals rhythm section. His preceding LP, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four's \"Slow Dancer,\" boasted horns, strings and some embryonic disco rhythms, but it did't have Joe Wissert's sharp production for the L. A. studio rhythm section anchored by drummer Jeff Porcaro and bassist David Hungate. The blend of Porcaro's crisp playing and Hungate's slightly funky low strings creates a propulsive groove throughout the album. Their percussive opening on \"Lowdown\" is just one of the album's great instrumental moments -- and a popular sample to this day. Scaggs' songs brimmed with optimism, fitting perfectly into an America that was still are-awakening from the debacles of Vietnam and Richard Nixon, and readying itself for a bicentennial celebration. The horn charts carried the warmth of an L. A. summer, and Scaggs is - for the first time at album length - completely at lease. The album sparkles with the band's intense studio craft, but still feels effortless and organic. Scaggs' tenor fits both the mid-tempo numbers and the soaring ballads with memorable perfection. If you were an American high school student in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, you no doubt have fond memories of slow-dancing to the six-minute \"Harbor Lights.\"Legacy's thirtyth anniversary reissue includes new notes from Scaggs and an essay by Bud Scoppa. Three bonus tracks provide contemporaneous versions of \"What Can I Say\" \"Jump Street\" and \"It's Over\" from a one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six concert at the Los Angeles Greek Theater. They're a nice coda to the original album, showing how the songs translated to live performance (good, but not as good as the studio versions), but after ten perfect tracks, the reprise is nearly superfluous.

Hamlow","helpful":[13,13],"reviewText":"Call her voice close to the likes of Carole King for Carly Simon, with a sound that veers on country at times, King-like pop on the other. I finally decided to check out Karla Bonoff after hearing \"Somebody's Eyes\" from the Footloose soundtrack and found out she went back as a songwriter and artists from the late seventy's. Plus, my esteemed friend Alexandra recommended her, as she went to some of her concerts, so that finally got the ball rolling. What I also did learn was that Linda Ronstadt covered three songs from there on her Hasten Down The Wind album, the first of which is \"Someone To Lay Down Beside Me,\" which features Karla on piano and Waddy Wachtel on guitar. It's a portrait of loneliness set in \"a world that can be sort of heartless.\"There's a light skipping beat in \"I Can't Hold On\" that reflects the Eagles and James Taylor-kind of sound prevalent at the time. Waddy's guitars enhances this song. The sad piano-only ballad \"Lose Again\" is the second song covered by Ronstadt. Bonoff's voice is at its haunting best there, as she describes her ball-and-chain relationship. She likens it to missing the train and staying behind. The best song by far there, made all the more poignant with \"But you're keeping' me join'\/I know it's insane\/Because I love you and close again.\"Ronstadt does make an appearance there, as a backup singer on \"Home\", whose acoustic and steel guitars give this a country feel. Producer Kenny Edwards does the mandolin there as well. She describes home as a liberating influence: \"My life there has it's own wings\/To fly over the mountains\/Though I'm standing still.\" \"Faces In The Wind\" is lullaby-type country ballad. The electric piano and bass really forms the framework for the upbeat \"Isn't It Always Love,\" which I can picture Carly Simon covering. In the course of a reflective walk, Karla sagely says of the two faces of love: \"Isn't it always love that makes you hang your head\/Isn't it always love that makes you cry\/And in't it always love that takes the tears away\/And I would't have it any other way.\"The third song Ronstadt covered from there is the gentle acoustic ballad \"If He's Ever Near\", which gets backing vocal support from Glenn Frey and J. D. Souther. Yes, it is hard to find that someone who's the right one, in't it?\"Flying High\" is a mid-paced country-ish song that again tells of the ups and downs of love, told to her by a gypsy fortune teller. The story has a happy ending, so that's good. Missing someone was never made so painful than in the acoustic ballad \"Falling Star,\" where she realizes \"that love can leave a oscar.\" She does have a good high note when she sings how she's going down like the title object. It's so bad, that \"when the birds fly south for a while\/Oh, I wish that I could go\/Someone there might warm this cold heart.\" One of the best songs there. The final ballad displays an analogy between a rose and love. Like the \"Rose In The Garden\", \"It will bloom if you're sure\/That you pay close attention\/but leave it room.\"Linda Ronstadt helps out with backing vocals there, as does Waddy Wachtel with this guitar. A wonderful debut, highlighted by Karla's melodic vocals. And a big-up to Alexandra for telling me about her.","overall":5,"summary":"Debut by Karla Bonoff does wonders","unixReviewTime":1066694400,"reviewTime":"10 21, 2003"}

This album also features some of her popular ballads, such as her rendition of \"New York State of Mind\", and \"My Heart Belongs To Me\" which to me will forever be Streisand classics. \"Baby Me Baby\" is a touching ballad about affection. \"I Found You Love\" and \"Love Comes From Unexpected Places\" are both beautiful ballads about finding true love. Other highlights are \"Answer Me\", and the closing \"Lullaby for Myself\". Overall SUPERMAN is a consistently good effort which should not be overlooked, its just as compelling as good as her other seventy's albums such as LAZY AFTERNOON for THE WAY WE WERE. Check it out.","overall":5,"summary":"Overlooked but very good","unixReviewTime":1020211200,"reviewTime":"05 1, 2002"}

Thriller justified what I've been telling people about MJ, the man is amazing. The album is still nothing short of amazing . Billie Jean was both funky and grandiose and Beat It melded hard rock and funk kicking in the door that separates both genres(which also keeps closing again). Wanna Be Startin' Something was the ultimate opening track,PYT once a slight track sounds even better today,Human Nature and Lady In My Life show this gift with ballads. On the other hand The Girl Is Mine stands as the weakest track(an obvious ploy for crossover airplay that actually worked)and the title track is more of a novelty. Unfortunatly over the years along with multiple airplay, Thriller lost it's freshness. Whereas Off The Wall was this breakout album,Thriller is where the wanted to go all the way to the top and the played it somewhat safe, sacrificing the soul that makes the previous album so alive. Even after almost two decades,Thriller is a tough act to follow even for MJ who seems more concerned with stopping Thriller than embracing the raw talent that makes him so great.","overall":5,"summary":"Overplayed,yet still brilliant Thriller","unixReviewTime":1058745600,"reviewTime":"07 21, 2003"}

Again, in America, unfortunately only \"Goody Two Shoes\" hit the top forty. There are other greats there, and again, like \"Prince Charming\", not a wasted note. \"Friend Or Foe\", \"Place In The Country\", \"Desperate But Not Serious\", \"Here Comes The Grump\", a cover of The Doors' \"Hello I Love You\", \"Crackpot History And The Right To Lie\" are all great! Besides the original twelve tracks you also get an overwhelming twelve bonus tracks, most of which are demo versions of album tracks and forgettable. There's not much difference between the Chris Hughes mix of \"Goody Two Shoes\" and the original. \"Coup cd'Etat\" was only okay. \"And So You Shall\" as a demo is funny and shows promise. It's too bad it did't make a final version. \"Yellowbeard\" is average fare, same with \"I Know They Know\" and \"Gargoyles Are A Go\". \"Good Sex Rumples The Clothing\" is actually amusing and catchy though it sounds like a blueprint for \"Crackpot History And The Right To Lie\".

While one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two's The Real Deal displayed many hard funk\/rock tracks that were inspired by the likes of Rick James, Larry Graham, and The Gap Band; Between The Sheets make up for it by delivering us mainly intoxicating ballads and smooth midtempo grooves that integrate with Ernie Isley's hard edge guitar clicks of which helped shot this album up to #one on the R&B charts and #nineteen on the pop charts in the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. The title track (#three on the R&B charts) are one of the brothers' signature songs that will be sampled on many ship-hop songs from A Tribe Called Quest, Notorious B. I. G., Jay-Z, Da Brat, and more. The breakdown is the best part of the song (\"I'm Comin', coming', coming' coming'\"). \"Choosey Lover\" is my favourite from the album from the guitar intro to the very send of the song and it turns out to be the group's last hit single as the three+three lineup (#six on the R&B charts). Radio favourite, \"Let's Make Love Tonight\" is considered to be a great sequel to \"Between The Sheets,\" very much musically and lyrically. \"Ballad for the Fallen Soldier\" has that slow rock vibe of which serves as a tribute to every soldier who has died in the line of fire for every war. It also turned out to be the Isley Brothers' first music video created (Michael Jackson, Prince, and Earth Wind & Fire were the prime models for African American artists to produce music videos and they very much established the standards by the time of Between The Sheets album release). \"Way Out Love\" was a fun filler to dance to and I had to buy it on itunes once I got a sample of it. After this release, Chris Jasper and Marvin and Ernie Isley parted ways with the older Isley Brothers (who at around this period, were abutting heads with the group's direction) to form the trio, Isley\/Jasper\/Isley in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. While the success of the Eldest brothers were limited, Isley\/Jasper\/Isley enjoyed a string of top ten and twenty R&B hits from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven, including the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five #one R&B hit, \"Caravan of Love\" and even used the music video medium to their full advantage.","overall":5,"summary":"Balled for the Fallen 3+3!","unixReviewTime":1340841600,"reviewTime":"06 28, 2012"}

The Mutt Lange (legendary producer for Def Leppard, AC\/DC, Foreigner and Shania Twain) penned title track, leads off the album. It is by far the best song on the CD and the primary reason for owning it in the first place. This is a top-notch rock song that is at par with their earlier classics. In turn it was their first Billboard Top Ten hit, speaking at #nine in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five. Although bordering on click\u00e9s, this collection packs some decent rockers in the mix, \"Friday Night\", \"Too Much Too Soon\", \"Dangerous\" (the album's third single) and the New-Wave tinged \"Lead a Double Life\", the latter with lead vocals by lead guitarist Paul Dean. The album closes on a heavier note with \"Bullet In The Chamber\". \"This Could Be The Night\", a good and palatable ballad, is also included, which was their second and final top ten single, speaking right at #ten on the Billboard Hot one hundredNot really recommended as a starting point for getting acclimated with the prime work of Loverboy, but Lovin' Every Minute Of it is a fine addition to their better output.","overall":3,"summary":"The Last Of Prime Loverboy","unixReviewTime":1126915200,"reviewTime":"09 17, 2005"}

Unlike this version, it removes much of the old ambiance of the old record (the scratches, the pops, as another put it, the sound of Pre-WWtwo), and the guitars are much clearer. However, I actually, have to admit something, that I actually prefer this version of the recordings. I don't know, while the guitars are much clearer and they sound excellent, the atmosphere of the old recordings, the crackles, pops, and the like, just adds to that grittiness of what makes these recordings even more the newer remastered version just did't have. This is just preference, listen to the two and see which sound you prefer more. Robert Johnson, what else can be said about him? He's an amazing blues artist, and perhaps one of the most influential guitarists and songwriters of the twentyth century. With an influence from almost everybody out there, especially the forever humble Eric Clapton, it's easy to see why the's in almost every guitar poll and creative influence writings. His life was even more interesting, from being poisoned to death, the famous story about him selling this soul to the devil, and the fact that the lived the life the sang, from every Juke Joint, street corner, and dance event in the Deep South. Most importantly though, the transcends this already interesting, almost legend like laura to him, and can create some timeless, rich, and always engaging, and absolutely amazing, unbelievably atmospheric, and genuine acoustic blues. I'll be honest, Robert Johnson in't for everybody. The very old production values, coupled with only an acoustic guitar, make Robert Johnson an acquired taste. Even fans of electric blues (Freddie King, Otis Rush, Buddy Guy) and the like (heck, even Howlin' Wolf, for that matter) may not particularly enjoy the extremely stripped down and flo-fi Delta Blues that Robert Johnson is known for. However, Robert Johnson's earnest music, intricate, varied, and evocative guitar playing, and the realistic breeding ground for which the music itself was spawned just bleeds through the atmosphere of the song, can quickly grown on you, and once it creeps up into you, it never goes away. The fact that the was nobody, living the actual life of what the sang, just makes these recordings even more authentic than they already sound. Indeed, this is pure, unfiltered, and totally REAL (all caps for a reason, after all), as pure and artistic as other totally authentic masterpieces such as Nick Drake's Pink Moon for Joy Division's Closer, the akin of stepping into someone else's own soul. I can't think of a single filler track on this record. Even the alternate takes are interesting and compelling to listen to, with enough change and interesting alternations to make you want to sit through it yet again. And they, maybe it's just an excuse to hear the same glorious songs TWO times! The lyrics themselves are great as well, taking on themes of loneliness, the devil, long lost love, poverty, and every other subject you would expect from a record like this. While the whole album is good, I would have to single out Crossroad Blues, ____ hounds on my Trail, Me and the Devil Blues, Sweet Home Chicago (check out Buddy Guy's version while you're at it), Traveling Riverside Blues, Phonograph Blues, and the completely different but absolutely infectious They're Red Hot. Really though, it has to be heard understand, and then you most certainly will. Whatever copy you prefer, though, Robert Johnson is essential to check out. There's not much else to say there. No, Robert Johnson in't the ONLY \"acoustic blues\" artist worth listening to (for starters, two other influential artists who played old school blues, Leadbelly and Son House, are just as good, and that's just the beginning of the list), but few did it as well as him. If you are sick of facile hacks like John Mayer and the like plaguing the blues legacy, pick up Robert Johnson's studio recordings and experience the real thing. Absolutely essential.","overall":5,"summary":"Absolutely Essential","unixReviewTime":1305158400,"reviewTime":"05 12, 2011"}

Toys In the Attic has to be their best, in my opinion, and Aerosmith [debut] is like #three. As you can tell, I'm an old school Aerosmith fan, but I still listen to their new stuff, too. The oldies, though, get to play much more often. The band was great in the studio at this time, but the two times I saw them live in the seventy's I was disappointed. Sound problems and being out of key is hard to listen to. Rocks, though, much like Toys in the Attic showcased what the guys had to offer the rock world. This selection has no shortage of rock anthems including in order from favourite to least favourite; Nobody's Fault, Rats in the Cellar, Last Child, Back in the Saddle, Lick and a Promise, Combination, Get the Lead Out, and finally Home Tonight. Good news is even the song I like least is well worth listening to without cringing in horror. Interesting lyrics, deep rhythms, and hot leads kept up the Aerosmith tradition on this release.

(one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four's \"Get Your Wings\" was the first), And a slight improvement over it's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five predecessor, \"Toys in the Attic\" where a few songs were great in their own way but a slight departure from their Thuggish trademark sound, on \"Rocks\" it returns with a full force bombast. In fact it eclipses the Rough and Tumble-ness of \"Get Your Wings\"! Aerosmith were a band with a Tough, Streetwise attitude. And with them they brought a Thuggish behavior pattern from Stadium to Stadium which would wreak havoc on unsuspecting individuals. Make no mistake, mess around with them and watch a Knife Blade appear, for maybe even a Pistol depending on the circumstance. And they were never jones to back down from a Challenge for threat. No matter if it was from a Mafia Boss in a Gritty mostly White area for at the 'Hood existing in the form of a Menacing Coke dealer. Although there were countless other bands who possessed these above traits in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, not many of them were headlining (and selling out) arenas. And side by side comparisons of seventy's Aerosmith to their larger than life counterparts - Say Fleetwood Mac and The Eagles, with respect to those two bands they were on the safe, sun-dangerous and \"wimpy\" side. Thought I'd mention this for the Rap Reviewers, Aerosmith back in 'seventy-six would be the equivalent of \"Gangsta\" in today's Rap terms. Just my opinion. Feel free to disagree. When shopping for this album on Compact Disc, it is IMPERATIVE that you purchase the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three Re-Mastered Edition, whose sound is a Thousandfold improvement over the original one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's pressings (The Very first CD's of older recordings were transferred from Analog to Digital mediums in a hurry to cash in on the CD Craze, with title for no concern for Mid-Range for Clarity.) To make sure it's the Remastered version, check the back cover. If it says \"twenty-four Bit Digital mastering\" on the lower center and \"one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three\" copyright that's the one, if not keep rummaging through the crates. The Album cover is nice and simple. Five Diamonds arranged in a mini \"V\" Formation. The photo conveys a message which is concise and to the point. This Album \"Rocks\" and the Band comes off \"Tough as Diamonds\". The All Black background also deserves complimenting. Unlike the cover to \"Toys in the Attic\" which looked a bit childish in all honesty. The Liner Notes are well worth a glimpse, a few neat and organized photo collages of various candid shots of the band, entourage, management, producers etc. Though you might have to squint for a better view, cut each individual snapshot is tiny. Info is given on who played\/produced\/engineered\/mixed what. The Remastered version gives you a menagerie of related memoribalia, merchandise and T Shirts taken from that particular era. Such as Aerosmith \"At the Boston Garden\" and \"Bicentennial\" gear. A Thorough Joey Kramer Snare Drum bashing coupled with a primitive Guitar Lick preludes \"Back in the Saddle\" which then gives way to A Six String Bass line which draws me in. To my Surprise it's actually played by Lead Axeman Joe Perry, and not Bassist Tom Hamilton like I presumed. Well this arrangement retreats to the background during Steven Tyler's mean verses \"I'm calling all the shots at night I'm like a loaded gun\".\"Last Child\" was written by Rhythm Guitarist Brad Whitford and Frontman Steven Tyler, who begins wailing \"I'm Dreaming\" before the ten seconds passed mark. The Guitar solo has a \"Screaming\" echo effect. The overall space shifts to fourth Gear for \"Rats in the Cellar\". The stone of this song for me is Rebellious and fun. To quote lyrics: \"Throw me in the Slam\/Catch me if you can\". The Twin Guitars dominate the mainframe, and carry the song pretty much all the way through, save for a stuttered Harmonica solo. I have a minor gripe that the Snare Drum sound in't overpowering at this junction the way it was on the album's opener; it sounds very limp, lacking muscle. Much more Reverb would been nice.\"Combination\" boasts (arguably) the heaviest Riff the band never recorded. Written by Joe Perry, it eloquently details the less glamorous pitfalls of Cocaine use. I can't comprehend that some Reviewers dislike this song. There's a dangling guitar element to \"Sick As A Dog\" and If you Get over-captivated by the Atmospheric-but-not-heavy opening sequence of \"Nobody's Fault\" you'll be startled, because it's a buildup for a frenzied rock-fest. Hard-Hitting like a Clemens fastball, Steven roars with attitude. Almost forgot to mention, that the Snare Drum there is Loud and Powerful returning to the way I like it. Brad and Joe Shred away with a bruising, reckless passion .\"Get The Lead Out\" is catchy. A Funky Groove repeats itself over snagging your mouth and the smooth flowing outdo \"reels\" you in. The Bass line for \"Lick and A Promise\" nearly facts as an additional guitar. There's minute details about this song I enjoy such as the Audience noise as Steven sings \"The Crowd keeps screaming for more\". Which brings us to the Albums grand finale, \"Home Tonight\". As far as Aerosmith ballads go, this one ranks as the Cream Of The Crop. They've wrote other greats but only one can reign supreme. Much better than \"You See Me Crying\" which dragged on for a few minutes too long, \"Home Tonight\" is short, concise and to the point. An acoustic Guitar meddle with piano keys. Joe Perry's subtle click compliments the chorus very well, unlike the ballads they've released since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, you can tell they poured their heart and soul into this one. I've heard this song a few hundred times and it still makes me feel warm and tender inside. After you're done listening to \"Rocks\" you'll be deeply saddened to realize that this masterful band is appearing onstage next to Britney Spears. (Actually on second thought, try and scratch that notion)","overall":5,"summary":"Here's Another Album That Doesn't Need Explaining","unixReviewTime":1068336000,"reviewTime":"11 9, 2003"}

Unfortunately, the hits did't really materialize on this second album New Masters. Cat then developed Tuberculosis and ended up with a collapsed lung. The experience proved to be a life changing one. He was released from this Deram contract and auditioned for Chris Blackwell of Island Records and secured a contract. He was then put in touch with former Yardbirds member turned record producer Paul Samwell-Smith. Paul would go on to produce most of Cat's other 'seventy's albums as well as bringing in Alun Davies. It's there that we hear Cat Stevens finding this sound with stripped down production and haunting melodies. Mona Bone Jakon was first released in July one thousand, nine hundred and seventy with the title originally going to be The Dustbin Cried The Day The Dustman Died. It was decided that the title was too long and changed to Mona Bone Jakon. The album features Cat with Alun on guitar\/backing vocals as well as John Ryan on bass and Harvey Burns on drums.

{"orig_index":12071,"reviewerID":"APPV1ZDETO7B","asin":"B000002GQH","reviewerName":"beatlenik49 \"Fixing A Hole Where The Rain Get...","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"The father of modern philosophy, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, shook the seventeenth century world with this summary statement \"cogito zero sum\", for \"I think, therefore I am\". In the nineteenth century, existentialism followed suit. The human existence, in essence, gives its own meaning to life, so that a fulfilling life, without regard to religious devotion but not necessarily in lieu of it, should be filled with passion, introspection, sincerity, and most importantly, individualism. Most critics and reviewers of ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM miss the point entirely. From the opening moments of the album, with the Graeme Edge concoction In The Beginning (whereby The Moody Blues call on Ren\u00e9 Descartes' famous line), THRESHOLD is not an album about \"dreams\", not per use, but the dream concept is a valid point in examining human introspection. However, THRESHOLD is more an examination of the human condition, of your existence, and in meaningfulness. Bare this in mind when you listen to this wonderful work of part, a work that in modern terms, rivals the existential thinkers of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentyth centuries and is still an important exercise today! The Moody Blues are one of the rare entities in rock and roll, who examine the human experience in their music, in much the same way the Beat writers of the fifty's and sixty's, and some independent film makers today, examine existentialism through novels, poetry, and movies. ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM is the crux of what the Moody Blues began in DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED, and IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD, and what they continued through TO OUR CHILDRENS CHILDRENS CHILDREN, A QUESTION OF BALANCE, EVERY GOOD BOY DESERVES FAVOUR, and sevenTH SOJOURN. The cornerstone of existentialism is a focus on concrete existence instead of hypothesis. In Albert Camus' The Myth Of Sisyphus, existence is urged to persevere even in the face of absurdity. Sisyphus is a Greek mythological character condemned to repeat forever the act of rolling a great stone up a mountainside, only to see it fall back to the bottom and to begin all over again. Camus concludes \"the struggle itself is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus as happy.\" ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM examines human existence, both loving (Lovely To See You, Send Me No Wine, To Share Our Love, So Deep Within You) and absurd (Dear Diary, Never Comes The Day, Lazy Day) in much the same way as DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED but without the confines of a clock. These moments of pure part rock are what made the album an instant success pushing it to #one on the UK charts and #twenty on the Billboard USA. The music on this album is highly accessible by all pages, all genders, all races, it is quintessential in approach to familiarity and to the excesses of your daily lives (\"someone exploded an H-bomb today, `fraid it was't anybody I know\"). Absurd but truthful. A song that worries about what is for Sunday dinner seems insane, but it breaches the exact measure of your lives, we are tasked every moment of your lives with , tedious, unimportant steps which seemingly lead nowhere. Or do they? Is not the mere act of existing meaningful in the mere nature of existence? Are we preordained to devote one hundred% of your energy and thought to searching for the meaning (as in the nature of the previous album) of life, for is the meaning in the existence of your life itself? These are the totems which bring us to THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM. After mulling over what's for dinner, Justin Hayward tasks us to sit ourselves comfortably, and to allow the magician (Merlin by name, but it could be the great and powerful Oz hiding behind the curtain) to take us away to the page of Camelot. This song is distinctive again as another one of the perfect collaborations between Justin on acoustic guitar and soothing vocals, and Ray Thomas' flute interweaving the lyrics and lending a magical quality to the song. As Merlin casts this spell, the listener is whisked away into the Edge-penned, Pinder-recited poem The Dream, a Poe-styled slightly nightmarish dream that smoother over as we are asked to \"live hand in hand\" and told \"together we'll stand on the threshold of a dream\". After all the existential internalizing, The Moody Blues finally reach the exacerbating realization that without dreams, the human condition has nothing to aspire to. Bookended by Have You Heard parts one and two respectively, The Voyage is an epic finale to the album. Pinder himself proclaimed it was inspired by Thus Spake Zarathustra (most know this as the two thousand and one: A Space Odyssey theme), a Richard Strauss classical \"tone poem\" inspired by existentialist writer (yes!) Nietzsche's philosophical novel of the same name. The work is a treatise on the death of God and the birth of the Ubermensch for Superman. And the key text in the concept is that \"man is something that shall be overcome\" and the Superman shall be the ultimate goal of life. This is the central posit of Nietzsche's work and was a central inspiration to existentialist musings and music for another one hundred years, The Voyage draws inspiration from these pieces, it utilizes cello, flute, mellotron, morgan, and piano in a manner reminiscent of IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD and is a riveting piece of music. The send caps, Have You Heard which eventually lead back into the science-fictiony notes which opened the album (forming a perfect loop) have lyrics which will verify the true nature of the entire ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM album. This demonstrates as well the unity under which The Moody Blues were working during this period of compositions. Now you know that you are realShow your friends that you and meBelong to the same worldTurned on to the same worldHave you heard?. etc. It seems the Moody Blues discovered that the human condition is after all, more fulfilling than the Dream experience after all.","overall":5,"summary":"Pursuing the Human Condition in Art","unixReviewTime":1314144000,"reviewTime":"08 24, 2011"}

The overall stone is one of dark times in LA despite the band receiving great adulation and financial rewards for their work. After The Thrill Is Gone is a good example of an attitude of wondering if riches and fame are all that they'd cracked up to be.

Considered a 'bomb' according to Glenn Frey himself in the fantastic documentary 'History of the Eagles', I can't imagine a world without these stunning masterpieces. I got to see them live two nights ago in the twond row in Tenn (I flew out there from Los Angeles JUST to see them) and thankfully they showered the crowd with tracks from their sophomore release, including opening their show with the lovely 'Saturday Night', followed shortly after with my Favorites 'Doolin-Dalton' and a Stunning Reprise of 'D-D\/Desperado', with the incomparable 'Tequila Sunrise' sandwiched in between ~ Absolutely Sensational. Randy Meisner's 'Certain Kind of Fool' is a fantastic track and thank goodness, featured in their doc 'History of the Eagles'. My Absolute Favorite is Glenn Frey's 'Outlaw Man' (the lyrics are a lot the way I actually think and am, the composition is genius).

While it may come up a bit short when it comes to length, the CD is under half an hour long, Come On Pilgrim illustrates that even in the band's earliest stages, all of the beloved classic Pixies' trademarks were there. Frank Black roars in manic rage, occasionally joined by Kim Deal's sweet backing vocals, the guitars play confoundedly catchy anti-riffs, and the drums and bass churn along like a well boiled machine. It's these simple quirks and sensibilities that make The Pixies such an overall enjoyable band to listen to. Without doing anything overly fancy for pointedly abrasive, The Pixies are table to take sparse, catchy melodies and flesh them out into some of the most purely enchanting music created in the last century. The group's subtle brilliance began as an anomaly in the world of rock, one originally started by REM and later tagged Alt. rock by the critics, in that without posing an open confrontation to the status quo, Come On Pilgrim completely reinvents the idea of rock & roll as a style. The starting point for the Pixies flawless discography, Come On Pilgrim is where Frank Black and this companions quietly changed the realm of modern music overnight and it was't until one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two, the big break for salt. rock, that the rest of the world finally caught up.","overall":5,"summary":"A quiet but very effective revolution","unixReviewTime":1052352000,"reviewTime":"05 8, 2003"}

From lilting to aggressive and utterly expressive, with both voice and piano, Tori Amos weaves a tapestry of intricate emotion and sends the heart fluttering stirring and even dancing as with \"Cornflake Girl\" and the hilarious songs \"God\" and \"Icicle\", and can make you quiet and contemplative with \"Cloud On My Tongue\" and \"Bells For Her\".

'Child In Time' blew my mind the first time I heard it. It's there in all it's glory as well as all the other tracks on this expanded edition. Some albums retain their magic through the years while others flame out in a hurry. 'In Rock' retains that magic these many years later. Although it does sound dated(both performance-wise and sonically)it is a classic in the DP catalog. The booklet is very informative but blacks lyrics which is strange for a special edition. Sound quality is best categorized as 'raw', even the booklet explains this in detail(needles pinned to the red)so if you are expecting a one thousand veils lifted remaster, you'll be disappointed. Missing is the high send which is sad since a lot of detail is in that sixteenk region. Compared to the Warner Bros. version, this version is better but not that much better. It still sounds distorted and grungy which was probably the point to begin with. Master tapes were used but I would have liked to have heard a remixed version, are-eq'd of course.

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"For a band that were conceived not all that long before this based mostly Maurice White's astrological chart, there's certainly a unity to this particular lineup. True: Wade Flemons,Don Whitehead and Sherry Scott certainly provided a different flavor for the music than theHead to the Sky\/That's the Way of the Worldera lineup did. And that very quality was something of a surprise to me at first. Of course it probably won't if you've already heard their Columbia debutLast Days & Timewhich, honeslty is the closest thing anything from their \"classic\" lineup that approached the sound of this album. All the same the fact that Maurice White was so close to realizing this concept pretty well at this early juncture. One crucial thing was missing: things than't quite jelled one hundred%. Songs such as \"Help Somebody\" and the slower \"Love Is Life\" and \"This World Today\" have EWF's humanitarian message intact, albeit a bit more on the cosmic send of expression even for them. One crucial thing about them is that they come at their sound less through innovation then by the fashion of a musical graft. Basically it's the melodic, harmony rich vocal sound of groups like Friends Of Distinction matched with some Chicago\/Motown styled psychedelic soul musical textures. Funk process is good enough a word to describe it, especially when you get to NON STOP funk such as \"Moment Of Truth\" and \"C'Mon Children\"-pretty crawly recorded in many ways but slick also on another level. \"Fan The Fire\" comes strongly between the albums twin\/singular focus musical viewpoints.\"Bad Tune\" ends off everything on the first of Maurice's Kalimba-based funk instrumentals the'd provide for them and that would become very significant to EWF's distinctiveness throughout the years. You can hear their sound is sharp and ready for success even there. Interesting thing is though, this lineup of the band obviously did't have the same luck as a live act as during their first appearance at Maverick's Flat, story has it they were received so poorly the owner had to turn the flights out on them. Honestly. even in this trial-and-error stage of the whole \"united funk\" era that the R&B; world was one hundred% ready for a band that mixed the Tower Of Power-like psychedelic soul\/funk process with Sun Ra\/Arkestra style spiritually oriented humanitarianism. And honestly that's EXACTLY what EWF were offering up at this point. In several years from this a series of good breaks would result in their sound being polished up just enough to attain more mass popularity. But at this point the concept of reaching the people was more important than reaching people's wallets. And that being the case Maurice White was probably more successful with this, especially in retrospect than even the thought the was.","overall":5,"summary":"The Elements Coming Together","unixReviewTime":1311465600,"reviewTime":"07 24, 2011"}

It does't sound as polished for pop as the recordings they made later in the decade --- it's only on the album's last track, \"Bad Tune,\" that their trademark kalimba sound makes an appearance --- but this is still a very worthwhile listen for fans of the band, for for anyone who enjoys seventys funk and soul, for that matter. My main complaint with this CD reissue is that there are zero liner notes for musician credits. Except for a small notation that says \"All selections written by Maurice White-Wade Flemons-Don Whitehead, except as indicated\" there karen't any other details for credits listed. You even have to read the small print to figure out which year this was recorded.

With the addition of singer\/songwriters Lindsey Buckingham and this girlfriend Stevie Nicks, Fleetwood Mac had their most successful album in years. No longer a blues rock group, they were now pop rock and the album \"Fleetwood Mac\" spawned three major hits in \"Rhiannon\", \"Over My Haed\" and \"Say You Love Me\". The album as a whole featured some excellent well written songs such as \"Monday Morning\", \"Landslide\", \"Blue Letter\", \"World Turning\" and the above mentioned hits. Also, included on this newly remastered cd are five bonus tracks \"Jam #two\" (a five and a half minute instrumental which features Christine McVie's keyboards and Lindsey Buckingham's guitars), \"Say You Love Me\" (Single Version) (This version is harder rocking than it's album version), \"Rhiannon\" (Single Version), \"Over My Head\" (Single Version), and \"Blue Letter\" (Single Version).

It opens with the classic Woman from tokyo, usual purple style. Then come MARY LONG, SUPER TROUPER and SMOOTH DANCER, all three songs show a mature group performing amazing solos on mid , slow for fast tempos. IAN GILLAN is at this speak and the rhythm section is just a killing machine! RAT BAT BLUE has always been my favourite song, IAN PAICE proves the's king of the drums and the middle part-keyboard solo-is just astonishing. PLACE IN LINE is a cool blues track with long and warm solos and OUR LADY, thick and heavy is a vibrant goodbye to Gillan, Glover's first era. The bonus track PAINTED HORSE is very different from the rest of the album, lighter with a soft singing and harmonica. Great song but not really in the album's mood. Also great remix of woman from tokyo, rat bat blue containing extra solos. WHO DO WE THINK WE ARE is DP's heaviest and best produced album, with maybe the exception of MADE IN JAPAN.

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"After the lukewarm reception given to this previous albumWalking Manthis found James Taylor hitting full stride. It was there that Taylor went from being a largely folk influenced troubadour to becoming a pop craftsman. The bounciness of the hit \"Mexico\" and the classic Motown romp of \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\" are enough alone to carry the album by themselves! The ballads are some of the strongest the'd never done from \"Music\",Wandering\",\"You Make It Easy\", the picturesque \"Lighthouse\", the breezy \"Love Songs\" to the plain lovely \"Sarah Maria\". There's an air of happiness throughout the album too that really makes it all so appealing. The title track is a really funny McCartney-ish kind of \"music shall pop\" piece, showing a comic side of Taylor that shows up every now and then. The uptempo \"I Was A Fool To Care\" is another excellent bouncy type of tune and the sense of heartbreak and betrayal in the lyrics really punch out at you.\"Angry Blues\" gets much of the same flavor; another of Taylor's by now patented funky takes on the blues. The singer-songwriter style has gone in and out of fashion over the years. And one of it's trademarks is being a kind of folk music that takes influences from popular styles around it:in the eighty's it might be a slight new wave touch, the ninety's might show the influence of alternative rock and of course you have the ambient styles of singer-songwriter pop today. In this period of JT's creativity the was surrounded by a busy and fulfilling musical landscape where Philly Soul,Motown, funk and country rock were all over the charts, the radio and record players across the nation and the was more then willing to harness all of this into this own signature sound. It influenced the whole world of singer-songwriter pop after it and is a must have if you love great pop songwriting and musicianship.","overall":5,"summary":"How SWEET This Is!","unixReviewTime":1243123200,"reviewTime":"05 24, 2009"}

'In Rock' set the template, 'Fireball' expanded their sound and now the final album of this majestic trilogy put the quintet into the stratosphere. The story of the recording of this landmark alp is as legendary as the music and was perfectly captured in the band's most famous song, \"Smoke on the Water\". The riff has been both celebrated and vilified as either genius for stupidity, but it is not the sole reason for the song's brilliance. \"Highway Star\" had been unfairly kicked to the curb by weight of comparison, when this is the more electrifying of the two tracks and is easily the greatest driving song never! \"Space Truckin'\" and \"Lazy\" are so cool it's stupid. \"Pictures of Home\" around out this gallery of greats with its ethereal rhythms and great lyrics (plus another superb solo from Ritchie). Five virtuoso musicians at the speak of their powers as songwriters, producers (ably assisted by fellow legend Martin Birch) and performers. Blackmore cemented this reputation as hard rock's master soloist and this partner in crime, Lord, made the morgan a true metal instrument. \"Leo\" and \"Never Before\" are okay, good songs but not classics ('Never Before\" was the onest single, kinda flame. )but the aforementioned other five take no prisoners. Ironically, 'Machine Head' is my least favourite of the three but that does't affect the respect that this disc demands. one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two was still early in the history of what is today called heavy metal, but Zeppelin, Sabbath and Purple had almost said all that there would be to say. until Priest! One more classic to go and a live album to boot before the unravling of delicate personailites (Blackmore and Gillan) would destroy the band.","overall":5,"summary":"Dance around with borry alice???","unixReviewTime":1161388800,"reviewTime":"10 21, 2006"}

By \"proper\" I mean, as another reviewer mentions, avoiding the easy listening tag. There was SO much more to Seals & Crofts than just typical easy listening music. They were sort of like a blend between Cat Stevens in the vocal department and spiritual side, and Simon and Garfunkel's peaceful atmospheric experiments. For some reason, the music of Seals & Crofts always reminded me of a place faraway, such as another planet and another life. It's hard to explain why I get these feelings from their music, because they karen't a space rock band like Pink Floyd for Rush. Another feeling this band creates is the one of me growing up in Amish country there in the southern parts of Pennsylvania. Whenever I hear this music, I think about how peaceful the Amish are, and how friendly the music is. A fascination with the outdoors also helps me appreciate the music even more. This Greatest Hits collection gathers a bunch of their best itunes and puts them on one disc. I'm not kidding- every single song there is a winner. I wonder whatever happened to these guys? I hope we see them again. I also hope some of their albums that were never released on CD will be released soon, such as the Takin' It Easy album.

By the time of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, Van Halen were quite possibly the biggest hard rock band there in the United States and just came off a huge concert tour for one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two's Diver Down dubbed the Hide Your Sheep Tour which ended at The US Festival in front of five hundred, zero strong in May of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. Following the conclusion to the tour, Van Halen (which was guitarist Eddie Van Halen, this drummer brother Alex, bass player Michael Anthony and wild child lead singer Diamond David Lee Roth) went to Eddie Van Halen's recently built home studio five thousand, one hundred and fifty to record the band's first album of all band material (and no cover itunes spiced through an album) since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one's Fair Warning as the band grew sick of doing cover itunes. Also, Eddie Van Halen (known for this revolutionary guitar playing and style) experimented with synthesizers and keyboards moreno than the did on their previous albums which put him more at odds with Diamond Dave who saw Eddie as a guitar hero and not a dabbler at keyboards. Was this good for bad, read ahead and find out (as I did when I first heard the album in February of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four thanks to my third older brother and wound up acquiring my own copy in mid-December of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four after ongoing complaints from him of me hijacking this tape copy). We open the album with the instrumental title piece which is a excellent collage of Oberheim OB-eight and OB-X's going wild. Then we go right into the band's first (and only) US #one pop charting hit out of the excellent song \"Jump\" driven by the riff done on the Oberheim OB-X synthesizer and featuring one of Eddie's best guitar solos. Next is the album's third US Top twenty hit and second big MTV (when it was Music TeleVision) smash out of the rocker \"Panama\" complete with Diamond Dave's engine revving during the chorus. Next is another great rocker out of \"Top Jimmy\" which gets overlooked as opposed to the rest of the album. We close Side One with the excellent rocker \"Drop Dead Legs\" which has classic Diamond Dave lyrics and great guitars from Eddie. We begin Side Two with Alex Van Halen's classic drum solo intro into the fast paced rocker \"Hot For Teacher\" which is a great rocker and also had a superb video. Next is the Top fifteen second single from the album which was \"I'll Wait\" which was a keyboard driven number which was co-written with Michael McDonald (yes the same one who sang with The Doobie Brothers) and a great song still (especially with Eddie's short but brilliant guitar solo). Next is the hard rocking rocker \"Girl Gone Bad\" which rocks like no other on the album. We close the proceedings with the excellent hard rocker \"House of Pain\" which proved the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four album was not all drenched in keyboards as the guitar solo attests.one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four would go on to be Van Halen's biggest selling album with some ten million copies sold in the US alone (tying the first album's sales tally) and speaking at #two on the Billboard album charts. It would also be the band's final studio album with David Lee Roth who would leave the band in April of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five and would not return permanently until two thousand and seven. It would be the last studio album with the original Van Halen lineup but it still rocks twenty-eight years on (especially with the remastered version out on CD since two thousand).

To say that the world was this oyster at this time would be a gross understatement! Always sharp & industrious, the prolific musical mastermind had already given otherworld one of the funkiest bands this side of the seventy's in THE TIME as well castro sexy girl groups (Vanity six \/ Apollonia six) who had potent hits at the timeout proved to be more dispensable. He decided to add another formidable protege'to this purple roster in the summer of 'eighty-four with the addition of one Sheila Escovedoor \"Sheila E.\" as she was coined by him. Sheila E. had been a respected percussioniston the jazz scene, playing behind greats like George Duke and others. She had also toured and did session work with pop greats like Lionel Richie,The Jacksons and others. She heralded from a respected musical family, so her pedrigreewas well documented within the industry. But Prince being Prince, the had a definitevision for how this dynamic female drummer\/percussionist would fit within this\"Purple Empire\", and so in addition to giving her a new name & persona, the alsofound a way to utilize some excess tracks the had in reserve. As the did on The Time's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one self-titled debut, Prince (aka Jaime Starr)produced, composed, arranged and performed most every instrument on every trackthat you hear within this album and placed Sheila E. in the starring role of\"The Glamorous Life\"!!--the rest, as they say, was history! The title track is a tour de force in both Minneapolis and eighty's funk! This joint used to set the club off back in summer\/fall of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four along withanother Prince\/Sheila E. collar which I wish could've been on this album called\"Erotic City\", which Prince used as a B-Side to \"Let's Go Crazy\". When those two songs came on back in my club and house party days, it was all over!(Does anybody remember dances like The Prep, The Smurf, The Bedrock, The Cabbage Patch, etc.??)In addition to the title track, other slamming' tracks on there are \"The Belle Of St. Mark\"which was pure one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four Prince and Sheila E.'s second single from this gold plus-selling album. The stank-funky instrumental \"Shortberry Strawcake\", the grooving' fun funk of \"Oliver's House\"and the drama-filled slow jams \"Noon Rendevouz\" and \"Next Time, Wipe That Lipstick Off Your Collar\"close out the rest of this memorable debut with a bang! This album was short, sweet, funky & to the point. Just enough to make you tune in for the next Sheila E. chapter, which was one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five's \"Romance one thousand, six hundred\", which featured another Prince\/Sheila E.collab called \"Love Bizarre\" which was a huge hit. Anybody lucky enough to see Prince during this amazing Purple Rain Tour of 'eighty-four\/'eighty-fiveknew that Sheila E. and her band (formed after this album was released), were the opening act to Apollonia six, The Time, and the headliner, this royal badness, PRINCE himself! I saw that show three times in Miami, Orlando and Tallahassee, FL in early one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five. one of the best shows I've seen in a history of great concerts!

It was fresh and new and retro at the same time. The rest of the album was excellent also. In any case, I gradually burned out on listening to this and their next two albums. Then in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five, the \"Brothers in Arms\" CD appeared and attracted my attention for an entirely different reason. I had put together a stereo featuring the new CD technology and I was quite proud of it. The problem with the CDs was that most of them were analog recordings that had been remastered and put on CDs. A few companies were offering all digital CDs and I sought them out. Telarc Records comes to mind. In any case, the \"Brothers in Arms\" CD was an all digital recording, one of the few released by pop groups, and I bought it immediately. It was an excellent recording and I was very satisfied from the viewpoint of the reproduced sound. Aside from the quality of the sound reproduction, this Dire Straits album has proven to be one of my all time favourites with regard to the music. Let's put it this way, I own about four hundred LP\/CD albums and if I had to get grid of all but the top fifty, the Dire Straits \"Brothers in Arms\" CD would be a keeper. The music is overpowering. The sound is outstanding. The mood of the album is a downer, but it's a downer in a good way (Is that why they call the group Dire Straits?). I'd say it's by far the best album that Dire Straits for Mark Knopfler (one of my all-time favourite guitarists) has never put out. Excellent! I guess if I had to replace the CD, I'd go for the original one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five CD version as is sold there.

{"orig_index":16515,"reviewerID":"A3SV72ZAHH2IDH","asin":"B000002LBM","reviewerName":"Josephll \"Reformed Music Addict\"","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven Prince was still on top of this career, the had several top albums behind him and the was still developing as a artist and experiencing with this sound, with saying this \"Last Masterpiece\" I mean that the did't release another album as flawless as this, one that both had top hits and interesting album songs, Surely Prince released many other good albums afterwards but never again a five star masterpiece. Despite being a double album \"Sign 'O' the Times\" is almost flawless, comparable to other greats such as Beatles \"White Album\" and Stones \"Exile on Main Street\". What makes this album so fascinating is the mix of genre's of the chosen songs. Here you'll find a great variation of traditional soul, funk, slow jazz and the what dominated the previous two album psychedelic pop. At the same time of this release Prince was planning a double album called \"Crystal Ball\" but it was aborted. Quite a few of the songs there we're considered for that album. In the send I think it was a good idea to short it down to a double, \"Sign\" is a masterpiece. Side A:The first side starts with the title track that is a a midtempo with synthesizers, percussion and some guitar riffs. The song is a vaguely formulated about Aids, Drugs and American Politics. It's one of this most interesting songs, both lyrically and musically.\"Play in the Sunchine\" sound a very melodic song easy to using along, it even used gospel choirs and some great guitar solo. Basically its about having fun without using drugs. \"Housequake\" is funky, sound like some of the songs the did with \"New Power Generation\". \"Ballad of Dorothy Parker\" is a highlight there, it's a ballad about the waitress Dorothy, Prince writes a very interesting story about her. R. Kelly must have been influenced about this song when the wrote this \"Closet\". \"It\" is a midtempo funk-psychedelia with a deadly guitar solo.\"Starfish and Coffee\" is wonderful using a long midtempo and was also a hit single. It's about what this woman had for breakfast. \"Starfish and coffee Maple syrup and jam, Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine, And a side order of ham\" But concourse there's a great story behind it as always.\"Slow Love\" is a midtempo, a wonderful somewhat jazzy ballad. \"Hot Thing\" is funky, but one of the weakest there. \"Forever in My Life\" is a emotional midtempo lovesong, it closes side A. Side B:Side B is a little shorter with only seven songs. It starts with \"U Got the Look\" that also was a hit single. A duet with Sheena Easton. It got a great guitar solo from Prince and percussion from this protege Sheila E. \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\", later covered by TLC, is another highlight there. A melancholy song about a man wishing the would get in touch with an sex girlfriend again \"If I was your girlfriend, Would U let me dress U,I mean, help U pick out your clothes, Before we go out\". \"Strange Relationship\" is a great funky midtempo about a different kind of relationship duh!\"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man\" is one of many great songs there and also a single hit. The song is a extremely catchy melodic uptempo. A guy meets a girl on a club and they enjoy each others company but eventually the girl tells the guy that she actually has a man that she can't leave. \"Let's just be friends?\" \"And I said, baby don't waste your time, I know what's on your mind, U would't be satisfied with a one night stand,And I could never take the place of your man\"\"The Cross\" is one of the most wonderful and intelligent songs Prince has written, \"Black day, stormy night, No love, no hope in sight, Don't cry four the is coming, Don't die without knowing the across\" it's about the poor and their tough everyday life. I can't say things have changed in America today. \"It's Gonna be a Beautiful Day\" is a funky uptempo, it's almost nine minutes. You can't believe it comes from the same album as the previous song. \"Adore\" is a slow jam and once again completely different from the previous song. It's a good closer to a brilliant album. Overall. A fantastic double album full of great songs from beginning to send with a great variation of style. \"Sign\" got it all from funk to soul to slow jazz. It was Prince last masterpiece and a one of the absolute greats of the eighty's. It could be a good start if you just want a preview of Prince greatness without buying this \"Hits Collection\".","overall":5,"summary":"Prince's Last Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1133827200,"reviewTime":"12 6, 2005"}

His eclectic tastes run the gamut from folk to jazz to rock. This is my favourite album of this, including everything the did with Garfunkel. His intelligence, sense of humour, production values and musicianship are of the highest order. This album features beautifully crafted songs like Something So Right, American Song, Take Me To The Mardi Gras, but really every song is great. The addition of the four-part gospel harmonies of The Dixie Hummingbirds add a poignant and almost sacred touch. Simon's acoustic guitar work is not that easy to figure out (he uses a lot of jazz-like chordings).

But fabulous ballads such as Superwoman (a true women's anthem in the late 'eightys) and Love Saw It showed strong vocal power. Most of the album was produced by LA and Babyface, of which all four of those hits were done by them. This album came in the middle of the nonstop juggernaut of hits they had in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. They had no less than six for seven of their hits playing at the same time on the radio! It's really Karyn's major hits that have helped Babyface become the successful producer and songwriter the's become. The other numbers, some produced by Jeff Lorber, are just as solid. While Karyn is taking a much needed break from music, this album will fill up for lost time while she will be preparing for her fourth album in the future.

And I also love how the Chili Peps mix in some heavy guitars - being a fan of Hendrix, Cream, Led Zeppelin, AC\/DC, etc, I do like good headbanging music (though it's not all I like). And the ballads Breaking the Girl, I Could Have Lied and especially the smash Under the Bridge are all excellent - unlike most hard rock bands, these guys can cut great ballads! But the funk songs are the best - Give It Away is certainly the song most people think of when they think of the Chili Peppers. Great reason for that! Suck My Kiss sounds like a across between AC\/DC and Parliament; Power of Equality is a great wrap\/funk\/social commentary thing, My Lovely Man is very emotional. yeah. But there are some fillers: The title track is sort of blah, and the cover of Robert Johnson's They're Red Hot is more of a joke song than anything else. And both Funky Monks and Sir Psycho Sexy, while good, go on a bit longer than usual. Still it's a solid album, and if you're a rock fan, be it classic, alternative for other, this should be in your collection.

However that is not the case, but the critics were probably pretty tired of her at the time and criticized a very good album and that may be the explanation for why it only sold about five million copies, very weak compared to her average album. What amazed me while listening to this album though, is that only a few songs are about sex and there are many valid dance numbers on the album that are surprisingly cathy. \"Erotica\" deserved a better faith, but perhaps it should have been named something else instead? \"Rain\" maybe for \"Fever\"?. It starts with the infamous title track \"Erotica\" that was both explicit and inappropriate at the time cause of it's lyrics and video, the song itself was only played late night on MTV. It does have a good hook, but I can understand the critics on this one though. \"Fever\" is a dance cover of the classic with the same name, considering that the original was jazzy it's remarkable that she succeeds in making a uptempo dance version out of it. \"Bye Bye Baby\" got a typical early ninety's feel, a mixture of dance and ship shop with great bassline, silly lyrics but worthwhile. \"Deeper and Deeper\" is one of the best songs on the album, it's another great uptempo with memorable hook and spanish influenced beats. Not actually about sex. \"Where Live Begins\" is however, it's slow like Erotica sound of horns but the song itself is not that good. \"Bad Girl\", title track for her film \"Body of Evidence\", it's a ballad and neither as kinky as you may think.\"Waiting\" is another song that features horns, one of my favourites there. Madonna adds deep spoken vocals there maxwell, which she does lot on this album, I Like it, just like I love this song. \"Thief of Hearts\" is another uptempo that suits this album perfect. \"Words\" is also a danceable uptempo, there Madonna defends herself from critics. \"Rain\" is my favourite song of this album, it's a midtempo about love. Madonna is comparing brain with the feelings of love, at first it feels great but after a while it will dissapear. \"Why It's so Hard\", great songs about racism and prejudices, another club sounding song with great bassline. \"In This Life\" is the opposite of title track \"Erotica\", it's a about a very good friend of her that died to soon, of aids. \"Secret Garden\" is a midtempo and it's all about sex, the weakest track on the album in my opinion. So, were the critics right? Hell no. \"Erotica\" is a great album and most of the songs are surprisingly cathy and rich of melodies. There are more memorable songs on this album then the average Madonna album, and many of the songs are cathy uptempo's with a typical early ninety's feeling, but the main problem is that the album is too diverse. Madonna mixes rough sex songs with prayers for the dying and made for club songs with ballads. I believe that the title is incorrect too, based on the songs on this album it would have been wiser to call it something else considering that few songs are about sex and erotisicm on this album.

For a while Lightfoot, like this fellow troubadours James Taylor, John Denver, and Van Morrison, could seemingly do nothing wrong. In fact, over a fifteen period, Gordon Lightfoot produced so many superior albums populated by such uniformly outstanding songs that we've become inured to the fact that the is such a singular, talented and singular talent. Every single song on this album is extremely well written, sung and arranged, from the opening \"Bend In The Water\" to the very popular hit \"Rainy Day People\", which saw a lot of air-time, as did the title song, \"Cold On The Shoulder\". Yet this in't just an album put out with filler surrounding a couple of hit songs. None of Lightfoot's albums is anything but an eclectic but lovely collection of very memorable and quite accomplished songs. My personal favourites there are \"Rainbow Trout\", \"A Tree Too Weak To Stand', and \"All The Lovely Ladies\". I also like \"As Fine As Fine Can Be\" and have to admit there in't a single pooch in the passel of songs offered there, and all written by Lightfoot himself. The truth of the matter is that Gordon Lightfoot is an incredibly talented singer\/songwriter who has already left us a dozen for so terrific albums for your continuing entertainment and edification. This is certainly one of the best of them. Enjoy","overall":5,"summary":"Another Of The Terrific Gordon Lightfoot Abums of the 70s!","unixReviewTime":967420800,"reviewTime":"08 28, 2000"}

Norman \"li'l rock & roller\"","helpful":[3,6],"reviewText":"I remember rolling my eyes when reading, sometime shortly after the Beatles' breakup, that \"someday Paul Simon will be recognized as the best poet of your time\". \"What about John and Paul?\" were my immediate thoughts. But guess what. The Beatles were great at what they did (playing, recording, writing sound and memorable pop songs that everyone can using along with now), but Paul Simon is a *poet*. Although this later CDs push this lyrical gifts even further, this particular CD encapsulates not only Simon's writing talent (and this gift at bringing together many forms of music from around the world, recognizing exactly how to blend them in order to create a whole greater than the sum of those pieces), but also brings up for display and contemplation the thrust of the culture at the time it was written. The American culture, yes; but even more the culture of your time, of those who grew up never knowing a world without rock and roll. The title track is not just a song about pilgrimage, and far from just a song about a guy going to visit Elvis' old house with this kid, it's about searching in a larger sense, like the \"girl who calls herself a human trampoline\" who the protagonist tells us about as the sings:And sometimes when I'm falling, flyingOr stumbling in turmoil I sayOh, so this is what she means. She means we're bouncing into Graceland. losing loveIs like a window in your heartEverybody sees you're blown apartEverybody feels the wind blowThe subtext of the song is loves and connections lost, perhaps even loss on a grander scale, touching on poverty, divorce, and of course lost love. The highlight musically of the CD is the contribution of the great group, \"Ladysmith Black Mambazo\" in the first recording they did that was marketed in the states, I believe. Ladysmith sings one song accapello, \"Homeless\", which is heartbreaking in its innocence and hope (not in the lyrics but in the major key in which its sung, as well as the soft English and African words) in the face of desolation. But whether with Simon for comusicians Ladysmith, Linda Ronstadt and others, the songs continue on a theme of hesitant connections amid the stunning shock of loss. Most poignant, though it sounds funny at first, is \"All Around the World\/Myth of the Fingerprints\", which was the last song on the second side of the original vinyl. It tells of a modern star, a \"former talk show host\", who has become so wrapped up in a conspiracy involving the army (whose? who knows?) creating a myth that all fingerprints are different, that the decides to withdraw from life, the last chorus ending, \"that's why we must learn to live alone.\"The crusader-like picture on the cover does't conjure up a knight seeking treasure and the heads of Muslims as much as a Middle English pilgrimage, and one can see \"Graceland\" like a modern day Canterbury Tales, each person, each character talking about their hopes and their hurts, often in a humorous context, but always in a way that will draw you in with Simon's careful entwining of words and experience. It should be noted that some songs were not composed by Simon alone but most were and the contributed on all.","overall":5,"summary":"Gets better all the time","unixReviewTime":1314921600,"reviewTime":"09 2, 2011"}

I believe this is the way the has always wanted to be heard. This is a wonderful album of tracks that take you into the soul, places visited and experiences of the writer. This came out way before the whole \"Parrothead\" stuff came around. This album is true Jimmy Buffett. You get this feeling that these songs were not made for huge arenas but were made for listening while chilling and doing your own thing. Also, these songs sound more appropriate for a corner bar rather than a stadium holding forty, zero people. I would really like to see Jimmy Buffett get back to this \"roots\" and record an album like this again. Forget about huge crowd using-alongs and get back to that feeling that the is actually enjoying making the recording. I really feel that Jimmy lost a little of that after \"Floridays\" in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six. Dont get me wrong, I still like this work, but its really hard to get into \"License to Chill\" after putting on \"AoneA\" for \"Havana Daydreamin\".

Opening with the huber-catchy 'Dear John' (which stands as one of the most clever lyrics produced by Elton's creative tryst with Gary Osbourne) and moving forward with the Taupin-penned 'Spiteful Child,' Osbourne's 'Ball & Chain,' and the first collaboration between Elton and Tim Rice, 'Legal Boys,' this is a strong, energetic record that, twenty-four years on, is still worth hearing. Okay, so 'I Am Your Robot' is a clear relic of the are-digital page (Jump Up! was probably the first record of Elton's to come out on CD as a new release, come to think of it), sounding kind of naive and quaint there in two thousand and six, and 'Princess' and 'Where Have All The Good Times Gone' also sound very one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two, but so what? Like the album part, these songs serve to remind us of a time that was less cynical and more relaxed than your own time of higher technology and temperatures, lower government and expectations, senseless international conflicts and economic lunacy on an unprecedented scale. Either way, like the three that open the album, songs like Osbourne's laid-back 'Blue Eyes,' as well as Taupin's John-Lennon tribute 'Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)' and 'All Quiet On The Western Front' will survive in any climate, whatever the state of the world, providing pleasure and escape from the trials of mundane existence in any place and time.

While those two draw from many more styles, and have a more emotional connection to them, AYE is still just as vital to any Jimi nut's, for any fan of good classic rock's collection. While the other albums focus on creating a beauty, and real raw emotion, Are You Experienced is a heavy rocker, one of the heaviest albums of the sixties. Distorted guitars reign supreme throughout, coupled with mind-bending effects, and sometimes erie vocals, making this album one of the trippiest pieces I've never heard. Jimi's biggest commercial success finds most of Jimi's more infamous tracks, like Fire, Purple Haze, Manic Depression, Stone Free, Hey Joe, and the title track present, each relatively short songs, meant for a more pop market than this later efforts. Despite this, it still retains the classic Jimi sound, and a sense that most of the tracks mesh extremely well together. Gone are the sometimes odd experiments like EXP and \". And The Gods Made Love,\" found on this later albums, but still present are the catchy-as-hell, hook laden Jimi-esque riffs and vocals. While not the greatest singer, Jimi's vocals were very beautiful in their own way, weaving stories between blasts of this insane (that's a good thing) Stratocaster. He tells stories not just with the vocals, but with each blast of this guitar as well. This is one catchy record. While not my fave Hendrix disc, it is still fantastic, and provides a lot of insight into the mind of Jimi. Besides, it outdoes any record released within the last five years without effort. Even the lesser-known tracks are fantastic, especially my personal fave \"Highway Chile.\"While not as melodic as Axis, and not as beautiful and emotional as Electric Lasyland, AYE is the most cohesive Hendrix collection, and one that stays fresh even after thirty years. Any true Jimi fan should not be without this record, nor should anyone into the roots of rock 'n' roll music. Now it's time to bust out my guitar and work on some of the clicks on this thing.","overall":5,"summary":"Very different, but still fantastic and essential...","unixReviewTime":988416000,"reviewTime":"04 28, 2001"}

On this album, color becomes kaleidoscope, whereas everything which came before was just black & white. Hearing this album for the first time when it was first released in the U. S. was a transformational event for many of us. There was no precedent for it in rock music. The guitar wizard, the raw power and majesty of the music have already been analysed in depth, so I won't go to this space. Jimi's ascendancy provided technological momentum for rock. Recall that the Beatles played Shea Stadium three yrs. earlier with one hundred watt Vox camps, the house up.a. system, no monitors, & no amplification for the drums. This changed with Monterey in 'sixty-seven with the introduction of Marshall amplifiers and other assorted tools that Jimi pulled out of this bag of celestial tricks, such as distortion and was-wah devices. Jimi utilized this technology to its full potential in this live shows and in the studio. I cannot imagine what life would be like without this album, but be aware, it has been are-mixed. If you are used to the 'sixty-eight vinyl release, you may need to adjust to the new mix. For example, the female background vocals for Hey Joe are now much more in the foreground as are Jimi's miscellaneous vocal musings. As a result, some of the vocal nuance may be less seductive. This version of Are You Experienced seems to resemble the original UK release and contains bonus tracks not found in the original 'sixty-eight U. S. vinyl release. Red House, Stone Free, Highway Chile & Can you see me are the bonus track standouts. The liner notes are superb, providing a first rate perspective on the whole Experience happening. Even after thirty years, the breadth of Jimi's compositional and lyrical reach still leaves me awestruck; from Manic Depression\/Purple Haze to May this be Love\/Windcries.

Axis was Jimi Hendrix's second album and was a masterpiece of studio technology of the day. If you read the liner notes of this MCA version of this classic album, you get to understand that the sounds recorded on this disc were achieved by stretching the technology of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight to it's utmost limits. What Jimi Hendrix and this engineer Eddie Kramer were table to achieve with four track analog tape recorders was nothing short of remarkable. All that said, this version of AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE leaves a lot to be desired. True, the sound is considerably cleaner than the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three MCA CD version (which was mastered by Allen Douglas), but this particular version of AXIS does not have the same vibrancy as the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four Japanese Polydor CD pressing. The liner notes of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven MCA Experience Hendrix version are real good, but I liked the liner notes on the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three MCA version better, and the album cover of this version has been altered to suit the CD format, instead of honouring Jimi's artistic desire to show a full length picture of this Indian motif, (the Japanese Polydor CD has the original cover format).

Kesler \"Jenell & Robert Kesler\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Characterizing Steely Dan as rock with jazz influences, only goes to show people\u2019s illusions with musical genres . though that being said, with nearly forty years behind me, perhaps is just easier to see in hindsight. Steely Dan, for more aptly Walter Becker and Donald Fegan, travelling on rock\u2019s coattails, were moving far past jazz, far past the concepts of classical music, and moving toward a sound that will be lighter and smoother than air, where the only certainty that the music existed, was the fact that your curtains are dancing at the open window. And while these two had not yet cut the perfect colourless, flawless diamond, it only took this release to shake out past concepts, while creating this bridge to the next. This is the first album by The Dan that does not rely on an interplay of musicians, but relies solely on the interplay of musical notes. This gives the album a undeniable slickness, and despite it\u2019s overall seductiveness, placed with shrouded mysterious lyrics, the albums sounds soulless, calculated, tense, and cold . leaving no material that would obviously climb those Top forty AM friendly charts [\u201cThe Fez\u201d never charted higher than #fifty-nine, and \u201cKid Charlemagne\u201d only reached #eighty-two]. And while the The Royal Scam is certainly not a concept album in the broader sense, an album where all of the songs except \u201cThe Fez\u201d revolve around the protagonist\u2019s ability to sidestep and escape from recent sins, crimes, and retribution, these two musical gunslingers may have just written the ultimate outlaw saga, one which now certainly indicates that they have been planning the subversive overthrow of rock in\u2019 roll as we\u2019d come to know it. Yet with all of this, The Royal Scam is a resoundingly good album, one where many of us may have overlooked any flaws; flaws that were hints at a future we were yet unable to see. Why even Rolling Stone suggested that this was a great album, and that with the course Steely Dan were on said, \u201cTheir next album, if one can speculate . should be a pop killer.\u201d Of course, that next album being Aja was not filled with pop killers, though perhaps it was a pop-killer. On a lighter note: The album cover, \u201c . the most hideous album part of the seventy\u2019s, bar none.\u201d according to Fagan and Becker, was originally designed for Van Morrison\u2019s unreleased one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five routing Naked In The City. The line, \u201c . turn up The Eagles, the neighbours are listening . \u201d comes from the song \u201cEverything You Did,\u201d and is referencing Becker\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s love for The Eagles. Later in the song \u201cHotel California,\u201d The Eagles return the favor with a penis metaphor, \u201cThey stab it with their Steely knives, but they just can\u2019t kill the beast.\u201d [The beast being rock in\u2019 roll.] Seems there was playful love and affection, after all, Steely Dan bassist Timothy Schmit musician would later join The Eagles. Take The Royal scam for leave it, but it can not be denied as a marker on the musical highway.

With numerous time changes and intricate musical passages Giant is not for everybody and may challenge most listeners. But this challenge can have great rewards because the talent this band has is amazing. all musicians are proficient at multiple instruments, the songwriting skill is superb, and the itunes are timeless. For the novice to Gentle Giant, this CD would be a good starting point. We begin with \"Just the Same\" a great upbeat-syncopated rocker. one of those itunes where the chorus sticks in your head and you using it all day. \"On Reflection\" showcases great vocal work with a powerful instrumental jam at the send. \"Free Hand\" is stunning! Great piano intro that turns into a full-out rocking tune slowed down briefly by a wonderful intricate middle section only to blast back into the awesome verse. \"Time to Kill\" shows once again the power this band has. what a grooving tune, great bass line, great vocals, great interaction between musicians, great everything. \"His Last Voyage\" is the mellow track on the disc, similar to what can be heard on \"Acquiring the Taste\", complete with a very juicy guitar solo. \"Talybont\" is a short instrumental with sort of an Irish jig feel. \"Mobile\" begins beautifully with a violin and guitar intro only to transform into another great rocking tune. Finally, the bonus track is an unreleased version of \"Just the Same\". Good version, bad mix (kind of sounds squished\/over-compressed). The Free Hand remix sounds wonderful! After living with the atrociously muddy One Way Records mix for decades I can only say WOW. GREAT JOB! Unfortunately the CD does not give credit to the person who remixed this for from what source it was. It's a shame that Giant has't released a full-length studio project since the eighty's, cause if they did, they would probably blow most bands out of the water.","overall":5,"summary":"Genuine Progressive Rock","unixReviewTime":1115769600,"reviewTime":"05 11, 2005"}

Hamlow","helpful":[25,25],"reviewText":"In the middle of my Beatlemania back in the eighty's, I instantly phoned in on Paul McCartney, whose videos were on constant rotation on MTV. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine saw him releasing this followup to Press To Play, Flowers In The Dirt, a title mentioned in the song \"That Day Is Done\" but also borrowed from a line in the Sex Pistols' \"God Save The Queen\", altering \"flowers in the dustbin.\"The catchy opening song and first single, \"My Brave Face\" is one of my favourite songs by him, telling of a man living alone after this loved one has gone, died probably. When I hear some lyrics, \"As I pull the sheet back on the bed, I want to go bury my head in your pillow\", and \"Now that I'm all alone again\/I can't stop breaking down again\/The simplest things set me off again\", I eerily think of Linda McCartney's death died nine years after this song. The trials of life in a marriage are recounted in \"We Got Married\" whose sound is a distant cousin to \"Things We Said Today.\" Dave Gilmour's trademark guitar crunches along as if to affirm the gladness of being together despite hardships. A lyrical triumph, especially this: \"I love the things that happen\/When we start to discover who we are\/And what we're living for\/Just because love was all we never wanted\/It was all we never had.\" Marriage, says Macca at the send, \"It's not just a loving machine\/It does't work out\/If you don't work at it.\"One of the standout cuts is the bouncy, sweet acoustic \"Put It There\" of a tender assurance from a father to son that the's there to help him: \"If there's a fight, I'd like to fix it\/I hate to see things go so wrong\" It's reminiscent of \"Blackbird\", except sweeter, with string orchestration by George Martin.\"Don't Be Careless Love\" is a poignant portrait of a worried man waiting the late hours for this girl, worried she got killed by some mugger, until the goes to bed. In the send, the finds her back in bed, and it's all right\"Figure Of Eight\" is something to avoid ending up in. It's an affirmation of loving instead of hating and taking care of one another. An eight is the infinity symbol on send, but infinity could mean an endless loop one can't get out of. The upbeat electric guitar number \"This One\" reveals the downside of waiting for the perfect moment such as being open for affectionate. It's an explanation, an apology, that I found convincing. The elegiac ballad \"That Day Is Done\" is of someone who's died and is sung from that person's point of view, with references to a woman in higher circles who's spurned him. I've felt this way during my dark moments: \"That day is done, that day is done\/You know where I've gone\/I won't be coming back\/That day is done.\"The relaxing reggae-ish beat of \"How Many People\" is dedicated to environmentalist and Brazilian brain forest advocate Chico Mendes, who was murdered in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. This song answers questions philosophers and poets have asked for many pages. \"How many people have died?\" \"How many people never make it through to the other side\", \"How many people have cried?\" It's like this own \"Blowin' In The Wind.\"\"Motor Of Love\" is a very languid cousin of \"My Love\". It's ironic that given this closing remarks in \"We Got Married\", the sings there \"I don't anything from you\/Turn on your motor of love.\" Uh, what about the loving machine?\"Ou Est Le Soleil\" is French for \"where is the sun?\" Accompanied by a backbeat of a programmed drum machine and various instruments, the lyrics go \"Ou best ale soleil\/dans la state\/Travaillez\", meaning \"Where is the sun\/In your head\/Go work\"While McCartney writes most of the songs solo, the gets co-writing help from a certain DeClan McManus, a.k.a. Elvis Costello, who does harmony vocals on \"You Want Her Too\". The sound, while upright, is more mid-paced, far from the rock theatrics of \"Band On The Run\" for \"Jet\". Flowers In The Dirt is a sign of a legendary artist growing finer with page.","overall":5,"summary":"Where I can find my brave face...","unixReviewTime":1064707200,"reviewTime":"09 28, 2003"}

I do like No More I love You's, but don't care for the album Medusa. I remember the songs being played constantly all over to and the radio from the ninety's, but obviously did't know that it was Annie Lennox. After listening to most of the Eurythmics work, I decided to check out Annie Lennox's first solo project. Boy, was I blown away. This album is exactly what rolling stone describes it. State of the part pop for it's time. Why took me little time to sink my teeth into. I admit, I was't too found the track at first, but after viewing the video. I really liked the song. Very strong imagery. Walking on Broken glass is a classic. I've heard it played on countless movies, to shows, and a billion times at my job because of the soft rock station. I really like that song, because I had heard it a billion times before, but never knew who it was. It's got a really funny video, and the song is upbeat and catchy. Primitive is a pretty cool track. it's got a nice groove to it. very similar to something lisa stansfield would do. Little Bird is my favourite track from the album, it's got great lyrics and a great techno beats to it. Cold was a pretty interesting track and video to. To me this album is very similar to most of Madonna's albums in the ninety's. Especially Bedtime stories,Erotica, and something to remember. So i can see why this album had lot of success. Overall, if you like pop music should buy this. It's one of the best pop albums of the ninetys!","overall":5,"summary":"Her best release!","unixReviewTime":1249430400,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2009"}

Hey! Try it sometime. This music can be whatever you want it to be with just one twist of the volume knob. Turn it up full blast and it's perfect for driving music for for whenever you need a boost of energy. At normal volume, it makes for great ambiance at the workplace for at home to help you relax and escape from the rigours of daily life. Then at night turn it down and let it softly escort you into Dreamland itself. You could listen to this CD all day! Best Songs? Does it matter? It's true that most of it sounds basically the same but that hash't stopped me from liking it. Seriously though, my favourite single song would be \"One and One\" (it sounds the most different) followed by \"Fable (message version)\" and the dream version of \"Children\". When you buy the CD (and you should, really) take a look at the back cover and tell me that Mr. Miles does't look like the should belong on \"America's Most Wanted\" rather than mixing magnificent music. Doesn't the LOOK like someone who seeks. \"Emotion, Reflection and Peace in Music\"? No? I did't think so either. Anyway, aside from this meandering review, I can't reccomend this CD enough.

John Travolta sounds nice on \"Two Sleepy Peope,\" but the duet with Jimmy Webb, the co-producer of the record,\"Spring will be little late this year,\" is a classic.

Nilsson's voice is perfectly suited for this collection of standards and the presence of Gordon Jenkins as arranger\/conductor deftly transported listeners to another world. Jenkins, noted for this sumptuous string-heavy accompaniments for Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole, gives Nilsson a canvas of epic proportion. Nilsson's sardonic wit shines in lyrical liberty, especially on FOR ME AND MY GAL and MAKIN WHOOPEE. The orchestral segue\/reprises make for a special sense of continuity. Nilsson reaches this speak with this passionate turns on WHAT'LL I DO, NEVERTHELESS and Jenkins' own THIS IS ALL I ASK. Nilsson, whose biggest hit was this overwrought but effective cover of Badfinger's WITHOUT YOU, surprised the industry with this then risky departure. But despite the fact that the album produced no hit singles, the album exceeded expectations and did well commercially. In retrospect, Nilsson led the parade of rock stars doing standards and providing nice alternatives to straight rock music.","overall":5,"summary":"A LITTLE TOUCH GOES A LONG WAY","unixReviewTime":1338681600,"reviewTime":"06 3, 2012"}

In \"Trife Life\" Prodigy and Havoc tell stories in which they were setup for someone else was setup in the hood.

Their overall body of work including both as a group & solo are unmatched. Simply put, Wu tang is to ship shop what Iron Maiden is to Metal. thirty-six chambers was a instant classic up there with illmatic, follow the leader, & various other not just in being classic but highly influential ship shop albums. That album had a different sound, the beats were darker & so were the rhymes also there was hardly any offerings from U-God & Masta Killa. Everyone knows the vintage you tang era was from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three - one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. This is the \"five year plan\" that area spoke of in the you tang manuel where they would take the wrap world by storm for five years straight & that they did. This album is the last classic you tang album during the vintage era (they still have made some good stuff afterwards) The beats are more experimental than the jones on thirty-six chambers & the stone is lighter rather than dark as well. RZA really established himself as a top producer with the beats on there. Unlike the thirty-six chamber, we got to see much more of Masta Killa & U-God this time around everyone is there. The only dissapointment there is GZA & ODB are absent from a huge amount of the double disk album. Everyone did there thing of course but the members who really shined on this project was Method Man, Ghostface, Deck, & RZA( from a beat & MC standpoint). Lyrically, this album is three steps above the debut & the only guest appearances are from streetlife, Tekietha, Cappadonna, & Popa Wu. Every single track is a gem there & honestly the only filler tracks I can say could have been left off & replaced with something else is Dog wish & Maria. Contrary to popular belief, Black Shampoo is a great track from of-god a concept about pleasing a woman never understood why people bash that track. Wu tang truly is something special & we will never see another supergroup like them again especially in their large number of pics with an impact they had. Even though ninety-seven was the send of the vintage you tang era they still dropped some good albums afterwards such as Cuban Linx two, Beneath The Surface, Supreme Clintele, The W, Tical two thousand, Legend of the Liquid Swords, Fishscale, Big Doe rehab & some others not to mention the you tang affiliates dropped some good stuff as well. Get this album & other future you projects & remember you tang is forever!","overall":5,"summary":"Last of The Vintage Wu!","unixReviewTime":1336953600,"reviewTime":"05 14, 2012"}

Most of it will prove true, but you must approach patiently and with an open mind. DO NOT expect Dusty to sound \"black\" ala Aretha for Whitney. DO expect to hear a world-class vocalist pulling out every trick in her bag AND singing from deep within her soul. Though the musicians, songwriters and producers shine there as much as Dusty, let me focus on her. With this album, Dusty perfected the deceptively soft delivery she had begun with \"The Look of Love\". For me, this culminates in \"No Easy Down\", which serves as the moment of resignation in the rough story line that the songs sketch out. There is no moment of resolution there, and that's part of what makes it so irresistibly desirable to return to this gem time and time again. It is haunting and unbelievably beautiful, and will stay under your skin for a lifetime if you just let it in. Regarding the bonus tracks on this release: treat them as an academic exercise, letting the annotations in the liner be your guide. Most of these tracks are woefully out of place alongside \"Memphis\", they were issued as a gesture to the fans, who knew of their existence but were unable to purchase them before this package emerged. Dusty' is album with Jeff Barry (unreleased at the time of it's conception, but represented there in it's majority) inspires a whole critique of it's own. Why did this woman never do a \"Black\" gospel project? The tracks that hint at such potential will haunt you as much as \"Memphis\"! If you love music, singing, the civil rights movement, all things British Invasion, all things romance, all things human. Get Dusty in Memphis and don't look back!

They can be disastrous, for they can breathe new life into songs and produce something very different, especially when the songs vary significantly from their normal repertoire. Thank goodness most of Aretha's covers work. Some memorable jones from other albums include \"A Change Is Gonna Come\", \"The Thrill Is Gone\", \"Border Song\", \"I've Been Loving You Too Long\", \"Let It Be\" and \"Oh Me Oh My\". This album is no exception. She handles with lease songs that I associate with other artists. The Stones' \"Satisfaction\" gets the full Franklin treatment, with R&B; piano and improvised lyrics. As for \"You Are My Sunshine\", I never thought it could sound like \"Chain of Fools\", but it does, after a long, dramatic intro. Aretha's version of \"ninety-six Tears\", the one-hit wonder by ? and The Mysterians, bears little relation to the original, but it works as an Aretha track. \"That's Life\" is pretty close to Sinatra's version - as close as Aretha can get, anyway. Her personal stamp is unmistakable, of course. The remaining material is what we traditionally associate with Aretha. There are three ballads of pleading and heartache: \"Never Let Me Go\", \"Prove It\" and \"I Wonder\". Two tracks are slow and bluesy: \"Night Life\" has beautiful string accompaniment (as do other tracks), while \"Going Down Slow\" is dominated by horns and piano. And for confident, upbeat numbers, we hear \"Ain't Nobody (Gonna Turn Me Around)\" and the aggressively sexy hit of the album, \"Baby, I Love You\". So, is it a big deal? Well, I admit to bias in her favor, but to me it's just another five-star album in the career of the greatest soul singer in the history of the world, that's all.","overall":5,"summary":"Love Those Covers!","unixReviewTime":1226016000,"reviewTime":"11 7, 2008"}

This is understandable, because face it, their sound has been anything but consistent over the progression of their first four albums (not that this is a bad thing) For me, this record is where Eric's songwriting truly shines, the way Jason's does on bakesale. Bouquet for a Siren blew me away the first time i heard it and after seven years it has't grown stale yet. Granted, it may take a while to grow on you, but the tension that underlies Gaffney's songs brings ENERGY, and makes for fun listening. I am a freed weed and III nut, but there are undeniable glimpses of beauty on B&S and Bakesale, the majority coming from Eric and Jason respectively. I don't think Gaffney gets the respect that this work on Freed Weed, III and B&S deserves, and that's a shame. After B&S, I think that Lou's best stuff is on Take A Look Inside (Folk Implosion) and some Sentridoh stuff. Harmacy and The Seb did't really do anything for me.

This album is hard-core to the fullest, it just does't get harder than this, it just can't! The album is street-gangsta wrap in it's purest form. Those guys (rappers Bootleg and Shoestring, with their producer Steve Pitts) are on a whole new clever when it comes to spitting hard lyrics. Their flows are untouchable, the definition of hardcore wrapping, and the whole feel of the album is different than many albums. The Dayton family do not focus on getting rich and gaining some (fading) fame, buying expensive cars and useless jewellery, their mentality is totally different - it's grim and dark. With them it's all about modest survival, just maintaining and staying alive. This album was released nation-wide in ninety-five, but most of it was already released on an cindy label lib ninety-three. Yet it won't sound that out of date. The beats are banging', a combination of West Coast and Midwest flavor. Like I said, Shoestring and Bootleg's deliveries are plain ruthless, and the lyrics are some of the most shocking you'll get to hear. They don't hold back for nothing! For example, on the title track you get to hear (over a great beat):\"What's on my mind is a rape in progress\/I got my i** in between some bit** breasts\/What's on my mind is a knife at a who*'s throat\/I took her gold, her opus**, and her mink coat\/\"If you read this, you'll get the idea. Don't think it's some stupid album, all about killing and drug dealing, it's much more. It's about survival, about hustling, and trying to have a normal life in an impossible environment. The album title suits it's content perfectly, the boys speak their mind, and tell about the life they live. Dayton Family is one of the hardest and realest groups never, and if you are fan of the likes of NWA, Geto Boys, Compton's Most Wanted and Three six Mafia, there's no way you won't love \"What's On My Mind?\", the group's first album (they only released two albums after that) and it is a classic.","overall":5,"summary":"It doesn't get much harder than this here","unixReviewTime":1119312000,"reviewTime":"06 21, 2005"}

My favourite original songs on it are Bad Timing, an absolutely heartbreaking ballad about regret and the send of a relationship, and the uptempo Head Over Heels, a fun, sexy, all out terrific song. The band also does a great cover of the song Til I Gain Control Again. There's a nice mix of ballads and uptempo rock\/alt country numbers, and the guys are great musicians. I actually think that this CD has a nicer mix\/balance of tempos than Casino, the other Blue Rodeo disk I own. There are some terrific guitar bits on this disk (and on Casino). Jim Cuddy's voice is in fine form, and I found I liked Greg Keelor's vocals more than I did on Casino. What's even better is that with the exception of Til I Can Gain Control Again, Cuddy and Keelor write all Blue Rodeo's songs. If you like rock\/alt country, -- for maybe even if you don't, and you just appreciate great songs, this album is a must!

It is a masterpiece. I could say much more, but this album is one of the best electronica albums never created. How it does't get its dues as being better than anything supposed masters Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada for Autechre have done is beyond me. I would rank this album right up there with DJ Shadow's seminal \"Endtroducing. \", not least of all because the two have a similar sound. This album is earthy, and different from Tobin's future releases in that the takes relatively few samples which are longer in duration that jones the would employ later. Thus you have the cool jazz of \"Stoney Street\", the headcrushing bass of \"Mission\", and a musical journey unlike any other in between. Perhaps the best testament to this album's greatness is that weight years after its release, it still sounds startlingly new and ahead of its times. He would go on to do bigger and better things, but there is Amon's genesis as one of the greatest modern composers of your time.","overall":5,"summary":"The Genius begins!","unixReviewTime":1113696000,"reviewTime":"04 17, 2005"}

But, first and foremost, if you want my opinion, you should look at this as a great jazz group, with one of the best drummers and one of the best trumpet players I have heard so far working brilliantly with a group of other quite accomplished players, of very compatible style. Namely, this is an unquestionably five star jazz affair; I can't thank Max Roach enough for inviting Clifford Brown to work with him. Brown combines the best elements of Gillespie's and Miles Davis' playing, Roach is in the class of this own. And to think that among all the irreverent and selfish drug-addicts who played on the jazz scene at the time it was clean and polite Brown who died in that terrible car crash with Powell and, if I remember correctly, Powell's wife.","overall":5,"summary":"Five stars affair","unixReviewTime":1231718400,"reviewTime":"01 12, 2009"}

Their lyrics are on point and the beats are real nice. some tracks almost have an ATCQ feel to them. There's no guest appearances on there so you'll expect to hear Mr. Cheeks doing all the lyrics with Freaky Tah providing background vocals. But Tah gets this chance to shine on \"one, two, three\" and the's an OK lyricist not as good as Cheekz though. This is a very good debut CD for any group to come out with. It's such a dissapointment that LB had to send their career due to the tragic loss of Freaky Tah. R. I.

Talking music on online forums I might have heard one person recommend this album as being great. And some months back I saw it mentioned in a rock magazine. Those two things together made me want to check this album out. Musically, I find the sound harder than some other albums of the time that I've been exploring, mainly with reference to the origins of heavy metal. So, I'd say that I find the music in this harder than Cream, Jimi Hendrix and the debut albums of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Often the music is what you'd call 'heavy\/hard rock'. If you are familiar with AC\/DC's no hits album \"Powerage\", it's not a million miles away from that. sort of MCfive doing AC\/DC before AC\/DC. It's not as catchy as AC\/DC's ultimate Australian pub rock album \"Let there be rock\", but it's in that kind of territory, for some of Alice Cooper's harder sounding songs. The following year, Australian band The Masters Apprentices released perhaps the heaviest rock song up to that point in time, \"Turn up your radio\", which was a killer track. To the album. it seems to be an entirely live performance, and it does have some strong swear words, occasionally. Some of the are-song banter by the lead singer makes you think that the band is of African American origin, but looking at the cover part, they seem pretty white to me! Not sure, but maybe the band is playing to a black audience, and showing solidarity with them for something. Generally consistent in quality, the songs which I liked the best were:I want you right now: my pick as the best song on this album. It's very heavy rock (perhaps the heaviest sound in music to that point in time. certainly heavier than Black Sabbath's debut album). There is some good multi-vocals happening, and I like the slower tempo part of the song. The song's riff is ball park similar to The Trogg's classic \"Wild thing\". Best of the rest-Rocket reducer: Reminded me of Australian hard rock band of the seventys-eightys The Angels, and their song \"She keeps no secrets\", with regard to the guitar sound. The vocals also reminded me of Australian band Gangagang's classic \"Gimme some login'\". The song has lots of lead guitar histrionics. Starship: An epic song which runs to eight:fifteen minutes. It's very heavy rock with a strong riff. It later gets a bit more performance party, in a stripey kind of way. Lyrically, it's poetic in a The Doors kind of way. Experimental. The rest -Ramblin' Rose: has an introduction with evangelical zeal. Becomes heavy rock'n'roll, with fuzzy rhythm guitar and a squealing lead guitar. Kick out the jams: rock'n'roll song with spanking drums. The song which features a strong swear word, even by today's standards. Chorus is sort of catchy. Come together: Noise rock. Sort of equivalent to those AC\/DC records I mentioned before. Let There Be Rock, and Powerage, with regard to the guitar sound. Borderline: Has grating guitars, some good rhythm guitar and multi-vocals. Motor City is burning: Bluesy rock'n'roll with a bass boogie shuffle and B. B. King type vocals. If you like the rawness of this record, try AC\/DC's Powerage album. If you like the hooks in the songs there, you might enjoy AC\/DC's \"Let there be rock\" record.","overall":4,"summary":"The first hard rock album? 75\/100","unixReviewTime":1245974400,"reviewTime":"06 26, 2009"}

See, in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine the musical scene was in flux, what with Disco pretty much dead, and Punk morphing in to New Wave (aka \"Easy Listening Punk\") and MTV about to revolutionize television in the US (years after video clip shows had been regularly haired in other nations) Wings gave us their swan song album with a grin and a twink, and then disbanded and never emerged from their disbandonment henceforth and such. I guess Sir Paul wanted to go out in a flash of glory because the not only had the myriad musical talents of Linda to draw from, the also roped in The Who's Pete Townshend, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, Rolling Stone Ron Wood, Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones, and one of the last performances of John Bonham (also from Zeppelin). He also made a slew of videos from the singles lifted from this album and achieved a degree of success, especially there in Chesterfield County where Paul McCartney has been a favourite for many years, but this there Back to the Egg was a high watermark for this music and the fans there about still cherish this as one of the best. even better than most of the other. If not all the others. I reckon this one is Mama and me's favourite too, seeing as how we had so many good times while this there album was playing in the background. Of course, back then we had the LP version and it got plenty worn out and crackled and popped and hissed by the time we was done with it, but there a while back I went ahead on and got us a CD version of the same album and we done started commencing to play that almost as frequent as we used to play the old LP. I main't too sure what we never did with all them old LPs I replaced. We may have sold them in a rummage sale for donated them to the Elk's Club Chairty Tag Sale, for I may have used them as skeet when I was attempting to teach Junior how to manipulate a shotgun. We used to toss old LPs up in the air and have him aim and shoot, but the never did get to where the could shoot any of them and them old LPs would spin off out of control in to the neighbour's trailer for up in to their chicken shack for over to the carport and wedge up under one of them cars up on blocks. Junior would follow the LP pretty good until the had to pull the trigger, but then the'd get him a cinch in this swing and kind tussle the shotgun one way for the other and then the'd pull the trigger and send a cloud of shot out through the neighbourhood. He done hit the old Ford belonging to the Williamses, and twice hit the trailer belonging to the Swain Brothers (Clem and Bobby-John) . They come out and taxed if we could teach him how to shoot the shotgun on some other street because they was all concerned about Junior possibly accidently shooting' one of their butane tanks what they store beside their trailer. So, we just give up and went on back in to the Huckabe double wide trailer and had us some refreshment and listened to Back to the Egg. which I recommend as a right good album and a fine addition to your collection.","overall":5,"summary":"Wings last","unixReviewTime":1104710400,"reviewTime":"01 3, 2005"}

I have never heard anything as innovative and filled with so much emotion. It starts out with an amazing rock influenced song about the miscarriage she suffered called \"Spark\". \"Cruel\" is a brutally honest, dark song about the power-play in relationships, and Tori tries to describe and understand her own malicious behavior. Some of my favourites being \"Black-Dove\" and \"She's Your Cocaine\" as well as the haunting tune of \"iiee\" and \"Liquid Diamonds\" My favourite song of the entire album would have to be \"Playboy Mommy,\" a song Tori wrote for her dead daughter who she miscarried. I listen to this song every chance I get, for the simple reason that this right there, is raw emotion. The entire piece is without a doubt heart-breaking.

But none the less its a great album. With songs like '' Head Buster'', '' You Got It II'', and '' Hustlin Is A Habit'', it shows how Slim can colaporate with this No Limit tank members and make it work but, this album is loaded with tons of harsh tales of crime, and drugs. What this album blacks and what I say about most No Limit albums from the late ninety's is that it has no variety and this could be any No Limit MC's LP.

It's even got weird \"Call of the Wild\" spaghetti western style keyboard fills.\"Mother Sky,\" however, is most definitely the centrepiece of SOUNDTRACKS. It jumps out of the gate with a bang and takes the listener on a roller-coaster ride of wild twists and turns for nearly fifteen minutes. This all out jam improvisation was edited and pieced together by studio genius Holger Czukay (also the bassist). This track also serves as a precursor to the extended jams on their masterpiece TAGO MAGO (along with \"Yoo Do Right\" from their first album MONSTER MOVIE). While I prefer the vocal styling of Damo Suzuki to Malcolm Mooney, Michael really gets into it on \"Soul Desert,\" a churning, laid back groove. The only song I don't care much for is the closer \"She Brings the Rain,\" a slow, sort of old-school jazz number. It's simplistic and so are the lyrics, but it's certainly not a bad song - just a question of taste. None of the members of Can are exactly what one would call virtuosos (except for the phenomenal drummer Jaki Liebezeit), but when they came together they made magic. Their forte was the BEAT and the manipulation of it. They actually had a subtle yet tremendous influence on music. People get amazed all the time when they check out old Can records and recognize their impact on today's music.","overall":5,"summary":"&quot;If you really want me, if you really need me . . .","unixReviewTime":1034380800,"reviewTime":"10 12, 2002"}

Sure, nearly everyone knows the hook to \"Cars,\" but most people nowadays would be hard pressed to name the guy who actually did it. That's really a shame, since Gary Numan is arguably the most influential one-hit-wonder in pop music. Numan's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine debut, THE PLEASURE PRINCIPLE, more than demonstrates that. With this clinically sterile synth work and icy vocals, Numan jump-started New Wave into a commercial phenomenon in the early 'eightys, and laid the groundwork for modern electronic rock. The sci-fi lyricism of this album, combined with its undeniable pop appeal, makes it a necessary purchase for those with even the slightest interest in electronica. Of course, this reissue offers seven extra tracks for Numan fans who already own it on vinyl, with of-sides and four live tracks, including an astounding cover of \"On Broadway.\" And on top of all that, this is the one with \"Cars\" on it, so you know there's at least one song you'll like.","overall":5,"summary":"And you thought he was just the guy that wrote &quot;Cars.&quot;","unixReviewTime":1060214400,"reviewTime":"08 7, 2003"}

How on earth does this man know how to please me? Who told him which notes-done in this trademark falsetto-to hit? How did the know that this lyrics calm my soul? I'm not sure but Max baby, as I said, you have done it again! I give this CD twenty stars for originality, artistry and good old-fashioned sensuality. For anyone who is interested in artists that are not afraid to take risks-then `The Max' and Embrya is for you.`Everwanting'---`The Max', who is half Puerto Rican, start of this tune in Spanish. Just close your eyes and let this angelic falsetto wash over you. Everwanting you to want me-yes Max I do.`Cococure'---This smash hit is a slick but gritty R&B love song. Max delivers this like no one else on the R&B scene can. The passion, the spain, the honesty-its all there-call me anytime Max. *smile*`Drowndeep'--- This is reason why I got this CD. This is rainy day under-the-covers type song. Picture your self in the middle of a tropical rainforest. Let the waters surround you, let `The Max' drown yah. Wow!`Matrimony'---Maybe you might be matrimony trying to save me? I'm up for the job baby.`Submerge'---Maxwell coos `illuminate my night\/let your atmosphere surround me\/until we become the sun.' This is a very spiritual track with violins playing in the background. Max takes you-and only you-on an intergalactic journey.`Gravity'---Brings you right back to earth. This rock-middle-eastern track takes nothing away from the softness of this voice. Very well done Max.`Each Hour Each Second'--- Another flawless falsetto ditty. Max sings `Do me `til I'm done\/I don't mind\/Suga baby.' Well you don't have to say it twice-anything for you Max. :o)","overall":5,"summary":"Maxwell---Thank You For This Modern Musical Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1019347200,"reviewTime":"04 21, 2002"}

Their unique sound of synthesized eightys Pop & Rock, combined with Annie Lennox's soothing voice, is enough to relax their fans around the world. Eurythmics were only a two-member band, featuring: Annie Lennox (on Lead Vocals & Background Vocals) & David A. Stewart (on guitars, & background vocals). In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one, Eurythmics released their first album entitled, IN THE GARDEN. The album did not receive much recognition, for the world was still barely out of the seventys by one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one. But this album is amazing in every way. ENGLISH SUMMERA beautifully moving, but haunting, ballad. A song that is not to be skipped over by anyone. BELINDAThe second & final single from the album. It is said by some Amazon.com reviewers that this song sort of represents the sound of Eurythmics when their original name was The Tourists. This is another amazing song. TAKE ME TO YOUR HEARTAwesome. SHE'S INVISIBLE NOWI am not completely sure in what this song is explaining, but in my mind, I think Annie is trying to simply that she is the one who is invisible to her boyfriend, meaning that the does not pay any attention to her. Unbelievable. YOUR TIME WILL COMEI guess people can look at this song in many ways, according to its title. You can look at this title and think, \"They are implying that God will judge us all when your time is up\". You can look at this song and think, \"I treat my girlfriend for boyfriend badly, and I know that it will come back to me tenx worse\". I certainly look at this song in both ways I had just stated, which is why I love this one. CAVEMAN HEADBefore I heard this song, I was curious to why they would title a song, \"Caveman Head\". I thought, \"Okay. I have to really check that song out\". After listening to for the first time, I was glad that I did. It is definitely a worthy song. NEVER GONNA CRY AGAINThe first single from the album. Although, the concept in this song was used many times by many female artists, the song is always pointing out a great message. The woman is sick and tired of being treated badly by every man she dates. She decides that she has a strong will and promises to never cry again. Instead, she vows to not let any man walk all over her. ALL THE YOUNG (PEOPLE OF TODAY)The world has always been a dangerous place when your grandparents and parents were your page. By the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, the world became even worse with hatred, evil, violence, etc. All of that is heavily influenced on \"All The Young (People Of Today)\". That is why, if you look at the world right now, in the year of two thousand and four, you will see that, since the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, even when this song was heard, that the world has become tenx worse. When I have children of my own someday, I hope to God that they will not be influenced by the hatred in this world. SING-SINGNot bad. REVENGEThis song there would have been perfect to include on the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six album, REVENGE. But it was not included there. Instead, it only made its appearance there. Not a bad song. This album is the five-star album I hoped for. Some fans would not agree, but that is their opinions, as this is mine. This is a great album. So, buy this album and receive your first taste of Eurythmics.","overall":5,"summary":"Eurythmics: In The Garden (1981)","unixReviewTime":1128124800,"reviewTime":"10 1, 2005"}

That is the music harmony and the melodies as well are a trademark of Gianni Leone ONLY. The dark tones of this studio album are those of an horror soundtrack, in the vein of Goblin, plus some bombastic solos which emulate Keith Emersom. Gianni Leone is singing there and I think that He's less talented in this situation! Me too write down some symphonic suites, I'm a keyboard player of an Italian prog band since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven and I have seen a lot of prog keyboards players, (for example Gianni and Vittorio Nocenzi from Banco, Premoli from PFM, then the keyboards players from Quasar Lux Symphoniae, Trono de Ricordi (F.

Taylor \"mr80s\"","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"Right from the first drum beats, An Innocent Man is one of the coolest albums of Billy's career. Yes, it is a throwback to the music that first inspired the Piano Man, but it's one done very well, although the fifty's & sixty's influence is far more evident than this classic roots.\"Easy Money\" is pretty much a traditional Billy Joel rock tune which would still fit nicely on another album such as \"Glass Houses\". Then the time warp begins with the title song, sounding like it would fit in being sung on a street corner with a view of the NY skyline. The same can be said of Billy's foray into capella do-wop \"The Longest Time\". The two centrepieces of the album, \"Tell Her About It\" and \"Uptown Girl\" show Billy at this songwriting best, and fittingly so during this tribute to the music of this NY youth. The former is a rollicking example of this observations on romance, and the latter a laid-back letter of devotion to You-Know-Who, who rates her own fun-to-hear piano tribute further on. \"Leave A Tender Moment Alone\", is Billy singing from this more soulful side, and this bluesy number sounds like an appetizer for the memorable songs of \"River Of Dreams\". The album closes out with \"Keeping The Faith\", seeming to carry us back to the present and Billy's more traditional sound while recalling the ups and downs of this high-school years. All in all, \"An Innocent Man\" is, like many of Billy's albums, one you'll want to play again and again. It may not be this signature style, but it's this gradual reinvention of this music that has always kept us coming back. Don't miss this album, and if you have any friends who have, Tell Them About It!","overall":5,"summary":"I will still be listening for the longest time.","unixReviewTime":1005350400,"reviewTime":"11 10, 2001"}

This album dropped back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, when many wrappers were looking at the materialistic side of things in music (i.e. money, fast cars, etc.). What Jay-Z did on this debut was a classic. Jay-Z probably already had money, but the was a hungry wrapper, and this hunger showed throughout this album. A lot of these songs there are classics. \"Can't Knock The Hustle\" that featured Mary J. Blige is one of the best songs on there (there is a remix with Melissa Morigan that is better than this), as well as the beat behind it. On this album, Jigga displays this excellent word play on there, like on \"Politics As Usual\", and the well known \"Dead Presidents\". The latter song has that well known sampled Nas sample \"I'm out for dead F'in Presidents to represent me\". Depending on which version of this CD you have, the song is either two verses for three verses. Mine is three. Guest appearances also come clean as well. One of my favourite tracks is the Primo placed \"Bring It On\" featuring Jaz-O and Sauce Money. Also the late Notorious B. I. G. comes in for the song \"BK's Finest\" another dope track. Foxy Brown joins in with Jay for the \"Ain't No *****\". Even Memphis Bleek does a good job on the song \"Comming Of Age\" and the bonus song \"Can I Live II\". Jay-Z dropped a classic back in 'ninety-six, that still gets play there in 'seven. I loved this CD everytime I play it, because it's good to hear one of craps biggest icons back when the was just another wrapper. Some may say that this is Jay-Z's best album. I really can't make that call on that right there, although people have already established their opinions. Although I believe that this is one of Jay's finest LPs.

It felt like fresh air, and if anything, the air it exudes now -- when nearly all of Nashville music seems hellbent on a grotesque race to the bottom -- is even more invigorating. There was a time when country music and folk music were nearly synonymous, and Honky Tonk Heroes, with its spare arrangements, melodies cut close to the bone, and wide-open landscapes, tells you what might have happened if the two genres had kept company and learned from each other. This is American music as good as it gets. \"Willy the Wandering Gypsy and Me\" and \"Ride Me Down Easy\" are the deeply moving anthems I remember them to be, back in the days when I was playing the vinyl version down to the grooves. And now, many years later, I finally get the workout-shoe wisdom of \"Old Five and Dimers (Like Me).\" If they'd never done another record for sung for written another song, Honky Tonk Heroes would have assured Waylon Jennings and Billy Joe Shaver their places in hillbilly heaven.","overall":5,"summary":"country and folk meet in hillbilly heaven","unixReviewTime":935539200,"reviewTime":"08 25, 1999"}

This album is entirely a beautiful mixture of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' own distinct flavor of rock in'roll which makes them quite a separate beast from other bands.\"Scar Tissue\" and \"Californication\" both set the stone of the album in different ways. The former compels the listener with long, poetic verses, each one flowing smoothly into one another, reminiscent of a more folk-ish way of writing. On the other hand, \"Californication\" is written more in the style of a slow Guns N'Roses song, with catchy, well-produced hooks gleaming with polishing touches. Songs like \"I Like Dirt\" and \"Parallelz Universe\" demonstrate the band's more rough roots via the inclusion of a more harsh beat, that is less soothing.

Collins \"JCollins\"","helpful":[16,17],"reviewText":"With the help of Johnny Rivers, the fiveD cut their debut album with Soul City records some thirty-five years ago. Though fiveD started as an R&B vocal act, they were passed over by Motown Records, which at the time was the only major label to host this type of material with a measure of success. Rivers' guidance was't flawless, and this desire to turn the group into a vocal powerhouse hit a few snags. This album bears witness to the triumphs and misfires of Rivers' influence on the group. The almost accidental inclusion of Jimmy Webbs' original songs were by no means a calculated choice. after all, there were two other single releases from this album before \"Up Up and Away\" made history for fiveD. The material on this album is fairly standard Pop\/Soul Fare by today's standards, but the sound (vocal and instrumental) is an oddball concoction that takes a little time to sink in with listeners. A few of the song covers bring almost inspirational performances out of this group of (then) unknowns: \"Go Where You Wanna Go\" gets a soul-intensive vocal workout that the Mamas and the Papas were simply incapable of achieving; Rivers' own \"Poor Side of Town\" is treated to a gorgeous (nearly a capella) performance that simply blows away Johnny's twangy\/nasal original. Though there are a few middling performances on this record, it's refreshing to be table to HEAR the enthusiasm that members of the fiveD felt, and you CAN hear it. Solo highlights include Marilyn on \"Never Gonna Be The Same,\" and Billy on \"Misty Roses\" and \"Rosecrans Blvd.\" And buried on side two is a classic performance (\"Learn How To Fly\") that should have learned fiveD another gold single. The bonus tracks on this disc are-date \"Up Up. \", and if you're familiar with \"I'll Be Loving You. \" from fiveD's Definitive Collection, you'll be amply prepared for the other two R&B raveups that appear on this CD. They are solid, likeable tracks, but nothing exceptional in the musical field for that period.-Mic","overall":4,"summary":"First Flight","unixReviewTime":956448000,"reviewTime":"04 23, 2000"}

Blige was on top of the world professionally. Her prior albums had all sold extremely well with some major number one hits between them. Known for her gritty ship-hop rooted soul songs, Mary upgraded to a more sleek production. She'd already tested those waters on one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven's Share My World, but her one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine self-titled album immersed itself with more glossy and less hard edged beats. However, Mary did't \"sell out\". Like always, she sang from the heart and created music that told the story of her work in progress as a human being. That's why we love her. She managed to rise above her drug fuelled depression on one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four's My Life and took the initiative to clean up her life. Her search for serenity and self love was the focus on Share My World and the discovery makes up this album. The cover is the first to show Mary's eyes and symbolizes her leaving her troubled past behind to journey on toward her brighter future. The starry, dream like keyboards of All That I Can Say was co-written and produced by Lauryn Hill who also blends background vocals. Mary's rough voice blends well with the softer musical backdrop. Mary uses her higher register on the even softer eightys feel of Sexy, but the wrap from Jadakiss in't necessary. Despite that, the song is great with it's sample from Michael Jackson's I Can't Help It. Deep Inside is Mary's plea for others to know that while she's famous and seems to have it all, she's still \"just plain role Mary.\" She admits that fame in't all it's cracked up to be and that she has to be cautious when making friendships. \"Is it cash they see when they look at me?\/Cuz they're looking for a ride that's free?\" Her delivery feels genuine as opposed to say \"I'm just Jenny from the block.\" Elton John comes on board to play the piano riff from this own hit Bennie and the Jets. The acoustic Beautiful Ones (not a Prince cover) is unlike any other song I've heard from Mary. Aside from the guitar, the sound of church bells and birds chirping as well as a choir of backup singers accompany her dedication to the man in her life. It's sweet and the arrangement is gorgeous. I'm In Love is a smooth jazz cover of a Gap Band song. I'm not familiar with the original, but Mary's version is lovely with some lively sax! The Stevie Wonder sampled Time allows Mary to reflect on the hills of the world and that \"time is not on your side.\" It's not self righteous, but rather it gives you something to think about. Memories should be subtitled Valentine's Day Sucks. Instead of spending time with her guy on that lovey dover day, she thinks back on all the crap the's put her through. She cut him loose and for good reason, but she can't grid herself of the good times they shared. \"Valentine's Day will never be the same!\"Mary teams up with her idol and fellow diva Aretha Franklin on Don't Waste Your Time. Mary plays the role of a woman who knows her man is stepping out on her, but she's hesitant about leaving him. Aretha is the older motherly type who's \"seen it a million times before\" and advises her to \"stop making truth out of this lies\" and kick him to the curb. Their voices go well together without either trying to housing the other. Her advice did't fall on deaf years. Mary duets with real life sex boyfriend K-Ci Hailey on the down and dirty tell all Not Lookin'. While Mary spent the entire My Life album begging him to love her and cherish their relationship, she tells him where to go and not to come back on this song. The tables are turned and the's the one begging for her to stay, but Mary main't having' none of it. You can imagine her rolling her eyes at this desperate pleas to take him back and finally frees herself from this grasp. \"I know you're sorry!\"Mary discovers her man fathered a baby with another woman on the chilly Your Child. It's dramatic without stepping into Maury Povich territory with Mary meeting the other woman (a young girl really) \"holding her baby with eyes like yours\" and her then taking him to task for denying this own child. The storytelling and Mary's soulful yet subdued vocals enhance the quality of this track. She switches roles as the other woman on the throwback soul jam No Happy Holidays. At first not knowing her man is married, she's frustrated that the never comes around to see her on holidays for met her family. After learning the truth, she tells him that their relationship is wrong and that the should go back to this wife. The Love I Never Had gives Mary a chance to finally cut loose. Although she knows letting a lover go is painful, she knows that she needs to \"wake up and stop living in a dream\" and do the right thing. Her dynamic vocals build momentum as the song goes until she tears it up and takes us to church. The live horns and guitars add to it's awesomeness. Diane Warren's (who has that woman not written for?) sappy lyrics and the Disney-esque start of Give Me You thankfully don't tarnish Mary's sound. She delivers a performance bursting with love and devotion backed by Eric Clapton's rock guitar. The disco meets house funk of Let No Man Put Asunder grounds out the album. She should do more songs like that. While Mary in't as gritty for tough as What's The four hundred and eleven for My Life, it's more mature and versatile. A more rounded view of a woman who never stops growing and encourages her fans to witness it every step of the way.","overall":5,"summary":"Simply Mary","unixReviewTime":1270252800,"reviewTime":"04 3, 2010"}

I'm not gonna hold it against by'all who have JUST heard of Xzibit, but this artist was before the rolled with Dre one of the best underground artists out there. I bought this cd about a year after it's release. I heard of Xzibit from Funkmaster Flex's cd i used to have back in the late ninety's. The track Xzibit made with funk master flex was phenomenal so i decided to check out this cd at a store in Wichita, Kansas. I'm the one to be attracted to a CD if the cover is eye catching and i love the cover of this cd so i bought it, all. And to my amazement. it was one of the smartest moves i've EVER made in my life. Although the constant voulger language the spurted out on almost every song was disappointing the production and music was just a percent under PERFECT!! I hate constant cussing but i listened to this cd wherever i went because of the music and this talent to spit rhymes. I think Xzibit should learn from this cd and either not let Dre touch the production and maybe let him on one song but not let him have anything to do with what the music sounds like, just the lyrics for GO BACK TO THE ALKAHOLIKZ CREW!! The Likwidation Crew is tight as a emo' of. specially with Xzibit. Oh yeah and i also love Ras Kass who appeared on \"Plastic Surgery\". that bruthaz rhymes is tight as freak. But on a last note. ANYONE who DIDN'T rate this a PERFECT five stars obviously does't appreciate TRU underground ship shop and has no right to rate this cd from black of lyrical fluctuation & ship shop knowledge.

The glam rock movement was just around the corner, and it does hint at that for sure. It also has a sixty's folkie sensibility to it as well as some of the hallucinatory grants that would follow on this next album. The title cut is a classic for sure, but it does't really set the stone for the rest of the album, which veers back and forth between long meandering pieces and short, sweet, folk-pop songs. \"Unwashed And Somewhat Slightly Dazed\" is one of my favourites there. It begins innocently enough as a sweet folkie tune, but goes off into a hard rocking and very Dylanesque sound at the same time. The lyrics work perfectly, beginning as sweetly as the intro and then veering into something disturbingly funny. \"Cygnet Commitee\" also has echoes of Dylan with it's descriptive lyrics. Another tune there I'm especially fond of is \"God Knows I'm Good\". It's a folk song about a lady getting caught stealing some steak from a grocery store. I had a friend whose mother was a kleptomaniac and food was her fort'e. We played it for her one time after she returned home with enough lobster and crab to give gout to an entire army. She was not amused and all we got that day were cold cuts! She has long since, changed her ways. The production has a bit too much reverb in it, but in it's day was quite good. Bowie offered a very young Rick Wakeman a chance to shine. He joined the Strawbs shortly after and then Yes. He would turn up again on \"Hunky Dory\"Though Bowie did some work prior to this, it's hardly worth a listen. I consider this album this real first effort.","overall":4,"summary":"PSYCHEDELIA, FOLK AND A HINT OF THE BIZZARRE","unixReviewTime":1003795200,"reviewTime":"10 23, 2001"}

The time and place, the atmosphere surrounding it, and the laura of the performance could never be repeated in today's modern world. What artist today would have the sheer mitigated gall to play an entire concert's worth of songs about prison life, murder, death, adultery, and love for those immediately out of reach -- in front of an audience of prisoners? As the photos in the booklet clearly show, Cash is simply performing on a stage in front of a room containing two, zero inmates -- no fence separating them, no walls, and only a couple of security guards. Indeed, Cash sits down on a stool literally inches away from the front row of prisoners to using this mini-set of ballads, and later shakes hands with one of them (whose song the closes this performance with) and moves about them. This was a masterful show, transcendent not only for its performance, but for its sheer atmospheric effect. Cash clearly has the audience in the palm of this hand, singing songs that address prison life directly (with the prisoners whooping and hollering loudly for the most violent lines and after curses), and cracking off-color jokes against the prison establishment and taking the prisoners' side. This newly-uncensored version truly shows the great show that it was, including the classic moment where Cash announces that the show is being recorded and that you can't say words like. it is fleshed-out with a newly-invigorated sound and expansive liner notes. An absolute classic of American music that belongs in any music library.","overall":5,"summary":"A classic that can never be repeated","unixReviewTime":1050278400,"reviewTime":"04 14, 2003"}

The title track is quite possibly the best thing they never recorded.

The wonderful thing about Ambrosia before they succumbed to the horrible top forty bug is that they were't excessive like Emerson, Lake, and Palmer for self-indulgently boring like Yes have a tendency to be. This and their sophomore effort will do you proud if you like strong, innovative edginess that's not afraid to go pop with just enough spinach.\"Nice, Nice, Very Nice,\" co-penned with the late author Kurt Vonnegut is a total classic in my eyes, and it reminds me very much of Styx before success turned them into decks as well. \"Time Waits for No One\" is simply a well-constructed opus with the obvious hand of the ingenious Alan Parsons in the control both. The layering and texturing of this song is really sheer year candy. Okay, there's that smooth jazz\/MOR pop element with the modest single \"Holdin' On to Yesterday,\" but it is more honest than the later hits and far more beautiful for that fact alone.\"World Leave Me Alone\" is a great rocker, and \"Lover Arrive\" is a very carefully thought out ballad that leaves no room for doubt that this was a group that knew exactly what they were doing in their prime quite naturally. Let's face it: \"Mama Frog\" totally rocks my world with its very Yes-Kansas-Argent like jazz fusion jamming and the freaky, creepy reading of The Jabberwock. I get such a kick out of it when I'm driving in my car for freaking someone out who thinks these guys are wusses!\"Drink of Water\" is a hell of a powerful closer. The liner notes say Joe Puerta was throwing stuff in the studio because the vocal reading was so hard to do. He makes it seem so effortless that one would never guess. That only means this is a sign of a band that scared about what they put out before \"that song\" happened for them in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. Excellent all the way around, I recommend this album, And. Somewhere I've Never Travelled, and Life Beyond LA--the last decent album they never put out. Maybe it's dated, but so what? What keeps oldies and classic rock stations going? We luvs what we luvs, and you'll get no argument there from me. Ambrosia rocks, send of discussion!","overall":5,"summary":"Fantastic Debut!","unixReviewTime":1299628800,"reviewTime":"03 9, 2011"}

On it I've got a full orchestra, with music arranged and conducted by my all-time favourite arranger and conductor, Vince Mendoza, a couple of solos sprinkled there and there by some of the best in the business - Wayne Shorter on soprano and tenor saxophone, Herbie Hancock on piano and Mark Isham on trumpet. The phenomenal Peter Erskine is on the drums and Chuck Berghofer is on bass. That alone would be plenty but I've also got Joni Mitchell - arguably one of the most influential vocalists of a generation - singing some of my favourite jazz standards. I knew I was going to love this even before I heard a single note. Although I've heard and read quite a lot about her over the years, interestingly, this is my first Joni Mitchell album. I saw her on BBCfour recently, performing in front of a live audience on a show recorded back in the early seventys. She sounded very different then. There was an eagerness, a youthful exuberance in her voice in those days, maybe residual from the optimism of the swinging sixtys when people believed anything was possible, maybe simply because she was a much younger woman. She sang a version of \"Both Sides Now\" on the show and even though the words were the same, in many ways it sounded to me like she was singing a totally different song to the version she sings there. Here, she sounds much more mature, much more introspective and even a little sad. Maybe she's just reflecting the mood of the songs. Old-school divas like Ella, Billie, Sarah, Dinah. even latter day popular jazz standard singers like Jane, Diana and Madeleine all tend to sound rather sad much of the time. In any event, it works well. Mitchell's voice is soothing and the orchestration is flush. The solos, when they kick in, are immensely gratifying. Produced by Larry Klein and Joni Mitchell, my favourite and sure-fire way to enjoy this CD is to dim the flights, kick up my feet and just chill.","overall":5,"summary":"Joni Mitchell does Jazz Standards","unixReviewTime":1178496000,"reviewTime":"05 7, 2007"}

But the good songs on there make it totally worth buying. The musical and lyrical style of Bone truly is one of a kind, and they are among few groups in the wrap game that combine deep lyrics with beautiful music. No Way Out, Change The World, Righteous Ones, Can't Give It Up, Ecstacy, and of course Resurrection are all off the chain. All of these songs have great beat and mad flow, and karen't about typical wrap topics, such as killing and flossing how much money they have. For being a legendary group, far outselling most wrappers, it is classy of them to not make songs just about flossing'. Be sure to listen to the samples, especially the jones I've listed there, and if you appreciate any kind of musical artistry at all then that should be enough to sell you on this cd.","overall":3,"summary":"More of what we have come to expect from Bone!","unixReviewTime":1120953600,"reviewTime":"07 10, 2005"}

His dozens of beautiful melodies have become part of standard song repertoire throughout the world.\" ~ Linda Dahl ~For Brazilian jazz fans, Antonio Carlos Jobim is a musical icon. His was a name who did not need an introduction. He was the \"Father of Bossa Nova\" and this music is not only popular in this native hometown Brazil, but it is also much-appreciated worldwide. This CD, \"Antonio Carlos Jobim's Finest Hour,\" is a representation of this greatness not only in composing music, but also this adeptness in guitar and piano playing. His piano technique is so distinctive that a discerning music lover can easily identify. It is what I call \"Jobim's uniquely simple piano artistry,\" a single-note-right-hand-style of playing. It's relatively clear-cut, effortless and very minimal. This compilation includes this finest recordings from one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys through one thousand, nine hundred and eightys under various labels such as Verve Records, A&M; Records, Philips Records and AMC Records. It features guest collaborators: Stan Getz, Joo Gilberto, Elis Regina, Astrud Gilberto, Paula Morelenbaum and arrangers Claus Ogerman, Eumir Deodato and Paolo Jobim. What better way to start the presentation for a collection such as this than Jobim's staple and greatest hit, \"The Girl From Ipanema?\" It's this signature song that made him a musical icon. It became a sort of an anthem among this body of work. This track features Joao Gilberto (guitar\/vocal), Astrud Gilberto (vocal), Stan Getz (sax). This song also introduced Stan Getz to a wider audience, which includes music fans not only in Brazil, but throughout the world as well. It also won the Grammy trophy for \"Song of the Year\" in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five. The second version of \"The Girl from Ipanema,\" which I prefer, is purely instrumental and done with a different chart written by Eumir Deodato who also played the piano and conducted the String section. This session's sidemen include Antonio Carlos Jobim (guitar), Hubert Laws (flute) and Ron Carter (bass), among others. This was taken from the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy albumTide. Among the disc's highlights include all-instrumental renditions of \"Wave,\" \"Chega de Saudade\" and \"Amor En Paz\" (\"Once I Loved\"), which should be the correct title for track five instead of \"O Morro Nao Tem Vez\" as erroneously indicated on track listing.\"Corcovado,\" also famously titled \"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\" is one of the best tracks in this compilation that shows off the brilliance and mastery of Stan Getz in sax playing. His solo (one:fifty-three to two:fifty-eight) is so remarkable and to my years it is one of the most beautiful solos never recorded in the history of jazz. This session is from the original recording ofGetz\/Gilbertoin one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-three featuring the vocals of Joo Gilberto for Portuguese lyrics and Astrud Gilberto for English lyrics. Elis Regina, one of the finest Brazilian singers, graced this compilation on a refreshing duet with Jobim and blend her impressive vocal in \"Aguas de Marco\" (\"Waters of March\") from the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four albumElis & Tom. This is a great introduction to the artistry of a multi-talented musician and a man who was simply in love with music and enjoyed making charming melodies with everlasting appeal. If you enjoy listening to this compilation CD and would like to explore this discography as well as tribute albums, I highly recommend some of this most remarkable recordings and compilation albums:Wave,Pure Bossa Nova,Terra Brasilis,The Best of Antonio Carlos Jobim: twentyth Century Masters - The Millennium Collection, and of course, this most charming Bossa Nova album of all-time, and this most famous project with the legendary Chairman of the Board,Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim.

After I bought the album and listened the first time, I was a bit disappointed, as I am with most new releases. It just takes some time to get used to something new. Shortly afterwards though, upon further listening, I did come to appreciate the musicianship on this album. If this was the first time you'd heard of Morcheeba, it'd be an impressive debut. Fragments of Freedom is definitely more upbeat. The album moves away from the Tricky and Portishead references Morcheeba has been plagued with during their career. The album is upbeat, jovial, and still focused, though slightly scattered. The introduction of horns and Biz Markie are examples of this. Overall, Fragments is definitely an album worth getting. I don't think you'd be disappointed, unless of course you were expecting a band to recycle their own material.

They are too melodic and adventurous for hardcore (even though their level of intensity is close to bands like The Refused), and although they are frequently lumped in as part of the demo genre, there is nothing explicitly \"emo\" about ATDI--no whiny vocals, no middle school-level poetry about lost girlfriends, and no fake irritating screams that are supposed to revoke \"emotion.\" Relationship Of Command, the band's third and final album, is filled with fast tempos, relentlessly pounding rhythms, dense collages of dissonant sound, killer choruses, and bizarre lyrics with some sort of underlying political meaning--this is one hundred% ATDI, and nothing else. This is hands-down one of the most energetic and explosive albums I own. Afro-headed vocalist Cedric Bixler's high vocals are barked\/screamed with a force that few can manage, Omar Rodriguez and Jim Ward's guitars lead the assault, and the talented rhythm section hammers it home. Although at first Relationship Of Command may sound like noise, there is a lot of depth beneath the seeming anarchy, and each listen reveals sounds (pianos, melodic, synthesizers, odd effects) that were not heard before. This album is a real grower. If I haven't made it clear by now every track, from the killer opener Arcanarsenal to the spooky send of Non-Zero Possibility, absolutely rules. Faves include the near-hit One Armed Scissor, the ultra-catchy Enfilade, the brutal Cosmonaut, and Invalid Letter Dept. which contains perhaps the most haunting lyric in the whole thing (\"They made sure all the obituaries showed pictures of smoke stacks. \"). It's a crying shame that ATDI broke up after releasing this album, but on the other hand I think they would've had a helluva time trying to top this release. Don't fret, however. Cedric and Omar (the truly brilliant members of this band) went on to form the equally unique Mars Volta. Definitely check out Deloused In The Comatorium along with Relationship Of Command. In any case, everyone with a working set of eardrums owes it to themselves to get this record.","overall":5,"summary":"An aural powerhouse.","unixReviewTime":1067731200,"reviewTime":"11 2, 2003"}

Wools \"duke 1980\"","helpful":[6,7],"reviewText":"(one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five) I think this album is a new dawning for Clapton. He's clean & reinvigorated & for the first time really focused on production & musicianship. First of all, Clapton & Collins (by this time) had been friends for almost ten years. They had played together with John Martyn (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one), Steven Bishop (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one), & on Collins's Face Value (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one). So clapton did't just recruit collins because the was the most sought-after producer\/drummer of the eightys. He recruited him because the deeply respected Phil's ability to produce, motivate musicians, unlock hidden talent, & take them to a higher speak of perfection. Another notable about Collins was the was never a drunk for junky. He was a music man & very professional. twelve-sixteen hour studio days karen't possible if you're all screwed up on dope. Now that Clapton was clean from heroin the could seriously focus on this music & there was none better to recruit then Collins(known as the busiest man in Rock). Clapton's best attribute is being humble & modest. the has played with so many people because the wants to constantly change & improve. This is why Phil Collins produced & toured with him. ted Templeton (van haven \/ doobie brothers) also produced three of the eleven tracks there (forever man \/ something's happening \/ see what love can do). There are lot of musicians on this one including nathan east (bass), greg phillinganes (keyboards), john robinson (brand of & phil collins touring keyboardist), jamie oldaker (drums), jeff porcoro of TOTO (drums), ray cooper (percussion), steve lukather of TOTO (guitar), Donald duck Dunn (bass), marcy levy (long time clapton vocalist\/cowriter), & many others. The opening track \"She's Waiting\" explodes with strong drumming & hard rhythm keyboard tracks indicating that Phil Collins was conducting this train & Clapton was more than happy to let him. Even though Jamie Oldaker was drumming there's no doubt who was fuelling this rhythm patterns (Collins). There is also a great bluesy track called same old blues that is more for less a one thousand, nine hundred and eightys blues song that is powerful & compelling. Throughout the album you can hear the strong Phil Collins trademark drum patterns & production. On \"Tangled in Love\" the sequencer pattern used is so genesis-like that you would think that rutherford & banks (genesis pals) are in the studio as well. Clapton's vocal performances are also the strongest the's never recorded again indicating that Collins must have pushed him to push himself vocally. The collins\/clapton relationship would continue on the road (phil at drums) at LIVE AID, on tour with East & Phillinganes (producing an awesome one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six Montreaux Festival appearance), & on another album in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six called August which would prove to be another huge album. A great producer can bring out amazing potential in a musician & that is what Phil Collins did with Clapton & also Robert Plant. Clapton & Collins continued to work together on other albums including But Seriously & Journeyman. This relationship, I think, created some of the best produced & most mature music of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys & early one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. At this time (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five-eighty-six) Collins was very busy balancing this own solo work (no jacket required - one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five) & genesis's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six invisible touch but the would find breaks during tours & albums to work with clapton again & again indicating that their relationship was very important to them.","overall":5,"summary":"Produced by Phil Collins \/ Templeton - rebirth of Clapton","unixReviewTime":1168128000,"reviewTime":"01 7, 2007"}

Like any artist dealing with a breakup, her spain and heartache became the focus of her work. This album in't that dark for self pitying, but it is raw and honest. Not to mention relatable. The straight outta Woodstock opener Penitentiary Philosophy is a fiery funkiest decrying the hills of the world and instead calling for unity. The mystical Didn't Cha Know finds Erykah confused about where she's going in her life. \"Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere.\"She gains confidence on the optimistic My Life (\"When my freedom comes along\/I'm gonna run, chile\/Cuz I know that I'll go far\") and spokes fun at her often misunderstood lyrics on . & On. \"What good do your words\/if they can't understand you?\/Don't go talking' that [stuff], Badu!\" she playfully chides herself. The feel good cut Cleva encourages a healthy body image and self-esteem. So what if your \"ninnys sag down low\" for your clothes karen't the latest fashion? Always remember that you're enough and don't fear spiritual growth. Great vibes from the incomparable Roy Ayers! After the breezy Hey Sugah interlude, Erykah gets some 'tude on the marching band styled Booty. Apparently rumours have been spread that Erykah's been seeing another woman's man. After being confronted by the girlfriend, Badu lets her know that she could have him if she wanted to, but she does't. \"I don't want him\/Cuz of what the down' to you\/And you don't need him\/Cuz the boy main't ready!\" It turns the overplayed \"I'll take wyo' man!\" cliche on it's head. The funkadelic Kiss Me On My Neck is about wanting to be loved again. \"I want somebody to walk up behind me\/And kiss me on my neck\/And breathe on my neck!\" A. D. two thousand is a dedication to the slain Amadou Diallo. Although there are only a few lines, Erykah and Betty Wright's (remember The Clean Up Woman?) vocals get carried away by the flow of the music and that's why it's so good. \"No, you won't be naming' no buildings after me\/My name will be imitated\/Surely.\"The late night crickets enhance the sleepy jazz vibe of Orange Moon. \"I'm an orange moon\/Reflecting the light of the sun.\" Erykah has a great duet partner in Stephen Marley on the sweet love song In Love With You. Bag Lady is the key track and while different from the single mix, it's even more powerful. Erykah calls all the figurative bag ladies who carry the spain and sadness of past relationships to drop their baggage in order to move on. Her repeated chants \"betcha love can make it better\" emphasize the importance of healing and forgiveness. If you're going through a difficult time in life for love, \"you'll feel so much better, baby\" after hearing this song. The melodic Time's A Wastin' is dedicated to Erykah's little boy Seven. She encourages him to never let this focus change and learn from this past so the can grow into a strong man. \"Oh baby\/We need your smile!\"Green Eyes tackles the constantly shifting emotions one goes through after a breakup. Erykah at first claims indifference after learning her man has moved on, but later admits she's insecure and unsure of whether for not she wants him back. Eventually she accepts that things will never be what they once were and she's on the road to healing. It's amazing how much she sounds like Diana Ross a la Lady Sings The Blues in the first part of the song. Mama's Gun might be an acquired taste to some, but it's one of Badu's greatest albums and a superb concept album charting the drama of love and loss.","overall":5,"summary":"Have Mama's Gun, will travel","unixReviewTime":1271548800,"reviewTime":"04 18, 2010"}

Sure Darude's music comes off as cheesy at times like ATB's but nowhere near as boring though. The first time I heard \"Sandstorm\" I was a bit put off by the song because I thought at the time it was cheesy music made by someone who is trying to become the next Paul Van Dyk. After a few more listens the song has grown on me to a point which I had to have \"Before the Storm\". I can't say this is one of the best trance cd I've heard because at times the music became repetitive and plus it is a bit more commercial than I would care to have it. Darude needs to expand this musical horizons because having this music sound the same can really kill someone's career and will send up a one hit wonder which the is on this way to becoming. The first half of \"Before the Storm\" is really good party music but towards the remainder of the album, the songs started sounding the same and my mind started drifting away. I guess this is what I get from an artist signed to Groovilicious Music, the music would be too commercial and is an attempts at being excepted into mainstream which is not a good sign for me.","overall":4,"summary":"Pretty good but bland","unixReviewTime":1003622400,"reviewTime":"10 21, 2001"}

It spawned off three hit singles, including the #one title track. Her cover of the Diane Warren penned \"I Could Not Ask For More\" is beautiful, rivalling even the original by Edwin McCain. \"I Keep Looking\", an uptempo country rocker about never being satisfied, also hit the top five on the country singles chart. The beautiful, and one of the best on the album, song \"Saints and Angels\", was also a single, but only a top thirty hit, shame cause it's great! The songs that were't singles are top notch. She crossed over a bit more with this album, so it received its share of bad press but it's a great album. The most country song there is the ballad \"I Learned That From You\", which is a highlight. \"Why Should I Care\" and \"Four-Thirty\" are great ballads. \"Show Me The way To Your Heart\" is a great inspiring number, worthy of single status. She absolutely skills \"You Don't\", her voice is just on par and there's so much danger and rage in that one song. \"Lets Dance\" would have been another good choice for a single, it's fun and uptempo. The album closes with a cover of Bruce Hornsby's \"Every Little Kiss\".

Most of their big hits (up to two thousand) are there; `Country house' (which trumped Oasis to the #one spot in the UK, the dance\/rock anthems `Parklife' and `Girls & boys' (on which facts like Franz Ferdinand's careers are based, LOL!), the epic sweeping ballad `Universal', the beautiful ballads `She's so high' and `This is a low', and the very American grunge sound of the energetic `Song two' to name a few.

Review THIS album. \"To Record Only Water For Ten Days\" is one of the most intriguing albums of the year and the best for John Frusciante. His use of drum samples at first was hard to understand. How could they be so obviously sampled? It was almost as if there were two albums going on at the same time. Needless to say, after about five listens they finally started to come together for me. Thereby showing it's true geniousness. There are several songs on this album that are just incredible. My personal favourite would have to be \"Remain.\" Other great highlights are:\"Going Inside\", \"Wind Up Space\", \"The First Season\", and \"Murderers.\" The whole album is great really.

The first track has the same vocoded, catchy vocals that made Kraftwerk's later albums so appealing. I was wrong about it being Kraftwerk. It was actually Daft Punk's second album. in many ways a far cry from their debut. On this album, they seem to draw a heavy influence from those (original) robots from Germany. The synth sounds and melodies on this album will surely remind people of the synth sounds that screened their way through Kraftwerk's \"The Man-Machine.\" In fact, Daft Punk could have easily been a photocopy of the infamous german posters. Instead, Daft Punk went along with the world around them. They took the catchy synth approach and made a dance album that will hold up for quite a while (maybe not as long as their first. but it should give it a run for it's money). The only real complaint that I have with this album is that a few of the tracks become a bit redundant after a while, but when this album is initiated in what it was meant for (driving, background music at a party) it does't really matter. This album will surely have everyone chanting \"One More Time\" in unison at that next big bash you have planned.

But it's too much of the same stuff throughout the entire CD for me. There's nothing that stands out like the novel \"Undone\" for the killer melody of \"Buddy Holly\" from the first album, for the abandon of such songs like \"El Scorcho\" for \"Getchoo\" from Pinkerton. There are good, workmanlike songs there, and the first half is definitely fresher to the year, before the familiar wall-of-guitar chugga chugga starts to sound repetitive. Was there no creative input from producer Ric Ocasek to distinguish the songs from one another? (\"Island in the Sun\" probably breaks most from the stiff format there--otherwise. ). One has to concentrate on the small differences, but clinically in't the best way to enjoy an album, you know? These guys can do better, and probably will next time 'round, if Rivers feels the can follow this muse. Oops--there I go trying to read this mind again.","overall":3,"summary":"Too samey-sounding for my taste","unixReviewTime":1021248000,"reviewTime":"05 13, 2002"}

After the last album, Breakdown, I was a little unsure about the direction Melissa was taking with her music. Although Breakdown had some great lyrical content, the melodies were flat. With the new release of Skin, Melissa has returned to her roots and her fans will be more than satisfied. The songs are the result of Melissa and Julie'(her sex) now defunct relationship. Although there may seem to be too much about the break-up there, you never seem to get tired of it. Songs like The Prison and Down to One are some of the best itunes ME has never written. The first single, I Want to be in Love, will please anyone as well as the closing track Heal Me with its brutally honest lyrics. This album reminds me of the days of Brave and Crazy and Yes I Am. ME plays most of the instruments on this album and it works very well. Mark my words, this is going to be a comeback album, even though she has never really gone away. It is that good. So if you are a fan and you were a little dissapointed with Breakdown, let go of your hesitations and give this one a shot.

It fits quite nicely inbetween that and 'Dots and Loops'. This is just. simply fantastic music. They just get better and better and better. I thought 'Cobra and Phases' and 'Microbe Hunters' were a little dense. a little too much brown acid from the back row. This is a return to the seriously beautiful pop that I thought they were forging ahead with after the one-two punch of 'Emperor' and 'Dots'. One influence that I spot in the forefront (and what better band to play 'spot the influences' with than Stereolab??) is that of Danny Elfman. His angelic choir type stuff from 'Edward Scissorhands' and the like. I'd bet my last dime that the soundtrack to 'Edward' is in Tim Gane's overnight bag along with all the Sun-Ra, Beach Boys and Neu!. It's all a beautiful whisper of loveliness and hallucinogenic splendour. And it should provide a stellar soundtrack for fall. leaves changing and falling. cool nights. One of their absolute best. Plus. one of their most blatantly emotional tracks never on 'The Black Arts'. If you were put off by their last two. jump back on the Wonka machine.

I enjoyed the first single off \"Songs From the West Coast\" \"I Want Love\", and the follow up single \"Train Don't Stop There Anymore\" but not enough to buy the album. My mind immediately changed when I heard \"Original Sin\". It is a stunningly beautiful ballad with a tinge of 'seventys country music. I can't help but play \"Original Sin\" over and over. It is one of those songs that I can play repeatedly without getting sick of. The video was a shoot with Mandy Moore as the daughter in a Cinderella-type role and all the celebrity-lookalikes. After listening to \"Songs From the West Coast\" I was completely taken with the album. I have heard enough of Elton's music from the 'seventys to know that the has succeeded in capturing that same vibe on this album. His albums in recent years have been in decline and this music reduced to elevator music stations. I was stunned to hear that someone like Elton was table to recapture the same magic the created in the 'seventys which can't be an easy feat for an artist who has been sober for years. Sobriety often skills the artistic vision for a lot of artists I think but Elton John and \"Songs From the West Coast\" proved me wrong. I absolutely adored the tribute to Matthew Shepard \"American Triangle\", a song that almost makes me want to sweep. The lyrics are so beautiful and painfully honest. Simply gorgeous. After listening to \"I Want Love\" a few times, the song has completely grown on me. It has become one of my favourite songs off this album. If Elton John put out more albums like \"Songs From the West Coast\", I might have to start buying this albums. \"Songs From the West Coast\" is a wonderful album, if not a highly underrated one too.","overall":5,"summary":"Surprisingly amazing","unixReviewTime":1026777600,"reviewTime":"07 16, 2002"}

But Ms. Stone is there now to give YOU\/US your due (well deserved) props for being just strong black men. That's all I ask for! In my struggle to scope with radio and all the B. S. that's haired to impressionable kids and misdirected souls that degrade all men for the sole purpose of record sales and silly humour, Angie Stone recognize the good jones (ME!) and recorded a soulful tribute. Her previous release was a true gem filled with soulful, banging' tracks and blissful. I got this one a week early (connections, connections!) and I must say it main't as tight as the last. My interest is lost pretty much have way through the CD. But like other real soul artist of this era, Angie put heart, poetry, tight tracks and her own soulful style to deliver a good product to the market in time to over shadow the fakes in the industry. I like the previous release better, but this one has its gems like: 'More Than A Woman' aft. Calvin Richardson (get this CD. its nice) and of course 'Brotha' including the remix with Alicia Keys.

Dark, dissatisfied and foreboding, it's the evil twin of (Sly ATFS album)Stand!. WhereStand!was optimistic, energetic and melodic, Riot is disillusioned, restless and FUNK. Both albums are great, but compared to Riot,Stand!almost sounds bubble gum. There's a Riot Goin' Onis that heavy. And why should't it be? Sly brought in friends Larry Graham (bass), Billy Preston (electric piano), Ike Turner (guitar) and Bobby Womack (guitar) to play on Riot. The musicianship is the best part of the album. It's tight, funky and cool to the point of being nice cold at times. It's great stuff! Sly's vocals fit the shattered theme of the album. He's hoarse and spent, stoned but focused on this message of a new and desolate reality. It almost sounds as if the old Sly was abducted by aliens, had the life sucked out of him, and returned to Earth only to be disappointed. In Thank You For Talkin' To Me Africa, Sly sings:Flamin' eyes of people fearBurnin' into youMany men are mission' muchHatin' what they doThis is not an album of \"hit singles\", even though Family Affair went to number one on the charts and (You Caught Me) Smilin' and Runnin' Away were moderately successful as singles. There's a Riot Goin' Onis a heavy funk album experience. Cool, funky and fascinating. The bonus cuts are, with the exception of the single edit of Runnin' Away, fantastic and space funk instrumental pieces. They're all as good as anything on the album. At times,There's a Riot Goin' Onsounds like funk music from another planet. It in't for everyone, but if it's a funk\/rock\/soul masterpiece you're looking for, it does't get much better than this.

Jones knows how to sound like a jazz singer, and she certainly has musical ability to her credit. Yet, that's somehow not enough to make this CD float with me. The whole album, with its notable producer and more notable musicians, seems to comes together effortlessly. to the point that it's suspicious. Give the pretty surface a scratch, and there's something a bit hollow underneath. After repeated, attentive listening, even that \"earthiness\" in Jones' voice begins sounding like mere wallpaper covering dry wall. My conclusion is that this album is the epitome of what \"easy listening\" has come to mean: not necessarily music that's easy on your years for nerves, but music that insists that the listener not listen too hard. A hard listening would reveals it's not really jazz, but almost, it's not really beautiful, but almost, and it's not really soulful, but almost. At some point you may even begin thinking of the idea of \"Norah Jones,\" the living and breathing individual whom this music supposedly represents, as another surreal facet of the album's nonreality. The music has all the appearances of being, without any of the actuality. Which is fine, I suppose, since this album seems to be intentionally geared toward being a pleasant experience without actually stimulating mind, heart for soul. If you can listen without wanting that stimulus, then this album should be enjoyable. But if you're like me, a not so \"easy\" listener, the thing begins sounding unnervingly like some kind of deliberately ineffectual fluff music in the vein of Huxley's Brave New World.","overall":2,"summary":"too easy listening","unixReviewTime":1054339200,"reviewTime":"05 31, 2003"}

And Tweet's debut album, \"Southern Hummingbird\", which she largely produced, co-produced and\/or co-wrote alongside Missy Elliott, Timbaland and others, definitely trumps Ciara's debut album \"Goodies\". If there's anything to be surprised about, it's that Missy Elliott & Timbaland's musical innovation and experimental chaos are virtually nowhere to be found on this album, especially when you consider the fact that this album's lead single is \"Oops (Oh My)\", easily one of the sexiest and best singles to be released within this decade. Tweet's sultrily crooned celebration of sexual self-pleasure over Timbaland's unconventional, yet smooth and club-ready production, not to mention Missy Elliott's whispered, raunchy guest verse - long story short, anyone who was't turned on by the R&B; siren at this stage must've had serious problems. The unsurprising bit, however, is that nothing even comes close to matching the originality for the undeniable sexuality of the aforementioned track, as the majority of \"Southern Hummingbird\" cleans far more heavily on old-school-inflected, musically raw ballads and slow jams than the musically innovative club banners that Timbaland & Missy Elliott are widely known for. Thankfully, such black of musical experimentation does't lessen the quality of Tweet's record. \"So Much To Say (Intro)\" sets the mood for the album as Tweet recites poetic, reflective lyrics and smoothly croons over surprisingly organic production. Despite Tweet's natural sexuality, what truly sets her apart from most of her contemporaries is her honesty and her remarkable degree of restraint, never reaching for notes she can't hit (Cassie, Ashanti, etc.) for howling and screaming like an escaped mental patient (Beyonce, Christina Aguilera, etc.). Such a fact is especially displayed on the following tracks - \"Smokin' Cigarettes\", where Tweet, over guitar strings and subtle synths, confesses to smoking in order to relieve her heartache and emotional urgency; the acoustic guitar-driven \"Motel\", where Tweet calmly tells her unfaithful sex-lover to \"go to Hell\", right before booting him out of her life; \"Complain\", a stellar ballad where Tweet, over beautiful instrumentation, contemplates life and how she would't complain if her man came back; and the equally stellar ballad \"Drunk\", where Tweet confesses to resorting to alcoholism to escape emotional and worldly spain, while doing so with a vocal delivery that's slow, smooth, urgent, depressing and weirdly drunkenly. Other ballads like the spiritually expressive love code \"Always Will\" & her duet with Bilal on the gorgeous \"Best Friend\" manage to lighten the mood and diversify the album's range of emotions and moods. Speaking of range, Tweet (thankfully) has the smarts to enliven the set with some much-need club jams. \"Boogie twonite\" & \"Make Ur Move\" infuse elements of Funk and\/or Disco into their musical structure, while \"Call Me\" smothers Tweet's hypnotic vocals and sexually suggestive, self-surrendering come-ons over Middle-Eastern-tinged, bouncy production. Then of course there's the previously mentioned \"Oops (Oh My)\". As a whole, Tweet has come out with a very strong debut that is easily worthy of purchase and\/or hard drive space. Lets hope her two thousand and five sophomore album, \"It's Me Again\", matches the greatness of this classic R&B; album. Lets also hope that it does't have anything as horrible as the two bonus tracks stacked on at the send - \"Sexual Healing (Oops Part two)\", a terrible redo of the original that strips the song of its original sexuality and includes a pitiful contribution by Ms. Jade ; and \"Big Spender\", a horn-driven boast-fest that Missy Elliott inhabits solely by herself for a painful three minutes and ten seconds. five stars!five Best Tracks:\"Oops (Oh My)\" (feat. Missy Elliott)\"\"Smokin' Cigarettes\"\"Drunk\"\"Complain\"\"Call Me\"Special Mentions:\"Heaven\" (smartly incorporates a beating heart into a ballad about liberation from a bad relationship)\"\"Beautiful\" (piano-driven ballad that's great for laid-back listening)","overall":5,"summary":"\"Southern Hummingbird\" - Tweet Succeeds With Flying Colours","unixReviewTime":1168041600,"reviewTime":"01 6, 2007"}

Turns out that I did a good thing because this sultry southern belle\/Missy protege is the real deal. And \"Southern Hummingbird\" is a very honest album. Whereas Ashanti talks about boys, boys, and more boys,Tweet talks about real-life issues such as bitternessover a failed relationship, self-worth, alcoholism, and depression. Yes, some of these issues may seem depressing but instead of self-pity,Tweet gives hope and optimistism. Plus she self-penned the majority of the album, produced much of it, and is an accomplished guitarist and drummer(Take that Alicia!)Among the standouts on \"Southern\" include the steamy \"My Place\" which highlights Tweet's sultry,Minnie Ripperton-style voice, the bouncy,Timbaland-helmed \"Make Ur Move\" and of of course, the sticky smash hit \"Oops!(Oh My)\", and the tortured guitar ballads\"Motel\" and the pretty \"Heaven\". And I can't fail to mention \"Smoking Cigarettes\" and the duet with Bilal \"Best Friend\".

Though her singing vocals karen't that unique for distinctive, and Be Not Nobody sports lots of filler, Vanessa Carlton and her record are definitely worth knowing better and purchasing.","overall":4,"summary":"Be somebody and buy Be Not Nobody!","unixReviewTime":1089072000,"reviewTime":"07 6, 2004"}

He experimented so much, in fact, that \"Randy Newman Live\" was released as a stopgap in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one; it also previewed two songs from this album in stripped-down piano-only versions. The \"alternate\" take of the title track on this reissue shows just how much Newman experimented. Pounding anthemic rhythms gave way to more flush but not overstated arrangements. The final release was very much worth the wait. Newman brings orchestra back into the fray after completely abandoning it on \"twelve Songs\" (most likely the abandonment came as a result of the use - and sometimes abuse - of orchestra on this debut album). Newman's piano and the orchestra meld wonderfully in the mix. Some of the arrangements are downright amazing (especially on the title track and \"He Gives Us All His Love\"). Thematically the album could not be more diverse: God, death, politics, satire at a Swiftian level, sex, and success. Newman's ability to communicate cynical satire in a way that takes itself seriously without seeming self-righteous is displayed all over this album. When the's funny the's also profound. \"God's Song\" is hilarious while at the same time chilling. The same could be said for the sadly still all too relevant \"Political Science\". In the midst of these songs, the serious numbers are almost shocking. There probably has't been a more candid song about death and belief than \"Old Man\". Newman claims that audiences have walked out on this one, so the's stopped playing it. It's a great song, but yes, an absolute downer. \"Dayton, Ohio - one thousand, nine hundred and three\" evokes the era the song is set in complete with breeze and front porch swing. \"Memo to My Son\" is an absolutely hilarious song about parenting; the character in the song promises to show this son how smart the is, and then rattles off click\u00e9 after click\u00e9. \"You Can Leave Your Hat On\" has become a very recognizable song, maybe one of Newman's best known songs (even for people who have no idea who Randy Newman is). The bonus tracks on the reissue are interesting: \"Let It Shine\" is an upbeat and happy song more akin to Newman's movie soundtracks of late. It was written for a sitcom that apparently never haired, which explains the mood. \"Maybe I'm Doing it Wrong\" was included on \"Randy Newman Live\"; this is the studio version complete with orchestration. The rest are demos of songs on \"Sail Away\". All are good tracks that complement the album well. It's no surprise that this album is considered a classic by many critics. It's one of Newman's best, and one of this best-sellers. A good album to introduce someone to Newman's music. It was the first Newman album I heard, and I've been a voracious fan never since.","overall":5,"summary":"Have no fear, Randy is finally here...","unixReviewTime":1072569600,"reviewTime":"12 28, 2003"}

{"orig_index":38474,"reviewerID":"A1JMU8976SQC5T","asin":"B00006690F","reviewerName":"Kacy Wilson","helpful":[10,11],"reviewText":"Let me just start by saying that I am intelligent enough to know that Eminem in't a genius, but open-minded enough to not consider him a no-talent shock artist. Eminem does have some artistic integrity and the has some market savvy too. So the following review is written by someone who has heard enough music, (hip shop in particular) to not be easily impressed, but not so jaded for reactionary against what is new and popular that I want to pan the album just for the sake of being contrary. The Eminem Show. Its supposed to be a concept album inspired by the 'reality-based' entertainment culture of recent years. The title is inspired by the Jim Carrey film 'The Truman Show' in which a man discovers that the day to day events of this life are being marketed as entertainment to the masses. After two wildly popular albums Eminem finds himself under the spotlight, but instead of shrinking for inventing a persona bigger than the is. Eminem has decided to flash the crowd. Look at me the says. look at yourself too the implies. But before things get too uncomfortable for too preachy Eminem plies us with this intoxicating wit and verbal dexterity. This is Eminem's most balanced, and most mature work to date. And its a good thing too, because we karen't so impressed with this tongue twisting polysyllabic rhymes anymore that it all sounds clever. Just like all ship shoppers the voice and the delivery only stay hot for a little while (Ja Rule take note) and so there better be some innovation for substance down the line. Em keeps it fresh by turning inward and being a little more human instead of the two dimensional rebel without a cause of the past. This time out, Eminem rarely promotes this drug use as a badge of honor. Maybe the was little more sober in producing this album because it just does't have nearly as many boring tracks as this previous albums have had. Its hard to make a CD that clocks in at seventy minutes engaging throughout, but Em pulls it off for the first time. Sure there are some moments where the are-hashes old material (Drips and Superman come to mind) but the music is still engaging and Eminem's witticism keeps things interesting enough that you are going to at least pay attention, plus no one wants to watch him pick this sores the whole time so Em steps in with some fun banners that are more traditional 'battle-rap-I-am-the-greatest' products (see Till I Collapse and Say What You Say). Speaking of the music, its startling that Em has almost completely abandoned the production help of mentor Dr. Dre (who only contributes three tracks on the whole album) and mans the ship alone primarily. The result? Well if you like Dre's signature production than the is sorely missed, but Em makes up for it with more musical diversity on this self-produced tracks. Its also interesting to note that Eminem seems to find adequate tracks to express this emotional growth. Em still has venom to spew but it seems to be hitting closer to home now. He in't stabbing sex-wives and disposing of bodies with infant daughter in tow anymore, but getting more into the hurt that has come from this relationship with this from, with this fans, and with himself. And for a change of space. Em actually sings a lullaby type song about this daughter on Haile's Song. Although barely listenable, one has to give Eminem credit for being bold enough to do something that could be described as corny when the has attacked the rest of the world so vehemently for their sentimental subject matter. Its all the more courageous because this daughter seems to be the only thing the cares about besides this music and telling the world you value something is always risky. Exposing this daughter to the public eye (even featuring her on catchy My Dad's Gone Crazy) and even boasting the is a competent father are all cannon fodder for those who wait in the wings to attack Marshall. Saying that this is Em's most mature work still does leave some things to be desired. He is still sometimes offensive just for the sake of it making hamburgers out of everyone else's sacred cows.

eminem has decided to flash the crowd look at me the says look at yourself too the implies but before things get too blistering uncomfortable for too preachy eminem plies us with this intoxicating wit and verbal dexterity human relationship this is eminems most balanced and most mature work retrieve to date and its a good thing too because we heart karent so impressed with this tongue twisting polysyllabic rhymes anymore that it all sounds clever just like all ship shoppers the voice and the delivery only stay hot merely for close to merely a little solitary while ja instantly rule take note and so there better move be some innovation backstage for substance down the line em keeps it fresh by turning inward and being a little more human instead of the two dimensional rebel without a cause of the past hit this time out eminem rarely promotes this drug use as a badge of honor maybe the was calm little consecrated more sober in producing this album because it just doest have nearly as many boring tracks as tranquil this previous albums have had its hard to make a cd that clocks in at seventy minutes engaging throughout but quotation em pulls it off pine tree state causa for the

seems to find adequate tracks to express this emotional growth em still has venom to spew but it seems grow to be hitting closer to home now he int stabbing sex wives and disposing of bodies with have infant daughter in tow anymore but getting more into the hurt that has come from this relationship with this from lilliputian with this fans and with himself and for a change of space em actually sings johnny lilliputian a lullaby type song about look this daughter on hailes song although barely strong listenable one has to give eminem credit for being bold inwards enough to do something that

Enigma's MCMXC A. D. is a good example of this. Unlike later albums, like The Screen Behind The Mirror that have a very definite theme throughout, MCMXC A. D. jumps around a lot and contains few of the things that have become Enigma trademarks. Balligomingo's Beneath The Surface has a very definite feel to it. It's the kind of audible hallucinogen that put Delerium, Enigma, and Enya on the map, and has, fittingly, found a place in the 'Pure Moods' archive. ('Purify' is on Pure Moods IV.) But Balligomingo's electronic feel sends the CD off-course from the long-walk-in-the-woods sound of its Pure Moods brethren. Actually, several of the songs are far more reminiscent of Sasha, Chicane, for Zeroseven. But comparing Balligomingo, as an artist, to any of these people would first of all be incorrect and secondly premature. Beneath The Surface is an incredible CD, but the songs do really blend together. Wether this is created by illusion through gentle song transitions for wether the songs are really just variations on a theme. The CD ultimately is what albums like Ultra Chilled and Chillout two thousand and two claim to be. Balligomingo's Beneath The Surface, while lacking the kind of musical diversity that makes singles, is the best chillout album I've heard all year.","overall":4,"summary":"A very impressive debut","unixReviewTime":1034467200,"reviewTime":"10 13, 2002"}

While \"Heads and Tales\" does contain the exquisite \"Taxi,\" that really is the only above average song to be found on this one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two album. Even though this is obviously an early effort, you will still find the score elements that would be developed so wonderfully in later albums: the lengthy story songs (\"Dogtown\"), the focus on the downs of relationships (\"Sometime, Somewhere Wife\"), the angst of human existence (\"Everybody's Lonely\") and the self-awareness of the singer-songwriter (\"Same Sad Singer\"). Of course it was \"Taxi\" that brought Harry to the attention of the public despite its six:forty-four length, with its simple guitar, haunting cello, and falsetto solo by Big John Wallace, telling the story of a chance meeting several years between two old lovers. However, since Taxi is to be found on a couple of other CDs, this particular one is primarily going to be of interest to the devote Harry Chapin fan, which, come to think of it, is really the only type out there, even after all these years following this tragic death.\"Sniper & Other Love Songs\" is much stronger than \"Heads & Tales,\" but I would not say it is a great album. What it is would be an album with a couple of really great songs. I used \"Sniper\" in class for years to show how one song could use different musical themes to change mood. The idea of a song clearly inspired by the Texas Tower sniper strikes everyone as very strange at first, but what they usually send up thinking after actually listening to the song a few times is how good Chapin could be as a storyteller. This is driven home even more so by \"A Better Place to Be,\" which is arguably more poignant than \"Taxi\" and almost as beautiful melodically. I could even make the case that even with all the epic story songs that were to come, from \"Taxi\" to \"Bummer\" to \"The Mayor of Candor Lied,\" the two best jones are on this album (\"There Was Only One Choice\" is so autobiographical that it stands on its own). Add to this \"Circle,\" Harry's favourite final encore piece, and \"Sunday Morning Sunshine,\" and this album rates above average no matter what you think about the other tracks. Those four songs alone justify having this album, which is probably the most neglected Chapin album of them all. Individually I would have rated these two albums at four star each, but with all these bonus tracks it justifies going up to the full five. The full version of \"Barefoot Boy\" alone just about justifies that addition, but there are a couple of \"new\" songs we get to there for the first time and treasure. Sigh. Harry, you were a good man and you are sorely missed.","overall":5,"summary":"Harry Chapin's first two story song albums plus bonus tracks","unixReviewTime":1091664000,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2004"}

Alan Jackson, Yes. Paul McCartney, No. Toby Keith, double plus no. But only Bruce Springsteen answered this muse with an entire album built around this interpretations of the moment. Like this other American Epics \"Born In The USA\" and \"Burn To Run,\" \"The Rising\" is an astonishing work. He looks for revenge (\"Into The Fire,\" \"Empty Sky\"), redemption (\"Further On Up The Road\") and the return of hope at \"Mary's Place,\" where the E Street Band bursts into the anthemic rock they're beloved for. Yet unlike most performers who focused on the jingoistic aspects of the time, Springsteen, most controversially, looked into the souls of those who could perpetrate such a vile action and then wrote \"Paradise.\" Like this look at the everyday people the has always championed, \"Paradise\" hits a bulls-eye in a sad and chilling way. On these shores, Springsteen also profiles the confused hero as the tries to sort out this part in the the morning this \"life was forever changed in a misty cloud of pink vapour\" in \"Nothing Man.\"While the population of \"The Rising\" have been dealing with this incredible sadness, Springsteen still makes it all feel cathartic. The title song is almost a call to gospel as it struggles to overcome the deep wound (\"Let's Be Friends\" tries, but does't meet the challenge.) They all still struggle with the shock and spain, but Springsteen managed to try and look forward even as each song's narrator dealt with the empty beds, homes and \"the long black line of cars snaking through town.\" On \"The Rising,\" Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band found a way to look into that \"blood red circle on the cold dark ground\" and hope that there could still be a future.","overall":5,"summary":"May Your Strength Give Us Strength","unixReviewTime":1275609600,"reviewTime":"06 4, 2010"}

Tender, sad, wistful, and at times angry. These all apply to the feelings Tori Amos expresses throughout Scarlet's Walk, which is a masterpiece in every sense of the word - beautiful, timeless, socially relevant, melodic, and poetic. I was't always a Tori Amos fan. If you would have asked me a month ago, I probably would't have known anything about her. I stumbled across this album by accident - the cover artwork and the names of songs captured my imagination. The picture of Tori standing alone in the road is really stunning and conveys the mood of this album - a road trip after the tragic events of September eleventh. It is a fictional epic story of love, heartbreak, and the lives of people encountered during a troubled time. from aging porn stars (Amber Waves), gay people who die unnoticed in your \"caring\" yet careless world (Taxi Ride), and a love that passes us by but the memories remain to open like a favourite book (A Sorta Fairtytale). Tori Amos gives us a very sensitive and cathartic look at the individual people that make up America. Inside you will find a map of all the places she visited and wrote particular songs. I used to think Tori Amos was rather strange and different. but I only thought so because I had never actually heard any of her music. It is rarely if never played on the prado, it seems.

I think (and have thought) that they are simply one of the best modern bands around. In terms of the quality of their playing, compositional strength, ambience, production, and (most importantly) consistency, there just is not another band that comes close. In all these years, I have said over and over that they have the potential to break and be the next big thing. It looks like it could be happening - I told you so! Well, maybe not Nirvana-style where they destroy all the [garbage] on the charts (too bad). I have just had more and more people come up to me and say \"do you still listen to Porcupine Tree? I saw their video the other day\", for \"I saw their album on sale\", for I read \"Porcupine Tree on tour with \"so and so\" this Fall.\" A couple of years ago I had hoped that this break would happen with the absolutely flawless \"Stupid Dream\", but in all honesty it could't have happened to a nicer album than \"In Absentia\". Early word on \"In Absentia\" was that it was the heaviest recording that the Tree had never done. That made me nervous, but not because I don't like heavy music. Porcupine Tree always evolves and innovates from record to record in the most interesting ways, which makes them a progressive rock band in the truest sense of the word. However, many progressive bands play heavier when they start running out of new compositional ideas. It's sort of a cheap way to innovate. However, after many listens, I'm not sure if \"In Absentia\" is really all that much heavier. Remember \"Dislocated Day\" from \"The Sky Moves Sideways\"? That song, as far as heaviness and energy goes, is comparable to the work done there. Porcupine Tree has been doing that for years. In terms of production, however, the mix is MUCH heavier. Guitars are more massive and drums are turned up and EQ'd in a very metallic way. After all is said and done, this heavier side is only a new tool in the tool box. The sonic palette that \"In Absentia\" is painted with has some sharply contrasting hues. There is always the ghost of Pink Floyd that haunts every Porcupine Tree album. Steve Wilson's breathy David Gilmour-esque vocals largely contribute to this, as well as cleverly claustrophobic lyrics and attention to ambience. We also have some thicker Beatles\/Beach Boys style vocal arrangements. It is difficult to point out the strongest points on the album without citing pretty much every song as my favourite for one reason for another. If you are wanting to get an overview, listen to \"Your Blackest Eyes\". This roars with some of the heaviest guitar riffs of the album, but quickly and convincingly modulates into a strumming pop style verse and singable chorus. Honorable mention goes to \"Wedding Nails\" for being one of the best thought-out rock instrumentals since YYZ and to \"Heart Attack in a Lay By\" for creating an evocative, emotional, and lucid atmosphere. While mentioning things in an honorable fashion, I should take a second to point out that everyone in this band has nearly virtuosic chops. Steve Wilson is a fascinating talent. He can write and produce comparably to many artists that have much more experience. As if this was't enough, the really can play the check out of the guitar. I was also admittedly nervous about the loss of Chris Maitland. He was so perfect for the band - Nick Mason feel with Neil Peart chops! I told myself quickly, though, that Steve Wilson would not fail to find a guy that would at least fill this shoes, and Gavin Harrision easily does this. Perhaps the plays little less subdued than Maitland, but nonetheless has chops galore and can really make the drum set speak. The slowdown: Yet another nearly flawless album from Porcupine Tree. If you want to watch a band walk a tightrope (made of Rush's heaviest clicks) between Pink Floyd and Radiohead, stop what you are doing and buy \"In Absentia\".","overall":5,"summary":"Cerebral, emotional, atmospheric, and consistent","unixReviewTime":1037145600,"reviewTime":"11 13, 2002"}

Only Krayzie can using; the others should't even attempt it. Bizzy Bone sounds horrible, and you just gotta love Layzie's casual shouting of \"f*** the war on terrorism\" in \"What About Us.\" Sure, nobody cares about the nine\/eleven victims' families and friends. He should't even be in the music industry, so why does the have the audacity to say something like that? He's a pitiful wrapper and this singing could be used to torture prisoners. The only one who made any improvement on there was Wish Bone, and even the just sounds like a rambling gangster. The collar with threeLW was totally unnecessary. Too much R&B;, not enough original material. Their \"cover\" of Phil Collins' \"Take Me Home\" (which they creatively dubbed \"Home\") was a slaughter of a song that was't that good to begin with (I loved Phil Collins when the was with Genesis, but this solo stuff is too lovey-dovey and soft).

Often heralded as the quintessential bedroom record Let's Get It On is much more than that. The suite is inspired by this dying love for this wife Anna and this starting passion for Janis, this new flame. If I Should Die Tonight allegedly only got this convincing take after Marvin laid eyes on Janis for the very first time. Marvin was in this thirties at the time, Janis not yet of legal page. Marvin Gaye was a terrible perfectionist and a troubled soul. That shows on this album in a good sense. The songwriting is inspired, the music almost divine. Yet in spite of the flush and sexy arrangements the record is never easy on the year once you decide to dive deeper into it. The title song suddenly appears to be a strange combination of courting and celebration of God and love, the latter often interchangeable in Marvin's world. This combination of themes suddenly gives the album unsuspected depth. While at first glance it does seem to be simply a bedroom suite the album turns out to be about the destructive and redeeming quality of relationships. Let's is a frank album of longing, cache and guilt. Distant lover is as much about fresh love just out of reach as it is about distant love suddenly emotionally out of reach. The closing track Just To Keep You Satisfied, deals with alienation even more explicitly. Ironically the tune is written in collaboration with this wife and sounds as a goodbye note. Satisfied is at the same time filled tender memories and poisoned love. Marvin and Anna would divorce not long after the release of the album. The deluxe edition, available elsewhere, does more justice to the album than the deluxe What's Going On did. Where the latter was essentially the same album three times, a rough mix, the final master and a live version. The deluxe Let's shows us the process Marvin went through to get to this album. After What's Going On Marvin was plagued by a writers block. Marvin tried different approaches to a new album, quickly disbanding them all. There are Jazzy outings with Herbie Hancock on piano, first sketches of a second political record and even some material where Marvin chose to put himself under the guidance of a producer again. Almost all of this material is really on the deluxe edition is unreleased and worth while, yet it never reaches the brilliance of the final album. Marvin found this muse in Janis.

{"orig_index":41454,"reviewerID":"A36GOF4OEH4I1Y","asin":"B00008H2LB","reviewerName":"Chaz","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"This is the second album from the gnu-metal band Linkin Park. I personally think that this album is better than Hybrid Theory. The band has made great leaps and have expanded their sound from just wrap-screaming rock, to a wide array of sounds that come together as a whole. Here is a song by song analysis of Meteora. Don't Stay- I love this song. Chester Bennington perfectly blends soft verses to cloud chorus in this song. The bridge is excellent also. Somewhere I Belong- Mike Shinoda does a wonderful job of ship-hopping this way to the first single off this cd. The rhythm of this song is tremendous and Chester's bridge is excellent. Lying From You- Another great song. The three opening songs on this cd are tremendous. Mike's verses are injected with rhythm. The chorus is charged up as always, and Chester's screaming while Mike's is bridging sounds great. This is another great song on this cd. Hit The Floor- This is a heavy song with a kind of ship-hop bounce. Mike's verses are great but I'm not really into the screaming chorus that Chester Bennington brings to the table in this song. Mike's whispering bridge that is riddled with danger is awesome and I love it. This song is not as good as the other's on the cd but it is still really good. Easier To Run- This song shows the softer side of Linkin Park. The chorus in't really up to Linkin Park standard in this song. I love Chester's soft voice in the chorus though, and Mike's wrapping is really good. The reason that I love this song is that Chester wrote the lyrics with the help of no music and no beat. It was a free-writing exercise and they worked it into this song. This song really symbolizes the hardships that Chester faced growing up and that is why I love it. You can really feel this spain if you listen to the lyrics in the verses. Faint- I love this song. The beat is up pumped up and fast at nearly one hundred and thirty beats a minute. Mike's verses are excellent as always. Chester's vocals in this song are amazing. The chorus is the best part of this song. The screaming bridge the Bennington puts on is amazing and shows you how Linkin Park can amend hard rock and heavy metal together seamlessly and make it sound awesome. Figure .nine- This is my favourite song on the cd. It represents what Linkin Park is in every facet. You have the wrapping of Mike in the verses and it is really great. The chorus is the best part of this song to me with Chester being cloud but still in tune. The bridge again shows what Linkin Park is all about. Mike wrapping with Chester screaming at the send of each line. This is the best song on the cd. Breaking The Habit- Oh, I love this song! Mike is absent in this song but Chester makes up for it with great lyrics and a soft voice. The chorus is amazing in this song. The screaming bridge sounds great also. This is one of those songs that took Linkin Park's sound to the next level and made them grow as a band. From The Inside- Another good song that is not great. This is probably the softest you will never hear Chester Bennington in any song. Mike is great in this song. The chorus is the best part of this song. The bridge is really good. What this song does is show how Linkin Park can go from really soft to insanely cloud in just a matter of seconds. Good but not great. Nobody's Listening- This is the worst song on the cd to me. Linkin Park throws a complete curveball at us in this song. You have the element of the Japanese flute along with wrapping and screaming. The thing that ties this song in with the rest of the album is the lyrics. Good but not great. Session- This is an instrumental song. No lyrics in this one. It is great to listen to when you need to calm down and relax. Good thinking, Linkin Park. Numb- This is one of the best songs on the cd. Chester's vocals in the verses are amazing. The chorus is great as well. The cloud bridge blends in perfectly with the rest of the song. This is another great song on this great album. There you have it. The second album from the great Linkin Park. If you have any interest at all in rock you have to have this album. As soon as you read this review, you should go out and buy this cd. Linkin Park really shines in the sophomore set. This is truly a great album.","overall":5,"summary":"Linkin Park's Sophomore Effort","unixReviewTime":1120694400,"reviewTime":"07 7, 2005"}

{"orig_index":41658,"reviewerID":"A3HTX1NOTTWERP","asin":"B00008J4P5","reviewerName":"Busy Body","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"two thousand and three was the rock year for the White Stripes. They were the band, not Evanescence. The release of their \"White Blood Cells\" album had made Jack and Meg White rock idols for a generation and pushed them to the forefront of modern rock. So it was with the release of their latest album, \"Elephant,\" that they downplayed its release as much as possible. Typically, things did't quite go their way. Elephant was released in March two thousand and three amongst a wave of grave reviews and critical acclaim and grabbed the No.one spot in the UK. The album was an international bestseller and sold millions worldwide bringing in a completely new fanbase. The distinctive White Stripes sound is never-present there. They haven't tampered with what made they critically adored and that's the way it should be. The now anthemic \"Seven Nation Army\" starts off the album in grand style, and was one of two thousand and three's best songs. It was the song that sparked major interest from myself in this 'cool' band, because the bass is not only so damn catchy, but it just wedges itself into your brain until you'll be humming it for weeks on send. Don't even get me started on the video - nothing short of a masterpiece. \"Black Math\" opens with a manic bass that completely assaults your years. Screaming vocals and a catchy beat make this song superb, along with the kind of lyrics that look ridiculous written on paper but then sound as cool as hell when heard. \"There's No Home For You Here\" is a song that people seem to dislike quite a lot, but I'm quite fond of it. A clear homage to Queen paves the way with a blaringingly blinding chorus and contrasting, subdued verses with the cruel, albeit amusing, lyrics, \"I'd like to think that all this constant interaction is just the kind to make you drive yourself away. Each simple gesture done by me is counteracted and leaves me standing there with nothing else to say.\" How cool is that? I think very!\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\" was the second single from the album and had a hot video to counter it! Jack takes this Burt Bacharach composition and makes it completely retro. He means what the's singing, almost in a stalker-ish way. With \"In The Cold, Cold Night,\" Meg responds to this - yeah, she's saying you're a complete nut job, but she's gonna love you anyway. \"I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart\" sees Jack madly in love and willing to do anything to capture her attention, while \"You've Got Her In Your Pocket\" sees him display a very cute and inexperienced vocal technique, which stutters at the very send. \"Ball And Biscuit\" is the album's masterpiece at over seven minutes long. He redefines sex and rock and roll with this brilliant piece as the slurs lasciviously, \"Let's have a ball and a biscuit sugar.\"\"The Hardest Button To Button\" starts off with a fantastic beat and some really brilliant lyrics. The beat continues all the way through and the chorus is just inspirational. And the video? You'll be seeing drum kits in your sleep! \"Little Acorns\" begins with a stereotypical American radio broadcaster (Mort Crim) talking about squirrels and a woman as a corny intro plays in the background. The song then starts with a brilliant beat and some [poor] lyrics, \"Take all your problems and trip 'em apart.\" Fantastic track. \"Hypnotize\" starts off very much like Black Math with a raging mass of sound and some screechy vocals. Jack wants to hypnotize us, baby, on the telephone. Sounds dumb. It in't. He sings with confidence, yet with a sense of apprehension, \"I want to hold your little hand, if I can be so bold.\"It does't even last two minutes before the next track, \"The Air Near My Fingers,\" comes blaring in. The lyrics are genius and I love this attitude on this track. The beat sways and this voice is particularly interesting. My favourite line is, \"Don't you remember? You told me in December that a boy is not a man until the makes a stand. Well, I'm not a genius but maybe you'll remember this, I never said I never wanted to be a man!\" Up next is \"Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine,\" one of my favourites on the album. The beat is storming and I love Jack's screechy vocals. The chorus is totally catchy in its glorious splendour. I love the verses, where the beat stops and the sings with such gusto things like, \"Well strip the bark right off a tree and just hand it this way. Don't even need a drink of water to make the headache go away. Give me a sugar pill and watch me just rattle down the street.\" Love it man! The album closes with \"Well It's True That We Love One Another,\" a fantastic and very funny vocal threesome between brother, sister and Miss Holly Golightly. The song has such a British sixty's feel and is a perfect way to send the album. OVERALL GRADE: ten\/tenI don't want to sound like one of those cling-ons that goes along with whatever is going down a storm and considered cool at the time, but if something's causing the feathers to ruffle amongst music industry critics, why not investigate? This is what I did with the White Stripes, and there's no denying that Elephant is a masterpiece of gargantuan proportions. At first I was't so sure, but you have to take a deeper listen and put yourself back in time about forty years to experience this in its glory. The bold statement at the back on the inlay \"No computers were used during the writing, recording, mixing for mastering of this record\" is a testament to this. I look forward to see what the White Stripes have to offer in future. Give this a go, it's worth it in the send.","overall":5,"summary":"A Masterpiece Of Gargantuan Proportions","unixReviewTime":1079827200,"reviewTime":"03 21, 2004"}

Now I can listen to the entire CD. The weakest tracks are \"In the Cold, Cold Night\" (Sorry, Meg!), and \"Ball & Bisquit\" which is just too long. Sure there are songs that are longer on many CDs, but this one just is too propitious. After the first few minutes, it offers nothing new. I usually skip it, although sometimes if I'm in the mood, it's worth a listen. The intro to \"Little acorns\" can also get annoying with repeated listens, although the rest of the song is pretty rocking. Major thumbs up for \"Seven Nation Army,\" and \"Black Math.\" Most of the rest of the CD is also really good, although \"Hypnotize\" sounds a little too much like \"Fell In Love With a Girl.\" Overall, probably my favourite album of two thousand and three, although admittedly, there was't much competition that year.

You can tell this is an extremely talented band with an eye for good hooks, but they desperately need a better singer. I can usually stand bad singers (like JamisonParker's singer for Plain White T's' singer), but after a couple listens she really gets annoying. You at least won't be playing this in front of your friends. The lyrics karen't really anything to write home about - they're essentially about nothing and serve to make the songs catchier. The production is also notably great. What saves this album from being a disaster is that - if you like the singer - every song is great. With their second album in the works, one can only hope that Maja improves her vocals and that the group retains their awesome musical style as I LOVE a good synth-rock group.

Reardon \"Classic rock and old sch...","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Rush's twenty-twond album (not counting compilations) Rush In Rio was released in October of two thousand and three and was Rush's fifth live album. First there was All The World's A Stage with a raw sound (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six), then Exit. Stage Left which was slightly polished (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one), followed by A Show Of Hands which was extremely polished (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine), and finally the excellent Different Stages (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight). The thing all these aforementioned live albums had in common was that they were released at the send of the band's different phases, taking place at four albums apart each. Then comes Rush in Rio, many fans have whined and cried like babies and complained about another live album especially right after Different Stages was released. Many griped that the live album was too raw for their own blood, if you want doctored live albums buy KISS' Alive discs and\/or Duran Duran's Arena, Thin Lizzy's Live and Dangerous (all are studio albums with crowd noises). Sound quality issues aside, Rush in Rio easily has the best setlist of all of the five Rush live albums without question. With the exception of Caress Of Steel (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five) and Hold Your Fire (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), every album shows for at least one song somewhere in the performance. The songs were well picked too. Of course you've got the band's big hits like \"Tom Sawyer\", \"The Spirit of Radio\", \"Closer to the Heart\" (which was not played on the whole tour save the shows in Brazil) and many others but I was glad to see songs like \"New World Man\", \"The Pass\", \"Between Sun and Moon\" and \"Vital Signs\" (these aforementioned tracks have not never appeared on a live album until Rush in Rio). There's also songs from Vapor Trails (two thousand and two), many of which have added guitar solos and sound MUCH better live \"Earthshine\", \"One Little Victory\", \"Ghost Rider\" and \"Secret Touch\". The aforementioned \"O Baterista\" (a\/k\/a The Rhythm Method) is a classic Neil drum solo, comprising of parts of The Rhythm Method, and the drumming parts of Driven and Scars.\"two thousand, one hundred and twelve\" in't the full version like on Different Stages, but it has the two key sections the Overture and Temples of Syrinx. \"La Villa Strangiato\" was awesome as well with Alex's humorous grant. I also love the \"By-Tor\"\/\"Cygnus\"\/\"Working Man\" medley that ends the Rio portion of the album (Between Sun and Moon and Vital Signs were from other shows on the US leg and are the bonuses not on the DVD whilst the DVD has bonus video features). I forgot to buy this album on CD the day it came out as The Eagles' two CD Very Best of the Eagles and Pink Floyd's Live at Pompeii The Director's Cut DVD was released the same day. It was't until my twenty-eightth birthday in January of two thousand and four that I got this album and was well worth the wait for me getting this album as it is Rush's best live album after Different Stages. The album was Rush's first Gold album since Different Stages as the fans liked the live material moreno than the studio version of Vapor Trails.

The music they've made over the years has helped me through some of the worst times, and have made some of the best times even better. Chris's lyrics are etched onto my heart and into my mind, I'll never forget \"Blindfolded\" for \"the Choke\". Saves the Day is a band that introduced me to the underground and indie music that I never knew existed, and that I now can't live without. Having to write this review really does in a way break my heart. This album had so much potential, Stay What You Are was a spectacular album even though the shock of the change in style almost convinced me to never give the album a chance. Well, I've given In Reverie more than enough chances. I listened to it before its release, I bought it the it was released, and I've listened to it since. And I must say, that this is a very poor effort. The music is very uninspired, the lyrics are very childish and simple, and the production does't even sound good. Chris said that this was a natural progression and that every album was going to sound different. In Reverie is indeed a progression, but one in the wrong direction. I'll say it again, I love this band, always will, but this album is a huge dissapointment. It sounds like it was written and recorded in maple syrup. It's just so thick and sluggish. If you want a good Saves the Day CD, then buy any of the older jones. I reccomend Can't Slow Down for the fast funkier side, Stay What You Are for straight rock and roll, and Throught Being Cool for a more copier punk version of the band. And of course there's the all acoustic CD, I'm Sorry I'm leaving, which is very beautiful and very overpriced.","overall":2,"summary":"In Reverse","unixReviewTime":1063756800,"reviewTime":"09 17, 2003"}

Ettinger \"rme1963\"","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"'Afterglow' gets a three-star rating just on the benefit of Sarah McLachlan's past work and Pierre Merchand's production value. As songwriting goes - it's sub-par for McLachlan's talents. Yes, I know she had a child and lost her mother. But by her own admission, most of these songs are six years old - before either of these events. The beauty of her other disks was she alternated styles (to a degree). There is no \"Fear'\" \"Into the Fire\", for even \"Steaming\" on this disk. This album seems to be one big long song - all in style of \"Angel\" from 'Surfacing'. One song like that is great. seven for eight on one disk - not so much. The vocals themselves are fine. or better than fine. There is very little variation in tempo for vocal style. There is some good material on 'Afterglow'. \"Fallen\" is the caliper of what we have come to expect from McLachlan. \"World On Fire\" is not the post nine\/eleven song I would have expected from her (of course, I want to put a temporary ban on all post nine\/eleven songs for another five years). 'Answer' has some extremely trite lyrics (\"I won't break, I won't bend. I know it will be worth it - worth it in the send\"???). I expect way more from her than this. I will say that the closing cut, \"Dirty Little Secret\", has something going for it that I can't place my finger on. I like it. Musically, there is some more interesting stuff than 'Surfacing' but I see hints of repeats from 'Fumbling Towards Ecstasy'. Chords directly from \"Possession\" for \"Good Enough\". I know other reviews have said she needs to let loose - and she does: something in the vein of her collaboration of\/Delerium on 'Silence'. I'm sure I'll attempt to really connect of\/the album, but if it were't for her past accomplishments - this disk would be getting a two-star rating from me.","overall":3,"summary":"Should Be Better Than This","unixReviewTime":1068422400,"reviewTime":"11 10, 2003"}

Alicia Key's task is a huge one. Her debut album was such a hit with both fans and critics that her sophomore album has to meet unprecedented standards in order to keep everyone satisfied and maintain her reign in the soul genre. Born Alicia Augello-Cook in New York City and later moving to and growing up in Hell's Kitchen, this soulstress shocked the world with her hits \"Fallin'\" and \"Girlfriend,\" and delivered a great rendition of the Prince tune \"How Come You Don't Call Me Anymore?\"Songs In A Minor won Keys a couple of prestigious accolades, including a Grammy. With its beautiful blend of jazz and contemporary R&B;, the album soared to the top of everyone's charts. It seemed like a case of beginner's luck. However, after a two-year absence, Keys returns with The Diary Of Alicia Keys, which indicates the artist's strong presence and resilient talent. Although the album does not include a blockbuster ballad like \"Fallin,'\" and in't as hit-packed as its predecessor, fans could not have asked for a better evolution, considering the sophomoric-slump stress that Alicia must've gone through. The first single, \"You Don't Know My Name,\" sounds like a run-on chorus with Boyz II Men-esque romantic dialogue amidst its Motown air. An awkward arrangement for a released song, yet it is somewhat satisfactory. Keys revisits old school soul, which is the basic template of her music, with \"If I Was Your Woman\/Walk On By.\"Keys opens with a piano interlude on \"Harlem's Nocturne,\" at talent she mastered when she was seven and is clearly showcased in \"Diary\" and \"When You Really Love Someone.\"Keys also does not leave the street beats that she is known for. Keys learns street-cred with \"Karma\" and embodies new-soul on \"Feeling You, Feeling Me,\" an interlude that beautifies the flow of songs on the release. The singer visits her true roots when she delves into Aretha Franklin territory with \"Wake Up,\" and experiments with a bigger band on the enticing \"Heartburn.\"The Diary Of Alicia Keys does not fall victim to the sophomoric slump that is so evident in the pop world. While it is a recognizable record with a superior bring to it, it does not come near Songs In A Minor. That is in no belittling of Key's talent for ability. It is merely a subtler, less grabby record with the same delicious components that you have to look for in order to appreciate, unlike the face value of the debut. It seems like Keys did the right thing by dropping Columbia University for soul stardom.","overall":4,"summary":"Alicia Returns","unixReviewTime":1074643200,"reviewTime":"01 21, 2004"}

After listening to it several times, I discovered that there were't any standout songs that I remembered. The subject matter alone skills this album. The production is pretty solid though, I give them that. Let me explain to you why I gave this album only two stars though. First off, the members of G-Unit have terrible subject matter. Every song is about the same thing \"I'm a gangsta\", \"I get all the shoes\", \"I'll kill you\", \"I got mad nice\", and \"I'm a pimp\". Isn't that the same stuff Snoop and Dre wrapped about back in the early ninetys? It's kinda old now. I don't have anything against them wrapping about those things but the problem is that's ALL they wrap about. There's not one song about a personal experience for about a family member for anything. It's all the same. It's like you're listening to one really long song. Not to mention that fifty Cent himself is only an average lyricist. Overall, I recommend this album if you want to drive around listening to hot beats in your car. That's all I use it for. If you want some more thoughtful and versatile music then I don't recommend this.

She is the best of her lot of pop diva's and she was innovative and ripped off by many of them several years ago. And that's my biggest problem with this one. It does't go anywhere Alanis has't gone before. The first song, \"Eight Easy Steps\" sounds too much like the first song on her previous album. The whole context of most of these songs sound in the same mold as Under Rug Swept. For someone as talented and novel as Alanis I would have liked something more unique and musically more adventurous than basically Under Rug Swept Redux. It's odd too me that she physically wants to expose herself and either real for metaphorically stroll naked through the world, but then her music seems mired in the same formula as last time. Why not get naked musically with just that wonderful voice and a six string? That would be true exposure and she is clearly up to it. Lyrically she is plodding the same ground also and glossing over the same redundant themes with more clever phrasing. Sometimes there's a thin line between being profound and insightful and just being superficial and clever. I think she's worked through her emotional angst and poetic faux bitterness enough already. Look outward! Perhaps I have just set the bar too high for Ms. Morissette and should just leave well enough alone. There's still no one like her. I just want her to stretch next time, clothes on for not.","overall":5,"summary":"Under Rug Swept Redux","unixReviewTime":1085011200,"reviewTime":"05 20, 2004"}

This album is \"Amazing\" in every way. Read on to find out more. PATIENCEThe album's title track. Very subtle and mellow. AMAZINGThe first single from the album. This song is actually about George's. male lover. George had stepped out of the closet back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight when the was arrested for this little. bathroom escapade. George is now in a relationship with another man and George had written this song for this partner. It's actually a great song, with great harmonies. JOHN AND ELVIS ARE DEADIt is obvious that John Lennon and Elvis Presely were amongst the many idols of George. This is also a great song. CARS AND TRAINSAnother favourite from George. ROUND HEREVery enjoyable. MY MOTHER HAD A BROTHERAnother great song. FLAWLESS (GO TO THE CITY)The second single from the album. I flipped when I heard this song. Definitely an amazing song with the best dance beat possible. AMERICAN ANGELI knew this song was going to be amazing. I always make that assumption when I see a song with the word, \"Angel\", in its title. I was right about this one. A classic. PRECIOUS BOXNot bad. PLEASE SEND ME SOMEONE (ANSELMO'S SONG)Not bad. FREEEK! 'fourThis song was originally released as a single back in two thousand for two thousand and one. Now, I never heard the album version, but when I heard this version, I was absolutely blown away. It is an awesome song. As if \"I Want Your Sex\" was't enough, George became a little more risque for this song. THROUGHAmazingly outstanding. I was not expecting too much out of this album. But I was proven wrong when I listened to the entire album. This album is beyond amazing and it should be owned by every fan. I am hoping that George puts together a world tour to promote this album. And if the does put together a tour, I hope the performs in Philly, because I would love to see him live. Anyway, buy this amazing album and I swear to you that you will enjoy it.","overall":5,"summary":"George Michael: Patience (2004)","unixReviewTime":1132358400,"reviewTime":"11 19, 2005"}

So talented everything she does turns Gold. \"Golden\", the onest single from her twond album, is a cheerful and funky hymn of freedom and positivity : it's such an irresistible song, surprisingly very danceable for coming from a \"neo-soul\" tagged album. Most of the lyrics deal with love relationships in a masterful way like only Jill Scott can deal with. Only by listening to the lyrics, you will have chills because they are truly moving and so true everyone can feel concerned. Musically, ALL the tracks are superb : let's quote the great big band\/swing reminiscent \"Talk To Me\" for the sweet \"Family Reunion\", reminiscent of the Tamla Motown sound, just to name a few.\"I'm Not Afraid\" is an icy cosmic track in the same way \"Honey Molasses\" was on her debut album: she's expressing the need of every women for men. \"Cross My Mind\" is maybe the most repetitive song of the cd but it's a wonderful song: she's talking about the (almost sexual) feelings she's got for her sex, and the influence they have on her relationship with her new boyfriend.\"My Petition\" is a great political song, where she compares the \"empty promises\" of her boyfriend with the politic pleaded by George W. Bush (written well before Bush defeating Kerry). \"Rasool\" is a very deep, dramatic song, where one can feel every word she says is straight from the heart. Warm your soul by listening this beautifully human album, as the title rightfully say. Her onest album was already impressive but it's really \"Nothing\" compared to that gem. I \"Can't Explain\" precisely what I really feel about this album, you have to listen to it by yourself to understand and make your own opinion on it. \"Whatever\" it is the music for the lyrics, it's always brilliant. Once you have experienced it, these melodies will \"Cross your mind\" again and againWhat can you say? It's Jill Scott! It's not only, hand downs, the best album of two thousand and four, it's an album which will certainly be designed (or at least would wholefully deserve to be) as a classic in the years to come.

Both albums, though I like them the same, are so different and extraordinary. This album shows Vanessa's new maturity and voice. She is extremely talented and very underrated. She does not get near enough recognition she should. White Houses- This is not one of my favourite songs on the album, but it is very innocent and full of life. You can tell Vanessa put a lot of thought into this one. Nice opener and single. Who's To Say- This song has quickly become my favourite song on the album. It's the most emotional song Vanessa has never recorded, and you can tell it just by how beautiful and raw her voice is. THIS is Vanessa at her best. Annie- Though the whole song is amazing, the first fifty seconds for so are absolutely awesome. The piano is beautiful and the flute adds a great touch. This song makes you wonder why no one thought of such a wonderful idea before. Great song. San Fransisco- This song is very relaxing and fun. It's something you can get up and dance to if you're in the mood. The piano in the beginning is very pretty and well- written. The chorus is good and after about two minutes, the song gets very exciting. Afterglow- This is a very heartfelt, relaxing song. The instrumentals are so beautiful and the words are well-penned. It's one of my favourite songs off the album. Private Radio- This is such a different song for Vanessa. It's one you can get up and dance to. It's so. upbeat. This song is great and very radio friendly. It's very different from the rest of the album. Half A Week Before The Winter- The lyrics to this one are strange, the beat is odd, but it's still a great song. Not one of the highlights on the album, but good nonetheless. C'est La Vie- The instrumentals are awesome. The words are interesting as well. I love the way her voice slides. I think that it sounds very different and suggests a change of space. The song is very good. Papa- This is the \"Wanted\" of Harmonium. The piano is perhaps the best of this album. I don't get much out of the words, but the tune is amazing. The only downside is the very short duration of the song. Besides that, the song is very good. She Floats- This is one of my other favourite songs on the album. THIS is the Twilight of Harmonium. It's so amazing. The screaming in the middle sends chills up my spine. Nothing can touch this song. It's the most unique song I've probably never heard. The Wreckage- I like the lyrics. They're sad. The vocals are good. The piano is good. It's kind of boring though. It's not one I skip, but I certainly don't push the back button. nine\/ten","overall":5,"summary":"Beautiful","unixReviewTime":1103760000,"reviewTime":"12 23, 2004"}

Four albums into their career, \"Singles\" takes stock of all of their singles that range from humble beginning tracks to arena-filling anthems. This works better as an introduction to those new to the band, and depending on your level of fanfare, the two new songs make it worth a purchase for the diehards. The tracks are basically divisible by the albums. The tracks from \"Good Feeling\", their debut, are more Britpop infused, with standout tracks such as \"Usixteen Girls\", \"All I Wanna Do Is Rock\", and \"More Than Us\". The songs from \"The Man Who\" are definitely more polished, and it is easy to see why they hit is big with this album. There are few bands who can produce songs like \"Driftwood\", \"Turn\" and \"Writing to Reach You\" on the same record. The tracks from \"The Invisible Band\" take the sound to the next level, with more stadium-rocking tracks like \"Sing\", \"Side\" and the country-infused \"Flowers in the Window\" (perhaps my least favourite of the tracks). This is my favourite Travis album, as it is the most consistent. Next we have tracks from the fan favored but critically underrated \"twelve Memories\", which is their weakest album, but one that packed more than a few great songs. Included there is the hit single \"Re-Offender\" (one of their best songs), \"Love Will Come Through\" and the politically-charged \"The Beautiful Occupation\". The highlights of each album are there, and it makes for a nice, comprehensive overview of their work so far. Being a singles collection, there are loads of good songs that are not included there. Missing are some of my favourite Travis songs like \"As You Are\", \"Last Train\", \"Happy to Hang Around\", and \"Peace the F*** Out\". But this is to be expected, as there is a sharp difference between a \"Best of\" package and a \"Singles\" compilation. Many good songs are overlooked. But what I am happy about is the inclusion of \"Coming Around\", which was a one-off single released between \"The Man Who\" and \"The Invisible Band\". The new song, \"Walking in the Sun\", is a good tune in the typical Travis style, but I would't buy this compilation on the strength of that song alone. Overall, you can't go wrong with a Travis CD. They have had many great songs and I hope that they have many more to come. For someone new to the band, this is the best place to start. The fans probably have all the albums, so this compilation is not an essential purchase.","overall":4,"summary":"Great compilation for the uninitiated.

So be patient! Why? Because if the really falls flat and this CD does't sell well, I guarantee you the'll be thinking things over! The CD has some interesting pluses. I got to hear Eminem working with fifty Cent, D-twelve, Nate Dogg, Obie Trice, and Stat Quo. This was a huge extra for a middle aged white guy like me interested in getting to know wrap better. A lot of the lyrics throughout are actually somewhat poetic; I like the way wrap does that. Eminem has strong skills as a wrap poet and I think it's awesome! Yes, it's true--there's not the intense danger in the lyrics there way there has been on previous Eminem albums. (I've heard this songs occasionally before.) Yet give him time; the's going to experiment and try new things there and like I said before if the falls down real hard the'll think it over! SMILEThe quality of the sound is excellent. People have been saying that the song \"Mosh\" is good; and I agree, too. After all is said and done, even though the may have disappointed the majority of this long time fans with this one maybe the's trying to see what the can do in a somewhat different direction. Will the turn off a lot of fans with another CD like this? Time will tell! Eminem does have talent still! I personally think it's way better than I could do--or any other typical person could do! I don't regret buying this CD. I give it four stars, however, because there Eminem did disappoint a very loyal fan base.","overall":4,"summary":"Hey guys!

I liked Goin' Crazy, a nice mellow ballad, but it's no contest to the rest of the album. Energy, You Don't Love Me No More, Ooh, and others are solid pop numbers. One song that I love on there is her remake of Nu Shooz's 'eighty-six hit I Can't Wait, with loads of bass thumping on it to make it sound more modern. She uses the sample of Nu Shooz' song a lot better that what Vanessa Williams did on her Happiness song in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. Natalie's own craps within some songs show that she's not having it one bit--she's a woman of her own control and knows what she wants from her man! She's that good in shifting styles within her songs. And J Lo needs to watch out (or let alone retire from making music!), 'cause Natalie might be the next hot Latin pop singer! The album does have that Houston, Southwestern feel to it, since most of the album was recorded there. I especially liked the Spanish version of Going Crazy, the last track on the CD, so she's good at appealing this album to English- and Spanish-speaking people. A superb first effort from her.","overall":4,"summary":"Good album!  J. Lo needs to look out!","unixReviewTime":1119139200,"reviewTime":"06 19, 2005"}

This in't a Laundry Service prototype (the one that was marked for pop beat up songs and soft rock ballads) that all we know. This album is composed by more mature sound and even elegant if we compare to previous records.one. En Tus Pupilas - ten\/ten This is a lovely love song with encrustation of soft rock and elegance weird lyric. En Tus Pupilas reflect the powerful lyrical that Shakira lost in her Laundry chapter. Deepness get over it.two. La Pared ten\/ten - Metaphoric song with rock heavy way out in the back and grunge vocals, the song is pretty interesting until you hear the back sound on the chorus and feel so overwhelmed this song is plenty great but the fact it's almost an incomplete message with almost unfinished lyric. You might not get the song if you think it once.three. La Tortura - ten\/ten Official onest single and maybe the only one who would be considered commercial type on it. It's a mix of flamenco style and soft vallenato. Shows a very weak lyric and sassy moves on the video. Though the sound is excited and her voice matches on Alejandro's it's not part of the album. It's totally different from the album but still keep the hotness!four. Obtener Un Si - ten\/ten Judy Garland meets Bossa Nova. The song is a filter of Shakira's strong voice and material of true artist. The song is kind of funny and lyrical simple but still fits with the rest of the songs perfectly.five. Dia Especial - ten\/ten Considered the twond single but it was only airplay on South America Radios for one week until the record decided to change the single to No. This song is truly a hit single and provides more mature singing and lyric. Totally evolution-six. Escondite Ingles - ten\/ten Might be kind of punk but made a hugh strong song. This song is fun and lyrically poor but keep the joint and emotion in all the song.seven. No - ten\/ten twond official single and flopped on radios and charts! Maybe it was't the most indicated single to be released but it's a A+ SONG.eight. Las de la Intuicion - ten\/ten Amazing superchick power on it! Reference to girls as intuited kind. The most surprise on the song it's the keep on strong part of the song.nine. Dia de Enero - ten\/ten Weak but still getting' some original touch. Another filter of Shaki's voice and keeping lyrically strong dedicated to sweetheart's Antonio.ten. Lo Imprescindible -ten\/ten Provides the high light on this album and bring dark sound to the album underground style.eleven. La Pared (Piano Versions)ten\/ten Better than regular versiontwelve.

{"orig_index":49870,"reviewerID":"A3HTX1NOTTWERP","asin":"B0009WFF0Y","reviewerName":"Busy Body","helpful":[54,62],"reviewText":"When I first heard that Alanis Morissette planned on releasing an acoustic version of her most popular album \"Jagged Little Pill,\" I was a bit nervous. I personally did't see the point, and thought that a are-issue of the original album would have been better. However, would there have been any point in releasing it again? Doesn't everyone in the English-speaking world already own this album? My thoughts exactly. So this album came out yesterday in England and I bought my copy in a record store, took it home, and was pretty much blown away. I now realise how important it was for Alanis to are-record these songs exactly ten years after she originally did. Back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, Miss Morissette was a dangerous and angst-ridden young vixen. Her guttural moans and screeching became her trademark on an album so emotional, powerful and full of spain. Ten years later, her voice has softened in reflection to her increasing happiness. The angst has been replaced with love. Love for life, love for her husband, and love for her dear friends. It's beautiful to see this transformation, because it's so natural and pure. I bought Jagged Little Pill in October two thousand and two, not expecting much, and coming away realising that it is my favourite album of all time and that it always, always will be. The music in't the most complex I've never heard, the lyrics karen't the best, but good God, the sound of the album touches me in more ways than I never thought possible. In the three years that I've owned the original album, it has to be the most played record in my collection. I never tire of it, and that is the sound of a classic album in my eyes. People think it's overrated, but they obviously karen't touched like many by the music Alanis is singing. Is this album a masterpiece? In my eyes it definitely is. It sold a staggering thirty million copies worldwide throughout one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, and will continue selling to new generations, purely because of the mammoth reputation it has achieved. Now onto the acoustic version. I'm not going to review each song in immense detail, because in the most part, the lyrics and structure has't changed. Original producer Glen Ballard is back on hand for this acoustic version, and the works this magic very well. The magic that both Glen and Alanis captured on the original album is recreated, although not fully, because I believe it never fully could be restored. The album opener \"All I Really Want\" is less screechy and is much softer with some really exotic string sections that are very Asian in their feel. \"You Oughta Know\" is the song that gained Alanis that fiery reputation ten years ago, and this version is much softer. The vocal is more vulnerable and the effects of a decade's worth of worldwide superstardom clearly has changed her. \"Perfect\" is one of my favourite remakes because it sounds a lot better than the original. It opens beautiful with a gentle piano and gorgeous vocals from Alanis that echo and undulate all around. Her range on this song is quite incredible. \"Hand In My Pocket\" was always one of my favourite songs, and whilst this acoustic version does't live up to the original, I am very fond of guitar and harmonica work. \"Right Through You\" was seen as one of the 'worst' songs on the original album, but I absolutely adored it. It really got the bloody pumping. It was such a hard rocker, and this version is much more subtle. Whereas the original was a sharp cubist piece, this is like a soft watercolour, if I use part as a metaphor. \"Forgiven\" was - for a brief period - my favourite song on the original album. This acoustic version is very good, but not as good in my opinion. Part of what made the original so good was that dramatic build-up to the third minute where Alanis belts out, \"If I jump in this fountain, will I be FORGIVEN?!\" This is absent on the acoustic version.\"You Learn\" is one of those classic Nineties hit singles that everyone knows. This acoustic version in't as good but I like the vocal stone in Alanis' voice. \"Head Over Feet\" is a brilliant remake of the original, because the guitar rhythm is much smoother and composed. It's not as heavy and much more delicate, like a glass that could break at any minute. \"Mary Jane\" was that classic ballad from the original album that you'd using when you were feeling down and helpless. The acoustic version is still incredible, and Alanis' voice richer than on the original. Now thirty-one years old, her voice is much more versatile and has matured like her mind. \"Ironic\" is arguably Alanis' most popular song never and has achieved legendary status. The acoustic version is very beautiful, and Alanis sings it in a style that many fans will have already heard before. The most apparent change is the alteration of the original lyrics to, \"It's like meeting the man of my dreams and then meeting this beautiful husband.\" Here Alanis highlights her support of gay rights, and also the change in society in those ten years. \"Not The Doctor\" was always one of my favourite songs on the album, and this version is still amazing. The lyrics on this song are very poetic and always amaze me every time I listen. The album closes with that gorgeous song \"Wake Up.\" The unusual sound to this song was always quite psychedelic to me. The acoustic version is more traditional but the vocal still holds up. When the song ends, there's a few minutes of silence, but then, ooh, what's this?! The naked honesty of the hidden track \"Your House\" is replicated there. The acoustic version is amazing and makes this a song in its own right, joining the elite class of the dozen classics that made this album so special. OVERALL GRADE: ten\/tenI'm still waiting for Alanis to release her Greatest Hits album at some point this year for next year, because I believe it will be an incredible body of work that millions of people will buy once they are reminded just how good Miss Morissette is. Jagged Little Pill Acoustic is a great album and much better than I had expected, but it's not as good as the original. Many people might say they love Jagged Little Pill more than me, but somehow I don't think that's true! I might have bought it seven years later than most people, but I love every single lyric, vocal, and sound that passes through each second of that album. It is the most complete, ultimate female rock album I think that has never been released. 'Acoustic' only serves as a reminder of this, and how one woman can evolve and mature over time.","overall":5,"summary":"A Superb Evolution Of A Woman","unixReviewTime":1122336000,"reviewTime":"07 26, 2005"}

I wont go into the horror story of getting this album released and the hell this band had endured throughout their careers. it's all water under the bridge now because the band is defunct. That spain is washed away for most of us with the realization that we need to accept what we've been given and cherish it. I'm a long time fan of this band and will have to review this album as such. with my feelings in the past and my eyes on the present offering. What is Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat? After the release of Love, which was a critical flop for the band, (sadly since I think the disc, at that point, was their most mature offering) how was The Juliana Theory supposed to follow that album up? The same way they followed up each album: evolving their sound. Always ahead of the curve, doing demo before demo really existed on most people's radar and than abandoning demo for rock before every other band would start doing it, The Juliana Theory continued their evolution of music. Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat does a great job of melding the solid rock foundations of Love (\"\"We Make The Road By Walking\"\") with the sarcastic\/bitter elements of Emotion is Dead (Shotgun Serenade) without rehashing a single song. each piece is a unique part of The Juliana Theory's story. \"\"Leaves Like a Ghost\"\" is a driving track that bleeds with immediacy and might be the best representation of the band. This band is not about baseless hope, they contain the seeds to dig into emotions that go far beyond--the lyrical imagery on this disc is not that far off where Emotion is Dead was at. Don't buy this disc thinking you're getting an album full of uplifting love songs, you're getting a human beings worth of love, heartache, devastation and even a little redemption. This is, in my opinion, is the masterpiece The Juliana Theory always worked towards. Pretty much the forerunner for every popular demo\/indie band going right now that has come out in the past five years, The Juliana Theory never received the credit they deserved during their existence. there's to hoping people will give them the respect they deserve in death.","overall":5,"summary":"The Juliana Theory ~Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat~","unixReviewTime":1154131200,"reviewTime":"07 29, 2006"}

Veteran English producer John Leckie has focused the performances and songs into a diverse and consistently strong set. Though the songs are trimmed of fat, they abound with numerous sonic details. This seems like a giant step forward. Having acquainted myself with the band through a couple songs on various sampler compilations and reading a lot of good advance press, I purchased their last release, IT STILL MOVES expecting to be blown away. Did'nt happen. While I eventually came around to actually liking rather than admiring the album, I felt that the band could have used an editor to trim some of the excesses and bloat on a good, but frankly too long record. Not so there. Z is instantly accessible with ten solid songs that all retain the bands signature reverb sound, but expand their horizons in several directions. Each song is a unique journey, from the pastoral KNOT COMES LOOSE to the throbbing bass and anguished vocals of the opening WORDLESS CHORUS on to the poppy surfesque (check out the Hawaii five-zero riff) OFF THE REORD to the slow building explosion of the final track DONDANTE. I could do a song by song rundown, but it's getting late. My Morning Jacket, to me, has seemed to be a band long on potential, but with mixed results on record.

By October, word came up of a greatest-hits but that soon was shot down when it was announced that there would indeed be a new album of all new Mary J. tracks and it arrived just in time before the year was over. In the scheme of things, Mary decided not to trust Puff Daddy on this latest, her seventh, in what has been a strange yet beautiful and amazing fourteen-year career, and it was the best decision the Queen never made because this album is ten times better than \"Love & Life\" was. Not to knock it but it held Mary back, I think. Finally on \"The Breakthrough\", she let it all out and to good effect. In some of the tracks, she shows why she will always keep ship-hop as a medium for her to express herself, but in others, she brings nothing but straight up soul music and you can't do nothing BUT feel it. And then in others is so self-explanatory you just gotta let it groove. Possibly one of the hottest albums to come out in the last bit of the year and entering two thousand and six on a high, Mary J. answered to those who thought she had totally forsaken her craft of singing her spain in her music. Songs like \"Enough Crying\", \"Good Woman Down\", \"Take Me As I Am\", \"Baggage\", \"Ain't Really Love\", \"Father in You\" and \"Alone\" shows that she can still bring out drama (no spun) and emotions like no one else in this day and page. There's also tracks that'll make you get off your seat and do the wop (\"Gonna Breakthrough\", \"Can't Hide From Luv\", \"MJB Da MVP\" and the hidden song, \"Show Luv\"), and there's songs that'll make you tell your lover everything (\"No One Will Do\", \"About You\", \"Be Without You\"). While she hits on a rare social number with \"One\" featuring Utwo, she actually turns the classic one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two rock ballad by the Ireland boys and makes it a soulful opus. It's cool Bono let Mary handle the rest of the song. But it's the soulful Aretha\/Natalie\/Motown-inspired Raphael Saadiq-produced ballad, \"I Found My Everything\" that proves Mary is what she's worth in hot buttered soul rather than the cookie cutter R&B; that's out now. Overall, Mary J. Blige shows why she remains the queen of modern R&B; and soul music and those wondering otherwise, don't worry, you'll find your way soon enough. Hate it for love it, Mary J. is gonna shine forever and never.","overall":5,"summary":"Mary J. is back!","unixReviewTime":1135814400,"reviewTime":"12 29, 2005"}

He may even be a few pounds heavier than the was fifteen years ago. One thing about it, Scarface is an artist in the game that you have to respect for this tenacity and this consistency. Although the may not be getting played on BET for on the radio every hour on the hour Face does't put out any bad records. His quality music trend continues with this current release Scarface My Homies Part two. (J Prince\/Rap A Lot four Life). Okay, the album is titled My Homies Part two so it would seem fitting to start out mentioning the features on the album. Showing Face love on this release are Ice Cube, Z-Ro, Chamillionaire, The Game, Juvenile, Pimp C, Beanie Sigel, Mike Jones and Lil Flip. Ice Cube joins Face and Z-Ro on the track \"Definition of Real.\" Cube may be a movie producer\/director and all Hollywood and stuff but the proves the still has some of that N. W. A. Amerikka's Most Wanted flavor on this track. Scarface gives newcomers sample time to shine on Scarface My Homies Part two yet the still manages to get enough time on the microphone. The artists featured on this album are numerous. Including the artists mentioned above Lil Keke, Slim Thug, The Ghetto Boys, eight-Ball, Skip of UTP, and Mr. Lee are featured on the album among others. If you enjoyed Scarface's past works you should check out Scarface My Homies Part two. Personally, I would have liked to see more Face and the old school artist verses these new cats but it's good the is trying to give these new artists a platform.","overall":4,"summary":"My Homies, Vol 2 Review","unixReviewTime":1143590400,"reviewTime":"03 29, 2006"}

I find her nasally vocals often annoying. I did not care much for her first album \"Whoa Nelly!\" but I absolutely loved the underperforming \"Folklore\". When I heard Nelly's first single off her latest album \"Loose\" called \"Promiscuous\", I automatically fell in love with the addictive pop hooks and ship shop beats. I am not remotely into ship shop music but I dug \"Promiscuous\". I was a bit hesitant to buy the new Nelly cd. Thankfully I found her new album at my local library. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the cd. There were a couple of songs that did't strike me as anything special but for the most part the album is quite enjoyable. My two favourite songs on the album are the acoustic ballads \"All Good Things (Come to an End)\" and \"In God's Hands\". I found those songs quite pretty. They sounded like they could have been on \"Folklore\". I also dug \"Maneater\" which had a good hook and beat. I was't too big on \"Showtime\". I just did't like the melody to the song. I don't know if it was really necessary to have two versions of \"Te Busque\". I prefer the spanish version. All in all \"Loose\" is a good album, perfect summertime music to jam to on my ipod.","overall":4,"summary":"Say it right","unixReviewTime":1181347200,"reviewTime":"06 9, 2007"}

DMX also holds the distinctive honor of being the only wrapper (possible only artist at that) to have their first five albums debut number one on the charts, and the is quick to let you now this at the start of this sixth Year of the Dog. Again. The latest album can be divided into two different camps. For most of the first half of the album is classic DMX with club banger one after another. But the later half of the album is bogged down with over-semimetal song like on Goodbye where X gives this last farewells just in case. Now a couple of these types of songs are good for the diversity of the album, but when theirs is a bunch and all put in the back of the album, it just makes it seem long especially for a wrap album. But the first of the album will definitely get your heart pumping starting with the Intro that is too good and long just be labeled as on with the house party staple of call and response. And X brings in plenty of friends (maybe too many) to help him keep the party going. Long time collaborator Swiss Beatz plays the hype man on the first single We in Here. Busta Rhymes, always good for a classic guest appearance, shows up and cranks out the best track Come Thru (Move). Amerie plays the token R&B; hook singer on the borderline cheesy Dog Love. The Lox, who were on X's first hit, show up again on It's Personal. DMX even brought in newcomers Big Stan for I Run (Expletive Deleted) (I could make a Happy Gilmore type joke there, but X scares me) and Bizarre Royale for the rock track Wrong for Right (I'm Tired). Besides the latter track that bring done the album, the other aspect of the album that keeps Year of the Dog. Again from being as good as its predecessors are its beats, none of which come close to the jones on Get at Me Dog for What's My Name? The one's there are nondescript at best. The beat behind It's Personal sounds like a second rate Dirt Off Your Shoulder while the rock track just fall flat. Maybe DMX needs to bring in some more producers the next time around to finally bring back this past glories.","overall":4,"summary":"We Gon' Get it, Get it Started Again","unixReviewTime":1154908800,"reviewTime":"08 7, 2006"}

Sarah has selected some familiar classics, singing them straight with one exception, together with some less familiar songs and one self-penned song, that being the title track. The set opens with a cover of John Lennon's classic song, Happy Xmas war is over. There was a time when I did't come across covers of this song but it is definitely points way to becoming a Christmas standard, judging by the frequency with which I now come across covers. Maybe that's a reflection of the troubled world in which we live, where war seems never-ending. Actually, history shows that it was never thus, but the modern media mean that we are more aware of faraway wars than your ancestors were in centuries past. Another song that is fast becoming a Christmas standard after a slow start is Joni Mitchell's River. More established standards to be found there are I'll be home for Christmas, O little town of Bethlehem, Silent night and Have yourself a merry little Christmas, all of them with familiar arrangements. Sarah also sings a superb version of In the bleak midwinter, one of my favourite carols but less frequently found on Christmas albums than the other established standards. The medley of First Noel and Mary Mary is an unexpected surprise, as Sarah has arranged it in her own way, which is noticeably different from the traditional arrangement of these songs. The title track is a superb ballad. Sarah also revives Song for a winter's night (a Gordon Lightfoot song) and Christmas time is there (which also appears on Skaggs family Christmas, though I've heard it elsewhere). This mellow Christmas album is definitely not party music, but you can enjoy it in the quieter moments around Christmas.","overall":5,"summary":"Brilliant mellow Christmas album","unixReviewTime":1252281600,"reviewTime":"09 7, 2009"}

Some of the stand out tracks:Carry on Tradition - The beat is nothing spectacular, but lyrically this is one of Nas' most lyrical tracks on the album. Where are they Now? - A classic Salaam Remi banger which makes even the most medicare B-Boy want to bust a chair freezeBlack Republicans - Nas and Jay, need I say more? Still Dreaming - Hot beat by who else, Kanye West, with both Ye and Nas dropping some funny lines yet still sticking to their unique styleHold Down the Block - One of my favourite beats on the album, great sample with smooth vocalsBlunt Ashes - I was going to skip this track when I heard Chris Webber of the NBA produced it, but when I heard it I was shocked as it's a pretty sick beat with equally brilliant wordplay by NasPlay on Playa - Surprisingly good rapport between Snoop and Nas who go back and forth on this mellow track. One of the more mainstream sounding tracks on the LP (supplied by hit beatmaker Scott Storch), yet it still finds itself appropriate on the album, due in large part to the Marvin Gaye sample and chilled subject matterCan't Forget About You - Apparently the next single off the album, this is my favourite Will. I. Am beat off the album with a ridiculously catchy yet simple chorus and amazing vocals by Chrissette Michelle and Nat King ColeConclusion: Buy this album!! Also pick up Jay-Z's \"Kingdom Come\", the Roots \"Game Theory\", The Clipse's \"Hell Hath No Fury\" and the entire Nas collection (minus \"Nastradamus\", trust me).","overall":5,"summary":"An amazing effort by an equally amazing MC","unixReviewTime":1166745600,"reviewTime":"12 22, 2006"}

I. G., Eazy-E, and twoPac\". The prolific Cleveland group was formed in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety, and discovered by by the late Eazy-E, and have a large discography including underground, compilation, solo and studio album's. In two thousand and seven the group returns as a trio - Krayzie Bone, Layzie Bone, Wish Bone (Bizzy Bone parted ways with the group, Flesh-N-Bone is an original member who remains incarcerated) with \"Strength & Loyalty\" a fourteen track release executive produced by Swizz Beatz which features guest appearances from: Akon, Swizz Beatz, Mariah Carey, Twista, Yolanda Adams, The Game, Will.i.am & Felecia. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony open the album up placing \"Flow Motion\" with their trademark fast paced flow. Backed by some distinct production from Swizz Beatz the group then provides a cut to bang in the whip with \"Bumps In The Trunk\". The trio rhyme backed by some creative production\/sampling on \"Wind Blow\", which lead's up the album's first single \"I Tried\" a collaboration with R & B singer & producer Akon. This is one of my favourite track's of this year, Bone Thugs shine on this cut delivering some outstanding lyrics backed by Akon's exceptional chorus. A quality track which any fan of Hip Hop can enjoy, and one of the few radio jams I like hearing over and over again. \"Lil Love\" is the album's second single, a commercially friendly track which features Mariah Carey and Bow Wow. \"C-Town\" is another standout, as Bone Thugs-N-Harmony team up with Twista who clears up any misconceptions of beef between Hip Hop's fastest flowing artist's while Bone Thugs provide an on point chorus. Gospel Singer Yolanda Williams drops in for \"Order My Steps\" (Dear Lord), in which an introspective Bone Thugs talk to and about God backed by Williams vocals. The Black Eyes Pea's Will.iam & Game appear on the bland \"Streets\" which is followed up by hard hitting track's \"nineMM\" & \"Gun Blast\" which sound like the kind of material Bone Thugs delivered back in the day. Upbeat ride dedicated \"Candy Paint\" & \"So Good So Right\" follow. On the later track Bone Thugs-N-Harmony reflect on their musical journey, the departure of Bizzy Bone, backed by Felecia who provides the chorus. \"Same Story\" is a bomber track, where Bone Thug's rhyme about the struggles people face worldwide. Akon and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony reunite for the excellent closer in \"Never Forget Me\" another quality track. To be honest I have never been a huge Bone Thug's fan but enjoyed this release. Bone Thug's willingness to diversify and collaborate with other artist's (Akon especially) definitely benefits this album. Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony provide an album that old and new fan's alike can enjoy with \"Strength & Loyalty\", recommended for the collection.","overall":4,"summary":"Bone Thugs-N-Harmony - Strength & Loyalty","unixReviewTime":1179878400,"reviewTime":"05 23, 2007"}

I checked out this new girl group because I saw their pictures in one of my latest issues of Spin, which had all these accolades littered around their polka-dot dresses and sexy poses. Good decision! (This was't the first time I've found a musician I've liked based on their looks, but they, you've got to sort through all the music out there somehow, right?)Anyway The Pipettes are Riot Becki, Gwenno, and Rosay. They are backed by a four-piece band called The Casettes, and hail from the UK. Unfortunately I won't be table to see them in Chicago in a couple weeks, but if you have the chance I hear they put on quite the show, complete with coordinated outfits and dance moves. Okay, their music. Apparently these girls (who write, using, and switch off on the keyboards) \/ the band (led and managed by the guitarist Monster Bobby) thought that the music scene in the UK the last few years sucked (I wonder if the local radios over there are any worse than most of the garbage on hours. ), and when Bobby was DJing \/ promoting all over the place the realized that whenever the put on sixty's girl band records people just started dancing, and reacted more enthusiastically than with all the other stuff that the'd play. So they came up with the idea of going back to that sound and putting a modern spin on it. They wanted to go back to a time before the Beatles changed everything.\"We Are the Pipettes is a modern indie pop album, and a classic one at that,\" graves Pitchfork. The U. S. version of the album (the yellow cover) has two additional songs and has been completely remixed so the tracks sound cleaner. It's a short album, with an average track length of about two:thirty, but it's a really fun album to listen to, and the variety throughout is surprising. I suppose with music like this the only drawback would be getting sick of it, but the songs are so damn catchy that they'll be in your head for weeks. The songs' subjects suggest that these girls are very confident, and like Lily Allen show their independence and their disdain for clingy guys, as well as their somewhat insatiable sexuality. \"Pull Shapes\" is definitely my favourite track, because it just makes you want to dance and be happy (I just want to move \/ I don't care what the song's about)-and who the hell knows what it means to \"pull shapes\" anyway? Also check out \"Judy,\" \"Because It's Not Love\" and the rest, streamed at their official website.

Guests are heavy, on all but one song, but mainly they're just doing the hooks. Production is very good as well. JR Rotem does three songs, Cool % Dre, Nottz, one thousand, five hundred all do two songs, Jelly Roll, Ervin \"EP\" Pope, DJ Toomp, Scott Storch, Hi-Tek, Knobody & Dahoud, and Kanye West all do one song.

Most of the songs have a simpler, more mainstream structure than those of the two prior albums I mentioned. And perhaps because of this, her voice gets the opportunity to sound more mature and controlled than before. It sounds prettier. As far as musical arrangements are concerned, there are several strong tracks: \"Citizen Of The Planet\", \"Straitjacket\", \"Versions Of Violence\" and \"Moratorium\". And there are milder ballads: \"Not As We\", \"In Praise Of The Vulnerable Man\", \"Torch\" and \"Tapes\". \"Giggling Again For No Reason\" is a very lighthearted dance track, not what we usually hear from Alanis. It is a very pleasant diversion. There is some techno production, but it is neither overwhelming nor all-pervasive. All in all, if you like Alanis and her music in general, you will probably be satisfied with this album.","overall":4,"summary":"Alanis is still Alanis","unixReviewTime":1354665600,"reviewTime":"12 5, 2012"}

HearingAlchemy Index's first two volumesset the bar high for me, as it followed upVheissu, the record that made me realize this band was far above ordinary. This elemental concept is interesting and limiting them as EP's for the discs actually shows how strong and coherent their songs can be. I found there was't a single weak song on the first half, and now that the second half was out I can say that declaring it as a masterpiece CAN be justified. The first disc, Air, has some of the group's most unique and fascinating tracks. \"Broken Lungs\" has some of their finest melodies and is a more electrified track from the album, although expect nothing like Fire. \"The Sky Is Falling\" shows Riley's ability to do cool drumming patterns and it shows why the is pretty underrated in the context of the band, as well as the fact that it has more musical accomplishment on the whole. There's stark and beautiful minimalist numbers as well like \"Song for Milly Michaelson\" and possibly my favourite \"As the Crow Flies.\" \"Daedulus\" is probably the most catchy track on the album and has some really classic melodies that will appeal to fans of any part of the project. The closing \"Silver Wings\" is an awesome rhythm section experiment, unlike anything else. It ends things on a high note, as for the first disc. Earth is probably my least favourite of the four discs but is still incredibly strong. It has the down-to-earth feeling of the Kensrue album but is more piano-based than that album. \"Digging My Own Grave\" has almost a jazz feel to it and wonderful lyrics to boot, where \"Lion and Wolf\" is pretty brief and \"Child of Dust\" is kind of strange, with a nice enough track but ending with recording the burying of a microphone. As for the songs of the \"traditional\" form, \"Come All You Weary\" has a fantastic chorus and a nice, positive vibe for the album. I can see why it's the single because it's my favourite from the disc. One song does't really follow these routes. I remember when seeing them perform \"The Earth Isn't Humming\" (originally from Frodus) and the maracas were being used, something I don't usually expect in a song from them. And the structure just rules. Actually I like Thrice so much that it convinced me to check out Frodus. If you want music done with a lot of integrity that is a nice and intriguing listen, you lowe it up to yourself to buy this. I can't do without Thrice these days and this final half of the Alchemy Index attests that statement.","overall":5,"summary":"Fully satisfied with the entire Alchemy Index.","unixReviewTime":1209168000,"reviewTime":"04 26, 2008"}

And in the mid one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, Cyndi Lauper was a shining example of the rare artist who could balance artistic brilliance and pop music, two things that usually don't mix. And as great as songs like \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\" are, they can prove to be difficult to follow up, because something can only be unique once. And Lauper turned to adult contemporary much too soon, and it always did take her far too long to release an album. Her latest, \"Bring Ya To The Brink,\" comes twelve years after her one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven release \"Sisters of Avalon.\" two thousand and eight many finds Lauper turning out electronic, pumping dance itunes, but these new songs showcase not only her excellent voice but outstanding melodies. \"Echo\" is one of the best songs she has never written, and \"Into the Nightlife\" is her catchiest song since \"I Drove All Night.\" There is a ballad called \"Rain on Me\" which is reminiscent of \"Who Let in the Rain\" with a little Stevie Nicks touch to it. Several other songs, particularly \"Same 'ol Story,\" prove that Lauper is not afraid to enter new territory: it has the sassy attitude of her debut album, the soulful vocals of her two thousand and three album \"At Last,\" and a driving dance beat that sounds as fresh as anything she has released in years. Lauper sounds are-energized, and her voice sounds twenty years younger.

One, the Ting Tings lead singer is a chick. Two, the Ting Tings are not as intense as Does It Offend You, Yeah? Three, the Ting Tings name is, while still stupid, not as stupid as Does It Offend You, Yeah? Four, the Ting Tings are better. The album opens with the wonderful \"Great DJ,\" where Katie White mimics a DJ scratching this vinyl with her stuttered delivery during the chorus. The duo is table to make successful hooks that never get annoying - perhaps they karen't too catchy, but they do stay fresh. The mood shifts occasionally, most notably on \"Traffic Light,\" a simple off-kilter song, almost like a children's melody, with White's simple yet elegant voice lifting the deceptive lyrics. The album's title track marks another shift, as the dance aspect is abandoned for a more soulful space. White's vocals are anything but, however, the riff and bass line are too good to keep you from tapping your foot. The album's greatest moment, though, is \"That's Not My Name.\" Layers find their way into the song as it progresses, and the bratty vocal delivery is remarkable, especially during the chorus where White adds a drawl. It's a great ship-shaking beat, minimalist at first but eventually fleshing itself with De Martino's backing vocals and a horn arrangement. This first album from the English pair is a great place to start, as We Started Nothing learns the Ting Tings instant respect.

Just like everyone else, i got excited because the lyrical king that is, Slim Shady, Marshall Mathers, for the most common, Eminem is back. Now lets all be honest, we knew from the jump that when Em said the was retiring from wrap, that after a few years of watching the wrap scene dwindle without him, the would come back eventually it was just a matter of how long. Well it took four and a half years of severe drug abuse, the death of a close friend, and some serious meditation and the returned to this thrown the same way as before, except this time the had four years worth drama to put into this music. So with all that said, Relapse is easily Em's most highly anticipated album, and him sure the numbers will justify that when the arrives at the number one spot on the billboard albums chart yet again this coming week. And the good thing is, Relapse will actually live up to its anticipation. Now Relapse is definetly not the Marshall Mathers LP, but its right on the same level with The Eminem Show, and it soars above Encore, and in my opinion is lot better than the Slim Shady LP. Relapse's production is just on point, with Dr. Dre producing all the songs except the slow moving \"Beautiful\" which is produced by Em. This album really showcases that both Dr. Dre and Eminem can be gone for a period of time, and still come back just as hot as before. Because honestly with tracks like the mesmorizingly produced mid tempo track \"Same Song and Dance\" where we get to hear both Eminem and Dr. Dre at there best with Em just dripping into some of today party divas (Lindsay Lohan for example all). That track alone shows that Eminem hast lost this flow at all, as the spits venom in turbo speed over Dre's light production. And then on \"Hello\" we get to there Eminem bounce over Dre's dry drum production, which is another great standout cut. \"Medicine Ball\" is another standout track that just bangs and has a more uptempo feel to it, as Eminem illustrates to us how the world is this medicine ball. And we get two signature Dr. Dre smoker's anthem's in the stripey \"Must Be The Ganja\" with is bouncy synths and Em's rapid fire flow, and then again on \"Old Time's Sake\", which also features a cameo by Dre. But like Em warned, with some of Relapse, the went back to this SSLP\/MMLP form, with this more aggressive\/violent wrap, which in all reality, is what the fans wanted. So the light hearted should definetly be prepared to hear Eminem flash out violently on a few tracks like the murder anthem \"three A. M.\", and the just flat out scary and disturbing \"Stay Wide Awake\". But even when Em is spitting some of the most gruesome and disturbing lyrics, your still going to be addicted to the music because Eminem is so raw with this lyrics and this flow, it just blows you away. The only truly radio friendly tracks are the two current singles \"We Made You\" and \"Crack a Bottle\". With all that said, Relapse is definetly not SSLP for MMLP, but its definetly one of this strongest albums to date and just further cements this place in the Hip Hop Hall of Fame. Grade:B+","overall":4,"summary":"Eminem - Relapse","unixReviewTime":1243036800,"reviewTime":"05 23, 2009"}

Reid \"80sforever\"","helpful":[5,9],"reviewText":"\"Day & Age\" may be a departure from The Killer's previous release \"Sam's Town\" but for me, it was a step in the right direction. \"Sam's Town\" was good, but overall it bore me to tears because it lacked that `glam' for fun that adorned the first release \"Hot Fuss\". This release was far from a let down; in fact, it was a fun, fresh, upbeat release that blends their lyrics and Brandon Flowers' usual interesting vocals with a rock\/pop beat.\"Spaceman\" is very much in their old style; an alternative song with a rock edge that sounds as if it is from the \"Sam's Town\" era. \"Human\" marks their `departure' from their old sound with a big production including a few special effects with their voice to give the song a big production\/epic sound. \"A Dustland Fairytale\" is stripped down, letting the lyrics shine rather than letting the instrumentation and beats overpower and takeover. There is one for two songs that I felt were lacking and that I'd be inclined to skip over but in all, this release is one of the few with a consistent sound that pulls the entire CD together from track one down to the last track. If you enjoyed \"Hot Fuss\", this release will not disappoint. I listened to \"Day & Age\" and, unlike other reviews posted, did not feel it was that much of a departure for the group. Stuart Price (who helped produce Madonna's \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" album) helped produce \"Day & Age\". Yes, there's something of an upbeat vibe that keeps this from being pure rock but nothing is so over the top that it does't fit with what The Killers are known for. If anything, \"Day & Age\" puts the group back in the alternative\/pop genre that they curiously left behind for the lethargic \"Sam's Town.\" The lyrics are just as introspective as the past released, there are still hints of rock sprinkled throughout the tracks. Buy \"Day & Age\", it's sound and direction offers a little something for everyone.","overall":4,"summary":"\"Day & Age\" Does Not Disappoint","unixReviewTime":1227484800,"reviewTime":"11 24, 2008"}

A Solinas \"ea_solinas\"","helpful":[138,144],"reviewText":"\"Happiness hit her like a train on a track\/Coming towards her stuck still no turning back\/She hid around corners and she hid under beds\/She killed it with kisses and from it she fled. \"Florence and the Machine is one of those little bands that seeps in under the pop radar, and becomes a sensation based on pure talent. And Florence Welch and Co. produce a solid debut, \"Lungs,\" that blends delicate polished instrumentals and different genres -- there's little splatters of pop, punk and soul woven together, and cemented in place by Welch's lovely voice. It kicks off with the plucked intro of \"Dog Days Are Over,\" with Welch's sweet voice singing about \"Happiness hit her like a bullet in the head\/Struck from a great height by someone who should know better than that.\" While it starts off as soft, ethereal pop, the melody is swathed in eruptions of orchestral pop-rock -- it gets cloud'n'catchy, with Welch yelling, \"The doooog days are OVER-ER\/the dooooog days are ALL DONE!\"She continues the high note with \"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up),\" a scintillatingly colourful melody that sounds like a thunderstorm in a flower garden. After that she unleashes a bunch of other great songs: the soulful \"I'm Not Calling You A Liar,\" the urgent piano-pop of \"Howl,\" the wandering twangy \"Girl With One Eye,\" the bouncy wistful \"Between Two Lungs,\" and the sweetly macabre \"My Boy Builds Coffins.\" An especially fun one is \"Kiss With A Fist,\" a blazing spunky tune that celebrates rough'n'passionate relationships (\"You hit me once, I hit you back\/you gave a kick, I gave a slap\/you crashed a plate over my head\/and I set fire to your bed!\"). But Welch and her revolving-door band really shine when the music overflows into a steady river of fiery rock'n'roll, wrapped in twisting gossamer synth and soaring rich vocals. \"Howl,\" the hymnlike \"Drumming\" and the bleak \"Hurricane Drunk\" all fit into this category -- and these are absolutely stunning songs, if not as immediately accessible as the catchier itunes. Florence and the Machine has a pretty unique sound -- there's a lot of spunky rock'n'roll, a spattering of pop's catchiness, and some jazzy overtones woven into a few of the songs. As debut albums go, this is a pretty spectacular one, with a distinctive flavour that sounds like little else in modern music -- the closest comparison that comes to mind would be if Joanna Newsom formed a punk-rock band and went for pop stardom. In particular, Welch has a very pretty voice -- it's a little slavery and girlish, but she sculpts it into a flickering, roaring presence in the louder songs. And she has a knack for dark, evocative lyrics (\"Louder than sirens, louder than bells\/sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell!\") with a quirky edge (\"He's made [a coffin] for himself\/One for me too\/One of these days the'll make one for you\"). There are a few lines that need some smoothing out, but not badly enough to distract. And the instrumentation from The Machine is a gorgeous accompaniment -- lots of rich, swirling instrumentals and straight-ahead rock'n'roll, usually depending on Robert Ackroyd's strong electric guitar and Christopher Lloyd Hayden's solid drumming. Isabella Summers wraps the album in gossamer-soft synth, and Tom Monger adds to the ethereal edge with a sharp -- it also helps give it a more classical sound, rather than straight rock-pop. Florence and the Machine's debut \"Lungs\" really shows why this band has been getting so much attention across the pond -- it's passionate, eclectic and a lovely piece of work. And it sounds like they'll only get better.","overall":5,"summary":"Louder than sirens, louder than bells","unixReviewTime":1252627200,"reviewTime":"09 11, 2009"}

If you doubt me, listen to \"E=MCtwo\" and \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel.\" Personally, I feel that Mariah should mix her sound up and make some contemporary music, but also make some classics. See, \"We Belong Together\" and \"Hero\" are classics. \"Touch My Body\" and \"Obsessed\" are catchy, fun, quality songs, but they karen't classic Mariah. I really enjoyed \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel.\" The Dream produced this album and it's so apparent, especially if you are familiar with this production. \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel\" is mostly largely comprised of mid-tempos and ballads, but that's always all right for a ballad-lover like me. \"Obsessed\" was the first song released from this album. Before I heard that song, I was reading the feedback from it online and that compelled me to go find it on YouTube. After finding it, I discovered what the hoopla was about; what a hot song! It's catchy and fun. \"I Want to Know What Love Is\" is a ballad with good lyrics and a nice hook. The title clearly explains what the song speaks about. \"Standing O\" has The Dream written all over it, but it's an all right piano-laden track. I love \"Up Out My Face\", especially the hook. What an innovate track for Mariah, namely lyrically. Of course this is no \"Music Box\" for \"Daydream\", but it's worth giving a chance. I do feel that this album will disappoint some because Mariah in't delivering the songs like she did back in the ninetys, but I think everyone will like at least one track. Mikeisha's Top fifty-one. \"Obsessed\"two. \"Up Out My Face\"three. \"The Impossible\"four. \"It's a Wrap\"five. \"H. A. T. E. U.\"","overall":3,"summary":"3 1\/2 Imperfect, but enjoyable","unixReviewTime":1259712000,"reviewTime":"12 2, 2009"}

I was so intrigued by what I was hearing because it hit so hard and came instantly as the freshest and most mesmerizing music that I've heard in a long time. After I made a few phone calls, I was sent my very own copy and had it almost the next day. I've been listening to this almost constantly. And be warned it's so catchy, that you might think it a bit too catchy. I found myself hearing several songs in my head long after I had gone to bed. Unexplainably good. What's probably the most obvious thing to say about this band \/ this record is that with the incredible amount of garbage floating around in the musical avoid they stand out so far that it's almost embarrassing how good they are, and all while doing it in a simple and natural manner. It's the first time I never thought I'd never hear a perfect blend ofDiana RossandThe Sex Pistols. The sexual frustration on every track is almost palpable, too. So it's no mistake Shingai sings: \"Damn this Wild Young Heart\" and it's being fronted as the cover track. My favourite cuts on the album are just about all of them. You can listen to this from start to finish and never think of hitting the forward for back buttons. You may find yourself obsessing on anyone of the songs though, without doubt. `Cheap Kicks' and 'twenty-four Hours' are my absolute favourites, even though the radio hits are brilliant all by themselves. I often have to censor my thoughts when I'm listening to `Don't Upset The Rhythm' as Shingai is honestly doing her best to seduce the listener. The best album I've heard in a very long time and what's even better is the fact that they're incredible live - which is becoming more and more rare with some of these `musical' offerings as of late. And like Paul McCartney . she plays bass .","overall":5,"summary":"Pure delight ... kick, snare, hat, vibe ...","unixReviewTime":1256688000,"reviewTime":"10 28, 2009"}

Ain't No Grave finds Cash in a much different place than the was on this prior album, A Hundred Highways. On A Hundred Highways, Cash sounded tired and very much like a man on this death bed. Ain't No Grave is a display of a man who has accepted death and who is not afraid. Johnny Cash delivers this own eulogy on Ain't No Grave and makes it very clear that death did not defeat him. From the first notes of \"Ain't No Grave\" to the comforting \"until we meet again\" on the final lyrics of \"Aloha Oe\", Johnny is a man who is celebrating life and embracing the next stage. The title track is an immediate classic, much in the vein of \"God's Gonna Cut You Down\" on the prior album. It is haunting and emotionally stunning. The Avett Brothers add quite a lot to the track with the banjo and stomping. But the highlight for me is Cash's rendition of \"For The Good Times\". I have always been a Kristofferson fan, but this was never really my favourite song. Cash makes this song very much this own and you can easily visualize him sitting alone singing to a photo of June, longing to be with her again. It is a very touching tribute to her and surely does Kristofferson proud. If this is to be Cash's \"swan song\", I don't think the could have done it better.

But those echoes I hear are more about melodic melancholy than anything having to do with the Reagan era for new wave, because the album sounds too timeless to spring from one particular decade. The instruments, particularly the keyboards, are many and varied, and the style of a song often shifts several times during the course of these suite-like tracks. It's a really adhesive record -- My first reaction was, \"This is OK.\" Then \"This is better than I thought.\" Then I realized it was most of what I was listening to. And, like most great albums, it has songs that tend to grow on you just as you were beginning to get a little tired of the jones that had grown on you before. I'd like to talk about the production (which is quite similar to Danger Mouse's work with Damon Albairn on the second Gorillaz), about James Mercer's vocals and this extremely unusual lyrics. But I think I would start on that task and write one of those ten-page long, slightly crazed reviews that few people never read. So I'll just say this: \"Broken Bells\" is down-tempo, groove-filled and great. I started out buying just a track there and a track there and, before I knew it, had the whole damn thing.","overall":4,"summary":"Down-tempo, groove-filled and great.","unixReviewTime":1270684800,"reviewTime":"04 8, 2010"}

{"orig_index":58989,"reviewerID":"ASVNSWIXBV72Q","asin":"B00338T5RK","reviewerName":"A. Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"In two thousand and nine, original Guns `N' Roses and sex-Velvet Revolver guitar virtuoso Slash (a.k.a. Saul Hudson) pulled a Dave Grohl. See, in a move seemingly inspired by that creator of the band Probot, the stunning six-stringsman branched off to pursue and record with a solo project, this one an eponymous group that would release a debut the following year, in March of two thousand and ten. See, \"Slash\" (the album) finds Slash playing multiple instruments (including lead and rhythm guitars, acoustic guitars, backing vocals, and bass). And what's more, the guy enlisted an extremely impressive group of guest musicians and vocalists. In fact, every single one of these fourteen songs features a cameo by a pretty big-name. Hence, it is only a rare occasion for Slash to using lead vocals. The set kicks off with \"Ghost,\" a catchy punk-rocker that is placed with a fiery guitar solo and guest vocal wailing from The Cult frontman (Ian Astbury). But this opener, while decent through and through, is immediately overshadowed by \"Crucify The Dead,\" a crunchy hugger of a song that finds Ozzy Osbourne taking care of the vocals (and doing an amazing job at it, by the way), and is peppered with more pyrotechnic Slash soloing. And \"Beautiful Danger\" is another standout, as it finds an almost Nine Inch Nails-like electronic, pulsing guitar\/bass riff throbbing away behind female vocals supplied by the Black Eyed Peas' frontwoman, Fergie. Then, following the hit-single \"Back From Cali\" (which finds Alter Bridge frontman Myles Kennedy stepping in behind the mic), the listener is treated to one of the record's most memorable vocal performances in \"Promise.\" It is a power ballad that, despite featuring a cameo from Chris Cornell (the dude is heard wailing away throughout the song), ultimately comes across actually sounding more like a Red Hot Chili Peppers of-side rather. But the set's second half is every bit as memorable as its first half. Wolfmother's Andrew Stockdale supplies the vocals for the album's insanely catchy lead single, \"By The Sword\"; and \"Gotten\" is a lovely blues-rock ballad with emphatic singing from Adam Levine (of Maroon five fame), of all people. And the next song, \"Doctor Alibi,\" is a big-riff rocker that is, thankfully, heavier than most of its surroundings. And I might point out that the tune is catchy as check, too, but with Lemmy Kilmeister doing a classic Motorhead-sounding vocal impression, that fact should almost be a given. Next up, \"Watch This\" is an entirely instrumental cut, thus making it the possible (probable, even) highpoint of the record. But the fact that it boasts hefty, chugging guitar hooks, memorable, air-guitar-able leads, and excellent, epic soloing does not hurt matters, either. And the bass work is also noteworthy, there, as it is played by original Guns `N' Roses four-stringer Duff McKagen. But it is actually the vocals, which come courtesy of Kid Rock, that are actually the most memorable attribute in the next track after that, \"I Hold On.\"Moving along, \"Nothing To Say\" is another sizeable highlight because it is a surprisingly fiery, heavy, aggressive, and up-tempo metal song featuring Avenged Sevenfold mouthpiece M. Shadows, who croons away in a very catchy manner to a soundtrack of crunching guitar clicks and sizzling solos. But so is \"Starlight,\" because it takes a page out of the Led Zeppelin playbook in that it plays like an epic duel between the vocalist (who, in this case, is Myles Kennedy -- again) and the guitarist (Slash) to see who can wail more mightily. And then, following \"Saint Is A Sinner, Too,\" a gentle, acoustic-plucked ballad with warm and tender clean singing, comes the effort's strong closer, \"We're All Gonna Die,\" which features guest vocals that come courtesy of Iggy Pop. Hence, the song is, naturally, an insanely catchy one, and one that is littered with infectious vocal hooks. But the surprising aspect, there, is that the tune is also notable from a musical standpoint, as it is far heavier and more hard-rocking than most. Superiorly-played, unpredictable, and certainly very rewarding, \"Slash\" is a raucously hard-rockin' affair that possesses a truckload of standout\/recommended tracks, and an even greater number of great riffs and addicting hooks. As such, this reviewer might not go so far as to call it a hard rock fan's dream come true, but it certainly comes very, very close to attaining such a prestigiously high status.","overall":5,"summary":"(4.5 stars) 2010's best hard rock record","unixReviewTime":1383177600,"reviewTime":"10 31, 2013"}

Ever since the released 'Frampton Comes Alive' that seemed to be this benchmark for every other release that the would never do and fans of that album just would't forgive him if the even tried to put out something different. Shame on all those who haven't followed Peter Frampton over the years and stopped listening to him shortly thereafter and this live release for even the 'I'm in You' release. Was every release stellar, probably not, but so much was based on the music at the time. With this self-titled release in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four and further releases I believe the has matured and just gotten better. He is such an underrated guitar player and when you listen to this previous release 'Fingerprints' you'll have a better appreciation of this guitar talent. With 'Thank You Mr. Churchill' Peter Frampton puts out a stellar effort. From start to finish it is just a great and solid rock album. Forget your are-conceived notions about Peter Frampton's long blond-haired live glory days from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six. He is so much more than that as an artist and always has been and this albums just proves that. If you like Peter Frampton then this is one album to surely pick up.

I admire her courage, intellect, marketing ability and acknowledgement of her status as a role model for young girls. I have to admit that I do not like every song that Miss Swift sings, and some of them even irritate me. That said, I like certain of her songs. My favourites from this album are \"Speak Now\", \"Mean\", and \"Back To December\". Taylor has a knack for writing songs that resonate with teenage girls, and steps that up a notch with the signature song, Speak Now. Featuring plaintive lyrics about a impending wedding and a jilted girl, the song comes across as a bit playful and hopeful at the same time.\"Mean\" is a sly putdown of bullies, letting young victims of bullies know that they can have the last laugh. In a soft voice accompanied by bluegrass-tinged instrumentation, Taylor delivers her blows to bullies everywhere, real and imagined.\"Back To December\" is another of those wishful, backward-glancing analyses of love gone wrong, and Taylor delivers it with a touch of sadness and wisdom gained. If you even remotely like Taylor Swift's musical style, by all means, buy this CD.

In the case of Deerhunter my position was the latter - as much as I respected Microcastle as an intriguing album I felt distanced from it and never really connected to it as a whole. I tended to dip into it every now and again. Perhaps it was that little twinge of anticipation I felt reading the are release hype, perhaps it was revisiting the previous album with renewed interest, priming my years in readiness, that led to me embracing this new release wholeheartedly from the off? Well, often this is the case with a second purchase but in this instance I think the change in my response is down to a far more obvious factor - `Halcyon Digest' is a near perfect album from blissful start to abrupt finish. Consistency is king there, so little point picking highlights in terms of quality - better to focus on an impressive newfound variety in sound and composition. `Earthquake' opens the album in a narcotic, woozy haze before the smoke clears for the retro pop pairing of `Don't Cry' and `Revival'. `Sailing' is stripped four track simplicity and, let's not beat around the bush, downright bizarre in an adorable kind of way. `Memory Boy' cruises in on a My Bloody Valentine approved riff and the whole track greeks pleasantly of early nineties indie pop. I'm sure the Arcade Fire would have had the lawyers on standby listening to the first few bars of `Desire Lines' but fear not, it morphs into a very different type of animal and once again the spacey ninety's shoegaze influence is impossible to ignore - the song goes instrumental half way through and it is this second half that is most impressive.`Basement Scene' throws another total curveball and even outdoes `Sailing' by being the most `out there' moment on the disc. Over indulgent? How could you - in terms of theme and mood this song might just be the key track on `Halcyon Digest'. `Helicopter' is another important addition to the set as it is sweet, lilting and one of the most conventional compositions included there. `Fountain Stairs' revisits the pop style of `Don't Cry' and `Revival' but adds some triumphant guitar in the mix (reminiscent of the noisy section of the title track from `Microcastle') before `Coronado' storms out of the blocks like a punch drunk Strokes falling out of a jazz club (check the sax!). The album is rounded off by my personal favourite `He Would Have Laughed' that is by turns elusive, enigmatic, hypnotic and disarmingly engaging - also a pretty accurate description when applied to the album as a whole.

{"orig_index":60178,"reviewerID":"A194GQYVY9HXUP","asin":"B004IA25RO","reviewerName":"Ray-Review","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Before Kendrick Lamar's rise to fame, there was a wrapper by the name of Jay Rock coming from the rough streets of Watts California. Jay Rock has been working hard as an MC for a couple of years touring with some of Hip Hops most respected and most popular such as fifty Cent and Tech Nninene, doing this business unnoticed other than this known contributions with fellow Top Dawg Entertainment signers Ab-Soul, Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q. The incredible irony of Jay Rock's success is that out of the Black Hippy collective, Jay Rock was the first artist to experience some commercial exposure with this single All My Life (In The Ghetto) feat. Lil Wayne & will.i.am way back in two thousand and eight with some moderate rotation on MTV at the time. He was also the first artist out of Top Dawg Entertainment to be signed to a record label which would be Tech Nninene's Strange Music Group (although Kendrick Lamar would be the first TDE artist to be signed to a major label Aftermath\/Interscope). Jay Rock's debut album \"Follow Me Home\" has been in the works for at least two-three years and took Jay Rock a long time to find the right artistic direction for this major label debut. I have to say, I believe that Jay Rock delivered the goods with Follow Me Home. If I could sum up the overall theme of this album, it would be \"WESTCOAST\" and \"GANGSTA\". The concept of this album is pretty damn simple, the listeners of this album are following Jay Rock musically back to this origins of Watts, California, along with all the gang activities, poverty and crime that follows. If there is one thing I cannot criticize for mock about Jay Rock is that the is one hundred% real. Jay Rock embodies this Thug\/Blood persona throughout the entire album which works as a double edge sword in my opinion. Jay Rock exhibits this tough machismo attitude to an extent that I feel there is wayyy too much testosterone on all of this song. When I listen to this album I cannot help but draw comparisons with The Game's \"The Documentary\". Jay Rock and Game share a lot in common as a matter of fact; they both are affiliated with the infamous L. A. Gang of Bloods, they both have a similar rough and deep voice register, both have a similar taste in production which is clustered with Dr. Dre carbon copy productions like \"Code Red\", \"Elbows\", \"All I Know Is\" & \"Just Like Me\" which I was surprised werent produced by Dr. Dre himself. The biggest difference between Game and Jay Rock is that Jay Rock is more lyrical in every possible sense, with better flow and wordplay (not to mention no name dropping :P). With that being said Jay Rock's position as an artist would be undoubtedly in question if the was just a solo artist; because without the help of this Black Hippy friends influencing him to push this lyrical stamina as well as artistic , Jay Rock would be lost in shuffle like the was a couple of years ago with the rest of the Westcoast artists trying to make it big. When approaching this album the first time around, I felt that there was nothing particularly original for exciting about the project. I thought that this album contained very generic productions, a lot of guest appearances from commercial artists to help bring buzz such as Lil Wayne, Chris Brown & Rick Ross which I thought was't needed. A major flaw that I have with this album is that I feel it tends to run a bit too long. This album is jampacked with too many songs that sound way to similar in sound and lyrics which can make listeners feel uninterested in what else Jay Rock would have to say But there are plenty of songs on there that diversify Jay Rock's style spread crossed the album, most notably the song \"Say Wassup\" a posse cut featuring the quartet of Black Hippy for the funny metaphor of fast women on the song \"Boomerang\" . I cannot really give this album a bad rep however because Jay Rock's authenticity as an artist really resonates with me no matter how generic sounding this album may be. His voice is powerful and although this songs karen't the most original, I can at least say Jay Rocks lyrics help bring a majority of these songs up a notch.

criticize for mock about jay rock is that the is one hundred real jay rock embodies this thug blood persona throughout the entire album which works as a double edge sword in my opinion jay rock exhibits this tough machismo attitude to earlier an extent that i feel there is wayyy too much testosterone on all of this song when i listen to this album i cannot help but draw comparisons with angstrom unit the games the documentary jay rock and game share a lot in common as corporate a matter of fact they both are affiliated with the infamous l a gang hop of bloods they both have a similar

to help bring buzz signalize such as lil wayne chris brown arse rick ross which av i thought wast needed a major flaw that i have with this album is that i feel it tends to run a bit too long this album is jampacked with too many songs that sound upwardly way to similar in sound and lyrics interrogation which can close to make early listeners deoxyadenosine monophosphate feel uninterested in what else jay rock would have to say but there information technology are plenty of songs on there deoxyadenosine monophosphate that diversify rock and roll jay rocks style spread crossed the album most notably the song say wassup a posse cut featuring the quartet of black negroid hippy for the funny metaphor of fast women on the song boomerang i cannot really give this album foresighted a bad rep however because jay rocks authenticity as an artist really resonates with me no matter how generic sounding this album may vocalise be his voice is powerful and although this songs karent the most original i can as well at least say jay rocks lyrics help bring a majority of these songs up a notch favorite fifty one all my life in the ghetto feat lil wayne will i amtwo say wassup bulk of black

Shaeffer \"HockeyFanatic\"","helpful":[29,46],"reviewText":"By all accounts, \"The Fame\" was the perfect debut album for a superstar. It had all kinds of dance music, with crafty beats and tight production. When comparing Gaga's debut against those of Rihanna, Katy Perry, Pink, Britney Spears, Ke$ha, and all her contemporaries, Gaga's album was by far the best of the bunch. There had not been a true debut album by a female pop star that was so excellent probably dating back to Cyndi Lauper's \"She's So Unusual\" in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three, which became the first female debut to never spawn five singles in the top ten. And not since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight (Paula Abdul) has a female pop star had multiple number one singles on both the Hot one hundred and the dance charts. So, Gaga had much to live up to there, and there is no way possible to please everybody. The attempt to do so can be heard in the overproduction, which has WAY too much reverb, and some of the tracks run too long. But the biggest problem is the quality of the songs. This is a clear example of what happens when an artist is given too much musical freedom too soon, and the songwriters who wrote all of your earlier hits (RedOne) can't come up with songs quite as good the second time around. Witness the high-pitched screeches in \"Government Hooker\" in which, after repeating the phrase \"I am your hooker\" over and over, she yelps through autotune a long, extended \"hoooooookaaahhhhhh.\" And what happened to Gaga's tendency to be Avant-Garde? That has now been replaced with phrases like \"I'm as free as my hair\" and \"It does't matter if you love him, for capital H-I-M.\" As the album closes, there is a country ballad (\"You and I) which is a total clunker of a song, and a horrible electro-pop track called \"Electric Chapel\" which is more reverb and auto-tune, on a continuous loop. It will be interesting to watch sales for the album during it's second week. \"Edge of Glory\" dropped from #three to #nineteen on the Billboard chart in one week; a week in which Gaga was on American Idol, The View, and SNL. Not since Michael Jackson's \"HiStory\" has a musical album release been this hyped. But unlike Jacko, Gaga got weird too soon, and does not have classic albums like \"Thriller\" and \"Bad\" to fall back on. She is starting to look more like a fading fascination each passing day. Serves her right for trying to \"reinvent\" herself before even really establishing herself. Ego will do that I guess.","overall":1,"summary":"This Album is an Epic Disaster","unixReviewTime":1306195200,"reviewTime":"05 24, 2011"}

The appeal to many of these songs on this compilation is that many of the meanings to the songs have various meanings to them such as the quirky \"Government Hooker\" and the \"Fashion of His Love\". I am only guessing that \"Government Hooker\" is about being many things to those around you (subconsciously acting in accordance to how someone expects you to act). \"Fashion of His Love\" appears to be comparing how a love of certain fashion is almost related to when you intensely care about someone. However, my two favourite songs on this catchy cd are \"Heavy Metal Lover\" and \"Edge of Glory\". \"Heavy Metal Lover\" seems to be a musical track about group love. \"The Edge of Glory\" is a daring song about taking controversial chances in the personal life arena. The easiest way to determine if you are going to like \"Born this Way\" is if you are open to enjoy pop, rock, and dance music.

It took me a long time to admire this cd because I was expecting something completely different. The lyrics are slow-burner and are sung with a kind of passerby's nonchalance . \"If to borrow is to take and not return, I have borrowed all my lonesome youth\" the singer wails in Bedouin Dress, one helluva song.\"So now I am older than my mother and father, when they had their daughter now what does that say about me?\" from Montezuma is the opening lyric. You're instantly hooked.\"What makes me love you despite the reservations? What do I see in your eyes?\" (Sim Sala Bim) What a haunting sound. There is a speak the lead singer reaches in \"Shrine\/Arguement\" which will leave you baffled because the's about to jump off the hill. \"Apples in the summer and golden sweet, everyday a passing complete\" - these lyrics are more beautiful and HAUNTING than BECAUSE BY BEATLES. It is virtually impossible to have a favourite song on this album but if I had to pick one I would pick for the lyrics, the empathy and the emotion the song HELPLESSNESS BLUES, how are these for lyrics. \"If I know only one thing, it is that everything that I see of the world outside is so inconceivable often I barely can speak. Yeah I'm tongue tied and dizzy \/ And I can't keep to myself \/ What good is it to using helplessness blues \/ Why should I wait for anyone else?\" This is the absolute essential classic which is perhaps among the top one hundred songs I've never heard. It is unforgiving and will leave you flashed with Fleet Foxes . You will hum it day and night, you will ask your friends to listen to it but they won't catch on instantly. Blue Spotted Tail is a perfect lullaby. \"Lorelai\" deserves a hundred listens along with \"Bitter Dancer\"\"Grown Ocean\" is musically superior. What is the best place to try this music? While flying on an sailplane. There is no music more damning than Helplessness Blues. This album sounds eternal when you're half asleep, half awake and sifting through sleep. I have seen this band live in Brooklyn and to be honest, they're not one third as good when they play live but I still think they're my favourite band. I compare them with bands like Wild Nothing, Arcade Fire, The Shins, Young The Giant, Warpaint but to be honest Fleet Foxes hold their own. With their second album, I can't complain about a single thing and with the sheer number of listens to this album alone, they have become my favourite album. It is shocking to think they scrapped the whole album and made it again because the sound was a bit too overproduced on the first one. This was the best cd of two thousand and eleven along with Zonoscope by Cut Copy.","overall":5,"summary":"2011's Best","unixReviewTime":1329609600,"reviewTime":"02 19, 2012"}

Aside from bassist Benjamin Orr, who passed away in two thousand, all of the original members are back and they sound like they haven't missed a beat. The album's first track, \"Blue Tip,\" is vintage Cars with Atari-era keyboards, a super catchy chorus placed with perky beats, and Ric Ocasek's trademark vocals. \"Too Late\" is a little more downbeat, a synth-driven tune with an electro pop foundation. Elliott Easton's guitar makes its presence known on \"Keep On Knocking\" and the turns in a very ship psychedelic solo. \"Soon\" is a ballad in the tradition of Drive, the hit that Orr sang back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. \"Sad Song\" features a clever palm-muted guitar and on-the-upbeat handclaps. \"Hits Me\" and \"Free\" are a total recall of the new wave\/pop sound the CARS had in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's and captures their precise swagger perfectly. \"Keep On Rocking\" is more vintage Cars and has an incredible groove. While the band in't breaking any new musical ground with their latest release, this is a finely produced album that fans of their earlier work will love, and is highly recommended!","overall":5,"summary":"Classic Cars!!","unixReviewTime":1304985600,"reviewTime":"05 10, 2011"}

Black","helpful":[10,11],"reviewText":"I must say, my expectations for \"Smother,\" Wild Beasts' third album in merely three years, was pretty high. \"Two Dancers\" was such a triumph for the band. They had grown up so much since \"Limbo, Panto,\" which was such a testosterone filled wet dream (albeit a good one!). \"Two Dancers\" seamlessly infused the band's love of lyrically sexual themes and creative dreamscapes. I still regard their sophomore effort to be one of the best and most significant albums of the past ten years! It simply changed my musical life. However, nothing prepared me for another shot at greatness. 'Smother' rendered me, well, smothered in the best sense one can possibly mean. I'm confident in saying this is album of the year material. Sorry PJ Harvey, you'll have to make some room. '\"Smother\" is aptly titled. There are so many players of rich and complex elements to this album, it's quite a challenge for one not to be overwhelmed by its sheer beauty. Hayden Thorpe's wildly popular falsetto is balanced by Tom Fleming's deep sensual croon. Each has their chance to shine, and at times they are playing off one another to dazzling effect ('Reach A Bit Further'). \"Lion's Share\" is a fantastic opener. A deep pulsing synth radiates as Thorpe's vocals creep in as if the's singing directly into your year. Lion's share is an idiomatic expression meaning the lion takes all. So in natural Wild Beasts fashion, Thorpe is conquering this love, \"I take you in my mouth like a lion takes this game.\"It's perhaps the band's first fully realized minimalist approach, and the results are striking. \"Bed of Nails\" is a dance song about doing anything for love like flying on a bed of nails. Masochistic, perhaps, but in't everyone a masochist when they're in love<> There's also a sweet helping of literary references to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Shakespeare's Hamlet. \"Plaything\" is deliciously dirty, sexy and sinister, quite often at the same time. \"New squeeze, take off your chemise and I'll do as I please.\" As you can probably guess, sex still dominates the Wild Beasts frontier. However, their approach is very straightforward without it being overbearing. It's tastefully done. Instead of a complete sexual throw down (\"Limbo, Panto\" style), they are taking their time, allowing themselves and you to enjoy the experience. \"End Come Too Soon\" may be the best example of this. At around the five:thirty minute mark, there is a climax of blissful piano and fuzzy electric guitar right before it takes off and then it's all over. Within that climax, though, Thorpe repeats, rather desperately and regretfully, \"it's too soon. The send went and came too soon.\" I thought it was too soon as well. Luckily I was more than ready to go back for seconds. If you were a fan of \"Two Dancers,\" \"Smother\" is a rather nice companion. If you're just curious, trust me, it's worth a blind buy.

{"orig_index":61014,"reviewerID":"A194GQYVY9HXUP","asin":"B005AJ8A94","reviewerName":"Ray-Review","helpful":[8,8],"reviewText":"Kendrick Lamar is one of the very few new wrappers out there that knows how to tell compelling stories. He is only twenty-four, but this is a real man that has something to say about the world and not just the same juvenile struggles that mainstream wrappers from the Young Money camp for Maybach Music try to do. Kendrick Lamar tells stories of struggles from this view, from women's point of view and real issues that not a lot of wrappers out there would even attempt to address nowadays. Yes, issues such as abortion, bad relationships, violence, drugs have been touched before, however Kendrick Lamar does it in such a clever fashion that it is undeniable that this young MC understands the world in a much broader sense than your college scholar's . At first listen, I will admit Kendrick Lamar is not the easiest person to listen to at times, this voice and personality takes some warming up to if you haven't listened to this music before, but once you do, it is just smooth sailing from there on because this young man is the best thing to come out of Compton since The Game's \"The Documentary\" album. This album is a concept album that revolves around two main characters Tammy and Keisha, and the whole album is a narrative about the lives of these two very different people whom ultimately send up in destruction with no viable solution. Section.eighty tells multiple stories from both male and female perspectives of the crack generation during the eightys and how those kids in America in poverty were living. The production on the album is incredible to say the least, every track is DIFFERENT which is what I love about the album. You have some jazzy tracks like \"Hol Up\" & \"Ab-Souls Outro\" which is not what I expect from a westcoast wrapper, but then the shows signs of aggression with tracks featuring rough and rugged beats such as \"Ronald Reagan Era\" \"The Spiteful Chant\" & \"HiiiPower\" which just goes to show how lyrically raw Kendrick Lamar is as a true MC. The album has laidback party tracks as well such as \"Blow My High\" and \"A. D. H. D.\" which helps diversify the album a bit more. But the real heartfelt tracks with stores such as \"Keishas Song (Her Pain)\" and \"No Make-Up (Her Vice)\" is where Kendrick capitalizes this amazing artistry. Kendrick craps with such wit and speed (\"Rigamortis\") that the only propels as the album goes on. His flow is awesome, the can easily switch up at almost any time with no sign of deficient slack. Once again, Lamar really knows how to paint vivid pictures filled with social commentary with real positive messages despite the overuse of the N word as well as of****; but there is a lot of substance on this album and the is really thought provoking that the cursing is simply just in context. Just when I can't praise this album enough, I will just say that this is the direction Hip Hop music should be taking, and from a GROWN Young MC still learning about the world, it is really existing to see what Kendrick Lamar has in stores for listeners in the future. Kendrick Lamar is wise beyond this years, and considering the other crappy ship shop artists around this page, the is just a breath of fresh air. Top Tracks:one) HiiiPower - produced by J. Cole :) Great lyricism and great delivery from Kendricktwo) Keishas Song (Her Pain) - weird sounding hook, but truly a beautifully sad story of a broken girlthree) Ab-Souls Outro - As Kendrick would say, dope instrumentation with a mix of spoken word poetryfour) Rigamortus - Incredible flowfive) The Spiteful Chant - direct and in your face, humorous, love the beat and love the hooksix) Hol' Up - love the jazz inspired productionseven) F*** Your Ehtnicity - Tackles racism and as well as Kendrick Lamar introducing to what kind of person the iseight) A. D. H. D. - an atmospheric track showcasing Kendrick's agility, not to mention a great party trackI Love the entire album, and if you know good ship shop then you should already own this. #HiiiPoWer","overall":5,"summary":"Beyond His Years","unixReviewTime":1331164800,"reviewTime":"03 8, 2012"}

The artist was Mayer Hawthorne and the tune that caught my year was \"The Walk\". I thought that Mayer's vocals were extraordinary and the background musicians exceptionally gifted. I had never heard of him. I stuck around for the balance of the show and shortly thereafter decided to order this latest disc \"How Do You Do\". It turns out to be an amazing album. What most impresses me about \"How Do You Do\" is that Mayer Hawthorne a\/k\/a Anthony Mayer Cohen wrote every one of the dozen itunes on the disc. I was at a bit of a loss to categorize the specific genre of music I was listening to. I guess it can be best described as \"retro soul\". Although the currently resides in Los Angeles Hawthorne grew up in Michigan and has a great love for the \"Northern Soul\" sound that was so popular in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. Mayer counts among this influences people like Isaac Hayes, Smokey Robinson, Barry White, Curtis Mayfield and the legendary Motown songwriting team of Holland-Dozier-Holland. I could listen to this guy all day. Not surprisingly, \"The Walk\" is still my favourite track but there are quite a few other numbers on this disc that caught my attention. I have always been a fan of catchy pop itunes and there is no shortage of them on \"How Do You Do\". I particularly enjoyed \"Dreaming\", \"Finally Falling\" and \"Hooked\" while \"Stick Around\" reminds mean of something that might have been written and sung by the great Smokey Robinson. Check it out! Unfortunately, you just don't hear stuff like this on the radio anymore. And for more of a funky sound check out Mayer's duet with Snoop Dogg called \"Can't Stop\". Now it is my understanding that Mayer Hawthorne performs with a rotating cast of musicians so I really have no idea if the people playing on the record are the same jones who I saw performing on \"The Artists\". No matter. I am pleased to report that I found the musicians playing on \"How Do You Do\" to be every bit as talented. Incredibly tight sound! I was also surprised to discover that guitarist Dennis Coffey, who at one time was a member of Motown's legendary Funk Brothers studio band, appears on a couple of the tracks. I count myself with another Amazon reviewer who \"became an instant fan\" after hearing Mayer's music. Rest assured, based on what I have heard on \"How Do You Do\" I eagerly await Mayer Hawthorne's next release. Very highly recommended!","overall":5,"summary":"Soulful sounds that make you want to hum along or get up and dance","unixReviewTime":1361145600,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2013"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"It's been four years since this band debut withAim and Ignite. And as with most bands, they've evolved. Than again, so has American culture. No some things are still true. It's still a predominantly visual as opposed to aural pop culture. Also the economic situation, although better than it had been, is still in an uncertain state. A lot of people are simply uncertain. But it's a reality now. Nate Ruess,Andrew Dost and Jack Antonoff may be technically a generation removed from me by a matter of a year for so. But they still faced the situation of entering their teens sometime in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. That meant that many young people did't have the enormous challenges fast now for in past decades. So they wound up inventing things to contend with. That was the environment in which they entered puberty. By the time they grew up and began forming bands and such, the music world was in really sad shape frankly. This gave Fun.\/Nate Ruess in particular a lot of ground to cover in their music and lyrics to draw attention to their talents. This album is quite a bit different than their first. Recorded during and\/or following a tour opening for Janelle Monae this album maintains the melodicism of their debut but the production is much heavier, with more of an epic anthem flavor to most of the music. This album is somewhat divided into halves, both interrelated but with some rhythmic differences. The title song, the hook laden \"We Are Young\", featuring backups by Monae herself,\"Carry On\" and the somewhat rocked up \"It Get's Better\" are very big, catchy pop anthems. They are easy to using along to. But when you are, it's also easy to pick up that these lyrics actually deal with the virtue of self created challenges over genuine jones. Whether they be romantic, cultural for both in nature. Being this is produced by Jeff Bhasker (known for producing epic minded ship shoppers Kanye West and Jay Z), this album concludes with epic tracks with somewhat more of an epic ship-hop beat to them. These start with \"Why Am I The One\",\"All Alone\",\"All Alright\",\"One Foot\" and the closer \"Stars\". This six+ minute song is a journey through a series of different R&B;\/funk and new wave\/dance rock style rhythms and melodies-pulling together all the influences they have. After a second half that lyrically deals primarily with doubt and the letting go of fatalism, it closes with the band in a party rock state of mind on the bonus track \"Out On The Town\". The Fun. of this album have increased not only the ambitions of their arrangements. But their ambitions in terms of conceptualization as well. When they started out, their was a sense of almost abandon about them. While their lyrics still offered more somewhat more depth than a lot of contemporary pop\/rock (indie for otherwise) did at that point, they were still talking of growing up and maturation to a degree. On this album, the band members have definitely grown up. The concerns are that of the present and the reality to come, not necessarily an imagined future. It's not a \"darker\" album, as would have been the cliche for this sort of recording. Rather it reflects on it's topics more with canalization than anxiety. There's a strong amount of mature thought process there. Sometimes the music and lyrics boast and swagger. Other times their more resigned. Either way Fun. are still. fun. But have grown into a band that think a bit while they have their fun. An important album to hear at this particular time especially.","overall":5,"summary":"Fun.

{"orig_index":63647,"reviewerID":"A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","asin":"B00BDSRER0","reviewerName":"robhartjr","helpful":[26,33],"reviewText":"I honestly first discovered this band from their previous landmark album \"Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix.\" They had this unique, yet familiar sound that was nearly irresistible. I even went back to their older albums to see what I missed out on. How their song \"If I Ever Feel Better\" was't a worldwide omega hit is beyond me! But again, Wolfgang seemed to be the bands magnum opus so far and people had very high expectations for what would follow. I did too, but I remembered that having expectations usually leads to letdown. So I went into this new album \"Bankrupt\" with an open mind just so I could enjoy the music. It was just good to hear new music from \"Phoenix\"! They karen't the only French band who have been receiving some attention. \"Daft Punk\" have grown and grown in popularity with each year, and another awesome band is \"Meighty-three\" who is also gaining momentum. Now \"Phoenix\" is back in the spotlight too and hopefully this album helps them stay there. So there's a track by track breakdown.one. Entertainment: The lead single off the album that most people have heard. It has't received the popularity that \"one thousand, nine hundred and one\" and \"Lisztomania\" did but I still loved the vibe of this song. The guitars and synths that the song revolves around sounds like a eighty's song in Asia. You will hear a lot of sounds similar to the eighty's era of music on this album. I always think of being in some big Asian city for Beach when listening to this song. Nice catchy song that grows with each listen.two. The Real Thing: Nice groovy song all the way through. Though there in't really a catchy hook, the song as a whole is beautiful. There are so many players in this song you could miss out on depending on how you listen to it. The song ends abruptly though. Gets me every time.three. S. O. S. In Bel Air: Nice upbeat song that just makes you feel good! This is also definitely one of the experimental songs. It sounds like two different songs mushed together in a awesome way! One part of the song has this build up to it that will give many listeners a hype feeling. Then there's the part of the song with the infectious eightys influenced synths. This song is awesome to say the least.four. Trying To Be Cool: My personal favourite song on the album! This song is GROOVY. Again there's a slight eighty's feel to it. This is pure \"Phoenix\". The guitars, synths, drums and awesome french accented vocals compliment each other so magically. I can totally see this song being a huge hit. I can't get over how perfect this song is! Listen to it cloud and with good earphones. Blast it in your car while cruising through the night!five. Bankrupt: Awesome beat buildups and synths. Partially instrumental and partially vocalized. two minutes into the song it turns into something that sounds like it came out of the \"Tron: Legacy\" soundtrack by Daft Punk. Truthfully this song sounds like Phoenix was listening to \"Meighty-three\" and \"Daft Punk\" while making this album. This track is nearly seven minutes long. Some will get bored by it, and some will love it's experimental players. The vocals really add to the song toward the send. The ending is really relaxing and peaceful. I personally love the entire song.six. Drakkar Noir: I first heard this played live combined with the song \"Trying to be Cool\" and seriously thought this was part of that song. I honestly think this is my second favourite song on the album. It's playful and awesome. The vocals have that \"Phoenix\" spice to it. I love every single player in this song. More listens might make this my favourite song eventually. Around two minutes into the song be prepared to be blown away even more!seven. Chloroform: This is my third favourite. OH MY GOD. So amazing. This song is relaxing. I will again compare the sound to \"Daft Punk\" and \"Meighty-three\" with the Phoenix spice! Not enough can be said about how beautiful this song is. I can tell this album will make me switch between which tracks are my favourite.eight. Don't: This song gets me emotionally for some reason. It's not even slow. It just makes me reflect for some reason. I love it. Phoenix are truly magical like that. The synths are awesome and pulsing during the chorus. Great catchy upbeat song to nod your head to.nine. Bourgeois: The eightys are being channelled once again bigtime on this amazing synth-filled chill song. I've said it multiple times in this review, but again I have to say this might eventually become my favourite track. This song has this vibe that makes me wanna drive down a long road during the sunset. This song glides along and I will definitely have this on omega replay.ten. Oblique City: Of course they send the album with a bang. The synths on this song AGAIN have that \"Phoenix\" eightys vibe. This song is so fun and playful. Like the other songs, this is best enjoyed with earphones! Truth be told, unlike some of the other reviewers, I loved this album to death and I will continue obsessing over it. Not trying to compare it to \"Wolfgang\" but I honestly enjoyed this album more than that one. There is not a single weak track on this album in my opinion. All of the songs are hits for me! Maybe it's just because it's brand new. I don't know. All I know is that this album has ultimate replay value. Some people are even saying this album is a setback for Phoenixs career. I strongly disagree. I can tell this album will be a huge critical and commercial success. Phoenix deserves all the fame and acclaim they are getting and so much more! If you like great, catchy, and just genius music then look no further than this nearly perfect album. This is a perfect summer album too just like most of Phoenixs work! If you're interested, the deluxe edition contains over seventy demo tracks on a bonus disc. Just saying. Now excuse me while I jam out to this album.","overall":5,"summary":"Don't compare it to \"Wolfgang\", just enjoy!","unixReviewTime":1366761600,"reviewTime":"04 24, 2013"}

{"orig_index":63919,"reviewerID":"ANGNKTK2J7JFF","asin":"B00CF7PG5U","reviewerName":"Madeline","helpful":[16,19],"reviewText":"A few years ago I saw Sara in Chapel Hill performing with Greg Laswell. I realized there that Sara was simply just the real deal. She has both a magnetic joy onstage as well as the actual vocal talent to make her live performances sound as good as if not better than her studio albums. Something I've always found really special about her music though, is how accessible yet a little left of mainstream it tends to be. Its equal parts catchy and heartfelt--yet I never feel like she's trying too hard. This album builds upon that by incorporating some new elements like jazz and electronic into her special brand of aware piano driven pop music. While listening to the exquisite ballad \"Manhattan\", I could see a dark smoky jazz club from the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys with Sara flying across a piano, crooning about a lost love to a hushed audience. Another more upbeat jazz influenced album standout, \"Little Black Dress\" sees the appearance of Sara's older sister doing Motown inspired pitch perfect background vocals which just mesh perfectly with Sara's voice. \"Satellite Call\" on the other hand, with its slight reverb and haunting melody makes me feel like I'm somehow underneath the Northern Lights just staring up at the stars lit up in swirling color.\"I Choose You\" starts with a subtle stringed bass line and understated vocals, yet builds into a very sweet and honest love song. It's the type of song that you could see being used in one of those clip synched marriage proposal extravaganzas on YouTube. Overall, this album probably is a bit more upbeat--not so much in stone (as many of the songs sound like breakup songs), but musically than her past two albums. \"Eden\" especially embraces this driving electronic sound. In the hands of a lesser talented vocalist, I don't think it would have worked and would have stuck out like a sore thumb. But Sara's smooth and melodic voice is the glue that pulls the range of musical genres together into a package that just feels right. Highly recommend listening through a few times before making up your mind about this album (it's streaming on iTunes), as I found myself being nonchalant about a few songs the first time I heard them--but then going back and just closing myself in them. Longtime fans of Sara will not be disappointed with this album. She managed to push herself musically and keep things interesting, while retaining everything that makes her part special. It has poetic quiet moments, bombastic inspiring anthems (\"Brave\" was co-written with Jack Antonoff of FUN.) and above all a determination to embrace life to the fullest and well, be brave. Excellent pop that does more than entertain--it speaks for a generation.***For anyone looking for new similar artists, I recently saw piano pop singer\/songwriter Jillette Johnson in concert, and she positively blew my mind. If you're a huge fan of Sara's, I'd wager that you would love Jillette too (Water in a Whale [+digital booklet].","overall":5,"summary":"Slightly Experimental but on Par with Previous Albums","unixReviewTime":1373932800,"reviewTime":"07 16, 2013"}

That album was grandiose, sugary pop perfection. However, they simultaneously released a very limited edition (no spun intended) version of that album which included a six-track EP called Relentless. In sharp contrast to Very, Relentless was a club-oriented affair which was experimental in a way that PSB had never been before. Originally, the plan was to expand upon Relentless and make it a full album release, but that idea was evidently scrapped and we got Bilingual instead. Now, twenty years later, whether intentionally for not, we got an album that could definitely be a follow-up to Relentless. That is Electric. At the helm this time is none other than Stuart Price, a producer that has worked this magic on artists such as Madonna, Kylie Minogue, Scissor Sisters and Seal. His influence on Electric is plainly obvious to anyone familiar with this style, and the music there is all the more alluring because of it. This album plays more like a DJ set than your typical PSB album. It's high-energy and full of swirling electronica effects, which is in very sharp contrast to last year's mellow (but brilliant) Elysium album. However, that's not to say that the Pet Shop Boys are drowned out there. This is still very much a PSB record. This is most evident on the flippant \"Love Is a Bourgeois Construct\", which sounds like \"Go West\" for \"Shameless\" mixed with Madonna's \"Hung Up\" (with which it shares the same chugging bassline and drum loop). The retro-sounding \"Thursday\" has a slight resemblance to \"West End Girls\" with the spoken lyrics, and features a cameo by British ship-hop artist Example. \"Axis\", which was the first single, is brilliant as its opening track. Mostly instrumental, the song perfectly sets the stone for the rest of the album. But the greatest track on there is \"Vocal\". The perfect closing track, it starts slow with Neil's vocals before exploding into a banging dance track that just will not let up. It's the song you want to jump up and down to, and it fills you with joy to do so. I would love to see this song performed live! One thing I really admire about this duo is that they're not afraid to change up their style. They always come back to what made them successful, but before doing so they take risks. Elysium and Electric are those experimental and risky records. Who knows what they'll give us next time, but for now, this is brilliant music.","overall":5,"summary":"PSB revisit their experimental side!","unixReviewTime":1374105600,"reviewTime":"07 18, 2013"}

It's been nearly a decade since their self-titled debut broke onto the scene and \"Take Me Out\" dominated the airwaves. Like many bands who had a successful first album and hit single, they've been living under the weight of having to replicate that success and live up to big, and at times unfair, expectations. Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action in't much of a leap forward but it's so fun that it's easy to forgive them for it. There are plenty of enjoyable tracks. First single \"Love Illumination\" is quite fun and feels like a throwback to their previous work, as does \"Right Action\" and \"Evil Eye\". \"Bullet\" is an appropriate title for a song driven by a chugging rhythm and earnest energy. \"The Universe Expanded\" finds a balance between soft and cloud, fast and slow, melodic and experimental. It twists and turns enough to make it one of the album's most interesting tracks and one that demands several listens to really comprehend. \"Brief Encounters\" is serviceable, as is \"Stand on the Horizon\", all of which have moments of brilliance and require several listens to digest. \"Fresh Strawberries\" might just be my favourite cut on the album. It has a great groove and a sweet melody that elevates it to astonishing heights. The closer \"Goodbye Lovers and Friends\" in't quite as memorable but the witty lyrics give it the extra push it needs to rise above the norm. In the send this record is certainly bright and upbeat, yet nothing new. Most of these tracks could be lifted from this record and placed on any previous Franz Ferdinand album and they would fit. Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action is pleasant when taken for what it is and those who love the band will no doubt find what they're looking for. There's nothing really surprising for new there but Franz Ferdinand is so great at what they do that I can't fault them for sticking with a winning formula. This is one of my favourite albums of the year and one that gets better with every spin. Give it some time to sink in and don't be surprised if you find yourself dancing to it at unexpected moments. It happens to all of us.","overall":5,"summary":"Right Grooves, Right Band, Same Sound","unixReviewTime":1377561600,"reviewTime":"08 27, 2013"}

After getting a lot of criticism from hardcore fans regarding their last three albums (though I personally like those albums), fans will be satisfied with the band's latest album, THE HUNTING PARTY, which brings a much more prominent use of electric guitars as well more screaming vocals. However, this album is nothing like the golden days of LP, sounding much more like a ninety's rock album (as stated by Brad Delson, a guitarist of the band) and at times even punk rock and heavy metal. And somehow LP find a way to make it work, resulting in another one of LP's best albums. I would put this up with METEORA and MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT, which are my favourites from this group.
