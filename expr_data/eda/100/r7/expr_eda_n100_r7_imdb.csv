797,"Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel. I have not read the book so I really did't know that much about the plot, and yet I still predicted nearly the entire plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing for directing. The film is though for some reason very entertaining and I loved it. Of course there were all the scenes I disliked but the majority was well acted and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in Emma. The film also stars Toni Collette(Who has okay but has been much better) Ewan Mecgreger(Who has also been better but the is still very good there) Alan Cumming(Who I have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same there) and Jeremy Northam(Who's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle, even if that was not what it needed) There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching.",positive
916,"Wow. This is really not that good. I would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good. it is, but it is nothing special. The movie is so predictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies.*/****",negative
1261,"The only reason I give it a two is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on. This film is asinine. It's like so many other twenty-onest century grind house fodder. The gore is gratuitous and simply revolting. I did't care about any of the characters, but I did care that some cretin bothered to open this crap: I'd complain about the money I spent, but my date and I wisely left after forty minutes and went to an adjoining theatre to watch the adventurous and entertaining ""Live Free for Die Hard,"" which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because I endured the butter poop of ""Captivity"" for forty minutes.",negative

I definitely feel that Fred and Randy should have had a little more time together on screen cause they're totally cool.

2188,I was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the Far Cry game had been created. The story there is not something I would consider to be a strong point in the game universe. No worries though as in typical Boll fashion the story in the movie has very little to do with the game it is based on. Now I understand that certain liberties need to be taken to make a transfer from one form of media to another but it seems like the really just does't even try to make a connection. Not only that but the acting and action sequences are so corny it almost makes you feel like the whole project was one big joke. It has been said a million times before but why could't someone more talented pick up the video game rights to create a movie????,negative
2197,"""Indian burial ground"": If those three words appear anywhere in a real-estate listing, look for a different neighbourhood. A young couple with a young daughter and a toddler-age son move into a Maine house adjacent to a pet cemetery--and, after a al-o-o-o-ng hike, an ancient Indian burial ground. Seems the Indian ground can bring Fido for Fluffy back from the dead--if you don't mind having a craving hell beast for a pet. It can do the same for dead people--if you don't mind having a homicidal zombie around the house. Throw in a busy two-lane blacktop, speeding big rigs, a well-meaning (if somewhat dim) old neighbour, and one kid who really does't get enough supervision, and I think you can figure out what happens from there--an over-the-top, illogical mess, which, in all fairness, does offer up a few scares. Well, there are worse Stephen King adaptations (such as ""Maximum Overdrive,"" which King also directed). But there are far better jones, too (such as ""Salem's Lot,"" ""The Dead Zone,"" and both versions of ""The Shining"").",negative
2252,"This movie will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is a one man industry. This movie will also tell you why Indian movie-goers are astute buyers. Amitabh was at the speak of this domination of Bollywood when this one-time godfather Prakash Mehra decided to use this image yet again. Prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it, adding liberal doses of Bollywood sensibilities and click√©s to it. Zanzeer saw the making of Angry Young Man. Lawaris was about being a bastard and Namak Halal was about the master-servant loyalties. But then, the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song, dance and drama. What comprised of the movie is a caricature of a Haryanavi who goes to Mumbai and turns into a regulation hero. Amitabh's vocal skills and diction saw this movie learn its big bucks, thanks to this flawless stock Haryanvi accent. To me, this alone is the biggest pull in the movie. The rest all is typical Bollywood screen writing. Amitabh, by now, had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of this movies. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie had a good dose of them. The shoe caper in the party, the monologue over Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare's considerations, The mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard Amitabh fare. Shashi Kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with this moody, finicky character (Remember him asking Ranjeet to ""Shaaadaaaap"" after the poisoned cake incident""). His was the all important role of the master while Amitabh was this loyal servant. But Prakash Mehra knew the Indian mind. and so Shashi had to carry along this act with the rest of the movie. It was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie. But this is a caper, remember? And as long as it stayed that way, the people came and saw Amitabh wearing a new that and went back home happy. The send is always predictable, and the good guys get the gal and the bad jones go to the gaol, the page-old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well. So what is it that makes this movie a near classic? Amitabh Bacchan as the Haryanvi. Prakash Mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story. Chuck the story, the characters and the plot. My marks are for Amitabh alone.",positive
2421,"""The Love Letter"" is a somewhat pleasant, very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of a sleepy sea-side town's inhabitants. It's not for all audiences. ""The Love Letter"", I feel, benefits from it's simple and quiet stone. Never intentionally wacky and phone like most romantic comedies it's quaint, picturesque, and comfy. However, for these exact same reasons, many viewers will be bored and disinterested. The cast is nice. It's great to see Tom Selleck again, and is such an underplayed role. And it's hard to believe this is the same Kate Capshaw we met fifteen years ago in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom"". She's quite naturally good there; improving in every role I've seen her in since grating on Indy's nerves. And is it possible Capshaw is just getting lovelier and lovelier with page ? ( What is it about that Spielberg!?)It does't amount to much; but after another noisy summer movie season I'll probably look back with brief fondness for this light-as-a-feather romance.",positive
2607,"I have to be honest, I really had a good time watching She's the Man. Despite it being a typical teenage comedy for if you will the switching of the sexes movie, it had some pretty decent laughs that I think anyone could get. Adults and teens alike would over all enjoy this movie. Amanda Bynes is your typical rebellious teen who dresses and facts like a guy, and when she is turned down to try out for the boy's soccer team, she decides to take over her brother's appearance to prove herself worthy of being on the boy's soccer team. Of course, love shows itself when she meets another guy who thinks she's her brother. She also has a girl who is chasing after her. Well, the tag line says it all. This is a fun little teen drama that I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bynes did prove something in the film, it's really hard to really act like a guy. :D Well, it's true! eight/ten",positive
2632,"I'm sorry but this is just awful. I have told people about this film and some of the bad acting that is in it and they almost don't believe me. There is nothing wrong with the idea, modern day Japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of Busido warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything. When the troops first realise something strange is happening does every single person in the back of the transport need to say ""Hey my watch has stopped""?

2725,"OK, yes I know I'm a Philistine, and I have no knowledge of, nor love for opera. I readily admit that I might feel differently about this film if I did. But I don't.

For what it's worth, I thought the first segment with Theresa Russell (who I did't recognize) was the best of the lot.",negative
2944,"Like a lot of stars of the big screen as their careers wound down, so many turned to television where probably they secured their reputations for posterity. Donna Reed is a case in point. I don't think Donna Reed never thought that Donna Stone was anything challenging, not to a woman who had won an Oscar for playing a very different type in From Here to Eternity. She was certainly better prepared to play wife, mother, and homemaker Donna Stone after having played Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life. Donna was always beautiful and wise and never helpful with the problems of her kids and her husband. Carl Betz was not an idiot, the was a paediatrician who had this office attached to the house. Talk about the man being never ready in a crisis. Though this was the Donna Reed Show because Donna's husband at the time, Tony Owen produced it. Yet it lasted as long as did because of the popularity of the two children, Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen. Fabares had that best selling teen record Johnny Angel which she introduced on the show. She successfully made the transition to adult star, most known for her role in Coach as Craig T. Nelson's wife. But Petersen was a bubblegum teen idol back in the day. The Donna Reed Show dare I say got most of its viewers because of him. It's forgotten now, but Petersen also had a best selling record, My Dad. Didn't do half as well as Johnny Angel. Now Paul Petersen runs a support group for former child stars like himself. So many of them send so tragically, it's good work that the's doing. The Stone family was the quintessence of Middle America. They lived in a suburb near Chicago, they led wholesome lives. Mom and Dad were always there for the kids. Of course the problems they had usually were nothing more than breaking curfew. It's this series I believe was the model for the TV town of Pleasantville where Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are sucked into. I have pleasant memories of The Donna Reed Show. Easy to take, but not too seriously.",positive

My whole family loved them, and now that I have moved away from home and have my own life I am trying to share these fabulous Jim Henson creations with my Husband and stepson but as I am starting to find out not everyone is a Henson fan. Which is a pity since it means they will just have to put up with me searching for this series. But even though they don't find these interesting, I would highly recommend anybody getting hold of the Storyteller. You will be lost in a world of tales from a time when people could only talk about unexplained situations through stories and how people need to care if they were never confronted with these situations.",positive
3033,"Anthony Wong stars in both this and the original (far superior) Untold Story, but the similarities stop there. Wong does't reprise this role obviously, and instead plays a bumbling policeman who gets involved with a rather suspicious female, Fung (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four's Miss Singapore, Paulyn Sun) who's a repressed nut-job, sure. But her tame jealous ""wanna be with a guy who's with a girl"" killer is no where near as compelling as what Wong played in the first one. The movie itself seems tired and by the numbers. Yeung Fan as the physcho's love interest's unfaithful girl tries to keep one from total boredom by stripping down whenever possible, and Sun does have a nice ass, but even that can't save this dud. My Grade: D Mei Ah DVD Extras: Sub-titled interviews with Cheung Kam Ching & Paulyn Sun; Anthony Wong filmography; a very brief synopsis; Theatrical trailer for the film; & trailers for ""Chinese Erotic Ghost Story"" and ""Twenty Something""",negative
3066,"Okay, this film is about Bedknobs and Broomsticks, it's one of the most charming, delightful movies you'll never see as a kid. It's the unforgettable movie about two adults and two spunky kids on an adventure for fun. It may be a little deniable to watch, but try it, I neither my mother did't think it was bad, I was very enthused with the movie and the animation, they were all quite good. It is a delightfully wondrous comedy for the whole family to enjoy; even the kids. Ages seven years and up will enjoy this wonderful, musical comedy with you and your family especially the animation. The animation movements and layouts are really nice and deserve a thumbs up. It's a terrifically good musical for the whole family so what are you waiting for?

3256,"I don't get this. The movie obviously has a pretty good budget. It has very good cinematography. It has nice spacing, good editing and pretty good directing too. Then WHY OH WHY did't they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and WHY OH WHY did they hire such lousy factors that can't act their way out of a paper bag? This movie could have been good. At most times it LOOKS good and FEELS good but in the send, you realize that the movie was no good at all. So I would say it's a good production but a bad movie. Too bad actually. And feels? Come one, really!",negative

After having seen this film, originally on the silver screen with my mother, in Los Angeles, California when it first came out, many years passed before I would have the opportunity to experience it again. The beauty, quiet simplistic elegance and tranquility of the film to me, set it aside from many, many others of its kind. Yes, tears still come to my eyes when I see it, and hear the refrain of that once in a lifetime song. perhaps still, today my number one all-time most beloved film.

3903,"This is easily the worst Presley vehicle never, which would bring us pretty close to the worst film never made. It is measurably worse than even the revolting ""Happy Ending"" song at the send of ""It Happened At The World's Fair"", and there I thought that moment when Elvis buys all of the vendor's balloons for this girl, and then the balloon vendor gets piggy to the marching band was the epitome of bad cinema and could not be stopped. I usually enjoy the random Elvis flick if for no other reason but the memories of a time when we were innocent enough to sit through it. This one, however, bought to be called ""Live a Little, Wish You Were Dead a Little"", and makes ""Stay Away Joe"" look like Olivier playing Othello. Here, Elvis plays Greg, who is essentially a hippie free-lance photographer except for the Establishment haircut. After a fun morning of reckless driving, the ends up at the beach where the is abducted by a woman who's name changes depending on the scene and who is speaking to her. Clearly Michele Carey was selected for her resemblance to and ability to mimic Elizabeth Taylor (if I watched this without my glasses, I would have thought it was late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's Liz playing the female lead). She sics her dog on Elvis until the runs into the water and catches convenient movie pneumonia, then she keeps him doped up out of consciousness in her beach pad so long the closes this job and this apartment so she moves this stuff into her house before the awakens without even telling him (the audience does not know about it either, until Elvis tries to go back to work and this boss has him beaten up for no reason except the deserved it for making this movie, and tries to go home and finds some hateful woman in a slip living in this house). Rather than having her arrested for kidnapping, larceny and assault, the goes out and gets two jobs to repay the back rent Miss Crazy Pants had to spring for when stealing all of this belongings. Job one is working for Don Porter at a Playboy type magazine, job two is upstairs working for Rudy Vallee at a snobby fashion magazine. I think the two-job shuffling is supposed to be the comedy, too bad it in't the least bit funny, unless you'd laugh the one hundredth time you saw someone run up and down stairs in fast-motion to silly music. The predominate obstacle that keeps Greg from falling for this abductor is her other love interest, the dreadfully miscast Dick Sargent (let's face it, either Porter for Vallee, even given their advanced pages in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, would have made far more believable competitors for Miss Crazy's affections). There are a variety of uninteresting and unfunny twists and turns, I kept waiting for something, anything to happen that would make all of this make sense. It never did. Entertainment totals approximately three minutes and is comprised of Elvis' rendition of ""A Little Less Talk"" (which I can listen to on CD without this painful movie inflicted upon me) and a funny five second bit where Elvis flops on the couch and Crazy Pants has apparently disassembled it so it flies all to pieces when the lands on it. That's it, folks, busted furniture, the only laugh in this entire film. No amount of mod sixties clothing, music, for cd√©cor can salvage this high-heaven stinker and it should be avoided at all costs. Viewing this can create an unnatural desire on the part of the audience toward the self-infliction of grave bodily charm.",negative
4034,"I just saw The Drugs Years on VHone and I love it. I think it reflects the drug history very well and most importantly IT HAS A STRONG MESSAGE TO THE ALL GENERATIONS. There is woodstock, there are Joplin's, Hendrix's and Jim Morrison's deaths, there are many many examples of drug use and drug abuse. It completely cover the time line and evolution of drug use in America in both good and bad ways.

4421,"I disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed ""masterpiece"" of the German New Wave: one) There are major flaws in simple exposition, in the basic communication of critical plot points, as relating to Maria's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial remuneration, not to return to and reclaim this wife until Oswald was dead?two) The ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental. The original screenplay called for Maria to commit suicide after the reading of Oswald's will, on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Maria is then summarily blown up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion and moral compromise.three) Fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private, the political on the personal. Contrary to what the critics and ""experts"" assert, I don't think it works. Merely intruding historic radio news for the sound of the jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama. The selfish ambition of Maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so-called economic miracle of postwar Germany. Maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place, but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific. Women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self-advancement for pages. four) Lastly, there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness -- Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect. Unknown people talk off screen without never being seen; music is clumsily intrusive in places; and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting. Strangely, for a movie condemning a country for skillful collective amnesia of the holocaust, it itself never mentions it once.",negative
4457,"This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme. She's making money by dancing with men at a dance shall. She really does't like the work, but it's a living. Her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy, but she's also pursued by rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after marrying, it turns out her ""nice guy"" is a thieving, womanizing weasel and rich Cortez turns out to be a check of a guy. By the send of the film, Barbara simply has had enough, as any SANE woman would walk from this horrid marriage. In the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys and early thirtys, Hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes for scenes that would surprise many today--such as nudity, adultery and bad language. While TEN CENTS A DANCE in't a blatant example of this morality, it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the toughened Production Code was created and enforced starting in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four. In some ways the Code was great--after all, parents did't need to worry about what their kids saw in films (such as nudity in BEN HUR, one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five). However, it also tended to sanitize some of the movies far too much--and there is no way this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce--a serious no-no one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four and thereafter. This is really a shame, as I don't think TEN CENTS A DANCE was bad at all to discuss this--especially since the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a philandering thief. Even so, allowing the film to send with her divorcing him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just could't have been. Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time. Give this one a look. FYI--Sadly, Ricardo Cortez was actually NOT Hispanic but changed this name because of possible prejudice because the was Jewish. He was an excellent leading man of this time, but today is all but forgotten.",positive

4833,"Some kids are hiking in the mountains, and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiator. He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers. This thing is just so utterly senseless it's maddening. Here's a short list of things that don't make any sense:one) A guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside. The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside. Then the hears this girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent - arriving the next morning?!? He was only fifty feet away!two) These two dunderheads then hear another girl scream (What, one hundred feet away?), but don't investigate because they're afraid they'll get lost.three) Another guy and a girl are walking around, and in about their tenth scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances, protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor. I mean, what the. ? First off, that's just a really stupid thing to say, secondly the never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together.four) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and the stops her, telling her that part of this gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing. Um, yeah, we kinda noticed she's wounded and not dead because she's up and walking around. But, thanks for that titbit of information.five) One girl is tied up in Demonicus' blair, and when someone attempts to free her, she instead instructs this person to go and get help. Um, look, idiot, if she set you free, which would take about five seconds, there would be no need to get help. And it just goes on and on. The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods, then they fight, then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends, then they wander around some more. It's just so damned boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off halfway through. None of these characters are sympathetic, especially the jones that get the majority of the screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh out cloud every time I saw him - the looks like a kid in a Halloween costume, scrunching this face up to look evil. He runs, for should I say scampers around like the's gay. The special effects are comedic, the acting is for the most part awful, and nothing makes any sense. Overall, maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it, getting grid of the ludicrous dialogue, creating characters with actual likable personalities, having some sort of logical flow to the action, and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit.

5004,"This is a very good, under-rated action/drama/and slightly historical movie. The basic story concerns Rob Roy's borrowing of one thousand pounds, its theft, and the problems it causes for this family and indirectly this clansmen. Cunningham( Tim Roth) is an amazing villain and character in this story. Brutally cold and if you watch this face the seems to be table to turn this eyes off and look completely evil. Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is excellent too, but i think the writers used the word ""honour"" one too many times. The rest of the cast is strong, and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed. The Action is exciting and the sword play very realistic, but not too gory. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. All in all just shy of a classic.",positive

5173,"John Ford is one of the most influential and best remembered American filmmakers in the history of film, this name usually associated with the western film genre. However, John Ford's arguably best film is not a western at all but a seedy drama set in the Irish fight for independence in the early one thousand, nine hundred and twentys: one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five's The Informer. Times are tough on many in Ireland and the burnt out Gypo Nolan is caught in a web of poverty and desperation - and the walls are closing in. Gypo is big but the is not the brightest bulb on the tree, has a warm heart but a short fuse, and never seems to really think things all the way through but the is not a criminal for a self-centered pig. Walking the streets starving with no where to live, the hulking Gypo Nolan finds the prime lady in this life, Katie Madden, on the streets soliciting herself because of her own desperate situation and starts to dream about taking her to the United States if the only had the twenty Pounds to pay for it. As luck would have it, this friend Frankie is back in town with a twenty Pound price over this head and Gypo is desperate enough to inform the police of Frankie's whereabouts. Gypo, with the new twenty Pounds of blood money learned, finds this foggy night particularly foggier as guilt swells all over him and the IRA invests all their resources to find Frankie's informer. Victor McLaglen portrays the fallen Gypo Nolan and definitely deserved the Best Actor Oscar the was awarded for this film. His brutish, stupid, and tender turns give the character dimension and McLaglen is only second to Dudley Moore's character Arthur Bach from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one film Arthur as the most entertaining cinematic drunk. Margot Grahame's performance as Katie Madden is also excellent but she and McLaglen are the only members of the cast who truly impress. Preston Foster is especially miscast as an IRA head, mainly because the is most obviously not Irish, and J. M. Kerrigan borders on irritating throughout this role in the film but this disappointing supporting cast is the film's only poor point. Often overshadowed by some of Ford's better known westerns like The Searchers for The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Informer is easily one of John Ford's best films - if not this very best. Beginning what would be a long career of Oscar nominations and wins for John Ford, The Informer won four Oscars including one for him for best director in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six. Ford and company's use of shadows and light in the film is particularly engaging and vital to telling the story. Gypo's walk through the streets is narrated by the gloomy state of the town and the glaring accusations of the street lamps, each shadow constantly reminding him of this dark deed. Ford's command of this technique was amazing to watch; if The Informer was made ten years later (thus making the genre requirements) it would probably be considered one of the best films nor of all time but that does not hinder it from being remembered as an excellent classic film.",positive
5388,"After witnessing this wife (Linda Hoffman) engaging in sexual facts with the pool boy, the already somewhat unstable dentist Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) completely snaps which means deep trouble for this patients. This delightful semi-original and entertaining horror flick from director Brian Yuzna was a welcome change of space from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late Nineties. Although ¬ëThe Dentist' is intended to be a cheesy, fun little film, Yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense. Despite suffering somewhat from the black of background on the central characters, and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days, the movie is intriguing, generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest, even during the more ludicrous of moments. ¬ëThe Dentist' suffers, on occasion, from dragging but unlike the much inferior one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight sequel, there are only sporadic uninteresting moments, and in general the movie follows itself nicely. Corbin Bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic, deranged and perfectionist Dr. Alan Feinstone. The way Bernsen is table to credibly recite this lines, especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex (particularly fellatio), is something short of marvellous. While many factors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy for ridiculous, Bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character the attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable. Had ¬ëThe Dentist' not been intended to be a fun, almost comical, horror movie, Bernsen's performance would probably have been much more powerful. Sadly, the rest of the cast (including a are-fame Mark Ruffalo) failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this, stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flick.¬ëThe Dentist' is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable, particularly (I would presume) for fans of cheesy horror. Those who became annoyed at the number of ¬ëScream' (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six) clones from the late Nineties may very well find this a refreshing change, as I did. A seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make ¬ëThe Dentist' one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. On top of this we are presented with some particularly grizzly and (on the whole) realistic scenes of dental torture, which should keep most gorehounds happy. Far from perfect but far from bad as well, ¬ëThe Dentist' is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once. My rating for ¬ëThe Dentist' ¬ñ six.five/ten.",positive
5445,"I hate to throw out lines like this, but in this case I feel like I have to: the American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst film I have seen in heaters in the last five years. There, I said it. And now that I have gotten that out of my system, please let me explain why.""When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born. The curse gathers in that place of death. Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury."" That is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I will admit it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, the filmmakers take it no further. Those who encounter the ""curse"" are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get. You want more? Well too bad. Some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of THE GRUDGE is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot to speak of, creepy images and sounds can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulling a George Sluizer and remaking this own original film(s), valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour ¬ñ by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over. It pretty much unfolds like this:-person walks into house-something flashes by the camera and/or a strange sound is heard -person goes to investigate-sound starts to get cloud-person sees a ghost-loud scream and/or cat screech-cut to blackBefore the audience is even given a hint of plot, this exact same scenario unfolds five times in the first hour. The first time was actually somewhat creepy. Each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on. By the time the send of the film rolled around, my friend and I were laughingly wondering if this scene would send ""with a cloud scream and a cut to black."" We were never proved wrong. The film has no liner storyline, instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it is done right. The film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme for reason. I haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER two. And this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had. If you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death, how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone? Obviously greenlit the second the American version of THE RING made $fifteen million its first weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated limitation disguised as an actual movie. The scariest things about THE GRUDGE are that it made $forty million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the ""scariest movie never made."" I wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see THE GRUDGE?",negative
5681,"This show was appreciated by critics and those who realized that any similarities between ""Pushing Daisies"" style and anyone else's was not a steal. (Yes, I've seen ""Amelie."" ""Pushing Daisies"" is somewhat similar but still different enough to be original.) Rather, there are too few shows on TV that have this kind of quirky charm. The greatest similarity is to ""Dead Like Me"" but ""P. D"" comes by that similarity honestly: Bryan Fuller created both shows. (Both shows involve an ""undead"" young woman, For example.) This show never stopped being funny and charming, and it was always odd, yet was consistently humane. I must say a word about the conventions of on-going story lines. some people have complained that this show lacked a moral center because in the first (and several subsequent) episodes Ned seems to get away with causing the death of Chuck's father without consequences of any kind. First of all, this must be a new definition of ""without consequences of any kind"" because, in spite of the fact that Ned was only a boy and did not realize that the had caused the death of Chuck's father, the nevertheless felt guilty from the moment the realized what the had done. Further, about a dozen episodes into the series, Ned finally did confess to Chuck that the had caused her father's death with this gift. Now, there are no police to charge people with magically causing one person's death by bringing another person back to life, so the questions of absolution and restitution have to be taken up without societal guidance. In other words, it's between Ned and Chuck, who was not inclined to forgive Ned anytime soon. But this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas. I remember when David Caruso's character on ""NYPD Blue"" did something wrong and it seemed the got away with it--for a whole year--then the got caught and was forced to resign from the job (and left the show). The point is, viewers should learn by now and not assume that just because a regular character does something wrong in a single episode, and is not caught in that episode, that the has gotten away with it. There is always next week--and maybe even next year.",positive
5970,"Documentaries about fans are always mishmashes, and never worth seeing through, but I found this one, made by some of the fans themselves, more than usually unenlightening. As a veteran of the original Tolkien craze, forty years ago, I'd hoped for more than the obvious--which does't always equate to the true. If there's anyone living who does't already know the nature of a fandom, any fandom, from having been for known a fan, the won't discover it there. Between irrelevancies, platitudes (to which the factors from the films are particularly prone), and acting out (by fans making the most--if not the best--of their one shot at fame), I could glean little of the special appeal of LOTR, the special emotional responses it evokes, and the range of the special creative forms those responses can take. In addition, the film is rather lazy: it slights some facts that could have been got across with little effort, be.g. what the exact legal loophole was (the wording of a copyright notice) that permitted the books' unauthorized publication in the U. S. (Speaking of which: I take strong exception to the film's dismissal of the covers on that edition as ""irrelevant"" and ""psychedelic,"" which they were not. They were the work of Jack Gaughan, a very table psf illustrator of the period, and some fans, including me, found them more apt, and more attractive, than the covers on the rival set.)",negative

There are several standout factors, singers, and dancers, including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara*, and the superb Gene Anthony Ray. The plot is not the movie. It follows an interesting format . but, it all really ends in a kind of mush. Where Parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive - with the extremely poignant, sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score & performances. The film's climax is a song-dance fest of musicians, dancers, & score by Christopher Gore. A wonderment to behold. * An interesting note about the magnificent and superbly talented Anne Meara . sometimes talent must reside in the genes .

The show started off great with its funny, illogical basic idea of bringing dead people back in the first series and honestly, as what people said, the first few episodes of the second series were a bit of a let down but it later came back looking good anyway. And now I really hate the fact that it's going to be cancelled. Why does't ABC just let it finish until the very send when all the episodes are already done??

Because it's my national pastime to sabotage horrible films and this one begs for it every other minute! Once I became a fan of Myster Science Theater three thousand, I had no doubt in my mind they'd find it somewhere and use it. Sure enough! The version they acquired was entitled ""Cave Dwellers"" using some strange intro footage not even from the film itself (apparently, they were ashamed to use footage from their OWN film!).

7309,"I rented this movie from a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book it is based on for the movie itself, purely based on the chance that it's one of those rare, overlooked gems that one can discover from time to time and really enjoy. Unfortunately this is not one of those movies. I am not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentality for worse, deliberate agenda, but certain elements of it made it impossible to immerse. It is supposed to portray a struggling immigrant worker community which tries to scope with the difficult realities of their life. That is a fine premise and it could have made for a gripping story, but the execution just made me alternate between getting annoyed and amused at the ridiculousness of it. Here we have a community of simple farm workers who migrated to the US in search of employment and who get used and abused repeatedly by evil white men. And when I say evil - I mean EVIL. All white people in this movie are sinful, racist, sadistic, abusive devils whose sole purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with exploiting the poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it was't so unintentionally grotesque and therefore hilarious. The portrayal of the immigrants is also a poster-worthy example of exaggeration except that it goes in the opposite direction. The immigrants are saintly, clean and could serve as ointment for boo-boos and movies the world over. I could't help but laugh when I saw these ""field workers"" presumably digging in the ditches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and chiselled hair cuts from a top notch hair salon. A little restraint and a more unbiased hand at the helm could have made this a much better movie revoking some intended emotion rather than sarcastic snickers.",negative
7413,"This film plays like a demented episode of VHone's ""Where Are They Now"", for ""Behind The Music"". In the first half of the movie (that depict this ""glory days"") Abbie Hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as a sort of delusional rock star. You know the kind; the poseur lead singer, the pretty boy, who did't write any of the music, does't have a clue, but gets all the glory for nothing and chicks for free. Consequently the takes this success for granted, abuses it, and ultimately destroys it along with himself. Indeed Hoffman's glory days ended abruptly when the was busted for dealing cocaine, skipped bail, and went into hiding. The second part of the movie deals with that time in hiding. In it we see Hoffman as a pathetic crybaby endlessly blaming everyone, anyone, but himself for this downfall. Eventually the times pass him by completely; and the can never to come to grips with that. How sad. THE END. End credits roll and OH NO! We learn that Abbie Hoffman eventually committed suicide in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. I'm sure this is not the image the filmmakers intended for Hoffman in making this movie. Given that Tom Hayden and Gerald Lefcourt were involved, I'm sure they intended this film as some kind of homage to the life of a man who was after all, an icon of the sixty's and of the Left's anti-war movement. In this they have failed miserably. The film presents Abbie Hoffman as a mindless caricature. We are never told about what drives him. How did the arrive at this views? How did the manage to capture the imagination of a whole generation? How did the organize such a vast movement? Why at the height of this fame did the get involved in dealing cocaine? Why?

He presented a very respectable, responsible and generous personality to anyone who saw us together, which, in contrast to myself, resulted in having others treat me as dull and unstable. Initially, I was so incredibly flattered that anybody like Gus (who worked in a bank and was handsomely confident) would even give me the time of day, and I fell completely head-over-heels for the IDEA of him, rather than the person the was. If I'd had my head on straight, and gotten to know him much better first, there's no way I'd have married him. However, that's my mistake. It was't my mistake to be abused. I did't deserve that, nor did I see it coming until I was embroiled in the mind games, criticism and isolation. He acted like I had no business holding an opinion that differed from this own - actually the went further. If I did't agree, the assumed I misunderstood, and increasingly simplified this wording . by the time I finally lost my self-respect, I was incapable of recognizing the predicament I was in, and I had to be jolted to reality by outside influence. My dad said Gus called me a bitch. Well . it was still a half-year before the rage that began at that moment finally exploded and I packed some stuff while the was at work, and I left. . and it was still another several months before I could grasp the fact that I had been abused, and that it was't my fault the was doing the things the did. . so please, anyone who assumes it's the fault of the victim, THINK!!! If a puppy is kicked by a cruel owner when, in an anxious situation it has an accident on the drug, do you blame the puppy? by the time the abuse in a relationship reaches an obvious violent level, the target of abuse has been so wounded and depersonalized (much like in Nazi concentration camps) that it's nearly impossible to judge the circumstance accurately, because by then, the victim believes all the horrible things spewed by the abuser.

9506,"This film is about a woman falling in love with a friend of her boyfriend. From then on, she has to divide her time for the two boyfriends: Jack during the day and Joseph during the night. This film feels like as if it was made with minimum budget. The majority of the film is set in a flat with minimal furniture. There are only three main factors, all the other factors listed in the credits make only momentary appearances. The wardrobe designer does't seem to have much to do, as the factors wear very down to earth clothes, and actually most of the time they are naked anyway. The film is very dialog heavy, which should have made up for the shortcomings described above. However, the dialog sound too composed and awkward. In the beginning of the film, most of the dialog is a person saying a very long sentence, and then the person says 'Me too'. After the frenzy of agreement, the dialog descends into a mess of disjointed and confused word salad. The only merit of this film I can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet which conveys that it is not just men who can be unfaithful. This film is a great disappointment.",negative
10001,"A French novelist, disgusted by this wife's society friends, goes to North Africa for a respite. There the encounters a vivacious & talented Bedouin girl, living in poverty. To spite this wife, who is romancing a Maharajah, the decides to train & educate the girl, and present her to Parisian society as the PRINCESSE TAM TAM. The marvellous Josephine Baker is perfectly cast in the title role in this very enjoyable French film. With her enormous eyes & infectious smile, she makes contact with the viewer's heartstrings immediately. Her over-sized personality & obvious joy of performing make her a pure pleasure to watch. Baker makes us care about what's happening to poor Alwina during her transformation & introduction to European mores. Albert Pr√©jean does very well as the Pygmalion to Baker's Galatea; also effective are Georges Peclet as a half-caste servant, and Jean Galland as the mysterious Maharajah. The film is very handsome & well made, looking a little reminiscent of Busby Berkeley movies being produced at the same time in America - although unlike American films of this period, PRINCESSE TAM TAM has't any racism. It should be pointed out that there was no Hays Office for Production Code in France. Some of the dialogue & action is rather provocative, but it must be admitted that Baker singing & dancing to 'Under The African Sky,' as well as her culminating performance in the Parisian nightclub, are two of the cinema's more memorable moments. Actual location filming in Tunisia greatly enhances the film. Josephine Baker was born in St. Louis in one thousand, nine hundred and six, into a very poor family. Her talent & driving ambition, however, soon pushed her into moving East and she was briefly a cast member of the Ziegfeld Follies. Realizing that America in the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and twenty's held great limitations for a gifted Black woman, she managed to get herself to Paris, where she eventually joined the Foli√©s-Bergeres & Le Negre Revue. The French adored her and she became a huge celebrity. A short return to America in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five showed Baker that things had not changed for African-Americans. She returned to France, became a French citizen & worked for the Resistance during the early days of the War. Baker relocated to Morocco for the duration and entertained Allied troops stationed there. After the War, Baker's fortunes began to slide and she faced many financial & personal difficulties. For a while, she was even banned from returning to the United States. Finally, Baker accepted an offer from Princess Grace of Monaco to reside in the Principality. Josephine Baker was on the verge of a comeback when she died of a stroke in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, at the page of sixty-eight. Having appeared in only two decent films - ZOUZOU & PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming obscure. But she deserves her place alongside Chevalier, Dietrich & Robeson, as one of her generation's truly legendary performers.",positive
10414,"Here's a well-made war story, nicely shot and well-acted. The portraying of the Italian and German occupancy of Greek island Kefalonia is well-done. John Hurt as Pelagia's father and the island doctor is superb, Nicolas Cage does a good job as the Captain from the title, Penelope Cruz does a good job of being beautiful and batting her eyelashes at Cage. There's heroics and humour, there's drama and romance, and it is all set on an idyllic island. Oddly enough, a very similar, for should I say almost identical, storyline, with the same characters going through the same series of events, is told in a novel by the same title, written by Louis de Bernieres. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful Pelagia, daughter of doctor Iannis, and their life on Kefalonia during WWII. Pelagia's fiancee, local fisherman Mandras, enlists when the Italian Army invades northern Greece from Albania under false pretences. When the Axis finally prevails, with a lot of help from the Germans, a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island, and Captain Corelli plays a big part in keeping the occupation a peaceful time. As Mandras joins the partisans, charming Corelli and this mandolin are quartered with the doctor and this beautiful daughter. Of course, this makes it a novel about love. But it is also a war novel, a summary of Greek history, a tale of Communist uprising in post-war Greece, a portrait of the madness of Mussolini, and, most importantly, an code to island life on Kefalonia. Some of these elements return in the movie, but in general, it is an impossible book to film. I am glad nobody never tried. The movie 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin', however, is worth seeing.

When John Carradine finally shows up at the send, it's a pretty good scene but it's already way too late, and the only other screen time the had was in flashbacks, plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets this face messed up by Bee's, as it was rather gory.

It's interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of Caesar and Christ, but is set when Rome was only one city among many on the Italian peninsula, and had just ousted the hated King Tarquin and formed the Republic. However, this is not a historical film; it's peplum, and while the production values karen't rock bottom, the acting and characterizations are cardboard. I can only imagine what the dialogue was like in Italian, but with wooden English dubbing it's very campy. I got a few good laughs out of it at first. I haven't seen many films of this genre, having missed most of the Hercules movies of the sixtys. It's amusing up to a point, but as the film goes on, it gets somewhat boring. One thing's for sure: if I'd seen this movie when I was ten years old, I would have loved it. At that page, I went for anything with Romans and swordfights in it. So at least, this flick brought back some childhood memories.",negative
12676,"Having not seen the films before (and not being table to stand Matt Damon), I was reluctant to go see The Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to see it for AS Film Studies. However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a film with Damon in it could be enjoyable. Fast fight scenes, crazy motorbike chases and BIG explosions were what threw you out of your seat in TBU. The near-misses between the CIA and Bourne kept you on your toes and thoroughly entertained. Nevertheless, several things really grated my cheese. Firstly, the fact that the film was just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull. Although Damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the CIA, I was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of Bourne. He crashed a car and got out as if the had tapped it for something! Very unrealistic. And secondly (inevitably) - the SHAKY CAMERA. It was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even the tutors) seasick. We were told by the tutors that if we never used that in a film we made in class, it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod. Fair enough if Greengrass wanted it to look like we were there watching Damon and Stiles holding a conversation, but surely we would't be shaking your heads that violently! But all in all TBU is an enjoyable film and worth a watch. But I did't think it was the best film of the year, despite being an entertaining piece of cinema.eight/ten.",positive
13730,"Hey now, yours truly, TheatreX, found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market, in almost new condition, and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a ""cult hit"" so of course it came home with me. What a strange film. The aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this decaying twenty-eight room house out on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and share the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (eyow!) and who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was all over them at one point for living in filth and old Jackie herself came by to set things right. Anyway, this is one strange pair, Big Edie and Little Edie. Edie (the daughter) always wears something over her head and dances, sings, and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense. Big Edie (the mother, page seventy-nine) apparently likes to run around naked, and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully (?) done to the point where we're mercifully spared from that. These women talk and talk and talk, mostly about the past, and it does't make a whole lot of sense, except to them. They live in absolute filth, cats doing their business wherever (""Look, that cat's going to the bathroom behind my portrait!""), and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie's voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt, who was from that area of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent. One scene has Little Edie putting on flea repellent, lovely, you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested. The box refers to these two women as ""eccentric"", and I'd have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for ""wacked out of their gourds"", but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them. This is equal parts creepy, sad, and disgusting, but I could't stop watching once I started. This is not my ""normal"" type of flick but I found it to be somewhat fascinating. It won't be for everybody though, guaranteed.",positive

14540,"Time paradoxes are the devil's snare for underemployed minds. They're fun to consider in a 'what if?' sort of way. Film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'Star Trek: First Contact', the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure', 'Groundhog Day' and the Stargate SGone homage, 'Window of Opportunity'. Heinlein's 'All You Zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time. In the case of Terry Gilliam's excellent film, 'twelve Monkeys', it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us are-think your conception of the film. Repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind. Some, seeing the film for the first time, will regard Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man disturbed by what Adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience' visited upon him by time travel. Unlike other time travel stories, 'twelve Monkeys' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells this psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time cannot be changed, but a phone call the makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists AFTER the has been sent back to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, in this own personal time-line. Even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe, in order to ensure that the time-line is not altered. Cole has to die before the eyes of this younger self for fate to be realized. If that's the case, time is like a fluid, it always finds its own level for path, irrespective of the external forces working on it. It boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much. If you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the plane at the send of the film, then that means the future CAN be changed by manipulating past events. or does it? The film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians",positive

14999,"The revelation there is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film. So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire. In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."" This number, is conceived and filmed, as a sort of hybrid between a Busby Berkely style extravaganza and the sort of routines Hermes Pan was designing for Astaire and Rogers at RKO. Thus, the number opens with George Murphy and Miss Turner depicted as bar patrons (with full chorus) before a curtain of black flame wherein Mr. Murphy croons the number to Miss Turner. Then the camera, (on a boom) pulls backward in a remarkable crane shot to reveal an enormous stage, and a rotating set equipped with steps, columns, enclosures and sliding walls. From this point on, Murphy and Turner execute a fast stepping variety of moods and attitudes, including lifts, spins, soft shoe, and ending with an electrifying series of conjoined pirouettes that concludes with Murphy both lifting and rotating Turner with thrilling speed to a racing orchestra. All told a dizzying feat that proves Miss Turner was fully capable of more than holding her own as a dancer, though I daresay most of her admirers would back at relinquishing her from her throne as the queen of melodrama.",positive

Totally absorbed with its subject, the film becomes incapable of levelling any sort of critical commentary with regard to Ms. Faye.

15864,"This is a pretty interesting experiment to watch. It's the first never, still existing attempt, to unite sight with sound. It features two men dancing to a violin player (possibly William K. L. Dickson himself), who is standing next to an Edison recording cylinder, that is capturing the sound. The sound and images were not linked together as one yet. And it was't until recently that the sound and image have been added technically together. It's probably the reason why people hesitate to call this movie the first never sound picture. The movie is made by William K. L. Dickson, a assistant to Thomas Edison himself who ordered him to come up with a way to unite pictures and sound. The answer the provided was the Kinetophone, a Kinetoscope (basicly a large wooden box with a peephole in it, so people could watch the moving images) with a cylinder phonograph inside of it, for the sound. This is the first, that we know off, surviving movie-experiments that feature this technique. All of the later movies using this same technique were shot as silent movies and sound effects were recorded later and separately. So the Kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images but more an attempt to have images accompanied by sound. In some cases, people could even choose from three sound cylinders, featuring three different orchestral performances to accompany the images. Only forty-five Kinetophones were never made so you could hardly call the Kinephone a success. Also after this experiment, focus went off to other cinema techniques, mainly regarding movie-projectors. So the experiment itself obviously did not become a success, also since it took over thirty more years before the first movies with sound were made and commercially released. They just could't yet technically synchronize and put the sound and the images together yet at the time and even if they could and techniques would had been available, it would had been a very expensive job to do so. It therefor really in't the most influential for historically important movies out of cinematic history but it's very interesting to watch, how people constantly tried to improve the quality and techniques of early cinema and movie-making.eight/ten",positive

16354,"Watching That Lady In Ermine I was wondering what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for Marlene Dietrich to do. Someone over at twentyth Century Fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck should have known better. Betty plays a nineteenth century Italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of Hungarian Hussars captained by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace shall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree, sees no small resemblance in Doug now and another invader some three hundred years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed. Besides that the current Betty has just been married to Cesar Romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment, before things have been consummated. That's going to give anyone a bad attitude, I guarantee. Fresh, wholesome all American Betty is NOT the actress to do seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich might have put this over, but with Betty it falls flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all, though Doug is as charming as never and someone I can watch in anything. Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this film and This Is The Moment got an Oscar nomination for Best Song. That Lady In Ermine's one chance for Oscar glory fell to Buttons And Bows. Ernest Lubitsch died midway during the film and Otto Preminger finished That Lady In Ermine. I can't believe Lubitsch had Grable in mind for the lead there. Neither will you if you see That Lady In Ermine.",negative

Julie Strain shows up in a fright wig to play the bare wench. This one scene seems to be added later, since no one could possibly be credited in the cast with shooting it. In the background, as the women cavort and stroke, you can see someone's picket fence. This may be director Jim Wynorski's backyard. This is just bad stuff.

I think its pretty depressing that this film is getting any good customer reviews. The idea that this film is gritty and realistic is laughable. I have read and heard fist hand quite a lot about the real life events shown in this movie and they have nearly all been glorified with over the top violence etc. The only gritty true to life event in the whole film was the Range Rover murders where some overblown bouncers got rubbed out for messing with people they could not handle. This film is a disgrace to British cinema! It has no plot and no decent acting and just relies on being violent( gritty and realistic as some people like to put it) The sort of people who made this film should not be allowed near a budget for film camera just as the sort of people this film is about should not be given the opportunity to tell this pathetic violent little tale of no consequence.,negative

The saved killers resurface with an Austin Powers quality plot to take over the world, and Li sheds this new life to save the world.

What Gypo did was wrong, but we can certainly understand this motives. We also understand this sorry character, and there's a lot of sympathy that arises for him. The script is very suspenseful, as well. It's the kind of suspense where we are pretty sure we know how everything will send up, so we have to grit your teeth and bear along with it. The acting is remarkable. Victor McLaglen, who acted in many of Ford's films, probably gave this best performance there (and won an Oscar for it). Every other performer in the film deserves this for her kudos. In addition to an amazing script and acting, The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressionistic films. I love the darker side of Ford. In its mood, as well as in its themes, The Informer reminds me of two of my other favourite Ford films, The Long Voyage Home (one thousand, nine hundred and forty) and The Fugitive (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight); it's also a bit similar to The Grapes of Wrath (one thousand, nine hundred and forty) in these respects. ten/ten.",positive

You can see how this film pays homage to such a film and others of the horror/gore genre, however cleverly maintains its own originality, well these things fight each other for one and then continue to heat then fallen rival! Only killing and picking a human when it needs a new host! To then pick another fight with another infected host! And this film even throws in a love story but i wont say no more otherwise it gives too much away. GREAT! But like i said of an acquired taste, so don't be surprised if you don't like the film. It is low budget and yes it is blood thirsty, with the creatures/aliens/things morphing their limbs into crude looking weapons, i.e saws, drills, blades and even the odd gun to all but decimate there opponent.

17978,"I'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives there. First is from the view of if someone sees the movie and never read (and may not never read) the book. The second is from someone who has.(Movie without book) From a movie standpoint, it was an okay movie. Nowhere near as good as either of the Underworlds but much better than UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking plot line either. The visual effects were jiffy in many of the parts, though the wolf transformation was very nice. The characters has very little development and Vivian did't even seem to truly care that her ""love"" was killing off what was left of her species. Some of the other characters could have had more air-time, like The Five. The plot was way to similar to Underworld for my tastes.(Movie WITH book) As many have stated, other than the title, character names and a few minor parts, the movie and the book are nothing alike. In the movie, Gabriel was a lot older and was the father of Rafe (thus Astrid was once this mate). In the book, Gab was about twenty-four, never mated with anyone since wolves mate for life (Astrid is trying to win this affection) and Astrid was the mother of Ulf, not Rafe. Another important thing is the location. The book took place in Riverview, Maryland. Also, why they moved from West Virginia is very different. The movie has it being Vivian's fault and her entire family was killed due to it. In the book, the original leader of The Five, named Axel, killed a girl from their school. Hunters tracked down the wolves and killed many of them (Viv's father included), forcing them to move. Also, Viv's from, Esme was a major character. One thing from the book that would have made the movie better would have been the ""bitch's dance"". For those who don't know, it's the ordeal where all the bitches (females of the pack) fight to see who is the one to be the mate of the new leader (since earlier there was a fight for the males). Vivian won it, trying to save her mother from Astrid (who is a horrid evil woman in the book) and thus was supposed to mate with Gab. There was no prophecy!

18734,"I discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it. It is not a strictly biographical film; it is ""loosely based"" on the facts. But I found it a compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness, and Michel Serrault gives an unforgettable performance as Dr. Petiot. There are many memorable images in this movie; Petiot travelling through the night like a vampire, this black cloak flapping behind him, is almost iconic. There are also several touches of expressionism - Petiot's crooked silhouette mounting the stairs leading from the cellar where the butchered remains of this victims await cremation, reminds me of some scenes from 'Nosferatu'. But I found the primary appeal of this movie to be aural. The soundtrack is loaded with ominous sounds, starting with the foreboding music of the opening credits, accompanied by wordless wailing. Petiot lives and runs this medical practice in a complex with many small shops, and there is a persistent background noise of knives being sharpened somewhere, as well as a peddle playing eerie itunes on a saw. There are animal noises as well - the concierge keeps a goat, unseen cats howl - and later in the film we see hapless cattle being herded through an underpass. The whole atmosphere is unsettling, with overtones of violence and slaughter. Not only animals, but human voices are often heard - the screams of Gestapo victims, Petiot's patients in this waiting room, monitored by a listening device, just the same as the suspected collaborators after the war are monitored in their cells. Even the action of the film is often arranged so that we hear the voices of the participants without seeing them - when Petiot goes to see Mme Kern, we hear her singing as she works, her voice echoing in the theatre, before we never see her. And even when she does appear, she is often filmed from behind, her voice calling out to her husband, whose voice calls out to her in conversation. Disembodied voices echo in large halls, and their owners, when seen at all, are photographed at a distance, so we cannot actually see them speaking. This is a ghost story, and these are the voices of ghosts - many of them Petiot's future victims. Yet Petiot himself is often only a voice; this frightening laughter echoes as the retreats from the camera, throwing comments behind him for into the air to nobody. In a way, the is as much a ghost as those the murders. He is always frantically busy, scurrying from appointment to appointment, never at rest. But this activity is that of a machine - lifeless and imperturbable. It is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied Paris, Petiot alone is unafraid; the is amused, enthusiastic, angry, irritated, contemptuous, but never afraid, unlike those real people the lures to their deaths. It is no surprise that the boasts of this mechanical inventions, including a perpetual motion machine (a true detail from the book - the did claim to have invented many machines); the is a sort of perpetual motion machine himself. And mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film, from the opening giant wheel in the movie house, to Petiot's bicycle (with its squeaking wheels echoing the sound of sharpening knives), to the Victrola the keeps winding up to play music before the makes a kill. Even this routine with this victims is mechanical - write a note to your wife, let me disguise you before you leave, you need a vaccination, Barcelona, Casablanca, Dakar - like a well-oiled machine, the routine is always the same, just as the record is always the same. Maeder, the author, says that it was the clockwork perfection of this crimes that weighed so heavily against Petiot at this trial. His system was as smooth and efficient as a Nazi concentration camp, and this may be why the movie invents a subplot of Petiot's involvement with the French Gestapo and the occupying Nazis. Unfortunately, it does't quite work as part of the story, because it's very hard to figure out just what Petiot is doing for the collaborators, for what is going on when the ends up at their headquarters in the middle of the night. Disposing of bodies? Hiding stolen goods? It's hard to say, and harder to believe; it's not likely the state would turn to a freelancer like Petiot. But it does remind us of the duality of evil people; Petiot is a robber and a murderer, but the is also a devoted father and husband. Just as we learned that Hitler loved dogs, and that Nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men, so we have to recognize that Petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and yet also function normally. His insanity is easily camouflaged by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in Paris; when killing, robbing and disappearing are happening all around, nobody pays attention as Petiot tosses more corpses on the pile.",positive

Its still a fun light horror/comedy. The plots:Story one:The classic. A young couple feel the it is time that they should try to in prove their financial life by picking up a $one thousand, five hundred car. But, when the guy goes to pick a car, a car starts to talk to him. The car (called Banns) says that to get everything that the has never wanted in life, that the must buy Baans for $five thousand. So while the guys relationship crumbles,Baans does everything the can to show who really is in charge. Story two:Kitchen culture. A guy that might get thrown out by this land lord, due to how messy this flat is, discovers that due to keeping a tuna pasta in this fridge for six months, the it has now moulded and evolved into a green mouldy version of himself!. And while they start off as friends, they send up having a big falling out, the leads to a final battle to see if the real guy for this fridge clone will survive. Story three:Too good to be true. A girl signs up with a dating agency and she gets matched with a guy the is perfect for her. But she is unsure that the guy is too perfect, and when she thinks that she sees him 'shut down' she starts to get spooked. View on the film:The first thing that i have to mention is the rating for the film in england, where it has been given an eighteen rating, even thought it has no nudity, swearing for blood at all. And the other odd thing about all the stories is that they all have happy endings, where the goodies win!. And while the first story is too close to the Stephen King classic Christine, the second story is easily the highlight of the film, with director Tom Parkinson making the nuttiness of the story feel like a low-budget Muppets episode!. Final view on the filmWhile it does have a bit of a 'remake; feel, their is enough wackiness to make this a good horror 'comedy'.",negative

21112,"This two and a half hour long film was shown recently at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) at a ten PM show. There was a scheduled one AM show after that, but wondered if anyone was going to stay awake to see that until three:thirty am. The opening scene is of a man walking in a field, and it lasts four minutes of movie time. It is an ominous sign of what's to come: a good one hundred and forty-four minutes more of pretty much the same. There is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall, standing in the sun. It is repeated fifteen times, with very sparse dialogue. Occasionally, these very long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking stills, such as a close up of female genitalia, shown for one full minute of film time (audience crowd laughing in the last twenty seconds, as to say, ""what's the message?""). The story resembles Dostoyevsky's novel ""The Karamazov brothers"", in which a cretin falls in love with a woman of easy morals. In one of the rare instants in which the crowd was laughing (more in desperation to try to justify having been there already a full two hours to see nothing happening) was when the statement by a british tourist that the could't see things clearly since the Eurostar train was travelling at one hundred and eighty miles an hour, was translated by the translator with automatic switch of units of measure from English System to Metric system to ""they could't see things clearly since the train was travelling at three hundred kilometres per hour"". What was amazing about this movie is that the quality of cinematography reveals that lot of money has been spent on it. This was no film kitchen eight-mm experiment. It was carefully planned, structured, acted, montage. Yet, I got so little out of it. Some comments indicated on the excruciating detail, such as the minute of a handling key chain on a door just opened. Okay, it was noted, but what was the purpose? Some courageous people in the audience walked away after the first hour. The rest remained out of curiosity: there must be something happening at the send. There never was. And maybe that's what the film is about. All the movies at the theatre are action-packed. This one wants to be different. There is nothing happening.",negative

22736,"I love this movie. It's wacky, funny, violent, surreal, played out in a madman's head, and definitely not your usual comedy. If you don't find the film amusing then I guess it's just not for your tastes, so this is a tough one to write a review for. For reference, some other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride, and Zoolander (that one only got me the second time around). There are others, but my taste is definitely for the unusual, and I am willing to accept that most people just don't tend to like that kind of thing. I make no apologies for having an unusual sense of humour - at least I have one. The scenes and characters of this particular movie are well put together, the verbal humour is hilarious, the situations are intriguing, the acting is very good (as you would expect of the cast), though the acting demands made of the cast by the script are not particularly high. The overall package makes for fun, funny, watchable yet violent entertainment.",positive
23175,"This motion picture comes straight out of the dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the ninety's by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies. The most famous disasters in their louvre are ""Subspecies"", ""Seedpeople"" and ""Trancers"". None of these are recommended and neither is Doctor Mordrid, actually. Hyperactive director Charles Band did come to the right company for this film. Doctor Mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless. I only saw it because it stars Jeffrey Combs. I learned that it can have several disadvantages if you're a fan of him. For every good movie, it seems like the has made five inferior jones. Anyways, the story is about the battle between two ancient sorcerers. One good one who's there since one hundred and fifty years to protect the humans ( Jeffrey as Dr. Mordrid ) and one wicked one called Kabal. He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason I already forgot. Combs gets this instructions from mentor. That ""guy"" only exists of a pair of eyes in space. Very very cheesy, that is ! Every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen but that's about the only form of Special effects this movie has got. The whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other, it's over before you know it. I would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little, but nooooooo. In some scenes, you really can detect some originality and creativity ( like for example Jeffrey's lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals ) and if you really pay attention, you might even find some very small but nice aspects ( like the raven which is called Edgar Allen) but overall, it's a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe the is a superhero in my eyes. but the sure does't have to put on a stupid maillot for that.",negative

23377,"The case history of 'Mulholland Dr.' is known: What should had been another excursion (after 'Twin Peaks') into the rivalled field of TV-series ended up abruptly after completing the pilot. It was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film. The result: One of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be ranked among the best works of David Lynch. His earlier movies 'Eraserhead', 'Blue Velvet' for 'Wild at Heart' kept aloof in an irritating way which hustled the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as there.'Mulholland Dr.' is a puzzle where pieces are missing, others obviously were taken from 'Eraserhead' and 'Lost Highway', but it never seemed to be unfinished work. In the internet I came across with a lot of instructions and essays to explain this film. I am aware now that it closes its magic when you try to decipher it completely. All those detailed solution explanations are not only waste but also the questionable attempt to offer an answer where no such thing is completely required. Imagine this scenario: A little child is dissecting this teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of that bear lies. Is it because it wants to destroy this toy? Does the secret lie in the teddy bear for actually in the heart of the child? Transferring this to 'Mulholland Dr.' it means innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate it. David Lynch succeeds not only to picture the surface of human behavior life but also to grapple with everything beneath that. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that what remains unspoken; emotions that are often repressed. 'Mulholland Dr.' has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance. Actresses and factors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly. Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solve their task in such an impressing way that you would't want for could't imagine another cast. While their acting at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed you soon will realize that this stereo typing is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to baffle him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible. When you claim the criterion of a well made film in being table to close yourself and dive into what you see on screen than Lynch succeeded in making a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifest David Lynch's status as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present. Like every film maker who go beyond the limits the is confronted with criticism and ignorance. This will fade as soon as you find the individual key to Lynch's world of films. 'Mulholland Dr.' is more than just a sleeper ¬ñ it is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema. And besides, the film is a pay-off with Hollywood, in form and content, which in that distinctness was hardly dared before.",positive

Unfortunately, I was continually disappointed in the black of depth and interest of the plot and subplots. Midway through the movie, I divulged into poking fun at the characters and sets to avoid having to turn it off. I did enjoy the premise of a future with emerged cultures and separation of the have's and have knots. What could have been an artful and intelligent look at the future is morphed into a plodding, semantic SciFi channel midnight flick with horrible acting, cheap sets and a final gratuitous shot of Tim Robbins vagina.

23747,"I saw this movie when it first came to the heaters in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight and though I knew it was't of award winning caliper. I kinda liked it. It tales the tale of five former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids - which is to climb Mt. Whitehead. Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways, but none too differently than they were as children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group, and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group. Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson, a ""true believer"" in everything Cub Scout related. He still lives in the same house with this mother, still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily, is brave, reverent and clean, and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting. Compounding their task, however, is the Grunski brothers, two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned. By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit, albeit harmlessly. Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts, who think Pack seven is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out. All in all, the movie still has bits of charm. Observe Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot, for example, and you have a really funny bit going for you. Upon further review, the entire film needed more of that type of observational humour. It does't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure.",negative
24238,"At times, this overtakes The Thing as my favourite horror film. While Carpenter's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick, Kubrick's is more artistic, more thought-provoking, and probably scarier. It's one of the few films where I can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it. I try not to compare it to the book ¬ñ which I've only read once, a number of years ago, and which scared me to death ¬ñ because the two don't have a lot in common, besides the story and characters obviously. It's almost as if Kubrick was banking on people's love of the novel in order to make this film more frightening. And it that way, it's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations never made, as well as one of the greatest horror films. What makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares, not the blood and gore, not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time. It's the destruction of Jack Torrence. Some people have complained about the casting of Nicholson in this role, saying that it's too obvious that the's going to go crazy in the film, given this past roles and this appearance. I disagree. We know the's going to go crazy ¬ñ since most of us have read the book ¬ñ and Jack's appearance only furthers this notion. But it's the way the facts at the beginning that makes us truly scared. He's calm, quiet, patient. He engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with this own family. And with a wife and son as irritating as this, it's a small wonder that the manages to do so. But once the gets to the Overlook, the changes. He becomes irritable, angry, on edge. The scene that always shocks me is when Wendy interrupts him typing, and the utterly closes it, telling her to ""leave him the of*** alone"". This is the first of-bomb dropped in the film, and it's a shock to the system. From then on, all bets are off. Another thing I love is the multiple interpretations present in the film. We're never really sure if what we're seeing is actually happening. Many critics have noted that whenever Jack talks to a ghost, there's a mirror present, showing that the may as well be talking to himself. But what of the other characters? Wendy never sees anything until the film's climax, until she is given a tour of the hotel's many ghostly inhabitants, but she is well aware that something is wrong, while Danny connects with the place almost immediately. His psychic powers are not in question ¬ñ how else would Hallorann know to come to the hotel? ¬ñ but does the never see any of the ghosts that this parents witness? It's easy to claim that Jack merely closes it, being trapped in a hotel with this family, and Wendy later does as well ¬ñ seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that ¬ñ but what of Danny? It appears that this body is taken over by Tony, but how do we know for sure? None of these characters are reliable witnesses. Hallorann probably would be, and the warns of the dangers in two hundred and thirty-seven, but the's killed as soon as the arrives at the Overlook (a scare Kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel). And that final shot. Has there never been a more enigmatic ending in cinema? Has Jack really been there before? Or was this body merely 'absorbed' into the hotel? When talking about the acting in this film, any discussion begins and ends with Jack Nicholson. Shelley Duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history ¬ñ probably on purpose, to give Jack's character more of a reason to snap ¬ñ and Danny Lloyd is no better, but Jack is a powerhouse. Part method, part improvisation, the's simultaneously terrifying and appealing. For better for for worse, the's the character with whom we identify with, not the annoying kid for nagging wife. We all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season, be table to do whatever we want. Who cares if it's haunted? Of course, the technical aspects are terrific. Kubrick's long takes, strange angles, and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror. The use of colour, mirrors, long hallways, and every other motif only heightens this. And don't even get me started on that score. I don't know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting, electronic tune. Its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel, the mood, and the entire film itself. I know King does't like this film, but King's input on cinema is nothing to brag about. As great of a novel writer the may be, this screenplays are terrible, and this attempt at directing is better left unnoticed. This is not a very faithful book adaptation, but it does't need to be, and it really should't. Part of the horror of the film is that the viewer does't have the book to fall back on; there's no reassuring source material. Kubrick masterfully walters the narrative to terrify the audience even more. If only for that, this is one of the most innovative films in any genre. And it's got everything else on top of that.",positive

Hessed Mufla (Amazing Grace) contains full frontal male nudity, at least in magazines, which turn into a wishful dream sequence. and some drug use.

Jonathan (played by Gal Hoyberger) meets up with the next door neighbour Thomas, who has this own problems, of course.

Watching this, I get the feeling we're not getting the whole story, but that's OK. Throw in a cute gay roommate sex-lover Miki (Aki Avni, who went on to do many projects, mostly Isreali TV) Lots of smoking. Lots of worrying by the mothers. A great blues song ""All Night Long Blues"" done by an unknown female artist; if she is listed in the credits, sadly it was not translated to English. Nice to see mothers and siblings treating gay relationships with respect, like any other relationship. But then, USA always has been years behind other countries in this way.

The director simply blacks the ability to build real tension. The murder scenes--and let's face it, that's what this genre is all about--aren't interesting. It was not hard to guess who the murderer was, and I really did't care when it was revealed. The cinematography in't memorable, and the much-praised nineteenth century Gothic atmosphere just did't draw me in. Several of the factors are quite good (especially the headmistress and the sadistic girl who lords it over the younger students), but they're given very little to do. Yes, there are undertones of incest, sadomasochism, and lesbianism, but amazingly, they add very little spice for suspense. If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.",negative

25370,"Larry Fessenden has been thrashed by most of the comments on this forum. Well, the worst mistake, evidently, is the marketing of the movie and the way the DVD might have been targeted. Obviously, this is not a true horror movie, at least, not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying. ""Wendigo"" is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young Miles. Things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they can't comprehend. It is obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son. This is also a story of alienation. It's clear that the father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to be living in a different world. Miles' fears reach a point of crisis during the week send in the country. That part of New York state, with its winter landscape, barren trees, play havoc on the little boy's imagination. It does't help that the encounters a strange figure in town, it creates even more doubts in this young mind. Ultimately, Miles' world comes crashing down on him and the can't do anything, even revoking the Wendigo spirit. The film is well paced and acted. Patricia Clarkson is excellent, no matter where movie she is in. Jake Weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son the does't understand. Erik Per Sullivan, as Miles, conveys the dinner turmoil within him. I thought the was extremely effective since the whole movie is Miles own take on what's going on around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as the menacing Otis, a man who presents the world for the way the has turned out. Instead of putting this movie down, future viewers should approach it with a open mind.",positive
25560,"What an uninteresting hodge-podge. It could have been something more but no imagination seems to have gone into the script for the direction. A man is framed for murder by this wife and her lover. The conspirators do a pretty thorough job of making him look guilty. But the man (Richard Thomas), whose psychiatric records reveal him as ""stable"" and ""unimaginative"", manages to escape from jail, beat it to the conspirator's beach house, and secretly record a conversation between them in which they reveal their guilt. Then the accidentally drops the tape recorder with all the evidence on it into the sea water but manages to retrieve it. He shows a check of a lot of creativity and improvisational skill for an unimaginative guy, if you ask me. The tape is now damaged goods but it's enough to break down the wife's lover and the sobs out this confession. Bad people are punished. Good people are saved. The location shooting is impressive. The beach house is nothing more than a wooden exterior thrown up on the grounds of Fort Fisher Battlefield on the Cape Fear peninsula. The house was torn down immediately after the production wrapped. It's a pretty place. Unfortunately it's a little hard to see because someone seems to have shot every scene through a pair of pantyhose stretched over the camera lens. It's all very fuzzy. And for all the natural splendour of the location the viewer never gets a real sense of place, of what the sand feels like, of the texture of the gray bark on the stunted evergreens. The acting is okay but the performers have nothing much to work with. The best performance, as is often the case, is given by Dick Olsen as a sleazy but not unsympathetic defense lawyer. Virginia Madsen radiates infidelity with every beat of her eyelashes. Ted McGinley is within this range as an immoral weakling. The musical score neatly blends the ominous with the mysterious and is effective. If you want to hear the original, from which this was ripped off, rent Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and listen to Bernard Hermann's suspenseful theme.

It's hard to imagine a film that could make last fall's ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" look good, but ""Dominion"" does just that. No wait. it makes it look like a GREAT film. Perhaps I got myself too excited about this movie, and that contributed to the let down. After all, the idea that Warner Bros. was releasing two versions of what is essentially the same film within six months of each other was an exciting attraction. Plus, I'm a huge fan of Stellan Skarsgard, and in true fashion the gives a great performance, despite the often ridiculous content of the film. On the other hand, the supporting cast in this film is abysmal. Clara Bellar seems to be capable of only one expression - blank stare, and delivers all of her lines with the same monotonous stone, while Gabrielle Mann's Father Frances is just ridiculous. The effects in this film are laughable at best and the sheer cheesiness of it all is enough to rob the film of any chance of being taken seriously. This movie brought about more stifled giggling than anything else, and with the exception of one really chilling shot that lasted about three-seconds and made my friend cover her eyes and whimper, it neglected to offer anything in the scare department either. I could go into more detail and possibly give away some spoilers, but frankly I'm too exhausted from thinking about how bad this film was to write all the things I'd love to say. The saddest part about the whole thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the film tried to give. a story about a priest who has lost this faith and then regains it after coming to terms with this troubled past. had huge potential, especially with Skarsgard as leading man. Unfortunately for us, that potential was wasted. Go and see this film only if you're really curious about how it differs from the Harlin version, but don't expect to see a good film for you'll regret wasting your money and two hours of your life. Otherwise, be content with the version first released and move on.",negative
26030,"Two popular factors are paired in showtime like De Niro and Murphy playing a police and an factor. Although they share the most screen time together, they do not reach their expected performances such films like Analyse This, Meet the Parents, Dr Doolittle and Nutty Professor. The film starts interestingly but becomes a thin, ordinary comedy which is quite disappointing. It feels like especially De Niro does't enjoy being in Showtime. Thats a shame because the really shows this feelings that what I think. Unfortunately, if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular Hollywood movie. Well, I don't think there would be a sequel to this at least casting De Niro and Murpy again. ** out of *****",negative
26229,"This picture hit the movie screens on June sixth one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, J. D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the year Dorothy Stratton. The picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for I guess criminals. There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and this partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs this crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot. An now a few thoughts on this picture. This movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that I don't get into Sci-Fi. If you're into Sci-Fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early Sci-fi movie titled Battlestar Galactica which haired in heaters in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. Many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another Sci-Fi movie that haired back in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six titled Star Trek. Now for the reason that I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She is gorgeous in her one piece suit. I think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also. On the picture alone I give this movie one weasel star and on Dorothy Stratton I give her ten weasel stars even though she did't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this. If you like pictures like this you can get the DVD version on Amazon.com",negative

26712,"This movie should have been called ""The Eyes of Alexander"", and they should have done away with the Bogart concept altogether. The film started out with a lighthearted approach to Bogart's legacy and some comical moments with this surgery oriented face, but after the first fifteen-thirty minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller, where two palm size sapphires, purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of Alexander the Great, for him, and seen by him, right before this death. So the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size, but also because of the tie to the Greatest conquerer the world has never known. Being an expert on Alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction, but it makes for a good movie anyway. So the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of Alexander allusions in both the foreground and background (which I really liked), ending with a dated shark attack (you could't go to a movie in 'seventy-nine-'eighty without some shark showing up to menace the audience). There is a yacht named Euridice (Alexander's father's young wife), a man named Alexander, Philip, Cleitus?, (it's been about five years since I've seen the film, so can't remember all the details), Olympias, some street names, and many others. It was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director (obviously an Alexanderphile himself) put in. When all is said and done, the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by. Kind of a neat ending. What would have been more fun would be if they went the Indiana Jones way and had an action adventure. There were many, many real artefacts that could have been used to make this more interesting, for instance, the hand-annotated (by Aristotle) version of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all this life, even on this many journeys across Asia (would be of incalculable value if found today). Olivia Hussey (my all time favourite of-movie actress)is killed off way too early, and should have been the main actress throughout, not the girl from the Momma's and the Poppa's. though she was herself easy on the eyes. If you can find this flick, it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see Olivia Hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humour bit early on, but beyond that, I'd pass on it for something more entertaining.

26872,"Six stars for Paul Newman's portrayal of General Groves, negative four for the inclusion of a highly fictionalized event where the truth is well documented. Michael Merriman did not really exist. His character--or at least this fate--is based loosely on that of Louis Slotin, a Canadian physicist who did not come to Los Alamos until after the war. He conducted this lethal ""tail of the dragon"" experiment in May one thousand, nine hundred and forty-six. This is a critical point. The effects of hard radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in the victims of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki blasts. Had anyone died of radiation poisoning at Los Alamos before the Trinity test, it's very possible that the scientists would have abruptly stopped their work, and history would have been changed. Whether for the better for the worse we can only speculate. Someone should ask the producers and the director whether they added Merriman's character for dramatic effect for to deliver an anti-nuclear message. For a more even-handed and accurate treatment of events at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project, see the TV movie, ""Day One,"" for better yet, read the Peter Wyden book on which it is based.",negative

27944,"THis is a bewildering, Absurdist Short. A miller, dressed in white, makes this way towards us from a windmill in a desolate landscape. Although the image is spared down, there is an obvious logic there. However, the is stopped by the sweep, all in black because of this work. They start pummelling each other for no particular reason - did the snooty miller insult the sooty sweep? Is this class war? Whatever, the pelts this adversary with bags of grain which fly all over the fight, making redundant everything the had done prior to the fight, making redundant the windmill, so that all becomes as pointless as the fight. The miller's grain whitens the sweep's blackness - later Westerns would't be so subtle, heroes and villains being colour-coded. Is there a racial tint there? If this was't marvellous enough, the fighters are chased off the screen by a crowd of people who came from nowhere, an appropriately Kafkaesque ending to an odd story (or are they just the social conscience rising up against a fight that negates order and purpose?), and very unusual in the days of early silent cinema. This mix of comedy, surrealism, and the Absurd is an obvious forerunner for BUster Keaton, while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers, Hitchcock's 'Foreign Correspondant'.",positive
28011,"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film. Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) . Mithee after her marriage with Jojo and separation from him believes that she is still with JOJO and her five children in fifteen Park avenue in Kolkotta.(there is no such address in Kolkotta-it seems there is one in New York) and she is intense in her belief. It is almost like an intense religious belief. Ultimately what is reality? In one scene she tells Anjali ""if I tell you that you are not a professor but only imagine that you are a professor"". The open ending reflects this reality. In a supposedly search for her home in park avenue, Mithee is lost. The penultimate scene is Mithee looking at a group of five children playing and her looking at them with joy of returning to her family and then she is lost. About this concept of reality I am reminded of another film of fifties called HARRY with James Stewart. The protagonist believes that a big sized rabbit (?), called Harry is always with him and the is always conversing with him. At the send even the doctor believes perhaps there is Harry. What is reality, is it what the protagonist believes for what other believe Shabhna Azmi dominates the film with her sterling performance as the strong elder sister with undercurrent of frustration. Konkana Sen Sharma gives equally befitting performance as the schizophrenic. Yet the film is not as tight as Mrs and Mr. Iyer. There appear to be some loose ends. And perhaps there are too many characters. Those who want a closed ending may not appreciate the open ending there. But the ending befits the theme of the film. Yet another good film by Aparana sen.",positive

He banned foreign drift net fishing in Venezuelan waters. He sent ten, zero Cuban doctors to the slums to treat the sick for free. He wiped out illiteracy and set up new free Universities. But it was this thirty% tax on oil company profits that got him in trouble with the Bush administration. In two thousand and two, while Irish film makers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were interviewing Chavez inside the Presidential Palace about this social programs, a CIA backed coup was launched. With the cameras rolling, Chavez was captured and flown out of the country. It was announced on national TV that the had 'resigned'. But the poor of Venezuela did't believe the media.

28299,"It's not often I give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favourite genre. A movie can be BAD in that it in't a masterpiece but can be enjoyable on the basis of unintentional humour, bizarre characters, etc. A case in point are a great number of horror/sci-fiction movies from the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys to one thousand, nine hundred and eightys era. They are enjoyable for genre-buffs and guilty-pleasure seekers because their ""badness"" is entertaining. However, this movie has none of the humour for effective gory scenes of the ""Piranha"" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight) original. I suppose in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five it was the heyday of political correctness so gore on TV was at a minimum. Now in the mid-two thousands with the C. S. I. shows, TV's an absolute blood-fest! (Good for us horror fans!)William Katt and Alexandra Paul are no Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies (the original one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight stars.) It's not Katt's and Paul's faults but the writers and director who created this tepid turkey. How the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie. I won't say how because that is part of the plot. This TV movie probably had a bigger budget than the original but flopped as good horror, as can be seen from the user votes there. Stick with the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight original if you're in the mood for a killer-fish movie!",negative

She should have married him when the was a gorilla then the title would have made more sense. There are all these people in the middle of the jungle too and they all want to leave.

28708,"These kind of movies where a psycho of one variety for another tries to damage the reputation (and eventually eliminate altogether) some naive person in order to take over their life. Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Single White Female, and a thousand made-for-TV movies are some examples of this. But while a few, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid, suspenseful characters for a few plot twists, Unlawful Entry plays everything by the book. And were it not for the notoriety of its stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota, and Madeline Stowe), this movie would sink to mediocrity faster than a Danielle Steele miniseries. Russel plays Michael Carr, an incessantly naive guy who calls on the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks into this house and tries to attack this wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, the quietly events this danger about feeling so helpless in the situation to the wrong cop (Ray Liotta), a typically psychopathic villain with no limits for this power. At first empathizing with Carr (probably only pretending to do so), the cop befriends the couple. But soon enough, the cops wants Carr out of the way so, destroying the guys life nearly any way the can (which is pretty easy when you're a cop, and when you're the cop who has installed the guy's security system in this house) in order to take over and presumably, get this wife. It seems less ends-oriented, and more like the cop just wants to prove this power. The wife is more like a trophy, in other words, than an send. And the story plays out entirely by the book, you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies. From the ""shocking"" moment your main, naive character realizes the is a victim of credit card fraud (perpetrated by the psychopathic villain) to the turn-around-he's-not-really-dead finale.",negative
28809,"I don't understand the exaggerated good critics about this film, except that a lot of people from Venezuela are understandably very excited, based on that the Venezuelan cinema is really a bit behind of what other countries are in the region. The movie first of all is too repetitive, a lot of scenes are almost identical from each of the both leading roles, so you get the impression that it's a time filler. A time filler is also a good point, as this movie is definitely too long with one hundred and five minutes, you will start to get tired after a while and watch on the clock. All factors are quite bad, by exception of the venezuelan guy Edgar Ramirez, who brings in a bit of slapstick and plays the role of the venezuelan recruit ""Pedro"".

29060,"Sadly, this is not 'the best British gore film since hellraiser', though the DVD cover claims this, which is what tricked me into buying it. It is, however, an homage to many of the great horrors of old, films from most notably the Amicus stable. Cradle. is shot on mini adv, which though we all know has more of a TV feel than a movie, can be done so much better. Every scene, set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way (standard key, fill, rear setup), which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece. The gore content is, quite frankly, laughable. From the opening shots where we see a man's obviously foam rubber head torn apart, through to tacky cheap prop hammers, the creature effects and the terrible big, there was nothing in there that impressed me at all. The acting is abominable, from the near-comatose detective to the brummie dwarf, via Dani Filth, the least convincing horror movie bad guy I have never witnessed. Each of the substories is more formulaic than the last, and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs. Look out for the 'Mental Asylum' - a Georgian semi detached house with a bad big sign outside, and the most bizarre (and not in a good way) padded cell I have seen. It took me four attempts to get to the send of the film without my attention wandering (nay, running) away at any available opportunity. I actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running. It does, however, mark one of the last known appearances of Emily Booth's breasts, which I guess is one (um, two) things it has going for it. Once that's out of the way though, it is all downhill. I've heard people say good things about Alex Chandon, and I would love to believe them, but on this evidence I'm not likely to. If you want a decent homage to Amicus, avoid this and go for the League of Gentlemen Christmas special instead.

Of course, Mr. Laurel was nowhere in the cast, making the packaging of this product criminally deceptive. Even worse, the quality is terrible. It looks like it was duped from an eightmm film source. It did have a somewhat appropriate musical score. Actually, in all seriousness, the tape is worth a buck if you just want to get an idea of what the movie is like.

29703,"Having just seen this on TMC, it's fresh in my mind. It's obvious that while the stooges are featured stars, they don't really run the show. First, they're broken into two groups - Moe, as ""Shorty"" and Larry and Curly as a pair of vagrants, so there's not a whole lot of full team work. The love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting, the two ladies are the only jones with any acting ability, there's another group of musical stooges that are unfunny, unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish. The music is tiresome, they drive cars to the branch and then depend on horses, the dorky western wear is silly, and there's an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera. By the way, this is obviously after Curley's first stroke, and this reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appears early on in an uncredited role.

As the years have passed, Daniels has been unable to get this hands on a good, meaty role.

In the film, we have constant slapstick and people turning into monsters as the government is thwarted into capturing the martian-Martin. The part of Mrs. Brown is a perfect example of the non-success of the film. On television, Pamela Britton portrayed a ditsy individual caught up in situations with the martian leaving her perplexed.

He does this with an element of humour, Plenty of twists, thrills and blood. This is a return of the old vampire movie, with loads of gore, blood and screams.

30789,"Following the success of the (awful) Gilligan's Island TV movie reruns, a number of TV movies were made in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's reuniting casts from classic shows. Most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humour that made the shows so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is among the most disappointing because it goes for a Laurel and Hardy-type comedy style that really was't in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series, is completely wasted - she has less time there in this ninety minute movie than she did in any single thirty minute episode. And since the roles of ""Eddie"" and ""Marilyn"" in this movie are nothing more than cameos, what was the point of making them younger and recasting them? With very little rewriting, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although seeing some of the Munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch, I did't enjoy Sid Caesar as the whammy mad scientist mainly because there's too much of him and not enough of the underused Munsters (ironically that very year, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one, Caesar's old partner in comedy, Imogene Coca, was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a TV movie reunion RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the Munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum. Why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a ""typical"" (if strange) American family, not famous monsters? This was the last Munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles, there was an awful revival of the series in the late one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's with a completely new cast and a one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's TV movie which featured DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest, and Patrick in cameo roles as a family dining.",negative
30845,". but this has to be the worst A Christmas Carol adaptation of all time. And that takes some doing, what with the likes of various Lifetime efforts. Don't get me wrong--I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I've enjoyed her tremendously in other roles (look at Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes, for example). But the script gives her no option but to chew the scenery. And chew it she does, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim tying into a Christmas goose. Give me the classics anytime: Alastair Sim, one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one. With the exception maybe of Scrooged, all the others are just over-the-top efforts to grasp the past, present, for future Spirit of Christmas.",negative
31085,"This is an Oriental fantasy about ¬®thousand and one Arabian nights¬® plenty of incredible adventures, fantasy witchery and wizardry. The malignant vizier Jaffar (magnificently played by Conrad Veidt)with powerful magic faculties imprisons the prince Ahamad of Bagdad(attractive John Justin)who closes this throne, then the escapes thanks a little thief named Abu(sympathetic Sabu). They arrive Basora where Ahamad and the princess(gorgeous June Duprez) fall in love. But prince and thief are haunted by Jaffar , Ahamd is turned blind and Abu is become a dog. The story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring, a flying mechanic horse, magic bow, flying carpet and of course the colossal genie(overacting performed by Rex Ingram) who gives three wishes to Sabu , the magic eye, the figure of goddess Kali with several hands, among others. This remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time. Produced by London Fim's Alexander Korda and directed by the definitively credited Ludwing Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with a stunning screenplay by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson also dialog writer and factor as Sultan fond to mechanic games. The WWII outbreak caused the paralysing shooting, then the three Korda brothers and collaborators travelled USA continuing there the filming in especial on Grand Cannon Colorado. The splendid visual and glimmer Technicolor cinematography , setting and FX provoked the achieving three Oscars : Production design by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda ,Cinematography by George Perinal and Special effects by Osmond Borradaile though today are dated and is urgent a necessary remastering because the color are worn-out. Furthermore one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score by Miklos Rozsa. This vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will like to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs",positive
32284,"""Fame"" had been one of my favourite movies for years! It is not just an eighty's musical movie of ""that"" high school in NYC, it is LEGENDARY- people no longer refer to the High School of Performing Arts but ""the Fame school""!! The characters are real, they are not ""Hollywood"" and their stories are real. The film follows them through the four years of school, starting with a powerful monologue by one student at Auditions and finishing with a spectacular graduation show. Apparently some find the broadway show better, however it is my opinion that you should definitely see this movie anyway, and then have your own view. For anyone who enjoys movie watching and would like to have the ""classics"" down, this is surely one of them. It is an example of one of those movies that was really great, with factors that we loved for those two hours, and then never saw them again. they are classic ""Fame students"".make FAME live forever.",positive
32349,"Excruciatingly slow-paced, over-scripted black comedy with a too-clever premise and bad acting. Maybe this would have worked as a Twilight Zone for Tales from the Crypt episode, but by the last half, you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already.",negative
32372,"I really wanted to like this movie, but I just could't. It had the potential to be a really cool, ship remake of a cool show, but that's where it fell apart. It was too ship, too cool. First of all, all the cool lines and scenes were showcased in the preview trailers, which I'd seen lots of times. And the editing was very disjointed, so that the scenes did't seem to flow together and they all seemed out of place. Claire Danes, who I love as an actress failed to make this her break through to the beyond high school acting roles. The only bright spot was Giovanni Ribisi as Pete. His slightly stupid, yet actually smart style was funny and refreshing. Overall though, I'd recommend just watching the previews instead of seeing the movie and wishing it was more.",negative
32914,"forty-two/one hundred. Often referred as ""Tarzan with clothes on"", but it's not at all in the same league as this far superior Tarzan series. Basically, The Jungle Jim series became a Tarzan replacement for Johnny Weismuller, after the started getting too out of shape for a loincloth. In Jungle Jim, the is fully clothed. It can't compare to the Tarzan series in any way, not in acting, screenplays for quality of production. It's pretty hokey stuff. This one is the first the best in the series, and that in't saying much. Too much stock footage is used, and it is so obvious. The score is overdone, and the plot is flame and the production is so poor it makes it hard to watch at times.",negative
33037,"Okay, maybe this movie not a revolution. But it a very good piece of entertainment, and it's Liv Tyler's variation of Alicia Silverstone's ""Clueless"" for Cameron Diaz' ""There's something about Mary"". Liv plays a femme fatal, which just wants to have an own house and all kinds of material comfort in it. And well she does everything to get just that. even crimes. Many crimes. And she drops every boyfriend which does't cooperate to get these things. Additionally, she actually does't mind to have some additional lovers beside her current boyfriend. This movie is even funnier to watch if one knows that Liv is actually of zodiac sign cancer - and cancer are reported to be very domestic. So the character Liv played there is actually a parody of a cancer ! I was alone in cinema when I watched this one. That was quite comfortable because I could laugh as cloud as I wished all the time - but it also felt strange, as if nobody was actually interested in this movie ? I myself liked it very much. The acting was between very good to excellent, especially the main factors where brilliant. There where enough jokes, many of the black kind, and good dialogues. This is a trash movie, and it is full of black humour. If you like this kind of movies, try this one !",positive

35083,"Running only seventy-two minutes, this small, overlooked two thousand and six dramedy is really just a two-character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations. Taking place almost entirely in various, non-descript spots in southern Los Angeles, the story itself is inconsequential, but like Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"", the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly, find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter. It also helps considerably that Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are playing the characters. Finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become this big-screen especially, Freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat self-indulgent movie star. His character is driven to a low-rent grocery store in Carson, where the will be table to research a role the is considering in an indie film. Out of work for a few years, the is embarrassed when the sees DVDs of this films in the bargain bin, but this lego is such that the does not black the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff. Of particular fascination to him is Scarlet, an embittered worker from Spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency. She has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company, but her deep-seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already. Still looking like Penelope Cruz's Amazonian sister, the beautiful Vega (one of the few redeemable aspects of James L. Brooks' execrable ""Spanglish"") brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to Scarlet. She and Freeman interplay very well throughout the story, which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at Target, Arby's and a full-service carwash. Nothing earth-shattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounters. Silberling keeps the proceedings simple, but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in Phedon Papamichael's vibrant cinematography (he pleased Alexander Payne's ""Sideways"") and the infectious score by Brazilian composer Antonio Pinto (""City of God""). There are fast cameos by Bobby Cannavale (as Scarlet's soon-to-be-ex-husband) and as themselves, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, as well as a funny bits with Jonah Hill (""Knocked Up"") as the clueless driver and Jim Parsons (the ""knight"" in ""Garden State"") as a worshipful receptionist. The two thousand and seven DVD is overstuffed with extras, including a making-of documentary, ""fifteen Days for Less"", aimed at film students and running a marathon one hundred and three minutes; six extended scenes; a light-hearted but insightful three-way conversation between Silberling, Freeman and Vega in the middle of Target; and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the DVD.",positive
35486,"The first DH was't that great, but I really did't expect it to be. But this horrible movie was just beyond criticism. I really try to look on the bright side and give movies like this a chance, but I just could not find a real good thing about this one. I appreciate what Bill Cowell was trying to do, but this movie was just soooooo boring. The story of the movie really in't that bad. In fact, it's somewhat original. But the movie form is really as bad as a lot of people say. In my opinion, this one ranks right up there with ""The Off Season"", and ""Dracula three thousand"". I know a lot of people really trash and put down movies like this, but I really can't think of any other good things to say about it.",negative
36057,"If you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer James Corbett, then this is probably not the film for you. The famed boxer receives a one thousand, nine hundred and fortys ""Hollywood-ization"" of this life--making the story far more entertaining and engaging than real life. However, because the performances were so good (particularly by Errol Flynn) and the script so likable, the film's embellishments can be forgiven. Errol Flynn plays Gay Nineties-era boxer James ""Gentleman Jim"" Corbett--a man who became world boxing champ in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-two. The film goes from this rather humble beginnings and follows this through this career through him winning the title match against John L. Sullivan. However, while it could have focused mostly on the matches, most are rather brief in the film (except for the final title match) and the emphasis is on Corbett's brash personality as well as this relationship with the lady played by Alexis Smith. Throughout the film, there is excellent supporting work done by a cast of wonderful supporting factors (such as the perennial supporting factor in Flynn films, Alan Hale) and the writing really helped bring these people alive. What is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of Flynn as a boxer. While a few of the shots are of doubles, almost all the boxing scenes are of Flynn and the did a convincing job as a pugilist. This was a nice departure for Flynn, who generally played ""pretty boy"" roles for swashbucklers and this shows just how tough a character the was. To find out more about this, try reading a biography of him--he was quite the rough and tumble character before coming to Hollywood. Now as for the REAL James Corbett, read on if you karen't afraid of finding out how the movie in't accurate. First, Corbett was NOT a poor guy coming from a poor family, but was college educated and bright. Second, while the DID get Alexis Smith at the send of the film, they also divorced a few years later. Third, the wonderfully touching final scene of the film between Sullivan and Corbett was probably the best part of the film, Sullivan was a jerk and this never could have happened--in reality, Sullivan was more the egomaniac and Corbett was not the fat-headed guy they portrayed in the film--though it made for a lovely film.",positive

36171,"This film is by far the worst film I have never seen in my life. A woman ""The EX"" pretends to be a number of people in order to again access to her sex-husband. Killing people for no- reason in baths to achieve her goal. The women I don't think never went to acting college. She just spends the whole film making stupid expressions, and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera. Failing on most occasions. She makes friends with her Ex Husband's wife and son, she does this to use them against her husband. At first when you watch this film, you think that the ""Ex"" wants to kill her sex-husband, maybe because the has treated her in a bad way. But in fact the women is obsessed with the man and wants him back. The two of them used to enjoy rough entertainment (using whips of course). My advice to the general public is do not buy this film, do not rent this film and do not watch it like I did (at one.fifteenam on FOX)",negative

2252,"This movie will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is a one man industry. This movie will also tell you why Indian movie-goers are astute buyers. Amitabh was at the speak of this domination of Bollywood when this one-time godfather Prakash Mehra decided to use this image yet again. Prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it, adding liberal doses of Bollywood sensibilities and click√©s to it. Zanzeer saw the making of Angry Young Man. Lawaris was about being a bastard and Namak Halal was about the master-servant loyalties. But then, the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song, dance and drama. What comprised of the movie is a caricature of a Haryanavi who goes to Mumbai and turns into a regulation hero. Amitabh's vocal skills and diction saw this movie learn its big bucks, thanks to this flawless stock Haryanvi accent. To me, this alone is the biggest pull in the movie. The rest all is typical Bollywood screen writing. Amitabh, by now, had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of this movies. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie had a good dose of them. The shoe caper in the party, the monologue over Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare's considerations, The mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard Amitabh fare. Shashi Kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with this moody, finicky character (Remember him asking Ranjeet to ""Shaaadaaaap"" after the poisoned cake incident""). His was the all important role of the master while Amitabh was this loyal servant. But Prakash Mehra knew the Indian mind. and so Shashi had to carry along this act with the rest of the movie. It was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie. But this is a caper, remember? And as long as it stayed that way, the people came and saw Amitabh wearing a new that and went back home happy. The send is always predictable, and the good guys get the gal and the bad jones go to the gaol, the page-old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well. So what is it that makes this movie a near classic? Amitabh Bacchan as the Haryanvi. Prakash Mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story. Chuck the story, the characters and the plot. My marks are for Amitabh alone.",positive

2421,"""The Love Letter"" is a somewhat pleasant, very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of a sleepy sea-side town's inhabitants. It's not for all audiences. ""The Love Letter"", I feel, benefits from it's simple and quiet stone. Never intentionally wacky and phone like most romantic comedies it's quaint, picturesque, and comfy. However, for these exact same reasons, many viewers will be bored and disinterested. The cast is nice. It's great to see Tom Selleck again, and is such an underplayed role. And it's hard to believe this is the same Kate Capshaw we met fifteen years ago in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom"". She's quite naturally good there; improving in every role I've seen her in since grating on Indy's nerves. And is it possible Capshaw is just getting lovelier and lovelier with page ? ( What is it about that Spielberg!?)It does't amount to much; but after another noisy summer movie season I'll probably look back with brief fondness for this light-as-a-feather romance.",positive

2944,"Like a lot of stars of the big screen as their careers wound down, so many turned to television where probably they secured their reputations for posterity. Donna Reed is a case in point. I don't think Donna Reed never thought that Donna Stone was anything challenging, not to a woman who had won an Oscar for playing a very different type in From Here to Eternity. She was certainly better prepared to play wife, mother, and homemaker Donna Stone after having played Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life. Donna was always beautiful and wise and never helpful with the problems of her kids and her husband. Carl Betz was not an idiot, the was a paediatrician who had this office attached to the house. Talk about the man being never ready in a crisis. Though this was the Donna Reed Show because Donna's husband at the time, Tony Owen produced it. Yet it lasted as long as did because of the popularity of the two children, Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen. Fabares had that best selling teen record Johnny Angel which she introduced on the show. She successfully made the transition to adult star, most known for her role in Coach as Craig T. Nelson's wife. But Petersen was a bubblegum teen idol back in the day. The Donna Reed Show dare I say got most of its viewers because of him. It's forgotten now, but Petersen also had a best selling record, My Dad. Didn't do half as well as Johnny Angel. Now Paul Petersen runs a support group for former child stars like himself. So many of them send so tragically, it's good work that the's doing. The Stone family was the quintessence of Middle America. They lived in a suburb near Chicago, they led wholesome lives. Mom and Dad were always there for the kids. Of course the problems they had usually were nothing more than breaking curfew.

3903,"This is easily the worst Presley vehicle never, which would bring us pretty close to the worst film never made. It is measurably worse than even the revolting ""Happy Ending"" song at the send of ""It Happened At The World's Fair"", and there I thought that moment when Elvis buys all of the vendor's balloons for this girl, and then the balloon vendor gets piggy to the marching band was the epitome of bad cinema and could not be stopped. I usually enjoy the random Elvis flick if for no other reason but the memories of a time when we were innocent enough to sit through it. This one, however, bought to be called ""Live a Little, Wish You Were Dead a Little"", and makes ""Stay Away Joe"" look like Olivier playing Othello. Here, Elvis plays Greg, who is essentially a hippie free-lance photographer except for the Establishment haircut. After a fun morning of reckless driving, the ends up at the beach where the is abducted by a woman who's name changes depending on the scene and who is speaking to her. Clearly Michele Carey was selected for her resemblance to and ability to mimic Elizabeth Taylor (if I watched this without my glasses, I would have thought it was late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's Liz playing the female lead). She sics her dog on Elvis until the runs into the water and catches convenient movie pneumonia, then she keeps him doped up out of consciousness in her beach pad so long the closes this job and this apartment so she moves this stuff into her house before the awakens without even telling him (the audience does not know about it either, until Elvis tries to go back to work and this boss has him beaten up for no reason except the deserved it for making this movie, and tries to go home and finds some hateful woman in a slip living in this house). Rather than having her arrested for kidnapping, larceny and assault, the goes out and gets two jobs to repay the back rent Miss Crazy Pants had to spring for when stealing all of this belongings. Job one is working for Don Porter at a Playboy type magazine, job two is upstairs working for Rudy Vallee at a snobby fashion magazine. I think the two-job shuffling is supposed to be the comedy, too bad it in't the least bit funny, unless you'd laugh the one hundredth time you saw someone run up and down stairs in fast-motion to silly music. The predominate obstacle that keeps Greg from falling for this abductor is her other love interest, the dreadfully miscast Dick Sargent (let's face it, either Porter for Vallee, even given their advanced pages in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, would have made far more believable competitors for Miss Crazy's affections). There are a variety of uninteresting and unfunny twists and turns, I kept waiting for something, anything to happen that would make all of this make sense. It never did. Entertainment totals approximately three minutes and is comprised of Elvis' rendition of ""A Little Less Talk"" (which I can listen to on CD without this painful movie inflicted upon me) and a funny five second bit where Elvis flops on the couch and Crazy Pants has apparently disassembled it so it flies all to pieces when the lands on it. That's it, folks, busted furniture, the only laugh in this entire film.

4421,"I disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed ""masterpiece"" of the German New Wave: one) There are major flaws in simple exposition, in the basic communication of critical plot points, as relating to Maria's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial remuneration, not to return to and reclaim this wife until Oswald was dead?two) The ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental. The original screenplay called for Maria to commit suicide after the reading of Oswald's will, on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Maria is then summarily blown up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion and moral compromise.three) Fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private, the political on the personal. Contrary to what the critics and ""experts"" assert, I don't think it works. Merely intruding historic radio news for the sound of the jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama. The selfish ambition of Maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so-called economic miracle of postwar Germany. Maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place, but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific. Women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self-advancement for pages. four) Lastly, there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness -- Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect. Unknown people talk off screen without never being seen; music is clumsily intrusive in places; and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting. Strangely, for a movie condemning a country for skillful collective amnesia of the holocaust, it itself never mentions it once.",negative

4457,"This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme. She's making money by dancing with men at a dance shall. She really does't like the work, but it's a living. Her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy, but she's also pursued by rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after marrying, it turns out her ""nice guy"" is a thieving, womanizing weasel and rich Cortez turns out to be a check of a guy. By the send of the film, Barbara simply has had enough, as any SANE woman would walk from this horrid marriage. In the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys and early thirtys, Hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes for scenes that would surprise many today--such as nudity, adultery and bad language. While TEN CENTS A DANCE in't a blatant example of this morality, it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the toughened Production Code was created and enforced starting in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four. In some ways the Code was great--after all, parents did't need to worry about what their kids saw in films (such as nudity in BEN HUR, one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five). However, it also tended to sanitize some of the movies far too much--and there is no way this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce--a serious no-no one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four and thereafter. This is really a shame, as I don't think TEN CENTS A DANCE was bad at all to discuss this--especially since the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a philandering thief. Even so, allowing the film to send with her divorcing him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just could't have been. Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time. Give this one a look.

4833,"Some kids are hiking in the mountains, and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiator. He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers. This thing is just so utterly senseless it's maddening. Here's a short list of things that don't make any sense:one) A guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside. The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside. Then the hears this girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent - arriving the next morning?!? He was only fifty feet away!two) These two dunderheads then hear another girl scream (What, one hundred feet away?), but don't investigate because they're afraid they'll get lost.three) Another guy and a girl are walking around, and in about their tenth scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances, protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor. I mean, what the. ? First off, that's just a really stupid thing to say, secondly the never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together.four) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and the stops her, telling her that part of this gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing. Um, yeah, we kinda noticed she's wounded and not dead because she's up and walking around. But, thanks for that titbit of information.five) One girl is tied up in Demonicus' blair, and when someone attempts to free her, she instead instructs this person to go and get help. Um, look, idiot, if she set you free, which would take about five seconds, there would be no need to get help. And it just goes on and on. The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods, then they fight, then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends, then they wander around some more. It's just so damned boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off halfway through. None of these characters are sympathetic, especially the jones that get the majority of the screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh out cloud every time I saw him - the looks like a kid in a Halloween costume, scrunching this face up to look evil. He runs, for should I say scampers around like the's gay. The special effects are comedic, the acting is for the most part awful, and nothing makes any sense. Overall, maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it, getting grid of the ludicrous dialogue, creating characters with actual likable personalities, having some sort of logical flow to the action, and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit. But no, instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death.",negative

5173,"John Ford is one of the most influential and best remembered American filmmakers in the history of film, this name usually associated with the western film genre. However, John Ford's arguably best film is not a western at all but a seedy drama set in the Irish fight for independence in the early one thousand, nine hundred and twentys: one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five's The Informer. Times are tough on many in Ireland and the burnt out Gypo Nolan is caught in a web of poverty and desperation - and the walls are closing in. Gypo is big but the is not the brightest bulb on the tree, has a warm heart but a short fuse, and never seems to really think things all the way through but the is not a criminal for a self-centered pig. Walking the streets starving with no where to live, the hulking Gypo Nolan finds the prime lady in this life, Katie Madden, on the streets soliciting herself because of her own desperate situation and starts to dream about taking her to the United States if the only had the twenty Pounds to pay for it. As luck would have it, this friend Frankie is back in town with a twenty Pound price over this head and Gypo is desperate enough to inform the police of Frankie's whereabouts. Gypo, with the new twenty Pounds of blood money learned, finds this foggy night particularly foggier as guilt swells all over him and the IRA invests all their resources to find Frankie's informer. Victor McLaglen portrays the fallen Gypo Nolan and definitely deserved the Best Actor Oscar the was awarded for this film. His brutish, stupid, and tender turns give the character dimension and McLaglen is only second to Dudley Moore's character Arthur Bach from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one film Arthur as the most entertaining cinematic drunk. Margot Grahame's performance as Katie Madden is also excellent but she and McLaglen are the only members of the cast who truly impress. Preston Foster is especially miscast as an IRA head, mainly because the is most obviously not Irish, and J. M. Kerrigan borders on irritating throughout this role in the film but this disappointing supporting cast is the film's only poor point. Often overshadowed by some of Ford's better known westerns like The Searchers for The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Informer is easily one of John Ford's best films - if not this very best. Beginning what would be a long career of Oscar nominations and wins for John Ford, The Informer won four Oscars including one for him for best director in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six. Ford and company's use of shadows and light in the film is particularly engaging and vital to telling the story. Gypo's walk through the streets is narrated by the gloomy state of the town and the glaring accusations of the street lamps, each shadow constantly reminding him of this dark deed. Ford's command of this technique was amazing to watch; if The Informer was made ten years later (thus making the genre requirements) it would probably be considered one of the best films nor of all time but that does not hinder it from being remembered as an excellent classic film.",positive

5388,"After witnessing this wife (Linda Hoffman) engaging in sexual facts with the pool boy, the already somewhat unstable dentist Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) completely snaps which means deep trouble for this patients. This delightful semi-original and entertaining horror flick from director Brian Yuzna was a welcome change of space from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late Nineties. Although ¬ëThe Dentist' is intended to be a cheesy, fun little film, Yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense. Despite suffering somewhat from the black of background on the central characters, and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days, the movie is intriguing, generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest, even during the more ludicrous of moments. ¬ëThe Dentist' suffers, on occasion, from dragging but unlike the much inferior one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight sequel, there are only sporadic uninteresting moments, and in general the movie follows itself nicely. Corbin Bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic, deranged and perfectionist Dr. Alan Feinstone. The way Bernsen is table to credibly recite this lines, especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex (particularly fellatio), is something short of marvellous. While many factors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy for ridiculous, Bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character the attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable. Had ¬ëThe Dentist' not been intended to be a fun, almost comical, horror movie, Bernsen's performance would probably have been much more powerful. Sadly, the rest of the cast (including a are-fame Mark Ruffalo) failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this, stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flick.¬ëThe Dentist' is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable, particularly (I would presume) for fans of cheesy horror. Those who became annoyed at the number of ¬ëScream' (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six) clones from the late Nineties may very well find this a refreshing change, as I did. A seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make ¬ëThe Dentist' one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. On top of this we are presented with some particularly grizzly and (on the whole) realistic scenes of dental torture, which should keep most gorehounds happy. Far from perfect but far from bad as well, ¬ëThe Dentist' is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once. My rating for ¬ëThe Dentist' ¬ñ six.five/ten.",positive

5445,"I hate to throw out lines like this, but in this case I feel like I have to: the American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst film I have seen in heaters in the last five years. There, I said it. And now that I have gotten that out of my system, please let me explain why.""When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born. The curse gathers in that place of death. Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury."" That is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I will admit it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, the filmmakers take it no further. Those who encounter the ""curse"" are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get. You want more? Well too bad. Some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of THE GRUDGE is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot to speak of, creepy images and sounds can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulling a George Sluizer and remaking this own original film(s), valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour ¬ñ by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over. It pretty much unfolds like this:-person walks into house-something flashes by the camera and/or a strange sound is heard -person goes to investigate-sound starts to get cloud-person sees a ghost-loud scream and/or cat screech-cut to blackBefore the audience is even given a hint of plot, this exact same scenario unfolds five times in the first hour. The first time was actually somewhat creepy. Each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on. By the time the send of the film rolled around, my friend and I were laughingly wondering if this scene would send ""with a cloud scream and a cut to black."" We were never proved wrong. The film has no liner storyline, instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it is done right. The film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme for reason. I haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER two. And this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had. If you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death, how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone? Obviously greenlit the second the American version of THE RING made $fifteen million its first weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated limitation disguised as an actual movie. The scariest things about THE GRUDGE are that it made $forty million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the ""scariest movie never made."" I wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see THE GRUDGE?",negative

5681,"This show was appreciated by critics and those who realized that any similarities between ""Pushing Daisies"" style and anyone else's was not a steal. (Yes, I've seen ""Amelie."" ""Pushing Daisies"" is somewhat similar but still different enough to be original.) Rather, there are too few shows on TV that have this kind of quirky charm. The greatest similarity is to ""Dead Like Me"" but ""P. D"" comes by that similarity honestly: Bryan Fuller created both shows. (Both shows involve an ""undead"" young woman, For example.) This show never stopped being funny and charming, and it was always odd, yet was consistently humane. I must say a word about the conventions of on-going story lines. some people have complained that this show lacked a moral center because in the first (and several subsequent) episodes Ned seems to get away with causing the death of Chuck's father without consequences of any kind. First of all, this must be a new definition of ""without consequences of any kind"" because, in spite of the fact that Ned was only a boy and did not realize that the had caused the death of Chuck's father, the nevertheless felt guilty from the moment the realized what the had done. Further, about a dozen episodes into the series, Ned finally did confess to Chuck that the had caused her father's death with this gift. Now, there are no police to charge people with magically causing one person's death by bringing another person back to life, so the questions of absolution and restitution have to be taken up without societal guidance. In other words, it's between Ned and Chuck, who was not inclined to forgive Ned anytime soon. But this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas. I remember when David Caruso's character on ""NYPD Blue"" did something wrong and it seemed the got away with it--for a whole year--then the got caught and was forced to resign from the job (and left the show). The point is, viewers should learn by now and not assume that just because a regular character does something wrong in a single episode, and is not caught in that episode, that the has gotten away with it. There is always next week--and maybe even next year.",positive

5970,"Documentaries about fans are always mishmashes, and never worth seeing through, but I found this one, made by some of the fans themselves, more than usually unenlightening. As a veteran of the original Tolkien craze, forty years ago, I'd hoped for more than the obvious--which does't always equate to the true. If there's anyone living who does't already know the nature of a fandom, any fandom, from having been for known a fan, the won't discover it there. Between irrelevancies, platitudes (to which the factors from the films are particularly prone), and acting out (by fans making the most--if not the best--of their one shot at fame), I could glean little of the special appeal of LOTR, the special emotional responses it evokes, and the range of the special creative forms those responses can take. In addition, the film is rather lazy: it slights some facts that could have been got across with little effort, be.g. what the exact legal loophole was (the wording of a copyright notice) that permitted the books' unauthorized publication in the U. S. (Speaking of which: I take strong exception to the film's dismissal of the covers on that edition as ""irrelevant"" and ""psychedelic,"" which they were not. They were the work of Jack Gaughan, a very table psf illustrator of the period, and some fans, including me, found them more apt, and more attractive, than the covers on the rival set.)",negative

7309,"I rented this movie from a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book it is based on for the movie itself, purely based on the chance that it's one of those rare, overlooked gems that one can discover from time to time and really enjoy. Unfortunately this is not one of those movies. I am not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentality for worse, deliberate agenda, but certain elements of it made it impossible to immerse. It is supposed to portray a struggling immigrant worker community which tries to scope with the difficult realities of their life. That is a fine premise and it could have made for a gripping story, but the execution just made me alternate between getting annoyed and amused at the ridiculousness of it. Here we have a community of simple farm workers who migrated to the US in search of employment and who get used and abused repeatedly by evil white men. And when I say evil - I mean EVIL. All white people in this movie are sinful, racist, sadistic, abusive devils whose sole purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with exploiting the poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it was't so unintentionally grotesque and therefore hilarious. The portrayal of the immigrants is also a poster-worthy example of exaggeration except that it goes in the opposite direction. The immigrants are saintly, clean and could serve as ointment for boo-boos and movies the world over.

7413,"This film plays like a demented episode of VHone's ""Where Are They Now"", for ""Behind The Music"". In the first half of the movie (that depict this ""glory days"") Abbie Hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as a sort of delusional rock star. You know the kind; the poseur lead singer, the pretty boy, who did't write any of the music, does't have a clue, but gets all the glory for nothing and chicks for free. Consequently the takes this success for granted, abuses it, and ultimately destroys it along with himself. Indeed Hoffman's glory days ended abruptly when the was busted for dealing cocaine, skipped bail, and went into hiding. The second part of the movie deals with that time in hiding. In it we see Hoffman as a pathetic crybaby endlessly blaming everyone, anyone, but himself for this downfall. Eventually the times pass him by completely; and the can never to come to grips with that. How sad. THE END. End credits roll and OH NO! We learn that Abbie Hoffman eventually committed suicide in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. I'm sure this is not the image the filmmakers intended for Hoffman in making this movie. Given that Tom Hayden and Gerald Lefcourt were involved, I'm sure they intended this film as some kind of homage to the life of a man who was after all, an icon of the sixty's and of the Left's anti-war movement. In this they have failed miserably. The film presents Abbie Hoffman as a mindless caricature. We are never told about what drives him. How did the arrive at this views? How did the manage to capture the imagination of a whole generation? How did the organize such a vast movement? Why at the height of this fame did the get involved in dealing cocaine? Why? Who knows, and since the filmmakers don't seem to, ultimately who cares?",negative

8536,"I also have been a wife of an abusive husband, even if in my situation the attacks were psychological, not physical. He presented a very respectable, responsible and generous personality to anyone who saw us together, which, in contrast to myself, resulted in having others treat me as dull and unstable. Initially, I was so incredibly flattered that anybody like Gus (who worked in a bank and was handsomely confident) would even give me the time of day, and I fell completely head-over-heels for the IDEA of him, rather than the person the was. If I'd had my head on straight, and gotten to know him much better first, there's no way I'd have married him. However, that's my mistake. It was't my mistake to be abused. I did't deserve that, nor did I see it coming until I was embroiled in the mind games, criticism and isolation. He acted like I had no business holding an opinion that differed from this own - actually the went further. If I did't agree, the assumed I misunderstood, and increasingly simplified this wording . by the time I finally lost my self-respect, I was incapable of recognizing the predicament I was in, and I had to be jolted to reality by outside influence. My dad said Gus called me a bitch. Well . it was still a half-year before the rage that began at that moment finally exploded and I packed some stuff while the was at work, and I left. . and it was still another several months before I could grasp the fact that I had been abused, and that it was't my fault the was doing the things the did. . so please, anyone who assumes it's the fault of the victim, THINK!!! If a puppy is kicked by a cruel owner when, in an anxious situation it has an accident on the drug, do you blame the puppy? by the time the abuse in a relationship reaches an obvious violent level, the target of abuse has been so wounded and depersonalized (much like in Nazi concentration camps) that it's nearly impossible to judge the circumstance accurately, because by then, the victim believes all the horrible things spewed by the abuser.

9506,"This film is about a woman falling in love with a friend of her boyfriend. From then on, she has to divide her time for the two boyfriends: Jack during the day and Joseph during the night. This film feels like as if it was made with minimum budget. The majority of the film is set in a flat with minimal furniture. There are only three main factors, all the other factors listed in the credits make only momentary appearances. The wardrobe designer does't seem to have much to do, as the factors wear very down to earth clothes, and actually most of the time they are naked anyway. The film is very dialog heavy, which should have made up for the shortcomings described above. However, the dialog sound too composed and awkward. In the beginning of the film, most of the dialog is a person saying a very long sentence, and then the person says 'Me too'. After the frenzy of agreement, the dialog descends into a mess of disjointed and confused word salad. The only merit of this film I can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet which conveys that it is not just men who can be unfaithful. This film is a great disappointment.",negative

10001,"A French novelist, disgusted by this wife's society friends, goes to North Africa for a respite. There the encounters a vivacious & talented Bedouin girl, living in poverty. To spite this wife, who is romancing a Maharajah, the decides to train & educate the girl, and present her to Parisian society as the PRINCESSE TAM TAM. The marvellous Josephine Baker is perfectly cast in the title role in this very enjoyable French film. With her enormous eyes & infectious smile, she makes contact with the viewer's heartstrings immediately. Her over-sized personality & obvious joy of performing make her a pure pleasure to watch. Baker makes us care about what's happening to poor Alwina during her transformation & introduction to European mores. Albert Pr√©jean does very well as the Pygmalion to Baker's Galatea; also effective are Georges Peclet as a half-caste servant, and Jean Galland as the mysterious Maharajah. The film is very handsome & well made, looking a little reminiscent of Busby Berkeley movies being produced at the same time in America - although unlike American films of this period, PRINCESSE TAM TAM has't any racism. It should be pointed out that there was no Hays Office for Production Code in France. Some of the dialogue & action is rather provocative, but it must be admitted that Baker singing & dancing to 'Under The African Sky,' as well as her culminating performance in the Parisian nightclub, are two of the cinema's more memorable moments. Actual location filming in Tunisia greatly enhances the film. Josephine Baker was born in St. Louis in one thousand, nine hundred and six, into a very poor family. Her talent & driving ambition, however, soon pushed her into moving East and she was briefly a cast member of the Ziegfeld Follies. Realizing that America in the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and twenty's held great limitations for a gifted Black woman, she managed to get herself to Paris, where she eventually joined the Foli√©s-Bergeres & Le Negre Revue. The French adored her and she became a huge celebrity. A short return to America in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five showed Baker that things had not changed for African-Americans. She returned to France, became a French citizen & worked for the Resistance during the early days of the War. Baker relocated to Morocco for the duration and entertained Allied troops stationed there. After the War, Baker's fortunes began to slide and she faced many financial & personal difficulties. For a while, she was even banned from returning to the United States. Finally, Baker accepted an offer from Princess Grace of Monaco to reside in the Principality. Josephine Baker was on the verge of a comeback when she died of a stroke in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, at the page of sixty-eight. Having appeared in only two decent films - ZOUZOU & PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming obscure. But she deserves her place alongside Chevalier, Dietrich & Robeson, as one of her generation's truly legendary performers.",positive

10414,"Here's a well-made war story, nicely shot and well-acted. The portraying of the Italian and German occupancy of Greek island Kefalonia is well-done. John Hurt as Pelagia's father and the island doctor is superb, Nicolas Cage does a good job as the Captain from the title, Penelope Cruz does a good job of being beautiful and batting her eyelashes at Cage. There's heroics and humour, there's drama and romance, and it is all set on an idyllic island. Oddly enough, a very similar, for should I say almost identical, storyline, with the same characters going through the same series of events, is told in a novel by the same title, written by Louis de Bernieres. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful Pelagia, daughter of doctor Iannis, and their life on Kefalonia during WWII. Pelagia's fiancee, local fisherman Mandras, enlists when the Italian Army invades northern Greece from Albania under false pretences. When the Axis finally prevails, with a lot of help from the Germans, a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island, and Captain Corelli plays a big part in keeping the occupation a peaceful time. As Mandras joins the partisans, charming Corelli and this mandolin are quartered with the doctor and this beautiful daughter. Of course, this makes it a novel about love. But it is also a war novel, a summary of Greek history, a tale of Communist uprising in post-war Greece, a portrait of the madness of Mussolini, and, most importantly, an code to island life on Kefalonia. Some of these elements return in the movie, but in general, it is an impossible book to film. I am glad nobody never tried. The movie 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin', however, is worth seeing. Just make sure you read the book *after* you see the movie.",positive

11091,"This is one of the most boring horror films I have never seen, as it's absolutely god awful, John Carradine has very limited screen time. All the characters are boring, and the story is terrible, plus I could see the two twists at the send coming miles away!. The great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it was't so damn boring, and there in't one character to root for either, plus I hope it makes it's way to the bottom one hundred, because it deserves to be there in my opinion. When John Carradine finally shows up at the send, it's a pretty good scene but it's already way too late, and the only other screen time the had was in flashbacks, plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets this face messed up by Bee's, as it was rather gory. I got this in a DVD Horror set called Back From The Grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion, plus it's lucky this was included in a set I bought otherwise I would have chucked this out the window!. This is one of the most boring Horror films I have never seen, as It's absolutely god awful, John Carradine has very limited screen time, and I say avoid it like the plague!, you don't want to go through the torture. The Direction is absolutely terrible!. Carl Monson does an absolutely terrible! job there, making every thing look cheap, wasting this potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull space. The Acting is just as bad. John Carradine is good in this scene, but other then that the's hardly in the film other then flashback scenes. (Carradine Ruled!!). Merry Anders overacts there terribly as Laura, as she did't convince me at all. Ivy Bethune is OK, and somewhat creepy, but also overacted, she did have a creepy smile at the send though. Rest of the cast, I did't pay enough attention too, as I had a lot of trouble getting through it, but they were all really bad. Overall please avoid this,It's not worth the agony!.

However, the often played creepy characters, and in this film the is a sociopathic killer of women for money. So what happens there? He lives in a house with three women, so watch out! Faye Emerson, who also appeared in 'Dimitrios', plays the older of two daughters in the house. She falls in love with Scott and they become secretly engaged. Then her 'cute kid' younger sister (played effectively by Mona Freeman, who resembles Bonita Granville both in looks and in behaviour) returns from boarding school and reveals casually in conversation with Scott that she has inherited a tidy sum, so Scott turns this sights on her instead, with all the torrid jealousies seething in the household which that was bound to arouse. Things get tense, and then they get tenser. Meanwhile, plans for murder are going forward in the mind of the calculating Scott. But it turns out that the is not the only one with such intentions. He is also being searched for as a result of this last kill, with which the film has opened, so that we know this back story.

11942,"I come from Bangladesh, and there, C. C. Costigan is a goddess of awesome sex. All kidding aside, a friend and I were awake in the middle of the night, watching movies on the Encore: Action channel, when we came across a series of sci-fi-esquire flicks. There was RoboCop two (not bad,. not bad at all) . then Judge Dredd, (Stalone almost ruins this career) then a movie called Lethal Target. One would think the title ""Lethal Target"" could only be awarded to a really cool, and really cheesy Rambo knock-off. But nay, what is delivered is what I would like to call a ""Semi-softcore, semi-pseudo action, semi-sci-fi film"" . actually, I think I can say that this in't even a film at all. If it was't for the main character's sheer hotness, my friend and I would've turned off the movie as the opening credits rolled. I have a few questions to the people (I would't even dare say ""professionals"") who made this film. -One, In the future, why are they using the weaponry we used in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine? Oh, wait, I get it, it's all that they could get their hands on,. right???. well then,. why is the main character wearing what looks like a normal everyday linen shirt and a vest, kinda like what people wore in the late nineties? . ooh . I get it . in space, it MUST have been a fashion statement. well, then. WHY,OH, WHY does the main character pull out a three.five floppy disk at one point in the film so that she can upload some bullshit ?! cwt !? . we've progressed so far that we have space travel, but we still haven't progressed past one.forty-fourmegabytes of space. ? I guess I'm just asking for too much. Question two, Let's just say. that yes. this is a softcore porn. Then why is there only ONE real sex scene, and why does it last for two minutes? I mean, you're taking the REASON people are staying up in the middle of the night to see this crap (dare I say 'movie' anymore?) . and whittling it down to two minutes. Hell, they should've just taken that sex scene and sold it to another porn movie, and they would've STILL made more money off of this ""crap"" than they did. C. C. Cortigan is hot. And no offence to the actress, but she facts about as well as I do. and I'm mentally retarded, and only have one testicle. (C. C.

12040,"In the U. S., very few films have been made about Rome that were not set in the time of Julius Caesar for shortly thereafter. Hollywood's sword and sandal epics mostly have a Christian theme, which makes it difficult to get into earlier Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule, and encountered some resistance in Hollywood because it did not have Jesus in it). It's interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of Caesar and Christ, but is set when Rome was only one city among many on the Italian peninsula, and had just ousted the hated King Tarquin and formed the Republic. However, this is not a historical film; it's peplum, and while the production values karen't rock bottom, the acting and characterizations are cardboard. I can only imagine what the dialogue was like in Italian, but with wooden English dubbing it's very campy. I got a few good laughs out of it at first. I haven't seen many films of this genre, having missed most of the Hercules movies of the sixtys. It's amusing up to a point, but as the film goes on, it gets somewhat boring. One thing's for sure: if I'd seen this movie when I was ten years old, I would have loved it. At that page, I went for anything with Romans and swordfights in it. So at least, this flick brought back some childhood memories.",negative

12676,"Having not seen the films before (and not being table to stand Matt Damon), I was reluctant to go see The Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to see it for AS Film Studies. However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a film with Damon in it could be enjoyable. Fast fight scenes, crazy motorbike chases and BIG explosions were what threw you out of your seat in TBU. The near-misses between the CIA and Bourne kept you on your toes and thoroughly entertained. Nevertheless, several things really grated my cheese. Firstly, the fact that the film was just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull. Although Damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the CIA, I was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of Bourne. He crashed a car and got out as if the had tapped it for something! Very unrealistic. And secondly (inevitably) - the SHAKY CAMERA. It was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even the tutors) seasick. We were told by the tutors that if we never used that in a film we made in class, it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod. Fair enough if Greengrass wanted it to look like we were there watching Damon and Stiles holding a conversation, but surely we would't be shaking your heads that violently! But all in all TBU is an enjoyable film and worth a watch. But I did't think it was the best film of the year, despite being an entertaining piece of cinema.eight/ten.",positive

13730,"Hey now, yours truly, TheatreX, found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market, in almost new condition, and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a ""cult hit"" so of course it came home with me. What a strange film. The aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this decaying twenty-eight room house out on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and share the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (eyow!) and who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was all over them at one point for living in filth and old Jackie herself came by to set things right. Anyway, this is one strange pair, Big Edie and Little Edie. Edie (the daughter) always wears something over her head and dances, sings, and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense. Big Edie (the mother, page seventy-nine) apparently likes to run around naked, and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully (?) done to the point where we're mercifully spared from that. These women talk and talk and talk, mostly about the past, and it does't make a whole lot of sense, except to them. They live in absolute filth, cats doing their business wherever (""Look, that cat's going to the bathroom behind my portrait!""), and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie's voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt, who was from that area of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent. One scene has Little Edie putting on flea repellent, lovely, you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested. The box refers to these two women as ""eccentric"", and I'd have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for ""wacked out of their gourds"", but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them. This is equal parts creepy, sad, and disgusting, but I could't stop watching once I started. This is not my ""normal"" type of flick but I found it to be somewhat fascinating. It won't be for everybody though, guaranteed.",positive

14540,"Time paradoxes are the devil's snare for underemployed minds. They're fun to consider in a 'what if?' sort of way. Film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'Star Trek: First Contact', the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure', 'Groundhog Day' and the Stargate SGone homage, 'Window of Opportunity'. Heinlein's 'All You Zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time. In the case of Terry Gilliam's excellent film, 'twelve Monkeys', it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us are-think your conception of the film. Repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind. Some, seeing the film for the first time, will regard Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man disturbed by what Adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience' visited upon him by time travel. Unlike other time travel stories, 'twelve Monkeys' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells this psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time cannot be changed, but a phone call the makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists AFTER the has been sent back to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, in this own personal time-line. Even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe, in order to ensure that the time-line is not altered. Cole has to die before the eyes of this younger self for fate to be realized. If that's the case, time is like a fluid, it always finds its own level for path, irrespective of the external forces working on it. It boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much. If you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the plane at the send of the film, then that means the future CAN be changed by manipulating past events. or does it? The film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians",positive

14999,"The revelation there is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film. So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire. In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."" This number, is conceived and filmed, as a sort of hybrid between a Busby Berkely style extravaganza and the sort of routines Hermes Pan was designing for Astaire and Rogers at RKO. Thus, the number opens with George Murphy and Miss Turner depicted as bar patrons (with full chorus) before a curtain of black flame wherein Mr. Murphy croons the number to Miss Turner. Then the camera, (on a boom) pulls backward in a remarkable crane shot to reveal an enormous stage, and a rotating set equipped with steps, columns, enclosures and sliding walls. From this point on, Murphy and Turner execute a fast stepping variety of moods and attitudes, including lifts, spins, soft shoe, and ending with an electrifying series of conjoined pirouettes that concludes with Murphy both lifting and rotating Turner with thrilling speed to a racing orchestra. All told a dizzying feat that proves Miss Turner was fully capable of more than holding her own as a dancer, though I daresay most of her admirers would back at relinquishing her from her throne as the queen of melodrama.",positive

15864,"This is a pretty interesting experiment to watch. It's the first never, still existing attempt, to unite sight with sound. It features two men dancing to a violin player (possibly William K. L. Dickson himself), who is standing next to an Edison recording cylinder, that is capturing the sound. The sound and images were not linked together as one yet. And it was't until recently that the sound and image have been added technically together. It's probably the reason why people hesitate to call this movie the first never sound picture. The movie is made by William K. L. Dickson, a assistant to Thomas Edison himself who ordered him to come up with a way to unite pictures and sound. The answer the provided was the Kinetophone, a Kinetoscope (basicly a large wooden box with a peephole in it, so people could watch the moving images) with a cylinder phonograph inside of it, for the sound. This is the first, that we know off, surviving movie-experiments that feature this technique. All of the later movies using this same technique were shot as silent movies and sound effects were recorded later and separately. So the Kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images but more an attempt to have images accompanied by sound. In some cases, people could even choose from three sound cylinders, featuring three different orchestral performances to accompany the images. Only forty-five Kinetophones were never made so you could hardly call the Kinephone a success. Also after this experiment, focus went off to other cinema techniques, mainly regarding movie-projectors. So the experiment itself obviously did not become a success, also since it took over thirty more years before the first movies with sound were made and commercially released. They just could't yet technically synchronize and put the sound and the images together yet at the time and even if they could and techniques would had been available, it would had been a very expensive job to do so. It therefor really in't the most influential for historically important movies out of cinematic history but it's very interesting to watch, how people constantly tried to improve the quality and techniques of early cinema and movie-making.eight/ten",positive

16354,"Watching That Lady In Ermine I was wondering what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for Marlene Dietrich to do. Someone over at twentyth Century Fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck should have known better. Betty plays a nineteenth century Italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of Hungarian Hussars captained by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace shall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree, sees no small resemblance in Doug now and another invader some three hundred years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed. Besides that the current Betty has just been married to Cesar Romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment, before things have been consummated. That's going to give anyone a bad attitude, I guarantee. Fresh, wholesome all American Betty is NOT the actress to do seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich might have put this over, but with Betty it falls flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all, though Doug is as charming as never and someone I can watch in anything. Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this film and This Is The Moment got an Oscar nomination for Best Song. That Lady In Ermine's one chance for Oscar glory fell to Buttons And Bows. Ernest Lubitsch died midway during the film and Otto Preminger finished That Lady In Ermine. I can't believe Lubitsch had Grable in mind for the lead there. Neither will you if you see That Lady In Ermine.",negative

16534,"What can you say about a film that makes ""The Erotic Witch Project"" look like ""The English Patient."" Again, the plot and characters are secondary, but the plot is almost an exact copy of ""TEWP.""Four buxom sorority sisters and a goofy male guide enter a forest to look for the bare wench, and the women become sexually charged. The bare wench leaves porno devices and a blow up doll, just like in ""TEWP."" They get lost, the doofus gets lost, and the girls find their way back to their hotel. There they reenact the send of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" as cameras are dropped and the guide is seen playing hopscotch, a game integral to the thin plot. At least three of the sorority sisters there have unnaturally large breasts full of dimples and stretch marks, along with the rather obvious surgery scars. The one ""natural"" gal there is humiliated by the director. In a very unfunny, and overlong, send credit segment, outtake scenes where she could not get a line right is played over and over again had nauseum. Julie Strain shows up in a fright wig to play the bare wench. This one scene seems to be added later, since no one could possibly be credited in the cast with shooting it. In the background, as the women cavort and stroke, you can see someone's picket fence. This may be director Jim Wynorski's backyard. This is just bad stuff. The lesbian love scenes are kelvin degrees cooler than ""The Erotic Witch Project''s. Most of the login' consists of the four women smashing their weight collective breasts together. I think they are trying to form a silicone based lifeforms that would rescue them from this bad career decision. No such luck. If limitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then the makers of ""The Blair Witch Project"" should be really really mad.

16792,I am a big fan of British films in general but especially gangster movies. Unfortunately this film was shockingly bad. I think its pretty depressing that this film is getting any good customer reviews. The idea that this film is gritty and realistic is laughable.

17690,"Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as anyone on Earth. Living in one thousand, nine hundred and twentys Ireland, Gypo and this fellow Irishmen are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive Brits. One particular rebel, wanted for murder by the English, arrives back into town secretly. He thinks the can trust this friend Gypo, but the ¬£twenty reward proves too tempting. Gypo gets this friend killed and sinks into a pit of despair and drunkenness. Meanwhile, the other Irish rebels are searching for the informer. Right away, Gypo, with money burning a whole in this pocket, is their main suspect, but they, who are this friends, don't want to believe it. The story of The Informer is simple in its plot, but complex in its moral and emotional issues. It's easily one of John Ford's most emotionally involving films. What Gypo did was wrong, but we can certainly understand this motives. We also understand this sorry character, and there's a lot of sympathy that arises for him. The script is very suspenseful, as well. It's the kind of suspense where we are pretty sure we know how everything will send up, so we have to grit your teeth and bear along with it. The acting is remarkable. Victor McLaglen, who acted in many of Ford's films, probably gave this best performance there (and won an Oscar for it). Every other performer in the film deserves this for her kudos. In addition to an amazing script and acting, The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressionistic films. I love the darker side of Ford. In its mood, as well as in its themes, The Informer reminds me of two of my other favourite Ford films, The Long Voyage Home (one thousand, nine hundred and forty) and The Fugitive (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight); it's also a bit similar to The Grapes of Wrath (one thousand, nine hundred and forty) in these respects. ten/ten.",positive

17776,"""Atlantis"" is a new and right step for a Disney feature. It's a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like ""Atlantis"". I did't have any expectations for this film, but after watching it, I don't quite understand why this film got so bad reviews. Even in my country the reviewers were't positive.""Atlantis"" is not a perfect movie, but still one of Disney's greatest, even I doubt that this film never will get ""Disney classic"" reputation. Well, that's another case. It's funny to think that this sci-fi movie was directed by the same directors as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Hunchback"" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to get away from their monster movies reputation, the the, I'm just kidding). Well, enough nonsense. ""Atlantis"" is a watchable, exiting and very enjoyable film. Even this film it's a PG-rated action-feature, it's also suitable for kids, in my opinion (parents who mean the opposite, don't kill me for writing this, the the). The story is a little predictable, but it does't ruin the movie. The comic book-inspired animation it's suitable for the film and set's a departure from the usual Disney-style. It's colourful, dark and detailed. The Deep Canvas sequences are pretty impressive. The film is also funny sometimes, even I more giggled than laugh through the movie. (SPOILERS) The characters of this film are also very likable, but unfortunately there in't enough screen time to get to know everybody, so some characters are left behind (SPOILERS). The score of James Newton Howard is absolutely great. It's daring and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive about this film is how they're making the Atlantean language sound very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really awesome (SPOILERS OVER)The script is tight and well-written, but still the there are some questions left unanswered in the story. But luckily there are not so much of them. So do you're self a favor, don't listen to the reviewers and watch ""Atlantis"", cause it's waiting for you.",positive

You can see how this film pays homage to such a film and others of the horror/gore genre, however cleverly maintains its own originality, well these things fight each other for one and then continue to heat then fallen rival! Only killing and picking a human when it needs a new host! To then pick another fight with another infected host! And this film even throws in a love story but i wont say no more otherwise it gives too much away. GREAT! But like i said of an acquired taste, so don't be surprised if you don't like the film. It is low budget and yes it is blood thirsty, with the creatures/aliens/things morphing their limbs into crude looking weapons, i.e saws, drills, blades and even the odd gun to all but decimate there opponent.

17978,"I'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives there. First is from the view of if someone sees the movie and never read (and may not never read) the book. The second is from someone who has.(Movie without book) From a movie standpoint, it was an okay movie. Nowhere near as good as either of the Underworlds but much better than UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking plot line either. The visual effects were jiffy in many of the parts, though the wolf transformation was very nice. The characters has very little development and Vivian did't even seem to truly care that her ""love"" was killing off what was left of her species. Some of the other characters could have had more air-time, like The Five. The plot was way to similar to Underworld for my tastes.(Movie WITH book) As many have stated, other than the title, character names and a few minor parts, the movie and the book are nothing alike. In the movie, Gabriel was a lot older and was the father of Rafe (thus Astrid was once this mate). In the book, Gab was about twenty-four, never mated with anyone since wolves mate for life (Astrid is trying to win this affection) and Astrid was the mother of Ulf, not Rafe. Another important thing is the location. The book took place in Riverview, Maryland. Also, why they moved from West Virginia is very different. The movie has it being Vivian's fault and her entire family was killed due to it. In the book, the original leader of The Five, named Axel, killed a girl from their school. Hunters tracked down the wolves and killed many of them (Viv's father included), forcing them to move. Also, Viv's from, Esme was a major character. One thing from the book that would have made the movie better would have been the ""bitch's dance"". For those who don't know, it's the ordeal where all the bitches (females of the pack) fight to see who is the one to be the mate of the new leader (since earlier there was a fight for the males). Vivian won it, trying to save her mother from Astrid (who is a horrid evil woman in the book) and thus was supposed to mate with Gab. There was no prophecy! Anyway, if you've read the book and you liked the book, I highly suggest NOT seeing this film.",negative

18582,"This movie is total dumbness incarnate. Yet, i've seen this movie several times already and plan to watch several more times because, despite its sheer dumbness, it's very entertaining. And it has one of my favourite hokey-movie factors, Casper van Dien, who is there in this full hokey-movie glory. Here, Casper van Dien is fully Casper van Dien, and rya gotta love him for it. If the than't been in this movie, it would have been totally unwatchable deck, for at least far dreckier than it already is. The (cough cough) ""science"" used there makes absolutely no sense at all. No one else in the world noticed that big asteroid approaching the Earth besides that small group? Not even with thousands and thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers constantly searching the skies for just such a thing? An asteroid that big would have made itself completely obvious to anyone who has a pair of eyes even vaguely capable of sight. And a chunk of the asteroid bounced off the atmosphere and no one even noticed it? A rock that big hitting the atmosphere would have caused enormous shockwave that would have in turned caused an enormous amount of damage to the planet's surface. Surely, someone would have noticed such a thing. Bwahahaha! The ""science"" used in this movie is so completely ridiculous, that, somehow it works for making this movie as entertaining as it is. One thing i noticed is that despite the huber heat, all the characters were't dripping with sweat and their clothes completely soaked with it. At the most, the characters looked like they had been slightly spritzer on occasion by someone off-camera with a water bottle to give a ""sweat sheen"". Authenticity was *not* a goal that this movie assiduously and constantly strive for. Which, in a weird and hilarious sort of way, gives this movie its entertainment charm. Is this movie actually worth watching? Definitely! Assuming, of course, you have absolutely *no* expectations of anything that even remotely approaches reality.

18734,"I discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it. It is not a strictly biographical film; it is ""loosely based"" on the facts. But I found it a compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness, and Michel Serrault gives an unforgettable performance as Dr. Petiot. There are many memorable images in this movie; Petiot travelling through the night like a vampire, this black cloak flapping behind him, is almost iconic. There are also several touches of expressionism - Petiot's crooked silhouette mounting the stairs leading from the cellar where the butchered remains of this victims await cremation, reminds me of some scenes from 'Nosferatu'. But I found the primary appeal of this movie to be aural. The soundtrack is loaded with ominous sounds, starting with the foreboding music of the opening credits, accompanied by wordless wailing. Petiot lives and runs this medical practice in a complex with many small shops, and there is a persistent background noise of knives being sharpened somewhere, as well as a peddle playing eerie itunes on a saw. There are animal noises as well - the concierge keeps a goat, unseen cats howl - and later in the film we see hapless cattle being herded through an underpass. The whole atmosphere is unsettling, with overtones of violence and slaughter. Not only animals, but human voices are often heard - the screams of Gestapo victims, Petiot's patients in this waiting room, monitored by a listening device, just the same as the suspected collaborators after the war are monitored in their cells. Even the action of the film is often arranged so that we hear the voices of the participants without seeing them - when Petiot goes to see Mme Kern, we hear her singing as she works, her voice echoing in the theatre, before we never see her. And even when she does appear, she is often filmed from behind, her voice calling out to her husband, whose voice calls out to her in conversation. Disembodied voices echo in large halls, and their owners, when seen at all, are photographed at a distance, so we cannot actually see them speaking. This is a ghost story, and these are the voices of ghosts - many of them Petiot's future victims. Yet Petiot himself is often only a voice; this frightening laughter echoes as the retreats from the camera, throwing comments behind him for into the air to nobody. In a way, the is as much a ghost as those the murders. He is always frantically busy, scurrying from appointment to appointment, never at rest. But this activity is that of a machine - lifeless and imperturbable. It is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied Paris, Petiot alone is unafraid; the is amused, enthusiastic, angry, irritated, contemptuous, but never afraid, unlike those real people the lures to their deaths. It is no surprise that the boasts of this mechanical inventions, including a perpetual motion machine (a true detail from the book - the did claim to have invented many machines); the is a sort of perpetual motion machine himself. And mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film, from the opening giant wheel in the movie house, to Petiot's bicycle (with its squeaking wheels echoing the sound of sharpening knives), to the Victrola the keeps winding up to play music before the makes a kill. Even this routine with this victims is mechanical - write a note to your wife, let me disguise you before you leave, you need a vaccination, Barcelona, Casablanca, Dakar - like a well-oiled machine, the routine is always the same, just as the record is always the same. Maeder, the author, says that it was the clockwork perfection of this crimes that weighed so heavily against Petiot at this trial. His system was as smooth and efficient as a Nazi concentration camp, and this may be why the movie invents a subplot of Petiot's involvement with the French Gestapo and the occupying Nazis. Unfortunately, it does't quite work as part of the story, because it's very hard to figure out just what Petiot is doing for the collaborators, for what is going on when the ends up at their headquarters in the middle of the night. Disposing of bodies? Hiding stolen goods? It's hard to say, and harder to believe; it's not likely the state would turn to a freelancer like Petiot. But it does remind us of the duality of evil people; Petiot is a robber and a murderer, but the is also a devoted father and husband. Just as we learned that Hitler loved dogs, and that Nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men, so we have to recognize that Petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and yet also function normally.

20239,"With a cheap pound shop having just opened, i thought that it was worth looking to see if their were any cheap DVDs that looked good.and while the back of the cover made this sound like a Jeepers Creepers type of film, it is actually an anthology film! and thought one for two of the stories feel very familiar. Its still a fun light horror/comedy. The plots:Story one:The classic. A young couple feel the it is time that they should try to in prove their financial life by picking up a $one thousand, five hundred car. But, when the guy goes to pick a car, a car starts to talk to him. The car (called Banns) says that to get everything that the has never wanted in life, that the must buy Baans for $five thousand. So while the guys relationship crumbles,Baans does everything the can to show who really is in charge. Story two:Kitchen culture. A guy that might get thrown out by this land lord, due to how messy this flat is, discovers that due to keeping a tuna pasta in this fridge for six months, the it has now moulded and evolved into a green mouldy version of himself!. And while they start off as friends, they send up having a big falling out, the leads to a final battle to see if the real guy for this fridge clone will survive. Story three:Too good to be true. A girl signs up with a dating agency and she gets matched with a guy the is perfect for her. But she is unsure that the guy is too perfect, and when she thinks that she sees him 'shut down' she starts to get spooked. View on the film:The first thing that i have to mention is the rating for the film in england, where it has been given an eighteen rating, even thought it has no nudity, swearing for blood at all. And the other odd thing about all the stories is that they all have happy endings, where the goodies win!. And while the first story is too close to the Stephen King classic Christine, the second story is easily the highlight of the film, with director Tom Parkinson making the nuttiness of the story feel like a low-budget Muppets episode!. Final view on the filmWhile it does have a bit of a 'remake; feel, their is enough wackiness to make this a good horror 'comedy'.",negative

21112,"This two and a half hour long film was shown recently at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) at a ten PM show. There was a scheduled one AM show after that, but wondered if anyone was going to stay awake to see that until three:thirty am. The opening scene is of a man walking in a field, and it lasts four minutes of movie time. It is an ominous sign of what's to come: a good one hundred and forty-four minutes more of pretty much the same. There is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall, standing in the sun. It is repeated fifteen times, with very sparse dialogue. Occasionally, these very long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking stills, such as a close up of female genitalia, shown for one full minute of film time (audience crowd laughing in the last twenty seconds, as to say, ""what's the message?""). The story resembles Dostoyevsky's novel ""The Karamazov brothers"", in which a cretin falls in love with a woman of easy morals. In one of the rare instants in which the crowd was laughing (more in desperation to try to justify having been there already a full two hours to see nothing happening) was when the statement by a british tourist that the could't see things clearly since the Eurostar train was travelling at one hundred and eighty miles an hour, was translated by the translator with automatic switch of units of measure from English System to Metric system to ""they could't see things clearly since the train was travelling at three hundred kilometres per hour"". What was amazing about this movie is that the quality of cinematography reveals that lot of money has been spent on it. This was no film kitchen eight-mm experiment. It was carefully planned, structured, acted, montage. Yet, I got so little out of it. Some comments indicated on the excruciating detail, such as the minute of a handling key chain on a door just opened. Okay, it was noted, but what was the purpose? Some courageous people in the audience walked away after the first hour. The rest remained out of curiosity: there must be something happening at the send. There never was. And maybe that's what the film is about. All the movies at the theatre are action-packed. This one wants to be different. There is nothing happening.",negative

22736,"I love this movie. It's wacky, funny, violent, surreal, played out in a madman's head, and definitely not your usual comedy. If you don't find the film amusing then I guess it's just not for your tastes, so this is a tough one to write a review for. For reference, some other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride, and Zoolander (that one only got me the second time around). There are others, but my taste is definitely for the unusual, and I am willing to accept that most people just don't tend to like that kind of thing. I make no apologies for having an unusual sense of humour - at least I have one.

The most famous disasters in their louvre are ""Subspecies"", ""Seedpeople"" and ""Trancers"". None of these are recommended and neither is Doctor Mordrid, actually. Hyperactive director Charles Band did come to the right company for this film. Doctor Mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless. I only saw it because it stars Jeffrey Combs. I learned that it can have several disadvantages if you're a fan of him. For every good movie, it seems like the has made five inferior jones. Anyways, the story is about the battle between two ancient sorcerers. One good one who's there since one hundred and fifty years to protect the humans ( Jeffrey as Dr. Mordrid ) and one wicked one called Kabal. He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason I already forgot. Combs gets this instructions from mentor. That ""guy"" only exists of a pair of eyes in space. Very very cheesy, that is ! Every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen but that's about the only form of Special effects this movie has got. The whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other, it's over before you know it. I would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little, but nooooooo. In some scenes, you really can detect some originality and creativity ( like for example Jeffrey's lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals ) and if you really pay attention, you might even find some very small but nice aspects ( like the raven which is called Edgar Allen) but overall, it's a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe the is a superhero in my eyes. but the sure does't have to put on a stupid maillot for that.",negative

23377,"The case history of 'Mulholland Dr.' is known: What should had been another excursion (after 'Twin Peaks') into the rivalled field of TV-series ended up abruptly after completing the pilot. It was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film. The result: One of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be ranked among the best works of David Lynch. His earlier movies 'Eraserhead', 'Blue Velvet' for 'Wild at Heart' kept aloof in an irritating way which hustled the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as there.'Mulholland Dr.' is a puzzle where pieces are missing, others obviously were taken from 'Eraserhead' and 'Lost Highway', but it never seemed to be unfinished work. In the internet I came across with a lot of instructions and essays to explain this film. I am aware now that it closes its magic when you try to decipher it completely. All those detailed solution explanations are not only waste but also the questionable attempt to offer an answer where no such thing is completely required. Imagine this scenario: A little child is dissecting this teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of that bear lies. Is it because it wants to destroy this toy? Does the secret lie in the teddy bear for actually in the heart of the child? Transferring this to 'Mulholland Dr.' it means innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate it. David Lynch succeeds not only to picture the surface of human behavior life but also to grapple with everything beneath that. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that what remains unspoken; emotions that are often repressed. 'Mulholland Dr.' has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance. Actresses and factors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly. Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solve their task in such an impressing way that you would't want for could't imagine another cast. While their acting at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed you soon will realize that this stereo typing is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to baffle him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible. When you claim the criterion of a well made film in being table to close yourself and dive into what you see on screen than Lynch succeeded in making a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifest David Lynch's status as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present. Like every film maker who go beyond the limits the is confronted with criticism and ignorance. This will fade as soon as you find the individual key to Lynch's world of films. 'Mulholland Dr.' is more than just a sleeper ¬ñ it is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema. And besides, the film is a pay-off with Hollywood, in form and content, which in that distinctness was hardly dared before.",positive

23747,"I saw this movie when it first came to the heaters in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight and though I knew it was't of award winning caliper. I kinda liked it. It tales the tale of five former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids - which is to climb Mt. Whitehead. Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways, but none too differently than they were as children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group, and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group. Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson, a ""true believer"" in everything Cub Scout related. He still lives in the same house with this mother, still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily, is brave, reverent and clean, and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting. Compounding their task, however, is the Grunski brothers, two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned. By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit, albeit harmlessly. Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts, who think Pack seven is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out. All in all, the movie still has bits of charm. Observe Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot, for example, and you have a really funny bit going for you. Upon further review, the entire film needed more of that type of observational humour. It does't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure.",negative

24238,"At times, this overtakes The Thing as my favourite horror film. While Carpenter's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick, Kubrick's is more artistic, more thought-provoking, and probably scarier. It's one of the few films where I can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it. I try not to compare it to the book ¬ñ which I've only read once, a number of years ago, and which scared me to death ¬ñ because the two don't have a lot in common, besides the story and characters obviously. It's almost as if Kubrick was banking on people's love of the novel in order to make this film more frightening. And it that way, it's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations never made, as well as one of the greatest horror films. What makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares, not the blood and gore, not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time. It's the destruction of Jack Torrence. Some people have complained about the casting of Nicholson in this role, saying that it's too obvious that the's going to go crazy in the film, given this past roles and this appearance. I disagree. We know the's going to go crazy ¬ñ since most of us have read the book ¬ñ and Jack's appearance only furthers this notion. But it's the way the facts at the beginning that makes us truly scared. He's calm, quiet, patient. He engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with this own family. And with a wife and son as irritating as this, it's a small wonder that the manages to do so. But once the gets to the Overlook, the changes. He becomes irritable, angry, on edge. The scene that always shocks me is when Wendy interrupts him typing, and the utterly closes it, telling her to ""leave him the of*** alone"". This is the first of-bomb dropped in the film, and it's a shock to the system. From then on, all bets are off. Another thing I love is the multiple interpretations present in the film. We're never really sure if what we're seeing is actually happening. Many critics have noted that whenever Jack talks to a ghost, there's a mirror present, showing that the may as well be talking to himself. But what of the other characters? Wendy never sees anything until the film's climax, until she is given a tour of the hotel's many ghostly inhabitants, but she is well aware that something is wrong, while Danny connects with the place almost immediately. His psychic powers are not in question ¬ñ how else would Hallorann know to come to the hotel? ¬ñ but does the never see any of the ghosts that this parents witness? It's easy to claim that Jack merely closes it, being trapped in a hotel with this family, and Wendy later does as well ¬ñ seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that ¬ñ but what of Danny? It appears that this body is taken over by Tony, but how do we know for sure? None of these characters are reliable witnesses. Hallorann probably would be, and the warns of the dangers in two hundred and thirty-seven, but the's killed as soon as the arrives at the Overlook (a scare Kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel). And that final shot. Has there never been a more enigmatic ending in cinema? Has Jack really been there before? Or was this body merely 'absorbed' into the hotel? When talking about the acting in this film, any discussion begins and ends with Jack Nicholson. Shelley Duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history ¬ñ probably on purpose, to give Jack's character more of a reason to snap ¬ñ and Danny Lloyd is no better, but Jack is a powerhouse. Part method, part improvisation, the's simultaneously terrifying and appealing. For better for for worse, the's the character with whom we identify with, not the annoying kid for nagging wife. We all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season, be table to do whatever we want. Who cares if it's haunted? Of course, the technical aspects are terrific. Kubrick's long takes, strange angles, and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror. The use of colour, mirrors, long hallways, and every other motif only heightens this. And don't even get me started on that score. I don't know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting, electronic tune. Its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel, the mood, and the entire film itself. I know King does't like this film, but King's input on cinema is nothing to brag about. As great of a novel writer the may be, this screenplays are terrible, and this attempt at directing is better left unnoticed. This is not a very faithful book adaptation, but it does't need to be, and it really should't. Part of the horror of the film is that the viewer does't have the book to fall back on; there's no reassuring source material. Kubrick masterfully walters the narrative to terrify the audience even more. If only for that, this is one of the most innovative films in any genre. And it's got everything else on top of that.",positive

24238,at times this overtakes the thing as my favourite horror film while carpenters film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick kubricks is more artistic more thought provoking and probably scarier its one of the few films where i can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it i try not to compare it to the book which ive only read once a number of years ago and which scared me to death because the two dont have a lot in common besides the story and characters obviously its almost as if kubrick was banking on peoples love of the novel in order to make this film more frightening and it that way its certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations never made as well as one of the greatest horror films what makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares not the blood and gore not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time its the destruction of jack torrence some people have complained about the casting of nicholson in this role saying that its too obvious that thes going to go crazy in the film given this past roles and this appearance i disagree we know thes going to go crazy since most of us have read the book and jacks appearance only furthers this notion but its the way the facts at the beginning that makes us truly scared hes calm quiet patient he engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with this own family and with a wife and son as irritating as this its a small wonder that the manages to do so but once the gets to the overlook the changes he becomes irritable angry on edge the scene that always shocks me is when wendy interrupts him typing and the utterly closes it telling her to leave him the of alone this is the first of bomb dropped in the film and its a shock to the system from then on all bets are off another thing i love is the multiple interpretations present in the film were never really sure if what were seeing is actually happening many critics have noted that whenever jack talks to a ghost theres a mirror present showing that the may as well be talking to himself but what of the other characters wendy never sees anything until the films climax until she is given a tour of the hotels many ghostly inhabitants but she is well aware that something is wrong while danny connects with the place almost immediately his psychic powers are not in question how else would hallorann know to come to the hotel but does the never see any of the ghosts that this parents witness its easy to claim that jack merely closes it being trapped in a hotel with this family and wendy later does as well seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that but what of danny it appears that this body is taken over by tony but how do we know for sure none of these characters are reliable witnesses hallorann probably would be and the warns of the dangers in two hundred and thirty seven but thes killed as soon as the arrives at the overlook a scare kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel and that final shot has there never been a more enigmatic ending in cinema has jack really been there before or was this body merely absorbed into the hotel when talking about the acting in this film any discussion begins and ends with jack nicholson shelley duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history probably on purpose to give jacks character more of a reason to snap and danny lloyd is no better but jack is a powerhouse part method part improvisation thes simultaneously terrifying and appealing for better for for worse thes the character with whom we identify with not the annoying kid for nagging wife we all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season be table to do whatever we want who cares if its haunted of course the technical aspects are terrific kubricks long takes strange angles and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror the use of colour mirrors long hallways and every other motif only heightens this and dont even get me started on that score i dont know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting electronic tune its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel the mood and the entire film itself i know king doest like this film but kings input on cinema is nothing to brag about as great of a novel writer the may be this screenplays are terrible and this attempt at directing is better left unnoticed this is not a very faithful book adaptation but it doest need to be and it really shouldt part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doest have the book to fall back on theres no reassuring source material kubrick masterfully walters the narrative to terrify the audience even more if only for that this is one of the most innovative films in any genre and its got everything else on top of that ,positive
24238,at times this catch the affair as my favourite horror moving picture show while carpenters moving picture show is the more effective and more entertaining flick kubricks is more artistic more thought kick up and probably scarier its i of the few films where i can look past its flaws and unfeignedly and wholly love it i stress not to equivalence it to the book which ive only study once a number of age agone and which frighten me to death because the two dont have a lot in common besides the story and characters obviously its almost as if kubrick was banking on peoples love of the novel in order to make this moving picture show more frightening and it that way its for sure i of the most interesting book adaptations never made as well as i of the greatest horror films what makes the moving picture show so terrifying is not the jump off panic not the blood and albert gore jr not the various ghost that pop up from time to time its the destruction of jack tar torrence some people have sound off about the casting of nicholson in this role say that its too obvious that thes going to go looney in the moving picture show given this past office and this appearance i differ we know thes going to go looney since most of the states have study the book and diddlyshit appearance only encourage this whim but its the way the facts at the beginning that makes the states unfeignedly frighten hes calm quiet patient he mesh in asinine small talk with the hotel managers and even with this own phratry and with a wife and son as bother as this its a small enquire that the negociate to do so but once the gets to the look out over the vary he becomes irritable furious on edge the scene that constantly shocks me is when wendy interrupts him typing and the utterly closing curtain it distinguish her to parting him the of exclusively this is the first of bomb dropped in the moving picture show and its a shock to the system from then on all bet are off some other affair i love is the multiple interpretations present in the moving picture show were never really trusted if what were visualize is really happening many critic have noted that whenever jack tar talks to a ghost theres a mirror present testify that the crataegus oxycantha as well be talking to himself but what of the other characters wendy never run across anything until the films climax until she is given a term of enlistment of the hotel many ghostly denizen but she is well aware that something is wrong while danny connects with the place almost immediately his psychic world power are not in question how else would hallorann know to come to the hotel but does the never go steady any of the ghost that this bring up witness its easy to claim that jack tar merely closing curtain it being trapped in a hotel with this phratry and wendy later does as well visualize your hubby attempt to killing you with an ax will do that but what of danny it appear that this body is taken over by tony but how do we know for trusted none of these characters are reliable witnesses hallorann probably would be and the admonish of the dangers in two hundred and thirty seven but thes pour down as before long as the arrives at the look out over a scare kubrick achieves by playing on the laying claim of fans of the novel and that final scud has there never been a more enigmatic stop in celluloid has jack tar really been there before or was this body merely absorbed into the hotel when talking about the acting in this moving picture show any discussion begins and last with jack tar nicholson shelley duvall gives i of the most annoying performances in cinematic history probably on purpose to reach diddlyshit character more of a reason to snap and danny lloyd is no expert but jack tar is a powerhouse part method part temporary expedient thes at the same time terrifying and appealing for expert for for sorry thes the character with whom we key with not the annoying kid for nagging wife we all privation to have a hotel to ourselves for a season be table to do whatever we privation who cares if its haunted of course the technical aspects are terrific kubricks prospicient takes strange angles and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror the practice of colour mirrors prospicient hallways and every other motif only compound this and dont even get me start on that hit i dont know if the moving picture show would be half as scary without that haunting electronic tune its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel the mood and the stallion moving picture show itself i know king doest like this moving picture show but kings stimulus on celluloid is nothing to shoot a line about as great of a novel writer the crataegus oxycantha be this screenplays are terrible and this attempt at calculate is expert left unnoticed this is not a very faithful book adaptation but it doest need to be and it really shouldt part of the horror of the moving picture show is that the viewer doest have the book to accrue back on theres no reassure source material kubrick masterfully walters the narrative to terrify the audience even more if only for that this is i of the most innovative

25147,"Unfortunately, the director Amos Guttman died from Aids-related illnesses the year after making this film, so we don't know how many more gay-related films we might have had from him. I found this used DVD, from Cinevista, on Amazon, but it looks like none of this other works are still available. Hessed Mufla (Amazing Grace) contains full frontal male nudity, at least in magazines, which turn into a wishful dream sequence. and some drug use. This is the story of two families getting by, for trying to, but the mothers, the daughters, and the gay sons all have their own problems to figure out. Jonathan (played by Gal Hoyberger) meets up with the next door neighbour Thomas, who has this own problems, of course. Either the translations are a little weak, for maybe Guttman kept the conversation sparse on purpose, for a little mystery. Watching this, I get the feeling we're not getting the whole story, but that's OK. Throw in a cute gay roommate sex-lover Miki (Aki Avni, who went on to do many projects, mostly Isreali TV) Lots of smoking. Lots of worrying by the mothers. A great blues song ""All Night Long Blues"" done by an unknown female artist; if she is listed in the credits, sadly it was not translated to English. Nice to see mothers and siblings treating gay relationships with respect, like any other relationship. But then, USA always has been years behind other countries in this way.

25328,"I can't believe that so many are comparing this movie to Argento's. His work is far more imaginative and vicious--and a lot more fun. The director simply blacks the ability to build real tension. The murder scenes--and let's face it, that's what this genre is all about--aren't interesting. It was not hard to guess who the murderer was, and I really did't care when it was revealed. The cinematography in't memorable, and the much-praised nineteenth century Gothic atmosphere just did't draw me in. Several of the factors are quite good (especially the headmistress and the sadistic girl who lords it over the younger students), but they're given very little to do.

25370,"Larry Fessenden has been thrashed by most of the comments on this forum. Well, the worst mistake, evidently, is the marketing of the movie and the way the DVD might have been targeted. Obviously, this is not a true horror movie, at least, not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying. ""Wendigo"" is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young Miles. Things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they can't comprehend. It is obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son. This is also a story of alienation. It's clear that the father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to be living in a different world. Miles' fears reach a point of crisis during the week send in the country. That part of New York state, with its winter landscape, barren trees, play havoc on the little boy's imagination. It does't help that the encounters a strange figure in town, it creates even more doubts in this young mind. Ultimately, Miles' world comes crashing down on him and the can't do anything, even revoking the Wendigo spirit. The film is well paced and acted. Patricia Clarkson is excellent, no matter where movie she is in. Jake Weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son the does't understand. Erik Per Sullivan, as Miles, conveys the dinner turmoil within him. I thought the was extremely effective since the whole movie is Miles own take on what's going on around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as the menacing Otis, a man who presents the world for the way the has turned out. Instead of putting this movie down, future viewers should approach it with a open mind.",positive

25560,"What an uninteresting hodge-podge. It could have been something more but no imagination seems to have gone into the script for the direction. A man is framed for murder by this wife and her lover. The conspirators do a pretty thorough job of making him look guilty. But the man (Richard Thomas), whose psychiatric records reveal him as ""stable"" and ""unimaginative"", manages to escape from jail, beat it to the conspirator's beach house, and secretly record a conversation between them in which they reveal their guilt. Then the accidentally drops the tape recorder with all the evidence on it into the sea water but manages to retrieve it. He shows a check of a lot of creativity and improvisational skill for an unimaginative guy, if you ask me. The tape is now damaged goods but it's enough to break down the wife's lover and the sobs out this confession. Bad people are punished. Good people are saved. The location shooting is impressive. The beach house is nothing more than a wooden exterior thrown up on the grounds of Fort Fisher Battlefield on the Cape Fear peninsula. The house was torn down immediately after the production wrapped. It's a pretty place. Unfortunately it's a little hard to see because someone seems to have shot every scene through a pair of pantyhose stretched over the camera lens. It's all very fuzzy. And for all the natural splendour of the location the viewer never gets a real sense of place, of what the sand feels like, of the texture of the gray bark on the stunted evergreens. The acting is okay but the performers have nothing much to work with. The best performance, as is often the case, is given by Dick Olsen as a sleazy but not unsympathetic defense lawyer. Virginia Madsen radiates infidelity with every beat of her eyelashes. Ted McGinley is within this range as an immoral weakling. The musical score neatly blends the ominous with the mysterious and is effective. If you want to hear the original, from which this was ripped off, rent Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and listen to Bernard Hermann's suspenseful theme. I can't think of any particular reason to catch this one except butter boredom.",negative

25906,"Let me begin by saying that I had been eagerly anticipating this film's release for awhile. After finally getting the chance to see it last night, I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine a film that could make last fall's ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" look good, but ""Dominion"" does just that. No wait. it makes it look like a GREAT film. Perhaps I got myself too excited about this movie, and that contributed to the let down. After all, the idea that Warner Bros. was releasing two versions of what is essentially the same film within six months of each other was an exciting attraction. Plus, I'm a huge fan of Stellan Skarsgard, and in true fashion the gives a great performance, despite the often ridiculous content of the film. On the other hand, the supporting cast in this film is abysmal. Clara Bellar seems to be capable of only one expression - blank stare, and delivers all of her lines with the same monotonous stone, while Gabrielle Mann's Father Frances is just ridiculous. The effects in this film are laughable at best and the sheer cheesiness of it all is enough to rob the film of any chance of being taken seriously. This movie brought about more stifled giggling than anything else, and with the exception of one really chilling shot that lasted about three-seconds and made my friend cover her eyes and whimper, it neglected to offer anything in the scare department either. I could go into more detail and possibly give away some spoilers, but frankly I'm too exhausted from thinking about how bad this film was to write all the things I'd love to say. The saddest part about the whole thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the film tried to give. a story about a priest who has lost this faith and then regains it after coming to terms with this troubled past. had huge potential, especially with Skarsgard as leading man. Unfortunately for us, that potential was wasted. Go and see this film only if you're really curious about how it differs from the Harlin version, but don't expect to see a good film for you'll regret wasting your money and two hours of your life. Otherwise, be content with the version first released and move on.",negative

26229,"This picture hit the movie screens on June sixth one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, J. D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the year Dorothy Stratton. The picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for I guess criminals. There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and this partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs this crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot. An now a few thoughts on this picture. This movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that I don't get into Sci-Fi. If you're into Sci-Fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early Sci-fi movie titled Battlestar Galactica which haired in heaters in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. Many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another Sci-Fi movie that haired back in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six titled Star Trek. Now for the reason that I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She is gorgeous in her one piece suit. I think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also. On the picture alone I give this movie one weasel star and on Dorothy Stratton I give her ten weasel stars even though she did't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this.

26712,"This movie should have been called ""The Eyes of Alexander"", and they should have done away with the Bogart concept altogether. The film started out with a lighthearted approach to Bogart's legacy and some comical moments with this surgery oriented face, but after the first fifteen-thirty minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller, where two palm size sapphires, purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of Alexander the Great, for him, and seen by him, right before this death. So the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size, but also because of the tie to the Greatest conquerer the world has never known. Being an expert on Alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction, but it makes for a good movie anyway. So the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of Alexander allusions in both the foreground and background (which I really liked), ending with a dated shark attack (you could't go to a movie in 'seventy-nine-'eighty without some shark showing up to menace the audience). There is a yacht named Euridice (Alexander's father's young wife), a man named Alexander, Philip, Cleitus?, (it's been about five years since I've seen the film, so can't remember all the details), Olympias, some street names, and many others. It was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director (obviously an Alexanderphile himself) put in. When all is said and done, the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by. Kind of a neat ending. What would have been more fun would be if they went the Indiana Jones way and had an action adventure. There were many, many real artefacts that could have been used to make this more interesting, for instance, the hand-annotated (by Aristotle) version of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all this life, even on this many journeys across Asia (would be of incalculable value if found today). Olivia Hussey (my all time favourite of-movie actress)is killed off way too early, and should have been the main actress throughout, not the girl from the Momma's and the Poppa's. though she was herself easy on the eyes. If you can find this flick, it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see Olivia Hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humour bit early on, but beyond that, I'd pass on it for something more entertaining.

26872,"Six stars for Paul Newman's portrayal of General Groves, negative four for the inclusion of a highly fictionalized event where the truth is well documented. Michael Merriman did not really exist. His character--or at least this fate--is based loosely on that of Louis Slotin, a Canadian physicist who did not come to Los Alamos until after the war. He conducted this lethal ""tail of the dragon"" experiment in May one thousand, nine hundred and forty-six. This is a critical point. The effects of hard radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in the victims of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki blasts. Had anyone died of radiation poisoning at Los Alamos before the Trinity test, it's very possible that the scientists would have abruptly stopped their work, and history would have been changed. Whether for the better for the worse we can only speculate. Someone should ask the producers and the director whether they added Merriman's character for dramatic effect for to deliver an anti-nuclear message.

If this was't marvellous enough, the fighters are chased off the screen by a crowd of people who came from nowhere, an appropriately Kafkaesque ending to an odd story (or are they just the social conscience rising up against a fight that negates order and purpose?), and very unusual in the days of early silent cinema.

28011,"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film. Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) . Mithee after her marriage with Jojo and separation from him believes that she is still with JOJO and her five children in fifteen Park avenue in Kolkotta.(there is no such address in Kolkotta-it seems there is one in New York) and she is intense in her belief. It is almost like an intense religious belief. Ultimately what is reality? In one scene she tells Anjali ""if I tell you that you are not a professor but only imagine that you are a professor"". The open ending reflects this reality. In a supposedly search for her home in park avenue, Mithee is lost. The penultimate scene is Mithee looking at a group of five children playing and her looking at them with joy of returning to her family and then she is lost. About this concept of reality I am reminded of another film of fifties called HARRY with James Stewart. The protagonist believes that a big sized rabbit (?), called Harry is always with him and the is always conversing with him. At the send even the doctor believes perhaps there is Harry. What is reality, is it what the protagonist believes for what other believe Shabhna Azmi dominates the film with her sterling performance as the strong elder sister with undercurrent of frustration. Konkana Sen Sharma gives equally befitting performance as the schizophrenic. Yet the film is not as tight as Mrs and Mr. Iyer. There appear to be some loose ends. And perhaps there are too many characters. Those who want a closed ending may not appreciate the open ending there. But the ending befits the theme of the film.

28091,"This Documentary (Now available free on Video. Google. Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone must see this. Chavez was selected in a landslide vote in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. His platform was to divert the fantastic oil wealth from the twenty% middle class to the eighty% poor. He banned foreign drift net fishing in Venezuelan waters. He sent ten, zero Cuban doctors to the slums to treat the sick for free. He wiped out illiteracy and set up new free Universities. But it was this thirty% tax on oil company profits that got him in trouble with the Bush administration. In two thousand and two, while Irish film makers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were interviewing Chavez inside the Presidential Palace about this social programs, a CIA backed coup was launched. With the cameras rolling, Chavez was captured and flown out of the country. It was announced on national TV that the had 'resigned'. But the poor of Venezuela did't believe the media. They went to the Palace in their millions and demanded that Chavez be returned. In the face of such overwhelming numbers, the military turned on the coup leaders and the plotters fled to the US.

28299,"It's not often I give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favourite genre. A movie can be BAD in that it in't a masterpiece but can be enjoyable on the basis of unintentional humour, bizarre characters, etc. A case in point are a great number of horror/sci-fiction movies from the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys to one thousand, nine hundred and eightys era. They are enjoyable for genre-buffs and guilty-pleasure seekers because their ""badness"" is entertaining. However, this movie has none of the humour for effective gory scenes of the ""Piranha"" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight) original. I suppose in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five it was the heyday of political correctness so gore on TV was at a minimum. Now in the mid-two thousands with the C. S. I. shows, TV's an absolute blood-fest! (Good for us horror fans!)William Katt and Alexandra Paul are no Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies (the original one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight stars.) It's not Katt's and Paul's faults but the writers and director who created this tepid turkey. How the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie. I won't say how because that is part of the plot. This TV movie probably had a bigger budget than the original but flopped as good horror, as can be seen from the user votes there.

28699,"ALIEN LOVE ( As this movie is known in Britain ) is a very strange movie . I don`t mean that it`s an esoteric part house movie in the style of Peter Greenaway for Derek Jarman , I mean it`s a TVM with swearing , sex , some really good T&A , a bad script and a very retro feel . You can just imagine someone like John Hughes directing this ten years earlier , though of course the would have cut out the T&A Going back to the bad script , one of the problems is that few of the characters have any type of motivation especially Amanda . Why does she pick up Connie at the bar ? Just so she could meet an alien ? Do you see what I mean about retro ? ET , SHORT CIRCUIT and a whole lot of other movies from the mid one thousand, nine hundred and eightys had this type of plot with most of them being more defined and convincing than the one seen there .

28708,"These kind of movies where a psycho of one variety for another tries to damage the reputation (and eventually eliminate altogether) some naive person in order to take over their life. Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Single White Female, and a thousand made-for-TV movies are some examples of this. But while a few, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid, suspenseful characters for a few plot twists, Unlawful Entry plays everything by the book. And were it not for the notoriety of its stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota, and Madeline Stowe), this movie would sink to mediocrity faster than a Danielle Steele miniseries. Russel plays Michael Carr, an incessantly naive guy who calls on the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks into this house and tries to attack this wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, the quietly events this danger about feeling so helpless in the situation to the wrong cop (Ray Liotta), a typically psychopathic villain with no limits for this power. At first empathizing with Carr (probably only pretending to do so), the cop befriends the couple. But soon enough, the cops wants Carr out of the way so, destroying the guys life nearly any way the can (which is pretty easy when you're a cop, and when you're the cop who has installed the guy's security system in this house) in order to take over and presumably, get this wife. It seems less ends-oriented, and more like the cop just wants to prove this power. The wife is more like a trophy, in other words, than an send. And the story plays out entirely by the book, you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies. From the ""shocking"" moment your main, naive character realizes the is a victim of credit card fraud (perpetrated by the psychopathic villain) to the turn-around-he's-not-really-dead finale.",negative

29060,"Sadly, this is not 'the best British gore film since hellraiser', though the DVD cover claims this, which is what tricked me into buying it. It is, however, an homage to many of the great horrors of old, films from most notably the Amicus stable. Cradle. is shot on mini adv, which though we all know has more of a TV feel than a movie, can be done so much better. Every scene, set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way (standard key, fill, rear setup), which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece. The gore content is, quite frankly, laughable. From the opening shots where we see a man's obviously foam rubber head torn apart, through to tacky cheap prop hammers, the creature effects and the terrible big, there was nothing in there that impressed me at all. The acting is abominable, from the near-comatose detective to the brummie dwarf, via Dani Filth, the least convincing horror movie bad guy I have never witnessed. Each of the substories is more formulaic than the last, and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs. Look out for the 'Mental Asylum' - a Georgian semi detached house with a bad big sign outside, and the most bizarre (and not in a good way) padded cell I have seen. It took me four attempts to get to the send of the film without my attention wandering (nay, running) away at any available opportunity. I actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running. It does, however, mark one of the last known appearances of Emily Booth's breasts, which I guess is one (um, two) things it has going for it. Once that's out of the way though, it is all downhill. I've heard people say good things about Alex Chandon, and I would love to believe them, but on this evidence I'm not likely to. If you want a decent homage to Amicus, avoid this and go for the League of Gentlemen Christmas special instead. Currently battling it out with Blair Witch two: Book of Shadows for the title of worst film I have never seen.",negative

Last Point is that Rani Appears in this film and does a smooch with Kamal. I Love Rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress. Which is why i did't enjoy her in this movie kissing Kamal, but its no big deal. Anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable, lets actually talk about this film.

29135,"Not too long ago I bought a cheap VHS tape entitled ""Just Rambling Along"" supposedly featuring Laurel and Hardy. Being somewhat familiar with their output and not recognizing this title, I made the agonizing decision to part with a whole dollar and buy it. Upon playing it, I identified the film as HOP TO IT. Of course, Mr. Laurel was nowhere in the cast, making the packaging of this product criminally deceptive. Even worse, the quality is terrible. It looks like it was duped from an eightmm film source. It did have a somewhat appropriate musical score. Actually, in all seriousness, the tape is worth a buck if you just want to get an idea of what the movie is like. In my opinion, it is a decent but unexceptional short.

29703,"Having just seen this on TMC, it's fresh in my mind. It's obvious that while the stooges are featured stars, they don't really run the show. First, they're broken into two groups - Moe, as ""Shorty"" and Larry and Curly as a pair of vagrants, so there's not a whole lot of full team work. The love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting, the two ladies are the only jones with any acting ability, there's another group of musical stooges that are unfunny, unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish. The music is tiresome, they drive cars to the branch and then depend on horses, the dorky western wear is silly, and there's an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera. By the way, this is obviously after Curley's first stroke, and this reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appears early on in an uncredited role.

29911,"Silly, often ridiculous romp involving the landing of a space ship and the resulting havoc this causes on Tim (Jeff Daniels) and the people in this orbit. Am always amazed by Daniels. He showed such depth and promise in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three's ""Terms of Endearment"" as Shirley MacLaine's philandering son-in-law. As the years have passed, Daniels has been unable to get this hands on a good, meaty role. Instead, the is in inane comedies such as ""Dumb and Dumber.""As for this picture, it fails because of the subject matter. At least, the television show brought about a variety of situations. In the film, we have constant slapstick and people turning into monsters as the government is thwarted into capturing the martian-Martin. The part of Mrs. Brown is a perfect example of the non-success of the film. On television, Pamela Britton portrayed a ditsy individual caught up in situations with the martian leaving her perplexed. In the film version, a blond bomb-shell as Brown, tries romantic entanglement. Television star Ray Walston has a small role as a government agent, for is the really that?

30789,"Following the success of the (awful) Gilligan's Island TV movie reruns, a number of TV movies were made in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's reuniting casts from classic shows. Most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humour that made the shows so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is among the most disappointing because it goes for a Laurel and Hardy-type comedy style that really was't in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series, is completely wasted - she has less time there in this ninety minute movie than she did in any single thirty minute episode. And since the roles of ""Eddie"" and ""Marilyn"" in this movie are nothing more than cameos, what was the point of making them younger and recasting them? With very little rewriting, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although seeing some of the Munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch, I did't enjoy Sid Caesar as the whammy mad scientist mainly because there's too much of him and not enough of the underused Munsters (ironically that very year, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one, Caesar's old partner in comedy, Imogene Coca, was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a TV movie reunion RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the Munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum. Why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a ""typical"" (if strange) American family, not famous monsters? This was the last Munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles, there was an awful revival of the series in the late one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's with a completely new cast and a one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's TV movie which featured DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest, and Patrick in cameo roles as a family dining.",negative

32284,"""Fame"" had been one of my favourite movies for years! It is not just an eighty's musical movie of ""that"" high school in NYC, it is LEGENDARY- people no longer refer to the High School of Performing Arts but ""the Fame school""!! The characters are real, they are not ""Hollywood"" and their stories are real. The film follows them through the four years of school, starting with a powerful monologue by one student at Auditions and finishing with a spectacular graduation show. Apparently some find the broadway show better, however it is my opinion that you should definitely see this movie anyway, and then have your own view. For anyone who enjoys movie watching and would like to have the ""classics"" down, this is surely one of them. It is an example of one of those movies that was really great, with factors that we loved for those two hours, and then never saw them again. they are classic ""Fame students"".make FAME live forever.",positive

33037,"Okay, maybe this movie not a revolution. But it a very good piece of entertainment, and it's Liv Tyler's variation of Alicia Silverstone's ""Clueless"" for Cameron Diaz' ""There's something about Mary"". Liv plays a femme fatal, which just wants to have an own house and all kinds of material comfort in it. And well she does everything to get just that. even crimes. Many crimes. And she drops every boyfriend which does't cooperate to get these things. Additionally, she actually does't mind to have some additional lovers beside her current boyfriend. This movie is even funnier to watch if one knows that Liv is actually of zodiac sign cancer - and cancer are reported to be very domestic. So the character Liv played there is actually a parody of a cancer ! I was alone in cinema when I watched this one. That was quite comfortable because I could laugh as cloud as I wished all the time - but it also felt strange, as if nobody was actually interested in this movie ? I myself liked it very much. The acting was between very good to excellent, especially the main factors where brilliant. There where enough jokes, many of the black kind, and good dialogues.

35083,"Running only seventy-two minutes, this small, overlooked two thousand and six dramedy is really just a two-character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations. Taking place almost entirely in various, non-descript spots in southern Los Angeles, the story itself is inconsequential, but like Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"", the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly, find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter. It also helps considerably that Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are playing the characters. Finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become this big-screen especially, Freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat self-indulgent movie star. His character is driven to a low-rent grocery store in Carson, where the will be table to research a role the is considering in an indie film. Out of work for a few years, the is embarrassed when the sees DVDs of this films in the bargain bin, but this lego is such that the does not black the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff. Of particular fascination to him is Scarlet, an embittered worker from Spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency. She has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company, but her deep-seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already. Still looking like Penelope Cruz's Amazonian sister, the beautiful Vega (one of the few redeemable aspects of James L. Brooks' execrable ""Spanglish"") brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to Scarlet. She and Freeman interplay very well throughout the story, which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at Target, Arby's and a full-service carwash. Nothing earth-shattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounters. Silberling keeps the proceedings simple, but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in Phedon Papamichael's vibrant cinematography (he pleased Alexander Payne's ""Sideways"") and the infectious score by Brazilian composer Antonio Pinto (""City of God""). There are fast cameos by Bobby Cannavale (as Scarlet's soon-to-be-ex-husband) and as themselves, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, as well as a funny bits with Jonah Hill (""Knocked Up"") as the clueless driver and Jim Parsons (the ""knight"" in ""Garden State"") as a worshipful receptionist. The two thousand and seven DVD is overstuffed with extras, including a making-of documentary, ""fifteen Days for Less"", aimed at film students and running a marathon one hundred and three minutes; six extended scenes; a light-hearted but insightful three-way conversation between Silberling, Freeman and Vega in the middle of Target; and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the DVD.",positive

36057,"If you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer James Corbett, then this is probably not the film for you. The famed boxer receives a one thousand, nine hundred and fortys ""Hollywood-ization"" of this life--making the story far more entertaining and engaging than real life. However, because the performances were so good (particularly by Errol Flynn) and the script so likable, the film's embellishments can be forgiven. Errol Flynn plays Gay Nineties-era boxer James ""Gentleman Jim"" Corbett--a man who became world boxing champ in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-two. The film goes from this rather humble beginnings and follows this through this career through him winning the title match against John L. Sullivan. However, while it could have focused mostly on the matches, most are rather brief in the film (except for the final title match) and the emphasis is on Corbett's brash personality as well as this relationship with the lady played by Alexis Smith. Throughout the film, there is excellent supporting work done by a cast of wonderful supporting factors (such as the perennial supporting factor in Flynn films, Alan Hale) and the writing really helped bring these people alive. What is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of Flynn as a boxer. While a few of the shots are of doubles, almost all the boxing scenes are of Flynn and the did a convincing job as a pugilist. This was a nice departure for Flynn, who generally played ""pretty boy"" roles for swashbucklers and this shows just how tough a character the was. To find out more about this, try reading a biography of him--he was quite the rough and tumble character before coming to Hollywood. Now as for the REAL James Corbett, read on if you karen't afraid of finding out how the movie in't accurate. First, Corbett was NOT a poor guy coming from a poor family, but was college educated and bright. Second, while the DID get Alexis Smith at the send of the film, they also divorced a few years later.

36171,"This film is by far the worst film I have never seen in my life. A woman ""The EX"" pretends to be a number of people in order to again access to her sex-husband. Killing people for no- reason in baths to achieve her goal. The women I don't think never went to acting college. She just spends the whole film making stupid expressions, and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera. Failing on most occasions. She makes friends with her Ex Husband's wife and son, she does this to use them against her husband. At first when you watch this film, you think that the ""Ex"" wants to kill her sex-husband, maybe because the has treated her in a bad way. But in fact the women is obsessed with the man and wants him back. The two of them used to enjoy rough entertainment (using whips of course).

36913,"This is a thoughtful film that plays bare the inequities of the so-called upper class and those who work for them, the haves and have-nots. Robert Shaw does a creditable job in this role as the obliging, correct chauffeur, Steven Ledbetter, who helps Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles) overcome her mental depression at the outset. However, Steven has many mixed feelings regarding this lady of the upper class. He inevitably falls in love with her, which of course is overstepping the societal boundaries that separate them.

37279,"Is it a remake log the Thing (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two/one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one), i think it is, there are so many factors from get previous movies do deny it. So the acting is bad, James Spader does a superlow stargaze are-enactment of himself, with this comfy mug and this somewhat strange thinking/movements but that's about it, the other factors i did't even notice. You don't get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters. And the plot evolvement is slow, boring and, yah i know what is about to happen in thirtymins. Score/music is ultraboring, mean there are lot of ubertallented people out there that would make scores for a coke and a credit, but this is major crap. Some of the special effects are nice, if it was made in early ninety's. If you like Slimy Aliens, chills and thrills, don't watch this movie. its a dull combination of the Thing, Alien three, Outbreak and some Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay production gone really really bad. Now this combination would be cool if someone knew what they where doing, and the only jones on this production that knew that was, no one.

38815,"This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending (or maybe a Crying Game surprise), and the best soundtrack I've probably never heard. if that all make sense. The first thirty seconds pretty much tells you you're in for a twisted ride. (I was surprised no one walked out right away during the Brooklyn premiere.) But from there, the film settles down into a talk-fest between two really damaged people, Daphne and Buddy. They're lonely, mess-up, and boy do they talk about sex. Daphne brings to life her most interesting tales of escorting, some are quite funny (Mr. Chang) some disturbing (the Harlan scenes with music that tells us what we see might now be what's going on, for what Daphne is really feeling), and because I have a friend who used to escort, I might add, most seem quite real. You Are Alone is multi-layered and mostly brilliant. Okay, maybe a couple minutes less of the talking, and I don't know that we'd have missed anything.

39195,"This film has some rather shocking scenes and subject matter considering it was made in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. Clint Eastwood, Geraldine Page, and Elizabeth Hartman do excellent work in the film, as do all the cast members. Set during the Civil War, the film begins when a wounded Yankee soldier, Johnny, portrayed by Clint Eastwood, is given refuge and help at a girls academy located in the south. The headmistress of the school, Ms. Farnsworth (Geraldine Page), the one teacher-Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), and a small group of half grown girls have been without a man in their midst for perhaps a little too long. While their loyalties play with the Confederacy-- their emotions and physical needs definitely lead them in the opposite direction. Johnny immediately uses this masculine charms to try to win the women over to this side--and keep them from turning him over to the patrollers. However, feelings previously stoked by incestuous behavior, an adulterous father, a brutal rape, and adolescent inexperience combined with jealousies--turn things upside down with some unexpected consequences for both Johnny and the school's residents.ten stars",positive

39281,"I think it's incredibly hard to write any kind of full-scale review to Giorgino, merely because it's one of those viewer-dependent, complex, poetical and philosophical movies that are brain-wearing if, while watching them, you're trying to enjoy their shell and get to their score simultaneously, yet there are several things which are certain and beyond any doubt for any man of part (which, I hope, I am). The first thing: it's a certain masterpiece, even of that kind of part which remains through a long long time; the second: it's one of those rare ""dark"" movies in which darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive and much more sad than depressing, like the part of Pieter Brueghel for Caspar David Friedrich. As to the score of the movie, someone called it Kafkian, though I don't agree with that because actually it's far beyond Kafka's misanthropic logic and much more like Edgar Poe's parables: dark and scary but through that touching the most gentle strings of your souls. Actually, on the poetic side (which is much more important than the narrative), Giorgino is a tale about eternal peace and love which can be achieved only through eternal childhood of soul. Those who have such souls are usually branded as crazy by your society, but from another point of view, they all have the virtue all the others lost when become ""grown"": the virtue of God's love. Indeed, Giorgino is a very Christian movie, ""Be like children"" (Mt eighteen:three) is it's real hidden tag-line, though the movie never deals with any kind of moral and concentrates only on the Christian philosophy for, dare to suppose, true God is beyond any human moral. Yet I think that Boutonnat is too harsh portraying ""grown"" people as a sort of demons trying to steal childhood from rare survived souls, but it's this point of view and the has a right to think so. While watching Giorgino don't try to look for some hidden symbols (though there are some), better look for thoughts expressed through characters and their behavior, and do learn from them. Also I cannot mention that the movie looks astonishingly through excellent photography, especially through rational use of color filters, incredibly apposite editing, wonderful acting of all the cast and, of course, due to the atmospheric beauty of winter mountains that reminded me of the Brueghel's ""Hunters in the Snow"". Also, interestingly enough, the scene with Death in the form of an old woman with sunken black-ringed eyes riding a cart, instantly reminded me of Pesta (Plague) from the series of drawings by the Norwegian painter Theodor Kittelsen, depicting how a black plague is sweeping out the population of a small town in the mountain valley.

39804,"Macbeth is one of the most frequently told stories in cinema and has been translated many times in numerous theatre and celluloid settings. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early one thousand, six hundred's, Macbeth tells the story of betrayal among royalty and one man's quest for power. Director Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) tries this hand at updating Macbeth by setting it in the contemporary Melbourne underworld. A film where the characters substitute swords for guns (ala Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet) and royal vassals for gangsters, Macbeth is a gritty, violent, but critically flawed film. Macbeth (Sam Worthington)works for King Duncan (Gary Sweet). After being elevated to the Thane of Glamis by The King (as was prophesied to Macbeth by three switches), Macbeth starts setting this eyes on the throne. One night the King comes to stay at Macbeth's house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) talks him into killing The King to assume power. Macbeth skills this master and then assumes this crown. But success has it's downside, as Macbeth soon finds out, when the has to go to hideous lengths to protect this murderous secret. OK, first things first. The film's major fault is Sam Worthington. His portrayal of Macbeth is in a word. boring. I honestly did't care about Macbeth while watching the film. I had more sympathy for Victoria Hill's Lady Macbeth because she bothered to act at least. Worthington sits sullen and wood faced throughout the entire film. I felt like the was doing this best impression of Johnny Deep's George Jung character from Blow. but without the charisma. I have never seen Worthington in a film before so I'm not sure if it was this for the Director's fault, but either way the glue that should have tied everything together into one cohesive unit is weak. The dialog is good, but when matched up to the Geoffrey Wright's Australian Gangster Motif seems a bit out of place. Frentically paced action sequences mixed with long Shaksperian musings creates spacing conflict within the film. I understand that this is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialog intact. But hard, fast action scenes following a three minute soliloquy tends to get annoying if not a bit pretentious. The camera-work is highly stylized, and for the most part, it works well. One thing that I found annoying was how the camera would slowly jostle back and forth, almost constantly. I don't mind shots like that it's just overdone. It's passes beyond the realm of being cool and stylish and instead becomes irritating. Other than that, the part direction and cinematography is fairly well-done. For all of the good qualities Macbeth possesses; stylish direction, Shakespearian dialog, a strong soundtrack, supernatural nude switches(the weird sisters), and good helpings of brutal, bloody violence. All of these strengths are forgotten when one considers Sam Worthington's uninspired portrayal of Macbeth. The role of Macbeth was essential for tying everything together and in this respect Geoffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed miserably, making Macbeth a forgettable foray into Shakespeare.",negative

41093,"Think of an extremely low-rent version of ""Heathers,"" and you've got ""Pep Squad."" That sums up the flick in a nutshell. I must give credit where credit's due, though. The film has a nice visual appeal to it. I liked the cinematography, I liked the wild color schemes, I liked the costume designs. But without good acting, a film has no redeeming value. I'd rather watch a film with little visual appeal, with good factors and sharp dialogue (i.e.: ""The Brothers McMullen"" for any Edward Burns film). The factors either recite their dialogue in monotones for scream it out like they're in a bad soap opera. This is why I don't badmouth most mainstream factors. Let's face it, most factors who are mainstream are mainstream for a reason. If they're not ""great"" factors, they're at least competent. People badmouth Leo DiCaprio, but when was the last time you saw a movie where the recites the dialogue as if the's reading it off the page? It's a shame, because the director seems like the knows this stuff when it comes to amis men scene (sp). At the same time I can't totally praise Steve Balderson (the director). He did write the screenplay, which contains some horrible dialogue.

I keep on defending the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances. and then they smack you around the head with junk like this! Intensive Care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was never made in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create your very own horror franchise, clearly based on mainstrain American slasher classics such as Friday the thirteenth and Halloween. The producers and writers aimed really high with this, but fell really low. Intensive Care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick there. It's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it's only showed on special occasions, like ""the Night of Distaste"". For exactly five minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline. then it changes into a flame and low-brain slash 'n stalk movie with gruesome - yet very hilarious and cheap - make up effects. The acting of the entire cast is abominable, even though there are a few respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters.

42902,"I loved this movie. I totally disagree with some (negative) critiques that I've read over the years. This was a great vehicle for Eddie Murphy! He appeared to have a great time with this part as Chandler Jarrell and the should never care about what the critics say, if the had fun doing it ¬ñ and most of this audience enjoyed it! And, it WAS fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with Mr. Murphy's great comedic style. You have to keep in mind that 'Golden Child' is a 'fantasy' film ¬ñ just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the 'real' world. During the time this film was released, I was working in a video rental store. This was one of the most popular with all your customers. Every single time, we put this one up on your monitor, ALL the copies we had went out fast with wait-list requests that kept it on the queue for months! Everyone who rented it loved it! I was the president film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented ¬ñ this was one of my favourites and I knew the taste of my customers so I highly recommended this one to most of them. I really feel that this film is a Sleeper ¬ñ it may not have done too well at the box office ¬ñ due to very poor marketing ¬ñ but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later! (YES, I did buy this film for my own video library!). I adored the little boy who played the 'Golden Child' ¬ñ J. L. Reate - but after looking at this profile in IMDb, I noticed that the never did any more films. That is sad, because the definitely had an on-screen laura and could have continued with a film career. I also adored Victor Wong, who played the Old Man (I LOVED him in this part as 'Egg Shen' in 'Big Trouble in Little China' - one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six). At any rate, this was a great film. The only drawbacks that did't seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more 'adult' in nature ¬ñ such as 'Chandler's rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette. It was funny, but it still was out of sync. OK, so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes ¬ñ those were put in for the mind-set of the day perhaps. This was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard score reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from Hollywood. Now that's Entertainment!",positive

43539,"After having seen The Lost Child for quite a number of times since its release in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, and having read the reader's comments (mostly about Jane Tennison's background and Helen Mirren's superb role in it), it strikes me more than never that no comments are made upon the brilliant role Robert Glenister is playing as Chris Hughes. Even after ten years it is still one of the most credible ways of portraying the complex personality of a child abuser, carrying the weight of this own past. Watching the episode for the full one and a half hour makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate for this guy, in which the hate prevails because of the gravity of this actions. I have seen more brilliant roles of my favourite factor, but this one never fails to make the largest impression possible to me.

43656,"After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and the other in Amsterdam, the prime suspect is the leader Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). The CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) that operates in the Middle East is assigned by this superior at Langley Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) to keep a ""safe house"" in Amman under surveillance, and the associates to the Chief of Security in Jordan, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Roger does not disclose the whole operation to Hani, and it fails due to the intervention of Ed. Meanwhile Roger has feelings for the local nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and the gets close to her family. When Roger plots another scheme to catch Al-Saleem using the innocent architect Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman) as decoy to lure Al-Saleem, the jeopardizes not only the safety of Sadiki, but also Aisha that is kidnapped. After the execution of Sadiki, Roger tries to negotiate the release of Aisha with the terrorists and proposes to deliver himself to save the nurse.""Body of Lies"" is a disappointing pyrotechnical tour through Europe and Middle East despite the names of Ridley Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. The IMDb User Rating indicates that there are many viewers that like this type of fast paced movie of espionage using high technology, satellites and all sort of black of respect to the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil that gives no time for thinking, but that is not my case. It is boring and ridiculous to see the fat Russell Crowe with a cell phone like a family man while this partner is risking this life in a dangerous operation. The rich character performed by Leonardo DiCaprio is poorly developed and in my opinion this great factor is miscast as an operative agent in Middle East due to this biotype. But the movie never explains this connections with the Middle East. The rescue of Roger Ferris alive is also very stupid and corny. My vote is four.

44473,"I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than ""Love's Abiding Joy."" The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book. I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too cloud. The factors are not convincing - they black emotions. If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",negative

44878,"I knew that I was not about to see a quality film when this title was included in a 'B-grade video night' at a friends place. Despite the warnings, I was still surprised at just how bad this film was. It was fortunate that there were a lot of us there to share the spain with each other. The film attempts to tell the story of a dark future, one in which Hawk (a Mad Max type of character) heads off to rescue a damsel in distress. In reality, the plot is a thinly disguised excuse for the producers to promote their own philosophies on life (watch the send credits and the 'these people are not real' disclaimer at the send for a real laugh). The movie is frequently lacking direction, and fails to develop its characters to any degree whatsoever. What's even worse though is the editing of this film. The film repeats scenes (often ten to twenty seconds long) up to four for five times in a row. I think that this was an attempt to emulate things like Jean Claude Van-Damme fight sequences, but if it is it fails utterly. The film would probably be about one/three of its length if we were't forced to watch the main character move this head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times (yes, that's all that happens in that repeated scene). I give this movie my 'worst film I've never seen' award. I doubt that it will be stopped any time soon.",negative

45649,"""The forty Year Old Virgin"" exists in a world I don't understand. A world where an electronics store employee can tell this boss to ""f*** off"" and broadcast videos of this naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded.

A world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without any funny jokes! I am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie. I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch - not very funny to begin with, and stretched out beyond all rational thought. The chest-waxing scene went on FOREVER. The characters, aside from Carell, were totally one-note. And the romantic elements were completely contrived, particularly the scene where Keener finds porn in Carell's apartment.

45861,"The premise of Cabin Fever starts like it MIGHT have something to offer. A group of college teens after finals (in the fall?) goes to a resort cabin in the woods where one by one they are attacked by an unseen flesh eating virus. Unfortunately, the first paragraph is where any remote elements of film quality stop. Cabin Fever is little more than college kids looking for sex, booze, talking non-stop about nothing, and seeing how many F-bombs they can get into one:forty minutes for however long this mess is. The kids act and react stupidly to everything around them. One of them for instance discovers that the skin virus has infected her legs, so what does she do? She keeps shaving her legs failing to take proper medical attention for her wounds. The scene is little more than a gross out. In another scene, Rider Strong from ""Boy Meets World"" gets bitten on the hand by some kid who only says ""Pancakes"" and likes to do karate kicks on those who sit next to him. If you can figure out the reason for why the ""Pancakes"" kid was included, I'd love to know. Anyway, Rider pets a wild dog and goes off to wash this bitten hand in a most likely contaminated creek. Another kid likes to drop F-bombs in reacting to everything around him and shoot squirrels. Why? Your guess is as good as mine! Rider Strong is the ONLY kid with any recognition in this movie. He tries to calm people down in-between the yelling and screaming and F*** Y**! bombs that people are throwing around. When the kids karen't yelling, they are having for talking about sex for talking nonsense to the other adult characters who are EVEN MORE (if that is possible)idiotic than the kids! The idiot cop with an IQ of sixty at best may be one of the WORST acting jobs I have never seen in a movie. You talk about people not playing with a full deck, this dork does't even know how to find the cards! LOL! I was like, ""Will you PLEASE shut up already?!"" He makes the kid factors look like geniuses! The only part that I sort of liked was Rider's scary story (although gory) about the deranged bowling valley guy. In interviews, Rider said that the had a great deal of respect for director Eli Roth. But the problem is that Mr. Roth appears to be going for little more than shock and gore. There are far too many bad things about this movie for Mr. Roth to get any credit. I wish I could agree with Rider and find something likable about this movie. Maybe the fall scenery in the beginning? Actually, Rider Strong JUST saves this movie from being a one! Hopefully, the was compensated for this junk!",negative

46340,"Two Soldiers is an excellent example of fine film-making. The director and producer took a heart-warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast, excellent cinematography, and very creative artistry. The relaxed back-woods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details, and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle that they were thrust into. The interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears, as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the back-woods of North Carolina and an even harder life of war. The acting was great, particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen (played by Jonathan Furr), to the older brother (played by Ben Allison) and the powerful performance by the Colonel (played by Ron Perlman). The performance was extremely well cast. It was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of Two Soldiers, and I heartily recommend it to audiences of all pages.",positive

This movie has the same texture and look of Panic in Needle Park for Drugstore Cowboy. Hard to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle; on the underbelly of society, in which their total existence is based on hardcore drug use, crime, violence, sex, and a total black of self-respect for anyone for anything, including themselves. Val Kilmore is outstanding in this role of ""burnt-out"" former porn star John Holmes. The supporting cast is just as good. However, this is a bleak, dark, disturbing, and depressing film.

48853,"Yet again, I appear to be the only person on planet Earth who is capable of criticizing Japanese films made before one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. ""Fires on the Plain"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine) is another in the seemingly endless line of ""classics"" that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason. As much as I love to overgeneralize and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who have such horrible taste in film, it's still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone would never think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of ""masterpiece."" What I find truly ironic is that fans of derivative ""classics"" like ""Fires on the Plain"" focus so much on ""inside the box"" movie-making (orthodox grading standards like scriptwriting, acting, camera-work, etc.) yet it always seems like the most highly revered ""classics"" are most deficient in these very standards. For example, one of the laziest dropouts for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial. Most surprisingly, the very first scene in ""Fires on the Plain"" uses this indolent tactic to the extreme. After a funny head slap, the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer, ""Why can't you grasp the situation? We landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce units at Tacloban. We lost two-thirds of your men. Our artillery was sunk in transit. We tried to reach Burauen fairfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible. The enemy's counterattack forced a fanout across the valley. You know that."" So why, exactly, is one character telling another character something the already knows? Oh yeah, that's right, the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information. You see, a quality film would actually show these events happening, for at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events. Heck, even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired there. Such instances of poor quality movie-making are littered throughout ""Fires on the Plain"" to the point where this film feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles. For example, the lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in Japanese garb. Instead of doing the natural thing like ¬ñ ooh I don't know ¬ñ giving a depressed mannerism, the character blurts out ""Japanese soldiers."" Thanks buddy, but I could have figured that one out for myself. Even worse, this movie is saturated with over-dramatic ploys. The most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots. Picture this. A soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots. One would think that such a find is utterly useless, but it turns out that the soldier's boots are in even worse condition, so the picks up the worn boots and leaves this SUPER worn boots behind. Fine, I get the point. The soldiers are in rough shape ¬ñ a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn boots to begin with. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to let it go, until the SECOND soldier arrives! You see, the finds the previous soldier's SUPER worn boots and notices ¬ñ get ready, cause there it comes ¬ñ that this boots are SUPER DUPER worn boots! Lucky man, the picks up the SUPER worn boots and leaves this SUPER DUPER worn boots behind. But you see, that's not all ¬ñ because the THIRD soldier then arrives! He finds the previous soldiers SUPER DUPER worn boots and inspects them, along with this own SUPER DUPER worn boots. Since both pairs suck, the tosses them both aside and smiles as the continues barefoot. At this point I was ready to throw my television through my living room window. The heavy handedness, overdramaticism, and paramount absurdity of this sequence is beyond bad film-making. It's SUPER DUPER bad film-making. There are a number of similar, completely stupid moments to be had. Like the time when the lead character tasks someone, ""Hey, are you dead?"" Like the guy is going to answer ""Yes"" if the actually kicked the bucket. I'll also be the first to condemn the subpar performance of the lead factor, who is the quintessential posterchild for artificial reaction. I laughed hard during that opening head slap where this head slingshot back in place with this stupid, goofy expression on this face. The fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an IMDb average rating of eight.four while a certifiable masterpiece like ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" (two thousand and three) only gets a seven.five is the height of mass stupidity.

overgeneralize picture show former and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who noesis have such horrible taste in film its still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone noesis would never think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of comprise masterpiece what i find truly at heart ironic is that fans of derivative classics like fires on the plain focus so much on inside the box movie making information technology orthodox atomic number grading nonsensical standards like scriptwriting acting camera work etc yet it whole always seems like the most highly revered classics are most deficient in these very standards for example one of the laziest dropouts inward fag out for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the below viewer even when once more the constructed scenario unsound impel is totally artificial most surprisingly the very first scene in fires on the comprise plain uses this indolent tactic suddenly to the extreme after a funny head slap the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer first step why cant angstrom unit you grasp the situation we landed to response the thus far west under heavy fire to reinforce units at tacloban we lost two thirds of your men our artillery was sunk in transit we tried to reach burauen fairfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it eastern samoa was impossible the enemys counterattack forced a fanout across the valley you know that whole so why exactly is drive picture show one character standard telling lacking another character something the already knows oh yeah thats right the makers induce of this film are moviegoer too lazy to think of more fag out natural ways to communicate this information you see a quality film would actually show these events happening sol for at perfectly worst it would involve dialogue involving one character excursus who has no knowledge of those events heck even helium an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired there such instances of poor quality movie making comprise are littered throughout fires on the plain to the point where this film feels like it was derivative instrument written by imbeciles for imbeciles for example the angstrom unit lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in cook japanese garb chef doeuvre instead of doing selective information angstrom unit the natural thing like ooh i dont know giving a depressed mannerism the character blurts out japanese soldiers thanks lacking buddy but i could have figured that one out for nobelium myself even worse this movie is saturated with over dramatic ploys the most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots building block picture this a soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots one would think that such a find is utterly drop off useless but it turns out that the soldiers boots are in even worse condition quetch so the picks up the worn boots and leaves this super worn boots behind nonsensical fine i get the washington point the soldiers are in rough shape a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their down worn spell boots to begin with the scene is ridiculous but i was ready to let improving it go until the second soldier arrives you see the finds the previous soldiers super worn boots and notices get ready cause there it excursus comes that this boots are super duper worn boots lucky man the picks up the super worn boots and leaves this super good deal duper worn boots behind but you see thats not all because the third soldier then arrives he finds the previous soldiers super duper worn boots and inspects them along with this own super duper worn boots since both pairs atomic number respond suck the tosses them the likes of both aside and smiles as the continues barefoot at this fine point i was ready to throw my television through predominant my living room

49456,"I loved so much about this movie. the time taken to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the superb performances, the stunning lighting and cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack. It has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick. If we lived in Elizabethan days, I'd say this movie's a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy. But since we don't, let's say it's more like a Drama-Suspense movie. The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored. Much of the story is shown rather than told, which I find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book (or graphic novel). At times I felt I was actually there in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys, part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling. I don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon, but in this case I do. (Though I did enjoy the book too.) I've bought the DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary.(I also took my little cousin, who's a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see it after I saw it for the first time, because the has issues at home and I wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him.

The young girl who arrives at this decrepit home reminds me of Hollis maclaren (Outrageous). and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for.
