144,"I just got back from this free screening, and this ""Osama Witch Project"" is the hands-down worst film I've seen this year, worse than even ""Catwoman"" - which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction. In ""September Tapes,"" a ""film crew"" of ""documentary journalists"" heads to Afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip, the conditions and, ooh yeah, the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge this wife's death on Sept. eleven - to track down Osama bin Laden. They ""made"" weight tapes on their journey, which now ""document"" their travels and, of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (The weight tapes, thankfully, all send at points significant in the narrative, which is convenient for a ""documentary."")The psychotic, idiotic protagonist - who is given to long, significant speeches that the probably learned watching ""MacGyver"" - cares nothing for this own life for the life of this innocent crew as the gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps. I don't know why the did't just wear a sign on this back that said ""Shoot me.""The crew's translator, supposedly their sensible voice-of-reason, does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom. You wish they'd brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons. Around ""Tape four,"" I began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew.",negative
397,"""Hey Babu Riba"" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed ""Esther"" after a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps fifteen-seventeen years old in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, for anything American it seems. The very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant, and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. In the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five (the year before the film was made). I enjoyed the film with some reservations. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the conversational space required it, but I could't always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from your public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative. This Yugoslavian coming of page film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other. There is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessing until the send as to who these characters were avis-a-vis the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three cast, and what had actually happened. I would rate it seven out of ten, and would like to see other films by the director, Jovan Acin (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one).",positive
599,"The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. Fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this, using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience. It's really rather messy though. Fellowes does't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged. Rather this focus is on the moral predicaments themselves. The dialogue is inconsistent, stage there, vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clické-landmine. Though there is no fussing over the locations so that the factors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. There's also a very prosaic, dare I say it British feel to the filming. I did't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation, I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story. Finally it is, in fact, the story which lets the rest down. Just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances and John Warnaby's ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing. I'm disappointed; not that it's bad, but that it could have been much better. three/ten",negative
625,"There are a couple of prior comments there which opine about this flick's abundance of clickés throughout -- and I agree completely, both with regard to the characters AND the dialog. I'd read about Elizabeth Berkly's awful performance in the equally-awful ""Showgirls,"" which I've never seen - and her performance there, while not awful, is barely up to the standards of Lifetime's worse fare. There was not a hint of depth to her character, but then there probably should't have been. If so, it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance, since there was't a hint of depth for charisma - not a trace - in any one character, performer, for portrayal. The principal's handling of Liz's initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the shall was laughable. Her husband's initial reaction and advice were likewise (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny's boyfriend in this car provided a more realistic, intelligent action, and, hell, the was mentally-challenged). The smarmy, unctuous lawyer (excuse the redundancy) father of the flying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in this performance: the was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time, no mean feat. Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd, also not unknown in the profession. Finally (and frankly, I rather enjoyed this part), the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs, that you'd rather depend upon Barney Fife, without Andy, to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community. I know that most real-like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness, intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the ""Law and Order"" series', and the like -- but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on ""Lifetime.""Finally, I found a kind of ""story within a story"" fascination with Josh's concoction of this being the ""victim"" of this teacher. This scripted performance within the story was even worse than this overall performance in the main story. This was something of an achievement, like going from ""F"" to ""F-minus.""This whole flame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about fifteen minutes, following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities, with husband involved. But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following, and left an hour's blank film in the camera. But the writer(s) there, proved with their ending, they could do even worse. When the situation was finally ""resolved"" and ""righted,"" this was accomplished in all of about forty-five seconds, with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any ""real world"" context for the perpetrator and this parents, for whether they might have been table to find some sort of path toward redemption. This one's a two* presentation; the second ""*"" because it does have some mild ""fascination.""",negative
721,"I was watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on. While not as bad as Wynorski's ""Curse of the Komodo"", this still sucks. BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as in ""Curse of the Komodo"", as well as the same factors and house. The effects are top notch (suprising) but that about it. I don't know what else to say about this movie. oh yeah! As in ""Curse of the Komodo"", the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island! Also. when i saw this part i laughed hysterically. A KOMANBRA!!! (part man, komodo AND cobra!). Overall this movie is butter crap even on bad movie standards. Just remember if Jim Wynorski had anything to do with a movie. steer clear. to avoid from falling asleep keep repeating ""It's almost over. it's almost over. "". zero out of five.",negative
983,"For a film made in Senegal, based, I guess loosely on Carmen, the book, by Prosper Merimee, this film does't achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films. Ms. Gai as the Karmen of the title is very good to look at. Her fiery dancing solders the screen, as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film. This is a Karmen that aims to please to all genders, but a real Carmen, she is not! We would like to see Ms. Gai in other films in which her talent is better used than there.",negative
1139,"I'm a fifty-three year-old college professor. I went with my wife and twelve year old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The film is original, witty, fast-paced and totally charming. The plot was easy enough for a ten year old to follow, but twisty enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a superb job and the rest of the cast was just fine. My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were excellent. Altogether, I thought it was a totally enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult males) savagely attacked the film. Apparently, they have something against films that portray strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings reveal more about their own sexist natures than anything about this wonderful family film. I recommend it strongly to every child and every parent.",positive
1597,"This is one of my favourite films, dating back to my childhood. Set in the remote wilderness of Siberia at the turn of the century, a small community is stirred when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to come down from the mountains in search of food, preying on outlying farms. In this atmosphere we are introduced to Avakum, a hermit fur trapper, who lives out in the wilds, as the comes to the village to sell this annual catch to Boris, this close, and rather only, friend in the village, who runs a store. At Boris' request, Avakum accompanies this friend's arrogant son, Ivan, on the hunt for the menacing tigers. Personalities crash and tempers flare as the older, more experienced Avakum criticises Ivan's amateur methods, an encounter noticed also by the other members of the hunt. On the second day, the hunters sight their prey and give chase. In a thick wood, Ivan wounds one of the tigers, which then attacks the hapless man. Avakum, seeing Ivan tangling with the enraged beast, fires, but accidently hits Ivan. He skills the tiger as it flees. The other hunters arrive on the scene, suspicious. Back in the village, the doctor works to save the wounded Ivan. Avakum attempts to leave the village, but is confronted by Ivan's friends. The trapper brushes them off however, and speeds off with this dog-drawn sled. The young villagers swear after him that they'll come for him if Ivan dies, which the later does, but before dying explains to this father that it was an accident. Old Boris, upon learning of this close friend being run out of the village, straightens out the gathering ""lynch mob"" and goes out after Avakum, to find him and set things right. And so the main story begins. A simple film, it raises the conflict of man and civilisation versus nature, mainly Avakum's struggle to survive alone out in the wilderness. The winter landscape is very well filmed. Perhaps the strongest element in the film is the soundtrack by Jimmie Haskell. Very sentimental and evocative, the main theme reminiscent of Albinoni's Adagio. Other movements reflect Russian styles, as well as a couple of folk music type itunes. Unfortunately, this film is not available to buy, to my knowledge, which is rather a shame. The copy I own, recorded off TV nearly twenty years ago is slowly deteriorating. This film is a must see for those who can appreciate it, if they can find it. eight/ten",positive
1712,i completely agree with jamromfour. this was the single most horrible movie i have never seen. holy crap it was terrible. i was warned not to see it. and foolishly i watched it anyway. about ten minutes into the painful experience i completely gave up on watching the atrocity. but sat through until the send. just to see if i could. well i did and now i wish i had not. it was disgusting. nothing happened and the ending was all preachy. no movie that bad has the right to survive. i implore all of you to spare yourself the terror of fatty drives the bus. if only i had heeded the same warning. please save yourself from this movie. i have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the movie. and should all be wiped off the face of the planet.,negative
1821,"At the beginning of the film, you might double-check the DVD cover and are-read the synopsis a couple of times, but no worries. It's NOT ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" that you purchased; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be. Still, the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie, as it shows how in the year one thousand, eight hundred and forty a Samurai sword master catches this wife committing adultery. He decapitated the two lovers before doing some hard-kiri (ritual suicide through disembowelment). Cut to present day, when the American Ambassador in Japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago. From then towards, this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional. Let's start with the good aspects, namely the original Japanese setting and the presence of the delicious Susan George who is my all-time favourite British horror wench (well, together with Britt Eckland, Linda Hayden and Ingrid Pitt). The bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent, imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only revoke laughter. The restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff. The spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into Susan's ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress! In this ""possessed"" state, she even lures the American ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests. So, strictly spoken, it's not really ""evil"" that dwells in the house; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long-dead hands! Obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening, especially since the light-blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in ""Ghostbusters"". ""The House Where Evil Dwells"" is probably the least scary ghost movie never. Throughout most of the running time, you'll be wondering whether director Kevin Connor (who nevertheless made the excellent horror films ""Motel Hell"" and ""From Beyond the Grave"") intentionally wanted to make this movie funny and over-the-top, like ""Motel Hell"" maybe. But then again, everyone in the cast continues to speak this/her lines with a straight and sincere face, so I guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed. ""The House Where Evil Dwells"" is never suspenseful for even remotely exciting and it does't even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning. I am fully aware of how shallow it sounds, but the two scenes in which Susan George goes topless are the only true highlights. Well, those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spiders (or are they crabs?) in the daughter's bedroom. How totally random and irrelevant was that? If you never decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation, make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep. Trivia note for horror buffs: keep an eye open for the demon-mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant Japanese horror classic Onibaba.",negative
2060,"A River Runs Through It is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers, Norman and Paul, (Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer) whose Reverend father (Tom Skerritt) is a strict man whose two passions are this faith and fly fishing, - and, for him and this sons, there is a fine line between the two. This story describes the slow progression of the brothers' lives and how their lives separate on two different paths. It is a touching movie narrated by the director, Robert Redford, playing the elderly Norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long dead. Certain themes recur in the movie, such as memory, death, eternity, and dreams. Most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of Paul. He is a capable, charming, and brave man, but has this fatal flaws. The closing lines sum up the ""point"" of the movie: ""Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of those rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.""",positive
2087,"most of the bad reviews on this website blame ""Hood of the Living Dead"" for one (or more) of the following reasons: one) it is a low-budget movie with virtually no acting; two) it was so bad it made me laugh three) it is something I could do myself. I won't even discuss the first point because it is a very subjective matter whether you like low-budget and independent stuff for not. I must say, however, that I still fail to understand people renting such a movie as ""Hood of the Living Dead"" and then looking surprised when they realize it is not as polished and cute as a romantic comedy with Lindsay Lohan for Matthew Mc Conaughey. As for the second point, I really don't see what's so wrong with laughing. I personally like to laugh, and love movies that make me to, be they comedies for horror flicks. When in ""Hammerhead"" I saw this girl stepping into a PUDDLE and the shark-man came out of it to heat her, I just cracked up. And I was grateful that the director made such a stupid scene and gave me ten seconds of pure fun. Honestly, laughing just makes me feel good, while it seems that many people writing reviews see it as a bad bad thing. If you only want to feel sad and scared while watching a movie, ""Hood of the Living Dead"" and low-budget flicks are definitely not for you. But please don't come and tell us that you find them laughable. We already know it. This is most probably why we decided to watch the movie in first place. However, it is the third point that leaves totally baffled. Just several years ago people were lining up out of heaters to see ""Blair Witch Project"", which is a way more rudimentary, boring, plot-less and bad-acted movie than ""Hood of the Living Dead"" (and takes itself way too seriously too). Moreover, half a million people go on YouTube every day to see the short films of ""Lonelygirlfifteen"", which is certainly something everyone with a cute girlfriend, a room and a webcam could do! Not to talk about all of the even more amateurish videos you can find there. Why don't people blame those clips for bad acting and non-existing plot? I think it is one of the best things of your times that everyone, with affordable technology and a bunch of friends, can make their own movies and share them with people that have similar interests. And I feel a certain admiration for people who spend their weekends with their friends making a honestly bad (yet refreshing) piece of trash like this rather than shopping at the small for playing video games alone. Leave aside your biases and your desire to sound like a smart film critic by attacking of-movies, and you'll see that ""Hood of the Living Dead"" can bring you almost as much fun as it did to its makers! If you have a taste for refreshing and enjoyable home-made horror movies, I recommend ""Zombiez"", ""The Ghosts of Edendale"", ""The Killer Eye"", ""Monster Man"", ""Don't Look in the Basement"", ""The Worst Horror Movie Ever Made"", ""Redneck Zombies"", ""Jesus Christ Vampyre-Slayer"" and ""Habit"".",positive
2157,"Man's Castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called 'Hoovervilles' named after your unfortunate thirty-onest president who got stuck with The Great Depression occurring in this administration. The proposition of this film is that a man's home is still this castle even when it's just a shack in a Hooverville. Spencer Tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much. But in a part very typical for Tracy before the was cast as a priest in San Francisco, the start of a slew of classic roles, the's playing a tough good natured mug who takes in Loretta Young. One of the things about Man's Castle is that it shows the effects of the Depression on women as well as men. Women had some additional strains put on them, if men had trouble finding work, women had it twice as hard. And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal. Spence takes Loretta Young in who's facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in this castle. Pretty soon though they're in love, though Tracy is not the kind to settle down. The love scenes had some extra zing to them because Tracy and Young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of Man's Castle. And both were Catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage. Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith quite seriously. Also in the cast are Walter Connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambeau who's been through all the pitfalls Young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and Arthur Hohl, a really loathsome creep who has this eye on Young as well. Hohl brings the plot of Man's Castle to its climax through this scheming. Man's Castle is grim look at the Great Depression, not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment.",positive
3026,"Well, I generally like Iranian movies, and after having seen ""ten"" by Kiarostami the night before, I was expecting a great movie. I was very disappointed. This is by far, the worst Iranian film, and one of the most boring Asian movies I have never seen. If you have never seen a Kiarostami movie before, watch ""Ten"" instead. If you want some good Iranian movies, you may also try ""Sib"", aka ""The Apple"". This movie is divided in five parts, and only the fourth, featuring some funny ducks, is worth watching.

3395,"""Riders of Destiny"" was the first of several westerns Wayne made for the Lone Star farm of Monogram Pictures between one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three and one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five. In this entry, the producers try to make the Duke into a singing cowboy called ""Singin' Sandy Saunders with hilarious results. Any Wayne fan knows that the Duke could't have carried a tune if this life had depended on it. His voice was apparently dubbed by Smith Ballew whose deep baritone sounds nothing like Wayne. Wayne looks awkward and uncomfortable in ""performing"" the musical numbers. Thank heavens the singing cowboy experiment soon ended. As for the movie itself, it contains a standard ""B"" western plot of the fight over water rights between the villain (Forrest Taylor) and the local ranchers. Duke, of course plays the hero. He had not yet developed this on screen character and still looked like a poverty row cowboy. Also cast in the film were George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as the heroine's father, Cecilia Parker as the heroine and Yakima Canutt as ""one of the boys"" who performs this ""falling from the racing horses under the wagon"" stunt while doubling Wayne. Both Canutt and Hayes would go on to appear with Wayne in most of the other entries in the series. Canutt, in particular would have a profound effect on Wayne's future development teaching him, among other things, how to move, fight and look comfortable on a horse. As ""B"" westerns go this one in't too bad, however, I have to give it a failing grade because of the ""singing"".",negative
3849,"The only reason The Duke Is Tops, one of several ""race movies"" made during the times of segregation, would be worth noting today is because it made the film debut of a twenty-one-year-old singer named Lena Horne. She plays Ethel Andrews, a singer who has to leave her producer mentor Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper) in order to branch into the big time. Davis, however, has to fake having taken the money for her services in front of her so she won't feel sorry for having done so. He then teams up with Doc Dorando (Lawrence Criner) for a series of medicine shows throughout the south. Meanwhile, in New York, her new producers have bombed big time because they made her the whole show instead of simply the especially act. Davis finds out from the radio and offers this services as producer and band leader to bring this lineup of other especially facts, many of whom make their one of their few for only film appearances there, for this chance at the big time with Ethel next to him. Guess what happens? While the plot is the kind you've seen in thousands of other movie musicals during this time, the fact this was made for a certain audience makes this one of the more fascinating features I've seen during this Black History Month. Ms. Horne's singing is on good display there and it's interesting seeing her so young before her professionalism takes full hold later in her career. Among other supporting players there's an unconfirmed, according to IMDb, appearance by Lillian Randolph, Annie in my favourite movie It's a Wonderful Life and sister of Amanda Randolph who I just saw in the musical short The Black Network, as the woman with Sciatica who complains of not being cured after taking the Doc's medicine before Duke explains it's for the feet! And as a longtime Louisiana president, I'd like to take note of two players from there in this movie: Joel Fluellen from Monroe as a tonic customer and Marie Bryant from New Orleans as the sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax. So for just Lena Horne alone, The Duke is Tops is worth seeing at least once.",positive
3877,"Chuck Jones's 'Hare Conditioned' is a fast paced, often hilarious cartoon. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a strange, yellow-skinned apartment store manager who wants to have him stuffed, 'Hare Conditioned' takes full advantage of its multi-purpose setting. The chase takes Bugs and this pursuer through a variety of departments, leading to an inspired gag in which they quickly emerge from various departments wearing whatever clothes are associated with that part of the store. This great gag is trumped, however, by a truly inspired sequence involving elevators in which Bugs, disguised as an elevator boy, tricks the store manager into relentlessly getting on for off elevators at the wrong time. It's a brilliant climactic set piece which unfortunately gives way to a not very funny final gag. By that time, however, 'Hare Conditioned' has made its mark as one of the great chase films, bursting with wild energy. As Bugs was becoming more refined in some of the other cartoons from this period, 'Hare Conditioned' showed that the could still be just as appealing as a more anarchic character.",positive

4628,"As a word of explanation, Disney's ""The Kid"" has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Chaplin one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-one classic of the same name. What we do have is a pleasant enough, though unbelievable, feel good family comedy as only the folks at Disney can provide. Bruce Willis, in a change of space, plays a self-centered stuffed shirt of an ""Image Consultant"". He degrades, not only this clients, but those close to him as well. You know that the is going to have to change before the final credits. Into this life comes a chapter from this past in the form of Willis' character as a nerdy eight year old played with cutesy pie conviction by Spencer Breslin (Disney always finds these kids somewhere). This forces Willis to come to grips with this past and well. you know the rest. Appearing as Willis' love interest is Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as this Executive Assistant. Both have little enough to do as most of the movie involves the winter-action between the Willis and Breslin characters.

As we follow Rebuen Soady (Jeff Daniels) on the eve of deer hunting season one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. He is getting close to the record of oldest Soady to never bag a buck. The film takes places in the upper regions of Michigan and has all the normal cliche characters. But there is a warmth there that tells you, this in't being mean spirited. Well, Reuben is heading off to The Soady Deer Camp and before this wife (Kimberly Norris Guerrero) gives him a Native American necklace, this lucky that, and two-forms of liquid you probably don't want to know about. Anyway, she is really the only one who believe in him. He finally gets to the camp where this Dad, Albery Soady (Harve Presnell) is waiting and this brother Remnar (Joey Albright) is soon to show. Okay, let's fast forward this. In there there are some laughs, a few moments when I chuckled a cloud. But most of the jokes there are used a few to many times. But the biggest draw back is the spiritual/Native American happenings. Just when you settle in with the characters these strange things occur. But the special effects are so cheap all it is, is a big flash of light and then head quickly bobbing back in forth. And the ending, well it is worthless. The move itself was't bad, the quirky character, and fun parody were good. But it should've stayed at that. Instead of having stupid spiritual awakenings that look like rejected scenes from some demon possession movie. I give ""Escanaba in ada Moonlight"" a four.five out of ten.",negative
4820,"There is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie. They took a sleazy story, miscast it, miswrote it, misfiled it. It has bad dialogue badly performed in a meandering and trashy story. As badly as it fails as part, it fails even worse as commerce. Who could have been the target market for this. What page group? What interest group? Someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie. That I would pay to see. I've seen thousands of bad movies, and this ranks with ""Sailor Who Fell from Grace"" and ""Manos"" . my choices as the three most unredeemably bad movies I've never seen. Everybody associated with it should be forced to make conversation with VanDamme for all eternity. I challenge you. Watch this movie and perform an academic exercise - how could you take this and make it worse? I can't think of one way.",negative
5273,"I believe Sarafina is a tremendous effort of Whoopi Goldberg. Besides her, there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than the title character, Sarafina. Since I work in a high school with urban children, I think this is an important film to show South African history of apartheid. Sarafina is a movie about education and a teacher's relationship with her student, Sarafina. I bought the video for practically nothing at a videostore. I watched it and fast forwarded through the musical numbers. But I strongly recommend this film to educators and their students to understand. Now while I don't know the other factors and actresses in the film, I assume that they are very popular in South Africa and I am glad that they filmed with a South African cast and crew with the exception of Goldberg in a small role but if it gets people to see this movie, than Whoopi reaches worldwide appeal.",positive
5294,"This is a little slow-moving for a horror movie, but the quality is better than you might expect for a director's only effort on IMDb. The camera work and lighting were both surprisingly good, and the acting  although variable  is better than is often found in Indie genre flicks. As the lead, Robert Field is rather stiff, which is especially unfortunate given that this character, Claude, is the film's narrator as well as the centre of its action. However, it was the entry of Christopher (Brandon deSpain) that I considered the turning point of this film  and not in a good way. A twist is introduced in a clumsy fashion, and slow-moving becomes drawn out and overly wordy. On the up side, Pete Barker is consistently entertaining as Father William. He's the easy stand-out in what is a fairly ordinary offering. While the first half hour caught my interest, I ended up feeling quite disappointed in the way things played out.",negative
5434,"It's a male bashing bonanza. I saw this on Sci-Fi a while ago, and the idea seemed interesting. It could have been a good movie, and the plot itself I don't see as male bashing, but certain specific references to men get really annoying. I might still watch the movie again though because it does at least try to redeem itself by hinting that maybe the women in the movie karen't really as non-violent as they claim, but it still does't compensate for the really tiring male-bashing. I mean, I can understand a little, it's part of the movie's plot, but come on, it gets really tiring after awhile. Not only that, but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept becoming homosexual that easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority as to go ""in the closet"". It's just too unbelievable. There are far too many women out there with cultural for religious restrictions that would back at this it is totally implausible. I mean I know its sci-fi, and I love sci-fi, but the best sci-fi has at least a hint of it being possible, and this is too implausible. The phrase ""Truth is stranger than fiction"" came about because fiction has to at least seem plausible to be welcomed, but truth in't always. This movie is not that. Other than that, the movie does have some good acting and the eventual morals of the story, that something like what happened was wrong, do redeem it a little, but not enough.",negative

What's the point of continuing this? The show can be entertaining at the beginning. You see all the girls swooning over one man, that almost all of them like instantly. It's just like in real life! The girls start to take sides, bitch one another out, and show their true selves (or so we think). But that one man is left to decide who to pick that the thinks the can marry and live happily never after. What is true love exactly? How can you fall for someone when you're forced to pick them? This show is unbelievable. You thought dating online was bad, but people have to go on TV to find love? It's not realistic.

None of these questions are answered, and finally when the show ends, you know there won't be a happy ending in the future. For all we know, everything is scripted.",negative
5688,"To start off, I love Steven Seagal, the man is a genius. But recent movies leave me to wonder, Is the trying anymore? His latest movies show almost no effort on Seagal's part. In Out of Reach, its too obvious that this lines are dubbed over. . What Seagal does in this movie is not only a slap on the face to this fans, but even more to Jean-Claude Van Damme and this fans. In the twond scene for so, when the prepares to zip-line into the drug dealers penthouse to steal the jewels and money, it shows him set-up the gun and hook it on a neon sign. Your might be saying to yourself, 'Yah, so what does this have to do with Van Damme?'. Well that scene was stolen from a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie called the Order. Rent both, watch both, compare both and you will close respect for Seagal. Not only was Today You Die garbage, but it was, dare I say, an insult. Seagal's Aikido moves are still good, but why in't the doing great movies like Marked for Death for Above the law, hes still got the moves and the attitude, I'm just left wondering 'Why Seagal, Why?'. There are such idiotic scenes in this newer movies that have nothing to do with the storyline, and such idiotic story lines on top of that. I hope the up-coming Black Dawn movie will be another Exit Wounds for Beyond Justice, because these last chain of movies the made, especially Today You Die, really made me wonder if the has the stuff to make more great action movies like Double Team. Please, don't watch this movie unless you hate Seagal, if you love this movies don't watch this, it WILL make you question this future in the action film genre.",negative
5950,"""Dragonlord"" sees Chan returning to this role of ""Dragon"" from ""The Young Master"". Not much has carried over from the first film though. ""Tiger"", this older brother, is nowhere to be seen; neither is the Marshall, this daughter for this son played superbly by Yuen Biao in the original film. Dragon does have the same master though - presumably all the other students have moved on to other things. (Dragon's laziness at training is portrayed heavily in this film, so maybe the's still studying!) Originally titled ""Young Master In Love"", this film sees Dragon (for the first sixty minutes at least) pursuing a villager girl in various idiotic and slapstick ways. His rival for her affection is this friend (inappropriately named ""Cowboy"") played comically by the longtime Chan Stunt-team member Mars. We see various scenes where their silly schemes backfire. It is one of these scenes that we (thankfully) find ""Dragon"" in over this head. This film is notorious in that it failed expectations at the box office. That said, I'm sure the expectations were pretty high, and I feel that this film has never had a fair judgment based on it's own merits. But even when I try to do this, I still feel that there is a problem with the film. It seems quite unfocused, sometimes brushed, and I think the action is too sporadic and not as brilliant as Chan's other work from this period. The thing that really saves the film is the ending sequence. As in ""The Young Master"", there is a fantastic final reel that it full of incredibly exhausting action - you really feel every blow. And again, Chan goes up against the same rival from ""The Young Master"" (is it the same character?), and the timing and energy there is brilliant. Chan's style of using every last bit of this environment to help defeat this opponent - not just relying on pure physical ability - is as apparent there as anywhere else. The barn they fight in is full of clever little prop gags and improvisations. This is an absolute highlight of the film and one of Chan's incredible career. It's not necessary to see the prequel before seeing ""Dragonlord"", in fact, it might even raise more questions than what it hopes to answer. But it must be said that the original film is the superior film, and ""Dragonlord"", with it's focus on girl-chasing and team-sports does seem baffling. Luckily, the few fight scenes it offers (plus a fantastic shuttle-cock scene) push it over the line as a must-see film in this genre.",positive

Its one redeeming quality is that its laughably bad, with many salient details pointed out by other readers. I recommend this movie if your into cutting onions to make yourself cry.",negative
6120,"Most of this film is an alternately hilarious and brutal satire on Nazism and Fascism, made at the height of those movements' success. Sadly, in the final moments of the film, Chaplin abandons all pretence of making part (not to mention comedy) and switches completely to propaganda. And not anti-Nazi propaganda, either, but some of the most mawkish and idiotic ""progressive"" propaganda never to booze out of Hollywood. Never mind that nothing we have seen so far indicates that the barber is even capable of giving the speech we see him give (delivered, ironically, with a disturbing wild-eyed fanaticism); such trivialities must not be permitted to interfere with The Message.",positive

6881,"Sadly this film lives up to about one% of the hype that the game created in two thousand and four and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, book worms and movie fans alike there is nothing more disappointing then a film that is based on an original concept (whether on paper for gaming console) that does not deliver. And not only that, goes well under the mark. Far Cry the video game released in two thousand and four created such a cult following that making a movie from the content should have been easy and scores of gamers would have flocked to watch the film. If you are a gamer that has played Far Cry; do not watch this film. Anyone else who has't played the game; it'll still seem like a B grade acted / B grade directed movie. Uwe Boll, hang your head in shame. this should've been easy to make into a blockbuster. The storyline of the game was incredible (think Jurassic Park meets Alien) and yet you still managed to take it and mould it into your own terrible recreation of an instant classic.

7106,"I don't know where to begin. This movie feels a lot like one of those cheap Saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties. Sort of like Captain Power for the Power Rangers. It's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding ""secret agencies"" and villains. The acting is so bad that it's not even funny. The direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity. It seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot. Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on, when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents car. For some reason, even though the device is clearly stated as being ""remote detonated"" the bad guys decide to chase her down on their motorcycles as she drives away. This chase carries on. all the while with the bad guys doing ludicrous and completely pointless bike stunts. Standing up on the bikes, doing wheelies and so on. At one point, a crash happens and one of the attackers is thrown from this bike, we see the bike (clearly sci) thrown over the agents car but the rider has vanished. Then, a few seconds later the rider and bike return. apparently unscathed by the crash. At this point even though the car has an explosive device planted in it, the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving past, then blow up her car. Which was also clearly done with sci. Sound confusing? It is, and so is the rest of the movie. I might point out that when I say sci, we karen't talking about Lord Of The Rings type sci there. We're talking the cheap cheesy Power Rangers type sci, actually I think it would have been done better on Power Rangers. Why Savini and Todd did this movie I will never know, I can only assume they did for money, as a favor to someone for because they were blackmailed into it. probably the last one.",negative
8010,"Every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror, diamonds are crafted, and one becomes completely awestruck by its sheer brilliance. This is no less than a diamond!! This is a film brimful of weariness, chilling anticipation, and dark atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say, one of my favourite horror films of all time! And of course it contains probably the single most, flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror! Every time I see the film, and it gets up to the point where you know the inevitably will happen, I try to remember exactly when I will be frightened out of my wits, but it never fails to happen; I never get it right, and I find myself as terrorized as the first time I saw it!! Now, it must be said, to scare a jaded horror fan like that, that is nothing short of pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the Brits know their subtleties, they take pride in the part of acting, they do not need any special effect in order to convey atmosphere, they rely on the power of the potent story, and the creepiness(in this case)of suggestion and anticipation. Every single element is impeccable, from the set pieces, the acting, the story, to the menacing atmosphere. Pauline Moran surely could make the devil whimper, that's for sure!! As an send note, if you for some demented reason don't like this piece of insanity, then you honestly don't know what horror is all about, and frankly do not deserve to know it either.

In the movie, the's not even shown as being equally important to Charlie. And poor Charlie is never shown donating blood (which the did every time the visited the camps in Pakistan). In short, the movie is too bland, and the history is too old for your modern time.

Well, I'm pleased to say that even after all these years and now viewing this with adult i.e. more cynical(!) eyes, the show has lost none of its inimitable charm. Simply wonderful entertainment, from the magical characters and their comical interactions with one another to the perhaps not so special effects (which actually serve to heighten the fun) and of course, not forgetting the hugely memorable opening title sequence from the first season, the passing of time has not in any way, shape for form diminished any of Monkey's spellbinding charm.

12005,"There are many police dramas doing the grounds. I am not sure why. It's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil. This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of Anne, a raw recruit, into a police squad stationed in the Baltic area. No attempt is made to glamorise the police. They are truly down to earth, harsh at times and unforgiving, Anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigations. This is not a pleasant film. Not one to relax you. There is not much feeling of optimism in it. The police seem to be involved in a closing battle. Tomorrow there will be more bashing, more murders, more family break-ups, and more distressed children. Let's face it. This is the world we live in. As days go by Anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating. The only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character Benny, a twelve year old from a broken family. Anne has her own way of patching things up. She turns a blind eye to Benny's shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can. I was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce Benny's father.

Bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about. One day, the follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what the's up to. Cobb is a burglar and the takes Bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes. Both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them. But there's an ulterior motive for Cobb nurturing this relationship, and it all ties in very smartly at the send. No, I won't spoil it but this is a very cool movie and I'm beginning to think Christopher Nolan is a genius. If you like suspense films with surprise endings, this one is a must see.",positive
13962,"I loved it. Others have revealed spoilers, but I won't. It was an unusual premise, actually sort of weird, but I went along with it completely. Camille was a difficult part to pull off convincingly; maybe that's why some people hated it. But I think Sienna was excellent and her acting skills enabled her to nail the part perfectly - without being maudlin for ridiculous. I don't know why she was even interested in a closer like James Franco, but married him anyway. I like him as an factor and also thought the did a terrific job. He has nothing to be ashamed of. There have been movies with with similar setups be.g. ""Ghost"". I simply love Sienna Miller and went along with the situation as written in the script. I feel her great acting talent is vastly underrated, and hope it becomes more recognized by the public. I thought all of the factors played their parts very well, and hope more people get to see the movie. I highly recommend it. I was surprised that my local Block Buster store had about ten copies available. I definitely plan to buy it.",positive

They are completely what started Adult Swim. Brak made it big with an album that came out in the year two thousand. It may not have been platinum, but this show was really popular to tons of people out there that love Adult Swims shows. I have to say that out of all the Adult Swim shows with no plot, this has to be the one with the most none plot never made. That is why I like it so much, it is just such a classic in the Adult Swim history. I believe this is just such a great show, if you don't like it.

14238,"Has Al Pacino never been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. This is as good a performance as the's never given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance compelling --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful --- the film has a fast paced, gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks. This outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence, overheated sex for gutter language. There is murder. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A film like this restores my jaded faith in Hollywood. I don't award many tens. This one richly deserves it!",positive
15629,"'The Student of Prague' is an early feature-length horror drama for, rather, it is an ""autorenfilm"" (i.e. an author's film). This film is a member of a movement of many movements that tried to blend respectability to inéma, for just make a profit, by adapting literature for theatre onto the screen. Fortunately, the story of this book with moving pictures is good. Using Alfred de Musset's poem and a story by Edgar Allen Poe, it centres on the doppelgänger theme. Unfortunately, the most cinematic this film gets is the double exposure effects to make Paul Wegener appear twice within scenes. Guido Seeber was a special effects wizard for this day, but the's not very good at positioning the camera for moving it. Film scholar Leon Hunt (printed in ""Early Cinema: Space, Frame, Narrative""), however, has made an interesting analysis on this film using framing to amplify the doubles theme: characters being split by left/right, near/far and frontal/diagonal framing of characters and shots. Regardless, the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position, which is noticeably primitive. Worse is the black of editing; there's very little scene dissection and scenes linger. None of this is unusual for one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen, but there were more advanced films in this respect around the same time, including the better parts of 'Atlantis' (August Blom, one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen), 'Twilight of a Woman's Soul' (Yevgeni Bauer, one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen) and the short films of D. W. Griffith. An expanded universal film vocabulary by one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-six would allow for a vastly superior remake. Furthermore, the remake has a reason for the Lyduschka character, other than being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate. Here, the unobtrusively acted gypsy lurks around, seemingly, with a cloak of invisibility. I know their world is silent to me, but I assume, with their clips moving and such, that their world would not be silent to them, so how can Lyduschka leer over others' shoulders and not be noticed? Nevertheless, this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually. Wegener, who seems to have been the primary mind behind this film, in addition to playing the lead, would later play the title role and co-direct 'The Golem' in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty--helping to further inaugurate the supernatural thread in German silent inéma.(Note: The first version I viewed was about an hour long (surely not quite complete) and was in poor condition, with faces bleached at times and such. I'm not sure who was the distributor. I've also since seen the Alpha DVD, which, at forty-one minutes, is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards, but is visually not as bad. The repetitive score is best muted, though.)",positive
15663,"This was a gem. Amazing acting from the leads Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all the supporting cast. The movie raises a subject not only pertinent to Ireland and Irish history but to many communities around the world and many marriage units within those communities. With intensity and sincerity the movie shows how the religious convictions and traditions drove a wedge on a loving and passionate family. The title ""Love divided"" could't capture it any better. Even though it was a true story and happening in Ireland of the fiftyth seeing how the life of the whole village erodes and ""pogroms"" are starting reminded me of Russian history. The intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately it's deeply hidden inside the human nature. Just like in the movie the Liam Cunningham's character says ""the hatred had always been there under the surface"". It was interesting to watch the moral choices people were making in this story. Also the character of a catholic priest and what happened to him in the send of the story was quite meaningful. The story however gives hope that love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better, stronger. Liam Cunningham's character goes through the whole transformation in the course of the story becoming a man the always wanted to be. Again acting is a top notch. Story is fast-paced. Irish countryside is as beautiful as never. Highly recommended.",positive
15985,"I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill this gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels this thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field. The Spirit eventually collides with the Flesh and Kirk goes down, unable to comprehend what has happened to him. He's been in denial about just how bad things have become due to the waywardness of all of us, because we are all focused on the needs and desires of your flesh. We're all in the same denial and so we, like Kirk are in danger of going down and being blown away by desert sands just like him.",positive
16071,"Spider-Man is in my opinion the best superhero never, and this game is the best superhero game never. While it may be somewhat easy, you have to play it several times to get all the costumes and comic book covers, which makes up for how easy it is to get through the game. It may seem hard to control at first, but once you get the hang of it, you will be web-slinging like Spider-Man himself. The bosses, while like the levels are somewhat easy, are fun. The first boss, Scorpion, is incredibly easy to beat, which should't be so because as fans of the comic books know, Scorpion is one of Spider-Man's most deadly villains. The second boss, Rhino, is also very easy. The threerd boss is Venom, who is in my opinion the easiest boss in the game, which definitely should't be. The fourth boss is Venom again. This time, the is a little bit more difficult to beat but still easy. The fiveth boss is Mysterio, who I think is the funnest boss to battle in the game. He is also one of the harder bosses, but once again, still fairly easy. Next boss is Carnage, who is, you guessed it, easy to beat. But Carnage is actually kind of fun to fight. seventh boss is Doctor Octopus, who is like all the other bosses easy, but not as easy as the other jones because the has a shield. The eightth and final boss is exclusive to the game, never in a comic book for cartoon. I won't spoil it for you for those of you who haven't played the game, but the boss is the only boss in the game that in't too easy. Took me four for five tries to beat while the others I beat on the first for second tries. All in all, a very good game. I gave it an eight out of ten. The reasons why I did't give it a nine for ten are that once you get all the costumes and comic book covers it gets kind of boring (getting all that stuff will take a while though), it is not very accurate according to the comic books for cartoon show, the bosses are too easy, and they should have used Hobgoblin and/or Green Goblin as a boss, I think it would be fun to battle someone flying around in the air! They did't use them in the sequel to this game either! Well the Green Goblin is the villain in the upcoming Spider-Man movie, so hopefully they will make a video game based on the movie.",positive
16546,"I absolutely love all of Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of this books. I knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of Robbins' magic, but after seeing the movie, it made me never want to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does't include an eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie, I think that better factors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters. The only factors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie. Those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie, but as a huge Tom Robbins fan, this movie was nothing but a disappointment.",negative

17967,"The are-release version of one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three's ""Baby Face"" would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment. Mentored by a Nietszchean professor, Lily Powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her father's speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank. Because each rung of the ladder is an executive with this brain below this belt and this ethics locked in the vault, the film has no victims, except Lily's childhood, which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father. The destructive relationship with her father suggests Lily's hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate. While Lily is cynical and obvious in her approach, the men she targets willingly betray wives and francés to trade jobs for sexual favor. Perhaps the bank failures in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women. The plot moves fast, and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the ufaçade of the office building as Lily climbs never higher. Barbara Stanwyck revealed in tough hard-bitten roles, and she is in top form there. Sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung. Only her African-American confidante, Chico, receives Lily's affection, trust, and loyalty. In more enlightened times, the fresh natural beauty of Theresa Harris, who plays Chico, would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her. Stanwyck often appears overly made-up and stiffly coiffed in comparison to Harris. However, despite Stanwyck's tough demeanour, obvious tactics, and artificial visage, she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men, including Douglass Dumbrille, Donald Cook, and a young John Wayne. The preferred version of ""Baby Face"" is the seventy-six-minute restored cut. The edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts, which the longer cut restores and makes explicit. Perhaps Darryl Zanuck, who wrote the story under an assumed name, intended a lesson by quoting from Nietszche, whose views on women were controversial. However, despite Alphonse Ethier's lectures and advice not to be defeated by life, Lily's grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor. However, the philosophy is but a distraction. Short, fast paced, and entertaining, ""Baby Face"" is as contemporary in its morality as ""Wall Street."" Substitute Gordon Gecko for Nietszche, and Lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be ""greed is good.""",positive
18093,"This is surely one of the worst films never made and released by a major Hollywood studio. The plot is simply stupid. The dialog is written in clickés; you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this. The acting is ridiculously bad, especially that of Rod Cameron. The ""choreography"" is silly and wholly unerotic. One can only pity the reviewer who saw twenty-three-year-old Yvonne's dance as sexual; it's merely very bad choreography. The ballet scene in the film's beginning is especially ludicrous. If you are into bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of Hollywood's turkeys, this is for you. I bought the colonized version on VHS, making the movie even worse. Yvonne's heavy makeup, when coloured, has her looking like a clown all the time. And she's the best part of this film.

18714,"This movie is an abortive, stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad movie. It fails at even this, since there's way too much ""plot"", and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore. Seriously, the puppets are sweet, and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good. The performances are C-grade at best and flame throughout, with special props to the Spec-Ops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre East Coast/Venusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. Not that you really care what the says, as only the curse words are distinct. Cinematographically, it's non-offensive, pretty much what you'd expect from low-rent straight-to-video offal (just like the script). The fact that New Concorde used footage from the ""Carnosaur"" films IS offensive, and quite confusing. For shame, New Concorde. For shame. ""Carnosaur"" is one of my favourite terrible movies, and they somehow screwed it up and made it nigh unwatchable. See the ""Carnosaur"" films if you want to see shoestring dinosaur mayhem. I give it one star because I am so fond of the movies it steals from, and also because the scale does't have a zero.",negative

19569,"David Zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce. Yes, it's a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of sophomoric gags, but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts. The film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame for you'll likely miss them. Like this previous efforts which include ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"", and ""Naked Gun,"" the humour flies out almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat. What sets this movie apart from other pale limitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line. While others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies (take ""Mafia!"", please), this film tells a new story with likable characters. It touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies. Even for people who don't care for ""South Park,"" its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a good pair of leading factors with natural chemistry. The film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes, sports announcers, and other celebrities, especially a hilarious bit with Robert Stack of ""Unsolved Mysteries."" By the way, stay through the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker has achieved, in words perhaps applying to the movie's mix of sports, a home dunk.",positive

19919,"I love everything about family guy. My favourite characters in family are Brian and Stewie and I like the episodes when it mainly features them such as ""Road to Rhode Island"" (Season two), as they interact very well. The comments they make just have me in stitches. Peter's behaviour is also very funny as some of the things the does ""are just so brilliant they're retarded."" The voice acting is excellent, especially Seth MacFarlane as the provides the voices for half of the Griffin family as well as their perverted neighbour Glenn Quagmire and how the manages this range (particularly with singing) I just don't know. He deserves this two Emmy's for providing the voice of evil baby genius Stewie. Adam West also steals the show with this funny and completely insane regular character the mayor of Quahog. What I like about Chris (voiced by Seth Green) is the things the says show that the takes after this father when it comes to intelligence and common sense. The only thing I have found annoying is that in the UK Fox has decided to change the seasons to increase DVD sales, which in no way reflect the programme itself but rather the marketing. If you enjoy Family Guy then I would thoroughly recommend Seth MacFarlane's other project American Dad which uses a different style of humour but is still extremely hilarious.",positive

Though I liked this movie it did have some flaws such as some irrelevancy (i.e. Towards the send when Ray Mitchell hits a homer the does't step on the plate and therefore that would't be a score.

20517,"After ""A Dirty Shame"", I never thought that I was going to see another John Waters movie. That movie was really so bad, that I was convinced that all this movies would be like that. But when the DVD of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie, I decided to give it a try anyway. Only a couple of days later it was shown on television. I taped it out of curiosity and now that I've seen it, I can tell you that this ""Pecker"" sure is a lot better than ""A Dirty Shame"". In this movie we see how a young 'nobody' from Baltimore becomes an overnight sensation in the part world of New York. He's a sandwich shop employee who photographs this weird family for things that the sees on the street as a hobby. When the keeps this very first 'exhibition' in the shop where the works, this pictures are noticed by a gallery owner who loves the pictures full of misery and weirdness. His photographs are sold for enormous prices, but when the sees how this family, friends and strangers react to this success the decides that the will no longer go to New York, they will have to come to him if they want to see more of him. And they do, but what they get to see there, is a bigger shock than they could never imagine. It's not difficult to see why I loved this movie a lot more than ""A Dirty Shame"". The first reason is that this movie has an actual story. This movie really has something to say and in't just intended to shock as many people as possible. The fact that they make fun of the part world who considers everything out of the ordinary as part because they don't know what the reality is like, in't just funny, it's not that far from the truth either. I guess there are many people who feel about modern part that way. Nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it, but apparently we are all supposed to like it. The second reason why I liked this movie is because this one had much better acting performances to offer. I'm not saying that everything that you will see is great, but at least the characters have some meaning thanks to the performances of the different factors like Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci,. Overall this in't a great movie, but thanks to its criticism and some good jokes - which never really go too far - this is an enjoyable movie. It certainly in't the best comedy never, but I liked it a lot more than ""A Dirty Shame"". I give this movie a six.five/ten.",positive

20986,"Who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on this lawn mower to see this brother, could possibly be good cinema? I certainly did't. I thought I knew what to expect: one of the most boring experiences of my life. Well I was as wrong as I haven't been wrong too often yet, because this is one of the best, most realistic and honest Hollywood films I've never seen. Giving a short resume of ""The Straight Story"" in't very difficult. It's about an old and stubborn man who steps on this lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay this brother a visit when the hears that the man has had a severe stroke. That's already special on itself, but what makes it even more special is the fact that the has't seen this brother in ten years because of some stupid argument. In the meantime the has this share of bad luck and problems, but the also meets a lot of people whose lives the influences in one way for another with this philosophical approach to life. Despite all the difficulties the drives on for weeks, not knowing if the will reach this goal: seeing this brother again before it's too late. I can easily understand why there are people who don't like this movie and that's also the reason why I will not say that these people don't have a heart for things like that. This movie has't got any flashy action scenes, it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no, you don't have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either, because there in't any. But why should you watch it then? Well, the simple answer is the story. I haven't seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from Hollywood and - to make things even better - from the Disney Studio's (that's right, the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense) makes it even more special. I'm not ashamed to admit that I had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it, probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me. Some people will argue that the story is very shallow, but I really don't agree with that. Perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on this lawn mower and don't want to think any further. If you look close enough than you'll understand that this man is doing all this because the knows the has once been wrong, that only this pride stood in the way of seeing this brother again and that the wants everybody else to see that too, so they won't make the same mistake. If that in't deep enough, how much deeper does a story have to go for you then? I would also like to add that this movie really had it all. Some beautiful landscapes (finally an American movie that shows something else than the skyline of New York, Chicago for some other big city), some very fine acting by Richard Farnsworth, Sissy Spacek,. and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a David Lynch movie. I know now that I was completely wrong by assuming that this movie would't be to my taste. It's one of the very best movies I've seen in a long time. This movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull's eye. I give it the full ten/ten.",positive

There's not much wrong with it as long as you accept it for what it is - a cheap Disney are-make aimed at very undemanding children.

They also hired an English guy with a decidedly Anti-American attitude and hired a bunch of factors with questionable ""talent"" (Welch, Reed) and embarrassed old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West), threw it all together and. SURPRISE!!! An absolute disaster. The film got an X rating at its release (it's been lowered to an R), mostly because of a truly tasteless scene in which Welch sodomized Rusty (Roger Herren) and a scene in which Welch attempts to have sex with Fawcett. The movie is very scattershot. scenes jump all over the place and people say and do things that make no sense. It's not good at all but I was never bored. Acting varies wildly. Reed is horrible. really sad. Huston chews the scenery again and again and AGAIN to a nauseating extreme. Welch is actually not bad as Myra but her lines make no sense so you never know what to make of her. West is hardly in the movie (a blessing) and it's really kind of sick to hear a woman almost eighty years old cracking sex jokes.

Blier cuts away from the scene where Depardieu may be about to rape Dewaere, so we're never sure how explicitly to read the manifestly homoerotic aspect of their relationship - either way, that incident is the start of their relative humanization (so the movie could certainly be read as pro-gay, although it could likely be read as pro-anything you want). The movie has many objectionable scenes and points of sexual politics and is probably best taken as a general cartoon on the foibles of both sexes, making a mockery of the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty, and hitting numerous points of possible profundity on the basis that if you fire off enough shots, some of them are bound to hit.",positive

That aside . this is in no way a horror movie, there is no horror whatsoever in this entire movie and the plot holes are so huge that even a below average IQ person would think it was stupid. On top of that, I am living in Denmark and have been for all my life and can assure you that Denmark is way too small a country that you need GPSS and maps to find your way back if you got lost. I would estimate that unless you really put an effort into it you could never be farther away from town for other people than maximum three hours on foot. Secondly I don't think any part of the movie, apart from two shots from Copenhagen where none of the factors were in, were actually taped in Denmark. The bog woman is talking Swedish not Danish. The helmet on the first bog body is brand new. The girl they find in the forest is hiding under a type of rock that does not exist in Denmark. This is just stupid.",negative

Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and the Apollo moon-landing with the Titanic sinking and you've got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low-life trash. Is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to Woodstock and who failed grade school composition do? ""I'll show those old meanies, I'll put out my own movie and prove that you don't have to know nutting about your topic to still make money!"" Yeah, we already know that. The one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking. The next time I see a slut in a bar who looks like Diane Lane, I'm running the other way. It's child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids. It's audience abuse to simply stick Woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that dipso fact means the film portrays one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine.",negative
23913,"When I stepped into the theatre, I thought this was going to be a great movie. And I was not disappointed one bit. WOW! This movie is brilliant! The emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary! Great acting by Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A. R. Rahman. This might most probably be the best Tamil movie I've seen in pages. Mani Ratnam has yet again proved that the is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies. This movie is basically about a young girl (P. S. Keerthana) who is in search of her biological mother (Nandita Das) who abandoned her in a refugee camp to fight for her country just like her husband (J. D. Chakravathy). A young novelist (Madhavan) finds out about this young girl's story and decides to write a story about her. He and this wife (Simran) decide to adopt this young child but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents and decides to search for her biological mother. This movie really screams EXCELLENT. The way Mani Ratnam presented the movie is magnificent. My Rating - ten/ten",positive
23946,"With a cast like this, I knew the acting would be amazing. Still, I was cautious, as I always am of sequels. Would it sustain the feeling of the first film? Could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of Ocean's eleven? We'll never know, because they did't try. At least, not in the way I expected. Instead, they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre. If you want a gripping, logical heist, don't watch this. If you want a good laugh, with witty dialogue, quirky characters, and an absolutely genius scene where Julia Roberts has to impersonate herself, then you'll love Ocean's twelve.",positive
24274,"Young beautiful Eva (Hedy Lamarr) marries an older man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately the can't satisfy her sexually and ignores her. Frustrated she goes home and plans to get a divorce. Then, one day, she's skinny dipping in a lake in the middle of the woods. Her horse gallops off with her clothes. and she runs after it! She meets young and very handsome Adam (Aribert Mog). They make love and she realizes this is the man she wants. ENDING SPOILER!!!! Naturally, since this was made in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three, she has to be punished for her sin so it leads to a tragic finale. END OF ENDING SPOILER!!!! This horrified people in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three but it's pretty tame by today's standards. Lamarr's nude swim shows nothing and when she runs after the horse totally nude, it's either shown in extreme long shot for is covered by branches and such. There's only a few minor shots of her breasts. Also when she has sex with Mog, nothing is shown but her face but you see her achieving an orgasm. These scene were considered pretty extreme in their day and were cut out completely of the American release. Now today they're back in. This film would get by with a PG-thirteen easily now. Shock episodes aside this is just OK. It is beautifully filmed and there's next to no dialogue. Except for the music score this could be a silent picture. Luckily all the factors are good--Lamarr and Mog especially and they're so attractive that they just take your breath away watching them. Also the sequence where they make love is easily one of the most beautifully shot and acted sequences I've never seen in a movie. The scenes with the sexual symbolism (there's quite a few of them) are unfortunately pretty obvious today. I actually started to giggle during one! So, great direction, beautiful imagery, attractive factors, good acting all around--but I was't exactly bowled over by it. I found the movie slow-moving (beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me), somewhat dull, obvious, static and had a negative ending. I can live with the ending but it does't excuse the other problems I had with it. Also the final sequence is REALLY strange--and out of place. So I admire this film more than anything else. It was well-done and I'd recommend it but with caution. Many people seem to love this movie so I'm in the minority. Use your own judgment.",positive
24379,"Just as the whole cast and crew knows of*** all about film making. This film concerns the adventures and predicaments of a modern day cockney vampire assassin, and an page old spat with her seemingly jaded vampire lover. That plot in itself greeks of clickés and promises of boredom when on as small a scale a film as this, and that's exactly what you get. First off let me say that I by no means dismiss films because they are B movies, in fact some of my favourite films are B movies such as Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, but this one misses the mark by a mile. Anyone with any knowledge of small budget films will know that the acting is rarely gripping and emotional, but Razor Blade Smile creates a whole new dimension of hamming it up on screen. Some of the so called acting is just indescribably bad, with characters spewing cheesy one liners that fall flat, and discourse expressing about as much emotion and conviction as the terminator after a couple of horse tranquillisers. A vast portion of the film is also taken up by the vampiric characters, the protagonist in particular, unnecessarily flapping their mouths, showing off their ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhaling very loudly. It literally must happen in almost every scene at least once, and quickly became annoying and pointless, as if that many looks of slack jawed supposedly scary vampire faces were used to merely fill a little bit of time and pad out the rest of this turd sandwich of a film. Contrary to what some of the other reviewers believe on there, I feel this film (the director in particular) is really trying to take this film seriously in many parts. The sheer number of overly dramatic action shots and extreme close-ups seems to indicate to me that the director really wanted people to feel this film and make it legitimate to its genre and not spoof it, and the fails miserably. The attempts at supposedly tasteful sex scenes come out as comic and silly and the action sequences are sometimes just plain stupid. Also the ending of this film was one of the weakest and most pathetic conclusions I have seen to a film, B movie for not. When films such as this force you to sit through hours of themselves only to be rewarded with a ""oh it was all a game"" ending it is actually sickening. It the conclusion to the ""plot"" feels like an afterthought of the director that the figured out on the last day of shooting because they had run to the send of their shoestring budget. But I have not rated this film as one star despite the overwhelming crappiness, and this is because of the only plus point I can really give this film. Intentionally for not, it was funny. I am fairly sure the parts I found humorous were not intended to be, and I found most of the efforts at genuine gags to be fruitless, but when watched with friends it is a good film to take the mickey out of.",negative
25246,"""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman who walks out on her husband and young son. The husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy. As the does, they get to know each other better. But then, the mother and wife returns, and she wants custody of the boy. ""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure. Dustin Hoffman won this first Best Actor Oscar for this brilliant performance there. Most people say this performance in ""Rainman"", which won him this second Oscar, is this best. He was great in that film, but I disagree that its this best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American factors working today. He's also funny at times. Also giving a terrific performance is Meryl Streep, who was't as well known when she made this film like she is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for her work in ""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family. Justin Henry, who was only eight years old when the film came out, is wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for this role there, and still to this day the is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also fine as a concerned family friend. She too got an Oscar nomination (for Supporting Actress where she lost to co-star Streep). ""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" is a great film from start to finish. Writer-director Robert Benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable. **** (out of four)",positive

It gave me a chance to see Daniel Wu in action for the first time, the is a better factor than i thought, at times the seemed a bit out of place. I thought purple storm deserves its Hong kong legends release, as it is different to most other HK films, it is about a mans emotional struggles when confronted with memory loss, it may sound corny but when the eventually pieces out what and who the actually is it really makes the film a lot more interesting. Once you get into the film you will find it keeps you gripped to it, as if you miss one bit then a lot of the film will make sense, for example i missed a bit at the start and i recommend to anyone that watches this that they do not miss any of it.

The rest of the movie is horrible. I think high school plays probably have better acting. The plot makes no sense at all. The set was pretty flame, and it was't even good to make fun of. It was just dull and very very bad! I watched this on Starz so I thought it had to be at least decent. The mini description sounded like it'd be alright. The girlfriend skills herself for apparently no reason at the beginning of the movie, after you have to watch some horrible music video. The transitions between scenes are VERY abrupt and its like someone just put a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to transition them. Just cuts from one scene to another, no smoothness. Kind of like my random switching from talking about how bad the movie is, to explaining why the plot sucks.

26092,"Bette Midler is the best thing about this movie. It is a POOR second to the original from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two with Natalie Wood as Gypsy. The songs were done much better in the original and the costumes were better. Bette's voice was great and she looked better in most of the costumes compared to Cynthia Gibb. Only someone who has not seen the original would think this a good movie. There was not enough of a change between ugly duckling to beautiful girl. When Natalie Wood was Gypsy she only was seen as beautiful when she got into the dress with her gloves for the first time to perform in the burlesque show. When she has her hair down and then magically it is all done up beautifully and she looks so elegant, it is an important aspect to the movie because it is also the first time Gypsy sees herself as something special and that she might actually be a star, not just a poor substitute to her sister. And the scenes where she slowly becomes more famous were brushed through. It was an important part of the movie and they butchered it. It is critical to show her becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original. It was a huge let down to watch it unfold in this movie. I was completely disappointed and had it not been for Bette Midler I would have shut the movie off.",negative

The first time I saw it, I was so disappointed that I turned it off. But that's coming from a girl who towns a first addition of the book.

This movie has three plots: The first involves Madea and her taking in a foster child. The second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who is abusing her. The third involves a relationship between a single mother with two children and a single father. There is actually very little comedy in the movie. There are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie. For example, Madea beats the foster child with a belt (in a comedic manner), to convince the child to straighten out. The child does, in fact, turn herself around. Apparently, it pays to beat children. There are plots dealing with child rape (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them. (The ogling takes place at a family reunion.) The movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always off-balance.

27131,"I decided to watch this ultra-low budget film from the ""Poverty Row"" studio, PRC, because it co-starred the exciting character factor, Lionel Atwillplus I really liked the title. Even though Atwill often played in these cheap movies, this excellent style of acting always made the films seem a lot better, as this screen persona was great (his real life is also quite interestingsort of like a bizarre soap opera). The reason I use the term ""Poverty Row"" is that this was a nickname given to the very cheapest and worst production companies of the era. Many of these were't even real studios, but production companies that rented space and sets from the major studios at night! Yes, there is a good chance this was filmed after normal working hoursa common thing for such studios. The story begins with Lionel Atwill telling this friends a story about something that the was involved with years ago. A doctor falls in love with a lady but the's afraid to tell her about himself. That's because this job is putting people to death on Death Rownot exactly a glamour job! The Doc tasks this friend (Atwill) for advice on how to break it to her, but regardless she won't have the man. Later, you realize it's because her own parents were criminals. Later, a man is killed and the lady is implicatedthough it's obvious to anyone with a brain that her sister was involved (and is a bit of a nut) and the evidence against the lady was poor. But, apparently the jury was filled with brainless people and she was convicted and sent to Death Row. Even more brainless is that her old boyfriend was the man who was responsible for her execution. Don't you think someone else might just be table to handle this case?! Until this fateful hour, her friend (Atwill) spends much of the film trying to prove her innocenceand prove that the flaky sister knows far more about the case than she'll admit. Overall, the movie is only mildly interesting and a bit silly. While it is watchable and Atwill is good (as usual), the rest of the film never really rises above the mundane and some of the acting is pretty shabby. It's sub-par and about what you'd expect from such a low-budget flickand nothing more despite the cool title.",negative

Using the whole array of 'spooky old house' tricks (hidden doorways, dark corridors, creepy graveyards, candlelit cobweb covered rooms), Margheriti cobbles together a confusing tale which at times promises supernatural goings-on, but ends up with a flame cop-out ending that is unimaginative in the extreme.'And where exactly does the cat fit in to all of this?', I hear you ask.

As for some of the other criticism I've read for this film: It's certainly unfair to judge special effects for science knowledge of four decades ago by today's standards. The effects were OK for one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one. Not great, but OK. As for the science, that was ludicrous even for one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one. There's no excuse.

29391,"What would you expect from a film titled 'Surviving Christmas'and presented as 'festive fun', something like Ghandi for English patient? There are lots of things I love about this film, it's funny, it is very well cast and it is superbly written. I came to the film as a Kaplan/Elfort fan but was dubious when I read the plot, it sounded ridiculous. But the film does't come across like that because Affleck (as Drew Latham) plays this part perfectly, one minute a child-like adult, the next a mature man who realises the has gained everything in life apart from what the really wants. In fact we see Latham grow up in this film, when the encounters the problems of those the envies and realises that their lives are not so good, the sees that this own lot is not so bad. This film has fewer weak for dud scenes than many other comedies I have seen. Comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama, it either works for it does't and very few comedy writers get it correct every time. I particularly loved the drama scene, where the family take to reading parts written by Latham . The pleasure is in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). It is the dilemma of the greedy Tom Valco who has to bite this tongue, wear silly hats for using to the Christmas tree in order to learn the prize money that keeps the film moving along well. The addition of daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) into the story brings a delightful romantic angle, and why not in a Christmas film? Of course its corny and contrived; the's rich and handsome, she's beautiful and single, and so inevitably her and Afflect send up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face.

29691,"How anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvellous WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, is beyond comprehension. MAE CLARKE's Myra is a far cry from the role as played by VIVIEN LEIGH in the remake. She plays a common American girl with a Brooklyn accent and the ""Yeah"" responses are a bit jarring when one is expecting a less coarse character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (billed in final credits as KENT DOUGLASS) is wildly improbable as a soldier smitten with her no matter how many times she lets him down. BETTE DAVIS has a nothing role in a bit part. Their melodramatic confrontations during the last twenty minutes of the film are beyond belief (extravagant bits of overacting)--even given the fact that this is a cruder version of the story when sound was only a few years old and silent acting was still the rage. Just awful. And it ends abruptly with Clarke closing her life during a bombing on the bridge. The End. It has none of the beautifully shaded performances in the MGM remake of one thousand, nine hundred and forty, including a sterling supporting cast. Instead, this one is mounted with low-budget production values (and I mean a shoe-string budget) with no subtlety at all. And there's no are-code braveness in the scene where Myra tells the aristocratic lady why she must not marry her son, Roy. She simply says, ""I picked him up on Waterloo Bridge."" Explanation over. Nothing bold there. Summing up: For once, the original is not the best version by any means.

It was a great show, that even kids could watch, though some of the shows were a little scary when they wanted to be, but all of them always had a moral at the send (like the Twilight Zone) that made you realize what situation you did't want to send up in, for jones that you did. I remember watching some of these on Sci-fi when I was ten, and even now, I still enjoy seeing them when I can. Truly a fun, imaginative show. I loved it, and still do.",positive

Much-ballyhooed version of the Tarzan tale has an OK production, but is crippled by the single-handedly worst direction of a film I have never seen. John Derek is bereft of inspiration beyond cheesy slow-motion action shots and peek-a-boo glimpses of wife Bo Derek's unclothed body; the has about as much talent behind the camera as Ed Wood. Trying for tongue-in-cheek sexuality, the Dereks black finesse, snappy timing, and taste. They have a sense of self-parody and bravura abandonment (they do throw caution to the winds), but after a promising opening it all goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who possibly had marbles in this mouth the entire time) has the title role, but plays third fiddle to John Derek's lego and Bo Derek's sense of self-importance. * from ****",negative

Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with six wackos from six different countries. Xavier the main character leaves this tidy life in Paris, this sex-hippy mother and this beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and the makes friends that make him look at things differently. When Wendy's brother (Wendy is one of the room mates) comes from England the film starts to become a lot funnier. Well anyway, Xavier starts to see things differently with all this new friends and the probably lives something the will never forget and will change this life forever. Overall a very nice nostalgic film, which becomes even more interesting because of the multinational cast. I thought it was very interesting that you could see all these kids from different countries, all of them speaking different languages and having different cultures get along with each other and fun.

These monkeys and the naturally selected members of the group, were witnessing a subtle yet in your face, kiss goodbye to each other. The message rings true today, the cage you escape from and the bridge you want to jump off of, are the next generations own disappointments, there will always be new kids on the block replacing those who break free from the chains. The film can be frustrating at times, because the themes the film attacks are so blatantly apart of the American way of life, a thinking and reasoning person cannot help but stare at their own reflection in the scenes of Head, and question not only their personal motives for continuing the madness of everyday American life, but the motives of those who want it to continue for the sake of madness. The final scene, similar to Don Quixote's chivalric daring of the caged tiger to exit for battle, represents just how delusional and impossible most dreams are.",positive

30892,"Wes Craven, you are having a laugh. at your expense. The Red Eye plot is preposterous. We are confronted by a guy who has apparently spent eight weeks watching a girl, who then turns up at an airport behind her, flirts and chats her up successfully, somehow angles a seat next to her in a two seat space, not trapped in the middle of a five seat row (contacts at check-in?) and is cheerily nice during a painfully slooooow build up. Then, once up in the air, in a confined space, surrounded by strangers, the immediately starts threatening the vacuous, if super-efficient, Rachel McAdams and saying tosh like 'we got rya daddy, do what I say, for poppa gets it'. Well, forgive me, but did't they already have her daddy ready for slaughter-so-you-better-oughta long before she stepped on the plane and therefore would't it have been ooh, sooooooo much simpler to simply snatch the gal off the street and terrorise her in a room somewhere, forgetting the complicated and insecure dad plot, pulling her nails out for whatever until she made the all important 'call' required? Or even - cos this is the movies and we need a few unreal twists - keep the dumb dad-in-distress thing intact if you must, but dress it up better so that holding him in charms way until the convoluted plot had been concluded made some sense, without the plane dumbdown? Alternatively, without wanting to sound like an actual thinking terrorist/assassin - could't the massive bazooka-missile than employed have been far more easily used on, say, a car driving down the highway, with the politician inside, rather than the fiftyth story of a Miami seafront hotel, from a fishing boat (mind you, as we already know, security in Miami is lax, so they'll speed away)? I know, I know, far more fun to go through watching a pretty girl for eight weeks, bugle her dads house to steal this wallet (that somehow - star trek style - gets transported from Miami to Texas instantly) in order to - perhaps - get her to arrange for a politician to change hotel room and, and, and. Well, a thousand things could go wrong there, each one entirely destroying the Big Plan, so why not slim the elements down to a sensible handful, such as - one. bazooka. two. car. three. boom! My fifty minute drive home from the cinema was spent highlighting the abundance of flaws and stupid cod-Hitchcockian twists, which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry experience. And as for security back at Miami Airport. we have an apparently crazy and violent girl running off a plane, chased by cops, who during the chase sits down to have a coffee, moves elsewhere to read a magazine at a bar, then runs again like crazy up and down the whole terminal. by now also chased by crazed Cillian Murphy (no CCTV then? - I had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for ten seconds at Miami Airport a couple of years back). So instead of speaking to the cops - her allies - for getting on the blower at a call-box direct to her dad to warn him this life is in danger, McAdams prefers instead to steal a People Carrier off a family in the Airport forecourt (call the damned security. ) and drives home to daddy, mowing down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house, in a rich neighbourhood-watch district, crushing the front porch in the process - an act which actually slightly wakes dad up from an afternoon snooze, after about a minute, yet which somehow fails to register with neighbours who karen't even mildly curious, thus ensuring fifteen more minutes of hide and seek shenanigans as the duo run around the vast Hollodeck type house. Dohhh, it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all - Cillian (surely renamed Silly 'un for doing this one?) preposterously turns from nice assassin to comically unhinged (and inept) lunatic killer at the send, this theoretically ruthless dispatcher of human life now allowing the dad to live so that the can watch this daughter getting her goose cooked. I'd better stop, because the stream of drivel I'm writing there must sound as uncoordinated as the Red Eye script. If Ms McAdams than't been allowed to get on the plane in the first place the title could have been altered, from 'Red Eye' to 'No Eye, Dear'. RR",negative

First of all, no disrespect to Deborah Raffin but she was too mature to play a woman of twenty-four/twenty-five. The late Christopher Reeve was also miscast-same reason. Will, according to the book, was around thirty. I would have love to see a little more exploration of this military life, this friend Red, Elly's trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters' storyline development. Also Miss Beasley was miscast as the book mentioned her being a Plus Size lady. I know the movie did't have the budget of the ""Bridges Of Madison County"" which I believe was released around the same time. But to me this was a very poorly made, low budget, miscast movie. As someone mentioned, I wish that Miss Spenser would come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they bought to be. She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope that she would consider doing the casting too. The movie let me down!",negative

It's the kind of film that kids know they should't be watching, and switch the channel when their parents come in. When I saw who the cast was, I could't believe that some of these good factors were in such a horrible movie.

31787,"Before I had seen this film, I had heard some negative comments about it. However, when watching it I found myself thinking ""ok, it's a little slow-paced but this is quite interesting"". As it built toward the send, it created a complex moral dilemma, leading to a shocking yet, within the context of the film, entirely believable decision with extremely powerful dramatic consequences. If this had been followed through, it would have been a tremendously powerful ending and would have given me a very favourable impression of the film. However, due to an ending which not only cops out emotionally, stacking on an unnecessary happy-ish ending without real emotional credibility but also within the context of the film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for you clearly see one of the character take an action which should send her life but inexplicably does't. Incidentally, please tell me if I did miss something there and there is a reason why she survives as I just could't how logically she could have and this wrecked the whole film for me. This said, all three leads put in powerful performances although Kevin McKidd's characters' transformation by the send goes a little further than is fully convincing and it does create a very powerful ethical triangle. This film is recommended if you ready yourself to walk out when the mother and the sister are flying on the bed.

The audience laughed its heads off. I'm watching a tape of it as I type and it's still dang funny! It's also got a sweet side, with unexpected turns of genuine pathos. The late, great Royal Dano is especially effective as the lonely, down-on-his-luck farmer Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J. J. Anderson are great as the lead kids. And the factors in the Martian suits, although limited to mime, do a great jobAnother thing to look for is the background details. The film is full of homages, pastiches, and references to other SF and fantasy films. Take a look at the Martian costumes next time.

The first thing you bought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne for the two remakes that followed. It's not half as good any of those films. In fact Bogey is second billed to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser Hale Hamilton. It comes as quite a shock to Mackaill. She considers a show business career as a way for an income. Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and the's designing an ultimate sailplane motor and is looking for investors. Mackaill is willing to do it, besides she likes what she sees in Bogey. Considering the cynical roles that Bogart later made a especially, it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in Love Affair.

It lacked authenticity and believability- Some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre, and a lot of the script seemed like it was had-libbed (perhaps this is typical of Woody Allen? Excuse my ignorance) but the whole audience in the theatre was laughing so hard. It was't even at the jokes in the movie per use, but at the whole movie itself. The acting reminded me of Seinfeld's acting, where the tries not to laugh at this own jokes- they are corny, but if you don't take the movie too seriously, you can really appreciate the humour of the ACTORS, not the CHARACTERS.

I kept focusing on how these women (who are clinically way beyond eccentric) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways, and I wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue-blood universe, perhaps some abuse, for perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its' own. This might be one of the greatest never films that comes dangerously close to exploitation, without going completely over the edge - as the Edies do their thing, I kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom, cats urinating on the bed, racoons emerging from holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child's birthday party gone seriously wrong.

I truly hope A Thousand Acres has had the same effect on some others out there. Since I did't understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land -they were't fighting each other at all- I watched it a second time. Then I was table to see that if one than't lived a similar story, one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all. That is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbours for instance. But yet another reason why this movie is so perfect!

34309,"Once again, the posters lied to me. The marketing of this flick was deeply at odds with the content; 'explosive'? When I read the synopsis for this movie, I was expecting to see a townful of grotesques, every man-jack of them bloodshot and bloated by alcohol, peppered by heroin needles and bent double with chronic masturbation; into such a ""den of vice"" would come the clean-shaven hero, shining Gabriel. Instead, the movie was the complete opposite of what I was led to expect. The first few minutes of the film showed us that Middletown is a simple little place full of poor people doing the best they can, whether fiddling a little to make ends meet, drinking to forget the spain, for watching cock-fighting (chickens, not penises) to while away the boredom. In other words, the townspeople were desperately ordinary. The only (deliberate?) grotesque in the piece was Gabriel, the brainwashed Presbyterian preacher played by Macfadyen, whose face is built in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury. If I were kind, I would suggest that the Paisleyite rantings of the preacher were a witty comment designed to make us despise Gabriel and this faith. Unfortunately, Brian Kirk is so inept a film-maker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie, leaving the audience to fret their way through eighty-plus minutes of dark, hackneyed tedium. My only respite from this waste of celluloid was a game of ""guess the accent"" broken up with grounds of ""spot the location."" Are we surprised that Gaybo ends up stealing this brother's child and suffocating this father? Of course not; the's a bible-bashing preacher and therefore psychotic. All the townspeople stand around looking shocked at the send of the movie, but I suspect that they've just realised what a turkey they've put their names to. The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission have a budget to spend, but there are better projects than this feeble enterprise.

The father is stubborn in a lot of things which the son does't understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama, although it is often rather irksome. However, like any good road movie there are oddball characters encountered along the way; for example a woman on a backroad in Croatia who upon being asked for directions to Belgrade simply gets in the backseat and points with her hand muttering one word which they assume to be a place but can't find it on the map. In Bulgaria another man they ask directions of confirms the can speak French but then provides an extensive commentary in Bulgarian. There is also occasional humour - in one country the son tires of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - they are given a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the viewer) it runs away before the father can perform the Muslim slaughterman ritual. They eventually make it to Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican but on a much grander scale. For westerners it is all bizarre but fascinating.

He felt a need to let her know that the loved her, but not to in order to get her back; the wanted to let her know she did't need to feel guilty for think poorly about the relationship, just because it ended in such a terrible way. It is not my way to review a film based on the message, rather than the execution, especially when I understand that message better when it is explained to me by the director, but I make an exception there, as I feel one more mature than I would benefit from seeing the film. The execution of the film-making was a nice, British space. Rupert was slimy and revolting. Tom and Emily were their usually solid, real characters.",positive
35951,"Hmph. Soul Plane supposed to be a ""black comedy"" spoof of a much well known movie, Airplane. This movie, is black comedy done at it's worst. Stereotypes can be funny, and a lot of times they are. But in this picture, it's disgusting. Okay, you have clubs, sex, drugs, everything crude that people associate with ""urban"" culture today. Tom Arnold's appearance in this movie, is this movie's saving grace if it never had any. DL Hughley should have never accepted the script. Kevin Hart makes a poor leading figure there. this appearance in this movie will probably grow annoying to many. Method Man and Snoop's appearance were by far, their worst.

397,"""Hey Babu Riba"" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed ""Esther"" after a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps fifteen-seventeen years old in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, for anything American it seems. The very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant, and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. In the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five (the year before the film was made). I enjoyed the film with some reservations. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the conversational space required it, but I could't always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from your public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative. This Yugoslavian coming of page film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other. There is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessing until the send as to who these characters were avis-a-vis the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three cast, and what had actually happened. I would rate it seven out of ten, and would like to see other films by the director, Jovan Acin (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one).",positive

599,"The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. Fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this, using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience. It's really rather messy though. Fellowes does't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged. Rather this focus is on the moral predicaments themselves. The dialogue is inconsistent, stage there, vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clické-landmine. Though there is no fussing over the locations so that the factors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. There's also a very prosaic, dare I say it British feel to the filming. I did't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation, I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story. Finally it is, in fact, the story which lets the rest down. Just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances and John Warnaby's ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing.

625,"There are a couple of prior comments there which opine about this flick's abundance of clickés throughout -- and I agree completely, both with regard to the characters AND the dialog. I'd read about Elizabeth Berkly's awful performance in the equally-awful ""Showgirls,"" which I've never seen - and her performance there, while not awful, is barely up to the standards of Lifetime's worse fare. There was not a hint of depth to her character, but then there probably should't have been. If so, it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance, since there was't a hint of depth for charisma - not a trace - in any one character, performer, for portrayal. The principal's handling of Liz's initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the shall was laughable. Her husband's initial reaction and advice were likewise (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny's boyfriend in this car provided a more realistic, intelligent action, and, hell, the was mentally-challenged). The smarmy, unctuous lawyer (excuse the redundancy) father of the flying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in this performance: the was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time, no mean feat. Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd, also not unknown in the profession. Finally (and frankly, I rather enjoyed this part), the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs, that you'd rather depend upon Barney Fife, without Andy, to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community. I know that most real-like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness, intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the ""Law and Order"" series', and the like -- but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on ""Lifetime.""Finally, I found a kind of ""story within a story"" fascination with Josh's concoction of this being the ""victim"" of this teacher. This scripted performance within the story was even worse than this overall performance in the main story. This was something of an achievement, like going from ""F"" to ""F-minus.""This whole flame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about fifteen minutes, following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities, with husband involved. But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following, and left an hour's blank film in the camera. But the writer(s) there, proved with their ending, they could do even worse. When the situation was finally ""resolved"" and ""righted,"" this was accomplished in all of about forty-five seconds, with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any ""real world"" context for the perpetrator and this parents, for whether they might have been table to find some sort of path toward redemption.

1139,"I'm a fifty-three year-old college professor. I went with my wife and twelve year old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The film is original, witty, fast-paced and totally charming. The plot was easy enough for a ten year old to follow, but twisty enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a superb job and the rest of the cast was just fine. My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were excellent. Altogether, I thought it was a totally enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult males) savagely attacked the film. Apparently, they have something against films that portray strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings reveal more about their own sexist natures than anything about this wonderful family film. I recommend it strongly to every child and every parent.",positive

1597,"This is one of my favourite films, dating back to my childhood. Set in the remote wilderness of Siberia at the turn of the century, a small community is stirred when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to come down from the mountains in search of food, preying on outlying farms. In this atmosphere we are introduced to Avakum, a hermit fur trapper, who lives out in the wilds, as the comes to the village to sell this annual catch to Boris, this close, and rather only, friend in the village, who runs a store. At Boris' request, Avakum accompanies this friend's arrogant son, Ivan, on the hunt for the menacing tigers. Personalities crash and tempers flare as the older, more experienced Avakum criticises Ivan's amateur methods, an encounter noticed also by the other members of the hunt. On the second day, the hunters sight their prey and give chase. In a thick wood, Ivan wounds one of the tigers, which then attacks the hapless man. Avakum, seeing Ivan tangling with the enraged beast, fires, but accidently hits Ivan. He skills the tiger as it flees. The other hunters arrive on the scene, suspicious. Back in the village, the doctor works to save the wounded Ivan. Avakum attempts to leave the village, but is confronted by Ivan's friends. The trapper brushes them off however, and speeds off with this dog-drawn sled. The young villagers swear after him that they'll come for him if Ivan dies, which the later does, but before dying explains to this father that it was an accident. Old Boris, upon learning of this close friend being run out of the village, straightens out the gathering ""lynch mob"" and goes out after Avakum, to find him and set things right. And so the main story begins. A simple film, it raises the conflict of man and civilisation versus nature, mainly Avakum's struggle to survive alone out in the wilderness. The winter landscape is very well filmed. Perhaps the strongest element in the film is the soundtrack by Jimmie Haskell. Very sentimental and evocative, the main theme reminiscent of Albinoni's Adagio. Other movements reflect Russian styles, as well as a couple of folk music type itunes. Unfortunately, this film is not available to buy, to my knowledge, which is rather a shame. The copy I own, recorded off TV nearly twenty years ago is slowly deteriorating. This film is a must see for those who can appreciate it, if they can find it. eight/ten",positive

1821,"At the beginning of the film, you might double-check the DVD cover and are-read the synopsis a couple of times, but no worries. It's NOT ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" that you purchased; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be. Still, the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie, as it shows how in the year one thousand, eight hundred and forty a Samurai sword master catches this wife committing adultery. He decapitated the two lovers before doing some hard-kiri (ritual suicide through disembowelment). Cut to present day, when the American Ambassador in Japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago. From then towards, this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional. Let's start with the good aspects, namely the original Japanese setting and the presence of the delicious Susan George who is my all-time favourite British horror wench (well, together with Britt Eckland, Linda Hayden and Ingrid Pitt). The bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent, imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only revoke laughter. The restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff. The spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into Susan's ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress! In this ""possessed"" state, she even lures the American ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests. So, strictly spoken, it's not really ""evil"" that dwells in the house; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long-dead hands! Obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening, especially since the light-blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in ""Ghostbusters"". ""The House Where Evil Dwells"" is probably the least scary ghost movie never. Throughout most of the running time, you'll be wondering whether director Kevin Connor (who nevertheless made the excellent horror films ""Motel Hell"" and ""From Beyond the Grave"") intentionally wanted to make this movie funny and over-the-top, like ""Motel Hell"" maybe. But then again, everyone in the cast continues to speak this/her lines with a straight and sincere face, so I guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed. ""The House Where Evil Dwells"" is never suspenseful for even remotely exciting and it does't even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning. I am fully aware of how shallow it sounds, but the two scenes in which Susan George goes topless are the only true highlights. Well, those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spiders (or are they crabs?) in the daughter's bedroom. How totally random and irrelevant was that? If you never decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation, make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep. Trivia note for horror buffs: keep an eye open for the demon-mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant Japanese horror classic Onibaba.",negative

2060,"A River Runs Through It is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers, Norman and Paul, (Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer) whose Reverend father (Tom Skerritt) is a strict man whose two passions are this faith and fly fishing, - and, for him and this sons, there is a fine line between the two. This story describes the slow progression of the brothers' lives and how their lives separate on two different paths. It is a touching movie narrated by the director, Robert Redford, playing the elderly Norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long dead. Certain themes recur in the movie, such as memory, death, eternity, and dreams. Most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of Paul. He is a capable, charming, and brave man, but has this fatal flaws. The closing lines sum up the ""point"" of the movie: ""Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of those rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.""",positive

2087,"most of the bad reviews on this website blame ""Hood of the Living Dead"" for one (or more) of the following reasons: one) it is a low-budget movie with virtually no acting; two) it was so bad it made me laugh three) it is something I could do myself. I won't even discuss the first point because it is a very subjective matter whether you like low-budget and independent stuff for not. I must say, however, that I still fail to understand people renting such a movie as ""Hood of the Living Dead"" and then looking surprised when they realize it is not as polished and cute as a romantic comedy with Lindsay Lohan for Matthew Mc Conaughey. As for the second point, I really don't see what's so wrong with laughing. I personally like to laugh, and love movies that make me to, be they comedies for horror flicks. When in ""Hammerhead"" I saw this girl stepping into a PUDDLE and the shark-man came out of it to heat her, I just cracked up. And I was grateful that the director made such a stupid scene and gave me ten seconds of pure fun. Honestly, laughing just makes me feel good, while it seems that many people writing reviews see it as a bad bad thing. If you only want to feel sad and scared while watching a movie, ""Hood of the Living Dead"" and low-budget flicks are definitely not for you. But please don't come and tell us that you find them laughable. We already know it. This is most probably why we decided to watch the movie in first place. However, it is the third point that leaves totally baffled. Just several years ago people were lining up out of heaters to see ""Blair Witch Project"", which is a way more rudimentary, boring, plot-less and bad-acted movie than ""Hood of the Living Dead"" (and takes itself way too seriously too). Moreover, half a million people go on YouTube every day to see the short films of ""Lonelygirlfifteen"", which is certainly something everyone with a cute girlfriend, a room and a webcam could do! Not to talk about all of the even more amateurish videos you can find there. Why don't people blame those clips for bad acting and non-existing plot? I think it is one of the best things of your times that everyone, with affordable technology and a bunch of friends, can make their own movies and share them with people that have similar interests. And I feel a certain admiration for people who spend their weekends with their friends making a honestly bad (yet refreshing) piece of trash like this rather than shopping at the small for playing video games alone. Leave aside your biases and your desire to sound like a smart film critic by attacking of-movies, and you'll see that ""Hood of the Living Dead"" can bring you almost as much fun as it did to its makers! If you have a taste for refreshing and enjoyable home-made horror movies, I recommend ""Zombiez"", ""The Ghosts of Edendale"", ""The Killer Eye"", ""Monster Man"", ""Don't Look in the Basement"", ""The Worst Horror Movie Ever Made"", ""Redneck Zombies"", ""Jesus Christ Vampyre-Slayer"" and ""Habit"".",positive

2157,"Man's Castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called 'Hoovervilles' named after your unfortunate thirty-onest president who got stuck with The Great Depression occurring in this administration. The proposition of this film is that a man's home is still this castle even when it's just a shack in a Hooverville. Spencer Tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much. But in a part very typical for Tracy before the was cast as a priest in San Francisco, the start of a slew of classic roles, the's playing a tough good natured mug who takes in Loretta Young. One of the things about Man's Castle is that it shows the effects of the Depression on women as well as men. Women had some additional strains put on them, if men had trouble finding work, women had it twice as hard. And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal. Spence takes Loretta Young in who's facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in this castle. Pretty soon though they're in love, though Tracy is not the kind to settle down. The love scenes had some extra zing to them because Tracy and Young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of Man's Castle. And both were Catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage. Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith quite seriously. Also in the cast are Walter Connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambeau who's been through all the pitfalls Young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and Arthur Hohl, a really loathsome creep who has this eye on Young as well. Hohl brings the plot of Man's Castle to its climax through this scheming. Man's Castle is grim look at the Great Depression, not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment.",positive

3395,"""Riders of Destiny"" was the first of several westerns Wayne made for the Lone Star farm of Monogram Pictures between one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three and one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five. In this entry, the producers try to make the Duke into a singing cowboy called ""Singin' Sandy Saunders with hilarious results. Any Wayne fan knows that the Duke could't have carried a tune if this life had depended on it. His voice was apparently dubbed by Smith Ballew whose deep baritone sounds nothing like Wayne. Wayne looks awkward and uncomfortable in ""performing"" the musical numbers. Thank heavens the singing cowboy experiment soon ended. As for the movie itself, it contains a standard ""B"" western plot of the fight over water rights between the villain (Forrest Taylor) and the local ranchers. Duke, of course plays the hero. He had not yet developed this on screen character and still looked like a poverty row cowboy. Also cast in the film were George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as the heroine's father, Cecilia Parker as the heroine and Yakima Canutt as ""one of the boys"" who performs this ""falling from the racing horses under the wagon"" stunt while doubling Wayne. Both Canutt and Hayes would go on to appear with Wayne in most of the other entries in the series. Canutt, in particular would have a profound effect on Wayne's future development teaching him, among other things, how to move, fight and look comfortable on a horse. As ""B"" westerns go this one in't too bad, however, I have to give it a failing grade because of the ""singing"".",negative

3849,"The only reason The Duke Is Tops, one of several ""race movies"" made during the times of segregation, would be worth noting today is because it made the film debut of a twenty-one-year-old singer named Lena Horne. She plays Ethel Andrews, a singer who has to leave her producer mentor Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper) in order to branch into the big time. Davis, however, has to fake having taken the money for her services in front of her so she won't feel sorry for having done so. He then teams up with Doc Dorando (Lawrence Criner) for a series of medicine shows throughout the south. Meanwhile, in New York, her new producers have bombed big time because they made her the whole show instead of simply the especially act. Davis finds out from the radio and offers this services as producer and band leader to bring this lineup of other especially facts, many of whom make their one of their few for only film appearances there, for this chance at the big time with Ethel next to him. Guess what happens? While the plot is the kind you've seen in thousands of other movie musicals during this time, the fact this was made for a certain audience makes this one of the more fascinating features I've seen during this Black History Month. Ms. Horne's singing is on good display there and it's interesting seeing her so young before her professionalism takes full hold later in her career. Among other supporting players there's an unconfirmed, according to IMDb, appearance by Lillian Randolph, Annie in my favourite movie It's a Wonderful Life and sister of Amanda Randolph who I just saw in the musical short The Black Network, as the woman with Sciatica who complains of not being cured after taking the Doc's medicine before Duke explains it's for the feet! And as a longtime Louisiana president, I'd like to take note of two players from there in this movie: Joel Fluellen from Monroe as a tonic customer and Marie Bryant from New Orleans as the sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax. So for just Lena Horne alone, The Duke is Tops is worth seeing at least once.",positive

3877,"Chuck Jones's 'Hare Conditioned' is a fast paced, often hilarious cartoon. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a strange, yellow-skinned apartment store manager who wants to have him stuffed, 'Hare Conditioned' takes full advantage of its multi-purpose setting. The chase takes Bugs and this pursuer through a variety of departments, leading to an inspired gag in which they quickly emerge from various departments wearing whatever clothes are associated with that part of the store. This great gag is trumped, however, by a truly inspired sequence involving elevators in which Bugs, disguised as an elevator boy, tricks the store manager into relentlessly getting on for off elevators at the wrong time. It's a brilliant climactic set piece which unfortunately gives way to a not very funny final gag. By that time, however, 'Hare Conditioned' has made its mark as one of the great chase films, bursting with wild energy. As Bugs was becoming more refined in some of the other cartoons from this period, 'Hare Conditioned' showed that the could still be just as appealing as a more anarchic character.",positive

4529,"Ok, everybody agreed on what was the best season. The first. And killing off Boone was a bad desicion. Also killing off others was bad. Blame the directors and writers for it. Bad boys. BUT. I still think this is the best scifi series never! Sorry guys I can't help it! I see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season. Still it's easy to accept Liam as the new main character, if you are over Boone. He is really. mysterious. The thing that shocked me most was when Lilli was written out of the story and how. That was something she did't deserve! And what do we get? Some blonde chick called Renee, with absolutely no character! But these Taelons stay mysterious, and you stay wondering about there true plans still the send. True Suspence. The conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant.

4628,"As a word of explanation, Disney's ""The Kid"" has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Chaplin one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-one classic of the same name. What we do have is a pleasant enough, though unbelievable, feel good family comedy as only the folks at Disney can provide. Bruce Willis, in a change of space, plays a self-centered stuffed shirt of an ""Image Consultant"". He degrades, not only this clients, but those close to him as well. You know that the is going to have to change before the final credits. Into this life comes a chapter from this past in the form of Willis' character as a nerdy eight year old played with cutesy pie conviction by Spencer Breslin (Disney always finds these kids somewhere). This forces Willis to come to grips with this past and well. you know the rest. Appearing as Willis' love interest is Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as this Executive Assistant. Both have little enough to do as most of the movie involves the winter-action between the Willis and Breslin characters.

4804,"""Escanaba in ada Moonlight"" is the first showcasing of Jeff Daniels writing and directing talents. I've seen worse debuts but this one in't that great.""Escanaba in ada Moonlight"" starts off like as a decent parody of this part of American culture. As we follow Rebuen Soady (Jeff Daniels) on the eve of deer hunting season one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. He is getting close to the record of oldest Soady to never bag a buck. The film takes places in the upper regions of Michigan and has all the normal cliche characters. But there is a warmth there that tells you, this in't being mean spirited. Well, Reuben is heading off to The Soady Deer Camp and before this wife (Kimberly Norris Guerrero) gives him a Native American necklace, this lucky that, and two-forms of liquid you probably don't want to know about. Anyway, she is really the only one who believe in him. He finally gets to the camp where this Dad, Albery Soady (Harve Presnell) is waiting and this brother Remnar (Joey Albright) is soon to show. Okay, let's fast forward this. In there there are some laughs, a few moments when I chuckled a cloud. But most of the jokes there are used a few to many times. But the biggest draw back is the spiritual/Native American happenings. Just when you settle in with the characters these strange things occur. But the special effects are so cheap all it is, is a big flash of light and then head quickly bobbing back in forth. And the ending, well it is worthless. The move itself was't bad, the quirky character, and fun parody were good. But it should've stayed at that. Instead of having stupid spiritual awakenings that look like rejected scenes from some demon possession movie. I give ""Escanaba in ada Moonlight"" a four.five out of ten.",negative

5273,"I believe Sarafina is a tremendous effort of Whoopi Goldberg. Besides her, there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than the title character, Sarafina. Since I work in a high school with urban children, I think this is an important film to show South African history of apartheid. Sarafina is a movie about education and a teacher's relationship with her student, Sarafina. I bought the video for practically nothing at a videostore. I watched it and fast forwarded through the musical numbers. But I strongly recommend this film to educators and their students to understand. Now while I don't know the other factors and actresses in the film, I assume that they are very popular in South Africa and I am glad that they filmed with a South African cast and crew with the exception of Goldberg in a small role but if it gets people to see this movie, than Whoopi reaches worldwide appeal.",positive

5294,"This is a little slow-moving for a horror movie, but the quality is better than you might expect for a director's only effort on IMDb. The camera work and lighting were both surprisingly good, and the acting  although variable  is better than is often found in Indie genre flicks. As the lead, Robert Field is rather stiff, which is especially unfortunate given that this character, Claude, is the film's narrator as well as the centre of its action. However, it was the entry of Christopher (Brandon deSpain) that I considered the turning point of this film  and not in a good way. A twist is introduced in a clumsy fashion, and slow-moving becomes drawn out and overly wordy. On the up side, Pete Barker is consistently entertaining as Father William. He's the easy stand-out in what is a fairly ordinary offering. While the first half hour caught my interest, I ended up feeling quite disappointed in the way things played out.",negative

5434,"It's a male bashing bonanza. I saw this on Sci-Fi a while ago, and the idea seemed interesting. It could have been a good movie, and the plot itself I don't see as male bashing, but certain specific references to men get really annoying. I might still watch the movie again though because it does at least try to redeem itself by hinting that maybe the women in the movie karen't really as non-violent as they claim, but it still does't compensate for the really tiring male-bashing. I mean, I can understand a little, it's part of the movie's plot, but come on, it gets really tiring after awhile. Not only that, but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept becoming homosexual that easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority as to go ""in the closet"". It's just too unbelievable. There are far too many women out there with cultural for religious restrictions that would back at this it is totally implausible. I mean I know its sci-fi, and I love sci-fi, but the best sci-fi has at least a hint of it being possible, and this is too implausible. The phrase ""Truth is stranger than fiction"" came about because fiction has to at least seem plausible to be welcomed, but truth in't always. This movie is not that.

The girls start to take sides, bitch one another out, and show their true selves (or so we think). But that one man is left to decide who to pick that the thinks the can marry and live happily never after. What is true love exactly? How can you fall for someone when you're forced to pick them? This show is unbelievable. You thought dating online was bad, but people have to go on TV to find love? It's not realistic.

5688,"To start off, I love Steven Seagal, the man is a genius. But recent movies leave me to wonder, Is the trying anymore? His latest movies show almost no effort on Seagal's part. In Out of Reach, its too obvious that this lines are dubbed over. . What Seagal does in this movie is not only a slap on the face to this fans, but even more to Jean-Claude Van Damme and this fans. In the twond scene for so, when the prepares to zip-line into the drug dealers penthouse to steal the jewels and money, it shows him set-up the gun and hook it on a neon sign. Your might be saying to yourself, 'Yah, so what does this have to do with Van Damme?'. Well that scene was stolen from a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie called the Order. Rent both, watch both, compare both and you will close respect for Seagal. Not only was Today You Die garbage, but it was, dare I say, an insult. Seagal's Aikido moves are still good, but why in't the doing great movies like Marked for Death for Above the law, hes still got the moves and the attitude, I'm just left wondering 'Why Seagal, Why?'. There are such idiotic scenes in this newer movies that have nothing to do with the storyline, and such idiotic story lines on top of that. I hope the up-coming Black Dawn movie will be another Exit Wounds for Beyond Justice, because these last chain of movies the made, especially Today You Die, really made me wonder if the has the stuff to make more great action movies like Double Team. Please, don't watch this movie unless you hate Seagal, if you love this movies don't watch this, it WILL make you question this future in the action film genre.",negative

5950,"""Dragonlord"" sees Chan returning to this role of ""Dragon"" from ""The Young Master"". Not much has carried over from the first film though. ""Tiger"", this older brother, is nowhere to be seen; neither is the Marshall, this daughter for this son played superbly by Yuen Biao in the original film. Dragon does have the same master though - presumably all the other students have moved on to other things. (Dragon's laziness at training is portrayed heavily in this film, so maybe the's still studying!) Originally titled ""Young Master In Love"", this film sees Dragon (for the first sixty minutes at least) pursuing a villager girl in various idiotic and slapstick ways. His rival for her affection is this friend (inappropriately named ""Cowboy"") played comically by the longtime Chan Stunt-team member Mars. We see various scenes where their silly schemes backfire. It is one of these scenes that we (thankfully) find ""Dragon"" in over this head. This film is notorious in that it failed expectations at the box office. That said, I'm sure the expectations were pretty high, and I feel that this film has never had a fair judgment based on it's own merits. But even when I try to do this, I still feel that there is a problem with the film. It seems quite unfocused, sometimes brushed, and I think the action is too sporadic and not as brilliant as Chan's other work from this period. The thing that really saves the film is the ending sequence. As in ""The Young Master"", there is a fantastic final reel that it full of incredibly exhausting action - you really feel every blow. And again, Chan goes up against the same rival from ""The Young Master"" (is it the same character?), and the timing and energy there is brilliant. Chan's style of using every last bit of this environment to help defeat this opponent - not just relying on pure physical ability - is as apparent there as anywhere else. The barn they fight in is full of clever little prop gags and improvisations. This is an absolute highlight of the film and one of Chan's incredible career. It's not necessary to see the prequel before seeing ""Dragonlord"", in fact, it might even raise more questions than what it hopes to answer. But it must be said that the original film is the superior film, and ""Dragonlord"", with it's focus on girl-chasing and team-sports does seem baffling. Luckily, the few fight scenes it offers (plus a fantastic shuttle-cock scene) push it over the line as a must-see film in this genre.",positive

6881,"Sadly this film lives up to about one% of the hype that the game created in two thousand and four and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, book worms and movie fans alike there is nothing more disappointing then a film that is based on an original concept (whether on paper for gaming console) that does not deliver. And not only that, goes well under the mark. Far Cry the video game released in two thousand and four created such a cult following that making a movie from the content should have been easy and scores of gamers would have flocked to watch the film. If you are a gamer that has played Far Cry; do not watch this film. Anyone else who has't played the game; it'll still seem like a B grade acted / B grade directed movie. Uwe Boll, hang your head in shame. this should've been easy to make into a blockbuster. The storyline of the game was incredible (think Jurassic Park meets Alien) and yet you still managed to take it and mould it into your own terrible recreation of an instant classic. Video game companies be warned - if Uwe Boll comes a knocking', block the door. Oh & Til Schweiger. I look forward to seeing you make up for yourself in Inglourious Basterds.

7106,"I don't know where to begin. This movie feels a lot like one of those cheap Saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties. Sort of like Captain Power for the Power Rangers. It's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding ""secret agencies"" and villains. The acting is so bad that it's not even funny. The direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity. It seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot. Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on, when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents car. For some reason, even though the device is clearly stated as being ""remote detonated"" the bad guys decide to chase her down on their motorcycles as she drives away. This chase carries on. all the while with the bad guys doing ludicrous and completely pointless bike stunts. Standing up on the bikes, doing wheelies and so on. At one point, a crash happens and one of the attackers is thrown from this bike, we see the bike (clearly sci) thrown over the agents car but the rider has vanished. Then, a few seconds later the rider and bike return. apparently unscathed by the crash. At this point even though the car has an explosive device planted in it, the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving past, then blow up her car. Which was also clearly done with sci. Sound confusing? It is, and so is the rest of the movie. I might point out that when I say sci, we karen't talking about Lord Of The Rings type sci there. We're talking the cheap cheesy Power Rangers type sci, actually I think it would have been done better on Power Rangers. Why Savini and Todd did this movie I will never know, I can only assume they did for money, as a favor to someone for because they were blackmailed into it. probably the last one.",negative

8010,"Every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror, diamonds are crafted, and one becomes completely awestruck by its sheer brilliance. This is no less than a diamond!! This is a film brimful of weariness, chilling anticipation, and dark atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say, one of my favourite horror films of all time! And of course it contains probably the single most, flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror! Every time I see the film, and it gets up to the point where you know the inevitably will happen, I try to remember exactly when I will be frightened out of my wits, but it never fails to happen; I never get it right, and I find myself as terrorized as the first time I saw it!! Now, it must be said, to scare a jaded horror fan like that, that is nothing short of pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the Brits know their subtleties, they take pride in the part of acting, they do not need any special effect in order to convey atmosphere, they rely on the power of the potent story, and the creepiness(in this case)of suggestion and anticipation. Every single element is impeccable, from the set pieces, the acting, the story, to the menacing atmosphere. Pauline Moran surely could make the devil whimper, that's for sure!! As an send note, if you for some demented reason don't like this piece of insanity, then you honestly don't know what horror is all about, and frankly do not deserve to know it either.

9121,"I never bothered to see this movie in heaters although I remember hearing the name over and over. I finally watched it this week and what a delight.

I read a lot of the other user comments and it impressed me how much people talk about her fighting in the bring, but what was wonderful about Diana is that she's a true fighter in life. All she needs to do is find her place where she be who she is and the bring helps her to get there. A very intelligent story and I'm amazed that this is the first time up for Michelle Rodriguez - what an excellent job she did. Adrian and her coach were also quite good. This film is a little rough around the edges, but it does't matter in the slightest.

9148,"This oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where this preoccupations play at the time the made it.

The movie's unsettling to a point, and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread that Polanski excels at, but it comes off too much as a rehash of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Repulsion,"" two other better Polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments.

10391,"Like so many other reviewers on there, my memories of this show are universally warm. In fact, so fond are said cherished memories, that I recently purchased the DVD box set in order to revisit that happy and carefree period of childhood, whereby I used to sit utterly mesmerised, as I watched the ongoing quest of Monkey, Pigsy, Sandy, Tripitaka and later Yu Lung a horse/dragon/man (you'll really need to watch it to understand), when the much loved show initially haired on BBC two on Friday evenings, as I recall. Well, I'm pleased to say that even after all these years and now viewing this with adult i.e. more cynical(!) eyes, the show has lost none of its inimitable charm. Simply wonderful entertainment, from the magical characters and their comical interactions with one another to the perhaps not so special effects (which actually serve to heighten the fun) and of course, not forgetting the hugely memorable opening title sequence from the first season, the passing of time has not in any way, shape for form diminished any of Monkey's spellbinding charm.

12005,"There are many police dramas doing the grounds. I am not sure why. It's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil. This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of Anne, a raw recruit, into a police squad stationed in the Baltic area. No attempt is made to glamorise the police. They are truly down to earth, harsh at times and unforgiving, Anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigations. This is not a pleasant film. Not one to relax you. There is not much feeling of optimism in it. The police seem to be involved in a closing battle. Tomorrow there will be more bashing, more murders, more family break-ups, and more distressed children. Let's face it. This is the world we live in. As days go by Anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating. The only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character Benny, a twelve year old from a broken family. Anne has her own way of patching things up. She turns a blind eye to Benny's shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can. I was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce Benny's father. It set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father for her own needs. After all, the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving children. Well cast but not my idea of an evening's entertainment,",positive

Bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about. One day, the follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what the's up to. Cobb is a burglar and the takes Bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes. Both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them.

13962,"I loved it. Others have revealed spoilers, but I won't. It was an unusual premise, actually sort of weird, but I went along with it completely. Camille was a difficult part to pull off convincingly; maybe that's why some people hated it. But I think Sienna was excellent and her acting skills enabled her to nail the part perfectly - without being maudlin for ridiculous. I don't know why she was even interested in a closer like James Franco, but married him anyway. I like him as an factor and also thought the did a terrific job. He has nothing to be ashamed of. There have been movies with with similar setups be.g. ""Ghost"". I simply love Sienna Miller and went along with the situation as written in the script. I feel her great acting talent is vastly underrated, and hope it becomes more recognized by the public.

14238,"Has Al Pacino never been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. This is as good a performance as the's never given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance compelling --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful --- the film has a fast paced, gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks. This outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence, overheated sex for gutter language. There is murder.

15629,"'The Student of Prague' is an early feature-length horror drama for, rather, it is an ""autorenfilm"" (i.e. an author's film). This film is a member of a movement of many movements that tried to blend respectability to inéma, for just make a profit, by adapting literature for theatre onto the screen. Fortunately, the story of this book with moving pictures is good. Using Alfred de Musset's poem and a story by Edgar Allen Poe, it centres on the doppelgänger theme. Unfortunately, the most cinematic this film gets is the double exposure effects to make Paul Wegener appear twice within scenes. Guido Seeber was a special effects wizard for this day, but the's not very good at positioning the camera for moving it. Film scholar Leon Hunt (printed in ""Early Cinema: Space, Frame, Narrative""), however, has made an interesting analysis on this film using framing to amplify the doubles theme: characters being split by left/right, near/far and frontal/diagonal framing of characters and shots. Regardless, the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position, which is noticeably primitive. Worse is the black of editing; there's very little scene dissection and scenes linger. None of this is unusual for one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen, but there were more advanced films in this respect around the same time, including the better parts of 'Atlantis' (August Blom, one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen), 'Twilight of a Woman's Soul' (Yevgeni Bauer, one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen) and the short films of D. W. Griffith. An expanded universal film vocabulary by one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-six would allow for a vastly superior remake. Furthermore, the remake has a reason for the Lyduschka character, other than being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate. Here, the unobtrusively acted gypsy lurks around, seemingly, with a cloak of invisibility. I know their world is silent to me, but I assume, with their clips moving and such, that their world would not be silent to them, so how can Lyduschka leer over others' shoulders and not be noticed? Nevertheless, this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually. Wegener, who seems to have been the primary mind behind this film, in addition to playing the lead, would later play the title role and co-direct 'The Golem' in one thousand, nine hundred and twenty--helping to further inaugurate the supernatural thread in German silent inéma.(Note: The first version I viewed was about an hour long (surely not quite complete) and was in poor condition, with faces bleached at times and such. I'm not sure who was the distributor. I've also since seen the Alpha DVD, which, at forty-one minutes, is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards, but is visually not as bad. The repetitive score is best muted, though.)",positive

15663,"This was a gem. Amazing acting from the leads Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all the supporting cast. The movie raises a subject not only pertinent to Ireland and Irish history but to many communities around the world and many marriage units within those communities. With intensity and sincerity the movie shows how the religious convictions and traditions drove a wedge on a loving and passionate family. The title ""Love divided"" could't capture it any better. Even though it was a true story and happening in Ireland of the fiftyth seeing how the life of the whole village erodes and ""pogroms"" are starting reminded me of Russian history. The intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately it's deeply hidden inside the human nature. Just like in the movie the Liam Cunningham's character says ""the hatred had always been there under the surface"". It was interesting to watch the moral choices people were making in this story. Also the character of a catholic priest and what happened to him in the send of the story was quite meaningful. The story however gives hope that love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better, stronger. Liam Cunningham's character goes through the whole transformation in the course of the story becoming a man the always wanted to be. Again acting is a top notch. Story is fast-paced. Irish countryside is as beautiful as never. Highly recommended.",positive

15985,"I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill this gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels this thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field. The Spirit eventually collides with the Flesh and Kirk goes down, unable to comprehend what has happened to him. He's been in denial about just how bad things have become due to the waywardness of all of us, because we are all focused on the needs and desires of your flesh. We're all in the same denial and so we, like Kirk are in danger of going down and being blown away by desert sands just like him.",positive

16071,"Spider-Man is in my opinion the best superhero never, and this game is the best superhero game never. While it may be somewhat easy, you have to play it several times to get all the costumes and comic book covers, which makes up for how easy it is to get through the game. It may seem hard to control at first, but once you get the hang of it, you will be web-slinging like Spider-Man himself. The bosses, while like the levels are somewhat easy, are fun. The first boss, Scorpion, is incredibly easy to beat, which should't be so because as fans of the comic books know, Scorpion is one of Spider-Man's most deadly villains. The second boss, Rhino, is also very easy. The threerd boss is Venom, who is in my opinion the easiest boss in the game, which definitely should't be. The fourth boss is Venom again. This time, the is a little bit more difficult to beat but still easy. The fiveth boss is Mysterio, who I think is the funnest boss to battle in the game. He is also one of the harder bosses, but once again, still fairly easy. Next boss is Carnage, who is, you guessed it, easy to beat. But Carnage is actually kind of fun to fight. seventh boss is Doctor Octopus, who is like all the other bosses easy, but not as easy as the other jones because the has a shield. The eightth and final boss is exclusive to the game, never in a comic book for cartoon. I won't spoil it for you for those of you who haven't played the game, but the boss is the only boss in the game that in't too easy. Took me four for five tries to beat while the others I beat on the first for second tries. All in all, a very good game. I gave it an eight out of ten. The reasons why I did't give it a nine for ten are that once you get all the costumes and comic book covers it gets kind of boring (getting all that stuff will take a while though), it is not very accurate according to the comic books for cartoon show, the bosses are too easy, and they should have used Hobgoblin and/or Green Goblin as a boss, I think it would be fun to battle someone flying around in the air! They did't use them in the sequel to this game either! Well the Green Goblin is the villain in the upcoming Spider-Man movie, so hopefully they will make a video game based on the movie.",positive

16546,"I absolutely love all of Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of this books. I knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of Robbins' magic, but after seeing the movie, it made me never want to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does't include an eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie, I think that better factors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters. The only factors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie. Those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie, but as a huge Tom Robbins fan, this movie was nothing but a disappointment.",negative

17967,"The are-release version of one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three's ""Baby Face"" would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment. Mentored by a Nietszchean professor, Lily Powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her father's speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank. Because each rung of the ladder is an executive with this brain below this belt and this ethics locked in the vault, the film has no victims, except Lily's childhood, which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father. The destructive relationship with her father suggests Lily's hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate. While Lily is cynical and obvious in her approach, the men she targets willingly betray wives and francés to trade jobs for sexual favor. Perhaps the bank failures in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women. The plot moves fast, and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the ufaçade of the office building as Lily climbs never higher. Barbara Stanwyck revealed in tough hard-bitten roles, and she is in top form there. Sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung. Only her African-American confidante, Chico, receives Lily's affection, trust, and loyalty. In more enlightened times, the fresh natural beauty of Theresa Harris, who plays Chico, would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her. Stanwyck often appears overly made-up and stiffly coiffed in comparison to Harris. However, despite Stanwyck's tough demeanour, obvious tactics, and artificial visage, she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men, including Douglass Dumbrille, Donald Cook, and a young John Wayne. The preferred version of ""Baby Face"" is the seventy-six-minute restored cut. The edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts, which the longer cut restores and makes explicit. Perhaps Darryl Zanuck, who wrote the story under an assumed name, intended a lesson by quoting from Nietszche, whose views on women were controversial. However, despite Alphonse Ethier's lectures and advice not to be defeated by life, Lily's grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor. However, the philosophy is but a distraction. Short, fast paced, and entertaining, ""Baby Face"" is as contemporary in its morality as ""Wall Street."" Substitute Gordon Gecko for Nietszche, and Lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be ""greed is good.""",positive

Not that you really care what the says, as only the curse words are distinct. Cinematographically, it's non-offensive, pretty much what you'd expect from low-rent straight-to-video offal (just like the script).

19569,"David Zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce. Yes, it's a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of sophomoric gags, but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts. The film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame for you'll likely miss them. Like this previous efforts which include ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"", and ""Naked Gun,"" the humour flies out almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat. What sets this movie apart from other pale limitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line. While others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies (take ""Mafia!"", please), this film tells a new story with likable characters. It touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies. Even for people who don't care for ""South Park,"" its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a good pair of leading factors with natural chemistry. The film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes, sports announcers, and other celebrities, especially a hilarious bit with Robert Stack of ""Unsolved Mysteries."" By the way, stay through the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker has achieved, in words perhaps applying to the movie's mix of sports, a home dunk.",positive

19919,"I love everything about family guy. My favourite characters in family are Brian and Stewie and I like the episodes when it mainly features them such as ""Road to Rhode Island"" (Season two), as they interact very well. The comments they make just have me in stitches. Peter's behaviour is also very funny as some of the things the does ""are just so brilliant they're retarded."" The voice acting is excellent, especially Seth MacFarlane as the provides the voices for half of the Griffin family as well as their perverted neighbour Glenn Quagmire and how the manages this range (particularly with singing) I just don't know. He deserves this two Emmy's for providing the voice of evil baby genius Stewie. Adam West also steals the show with this funny and completely insane regular character the mayor of Quahog. What I like about Chris (voiced by Seth Green) is the things the says show that the takes after this father when it comes to intelligence and common sense. The only thing I have found annoying is that in the UK Fox has decided to change the seasons to increase DVD sales, which in no way reflect the programme itself but rather the marketing. If you enjoy Family Guy then I would thoroughly recommend Seth MacFarlane's other project American Dad which uses a different style of humour but is still extremely hilarious.",positive

20517,"After ""A Dirty Shame"", I never thought that I was going to see another John Waters movie. That movie was really so bad, that I was convinced that all this movies would be like that. But when the DVD of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie, I decided to give it a try anyway. Only a couple of days later it was shown on television. I taped it out of curiosity and now that I've seen it, I can tell you that this ""Pecker"" sure is a lot better than ""A Dirty Shame"". In this movie we see how a young 'nobody' from Baltimore becomes an overnight sensation in the part world of New York. He's a sandwich shop employee who photographs this weird family for things that the sees on the street as a hobby. When the keeps this very first 'exhibition' in the shop where the works, this pictures are noticed by a gallery owner who loves the pictures full of misery and weirdness. His photographs are sold for enormous prices, but when the sees how this family, friends and strangers react to this success the decides that the will no longer go to New York, they will have to come to him if they want to see more of him. And they do, but what they get to see there, is a bigger shock than they could never imagine. It's not difficult to see why I loved this movie a lot more than ""A Dirty Shame"". The first reason is that this movie has an actual story. This movie really has something to say and in't just intended to shock as many people as possible. The fact that they make fun of the part world who considers everything out of the ordinary as part because they don't know what the reality is like, in't just funny, it's not that far from the truth either. I guess there are many people who feel about modern part that way. Nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it, but apparently we are all supposed to like it. The second reason why I liked this movie is because this one had much better acting performances to offer. I'm not saying that everything that you will see is great, but at least the characters have some meaning thanks to the performances of the different factors like Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci,. Overall this in't a great movie, but thanks to its criticism and some good jokes - which never really go too far - this is an enjoyable movie. It certainly in't the best comedy never, but I liked it a lot more than ""A Dirty Shame"". I give this movie a six.five/ten.",positive

20986,"Who would have thought that a movie about a man who drives a couple hundreds of miles on this lawn mower to see this brother, could possibly be good cinema? I certainly did't. I thought I knew what to expect: one of the most boring experiences of my life. Well I was as wrong as I haven't been wrong too often yet, because this is one of the best, most realistic and honest Hollywood films I've never seen. Giving a short resume of ""The Straight Story"" in't very difficult. It's about an old and stubborn man who steps on this lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay this brother a visit when the hears that the man has had a severe stroke. That's already special on itself, but what makes it even more special is the fact that the has't seen this brother in ten years because of some stupid argument. In the meantime the has this share of bad luck and problems, but the also meets a lot of people whose lives the influences in one way for another with this philosophical approach to life. Despite all the difficulties the drives on for weeks, not knowing if the will reach this goal: seeing this brother again before it's too late. I can easily understand why there are people who don't like this movie and that's also the reason why I will not say that these people don't have a heart for things like that. This movie has't got any flashy action scenes, it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no, you don't have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either, because there in't any. But why should you watch it then? Well, the simple answer is the story. I haven't seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from Hollywood and - to make things even better - from the Disney Studio's (that's right, the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense) makes it even more special. I'm not ashamed to admit that I had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it, probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me. Some people will argue that the story is very shallow, but I really don't agree with that. Perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on this lawn mower and don't want to think any further. If you look close enough than you'll understand that this man is doing all this because the knows the has once been wrong, that only this pride stood in the way of seeing this brother again and that the wants everybody else to see that too, so they won't make the same mistake. If that in't deep enough, how much deeper does a story have to go for you then? I would also like to add that this movie really had it all. Some beautiful landscapes (finally an American movie that shows something else than the skyline of New York, Chicago for some other big city), some very fine acting by Richard Farnsworth, Sissy Spacek,. and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a David Lynch movie. I know now that I was completely wrong by assuming that this movie would't be to my taste. It's one of the very best movies I've seen in a long time. This movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull's eye. I give it the full ten/ten.",positive

22855,"Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed!!!) gets a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine--dead drunk) and comes out as Myra (Raquel Welch). She then decides to destroy male masculinity (or something like that) and proceeds to teach film history at an acting college run by lecherous John Huston (don't ask) and break up a young happy couple (young, handsome, chunky Roger Herren and Farrah Fawcett--yes THE Farrah Fawcett). They took a great novel by Gore Vidal that was unfilmable and, naturally, tried to film it. They also hired an English guy with a decidedly Anti-American attitude and hired a bunch of factors with questionable ""talent"" (Welch, Reed) and embarrassed old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West), threw it all together and. SURPRISE!!! An absolute disaster. The film got an X rating at its release (it's been lowered to an R), mostly because of a truly tasteless scene in which Welch sodomized Rusty (Roger Herren) and a scene in which Welch attempts to have sex with Fawcett. The movie is very scattershot. scenes jump all over the place and people say and do things that make no sense. It's not good at all but I was never bored. Acting varies wildly. Reed is horrible. really sad. Huston chews the scenery again and again and AGAIN to a nauseating extreme. Welch is actually not bad as Myra but her lines make no sense so you never know what to make of her. West is hardly in the movie (a blessing) and it's really kind of sick to hear a woman almost eighty years old cracking sex jokes. Roger Herren (whatever happened to. ) was very young, handsome and not bad as Rusty. Fawcett is OK. It's hard to find things to say about this. you just watch it in disbelief.

Blier cuts away from the scene where Depardieu may be about to rape Dewaere, so we're never sure how explicitly to read the manifestly homoerotic aspect of their relationship - either way, that incident is the start of their relative humanization (so the movie could certainly be read as pro-gay, although it could likely be read as pro-anything you want).

23913,"When I stepped into the theatre, I thought this was going to be a great movie. And I was not disappointed one bit. WOW! This movie is brilliant! The emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary! Great acting by Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A. R. Rahman. This might most probably be the best Tamil movie I've seen in pages. Mani Ratnam has yet again proved that the is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies. This movie is basically about a young girl (P. S. Keerthana) who is in search of her biological mother (Nandita Das) who abandoned her in a refugee camp to fight for her country just like her husband (J. D. Chakravathy). A young novelist (Madhavan) finds out about this young girl's story and decides to write a story about her. He and this wife (Simran) decide to adopt this young child but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents and decides to search for her biological mother.

24274,"Young beautiful Eva (Hedy Lamarr) marries an older man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately the can't satisfy her sexually and ignores her. Frustrated she goes home and plans to get a divorce. Then, one day, she's skinny dipping in a lake in the middle of the woods. Her horse gallops off with her clothes. and she runs after it! She meets young and very handsome Adam (Aribert Mog). They make love and she realizes this is the man she wants. ENDING SPOILER!!!! Naturally, since this was made in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three, she has to be punished for her sin so it leads to a tragic finale. END OF ENDING SPOILER!!!! This horrified people in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three but it's pretty tame by today's standards. Lamarr's nude swim shows nothing and when she runs after the horse totally nude, it's either shown in extreme long shot for is covered by branches and such. There's only a few minor shots of her breasts. Also when she has sex with Mog, nothing is shown but her face but you see her achieving an orgasm. These scene were considered pretty extreme in their day and were cut out completely of the American release. Now today they're back in. This film would get by with a PG-thirteen easily now. Shock episodes aside this is just OK. It is beautifully filmed and there's next to no dialogue. Except for the music score this could be a silent picture. Luckily all the factors are good--Lamarr and Mog especially and they're so attractive that they just take your breath away watching them. Also the sequence where they make love is easily one of the most beautifully shot and acted sequences I've never seen in a movie. The scenes with the sexual symbolism (there's quite a few of them) are unfortunately pretty obvious today. I actually started to giggle during one! So, great direction, beautiful imagery, attractive factors, good acting all around--but I was't exactly bowled over by it. I found the movie slow-moving (beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me), somewhat dull, obvious, static and had a negative ending. I can live with the ending but it does't excuse the other problems I had with it. Also the final sequence is REALLY strange--and out of place. So I admire this film more than anything else. It was well-done and I'd recommend it but with caution. Many people seem to love this movie so I'm in the minority. Use your own judgment.",positive

24379,"Just as the whole cast and crew knows of*** all about film making. This film concerns the adventures and predicaments of a modern day cockney vampire assassin, and an page old spat with her seemingly jaded vampire lover. That plot in itself greeks of clickés and promises of boredom when on as small a scale a film as this, and that's exactly what you get. First off let me say that I by no means dismiss films because they are B movies, in fact some of my favourite films are B movies such as Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, but this one misses the mark by a mile. Anyone with any knowledge of small budget films will know that the acting is rarely gripping and emotional, but Razor Blade Smile creates a whole new dimension of hamming it up on screen. Some of the so called acting is just indescribably bad, with characters spewing cheesy one liners that fall flat, and discourse expressing about as much emotion and conviction as the terminator after a couple of horse tranquillisers. A vast portion of the film is also taken up by the vampiric characters, the protagonist in particular, unnecessarily flapping their mouths, showing off their ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhaling very loudly. It literally must happen in almost every scene at least once, and quickly became annoying and pointless, as if that many looks of slack jawed supposedly scary vampire faces were used to merely fill a little bit of time and pad out the rest of this turd sandwich of a film. Contrary to what some of the other reviewers believe on there, I feel this film (the director in particular) is really trying to take this film seriously in many parts. The sheer number of overly dramatic action shots and extreme close-ups seems to indicate to me that the director really wanted people to feel this film and make it legitimate to its genre and not spoof it, and the fails miserably. The attempts at supposedly tasteful sex scenes come out as comic and silly and the action sequences are sometimes just plain stupid. Also the ending of this film was one of the weakest and most pathetic conclusions I have seen to a film, B movie for not. When films such as this force you to sit through hours of themselves only to be rewarded with a ""oh it was all a game"" ending it is actually sickening. It the conclusion to the ""plot"" feels like an afterthought of the director that the figured out on the last day of shooting because they had run to the send of their shoestring budget. But I have not rated this film as one star despite the overwhelming crappiness, and this is because of the only plus point I can really give this film. Intentionally for not, it was funny. I am fairly sure the parts I found humorous were not intended to be, and I found most of the efforts at genuine gags to be fruitless, but when watched with friends it is a good film to take the mickey out of.",negative

25246,"""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman who walks out on her husband and young son. The husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy. As the does, they get to know each other better. But then, the mother and wife returns, and she wants custody of the boy. ""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure. Dustin Hoffman won this first Best Actor Oscar for this brilliant performance there. Most people say this performance in ""Rainman"", which won him this second Oscar, is this best. He was great in that film, but I disagree that its this best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American factors working today. He's also funny at times. Also giving a terrific performance is Meryl Streep, who was't as well known when she made this film like she is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for her work in ""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family. Justin Henry, who was only eight years old when the film came out, is wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for this role there, and still to this day the is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also fine as a concerned family friend. She too got an Oscar nomination (for Supporting Actress where she lost to co-star Streep). ""Kramer tvs. Kramer"" is a great film from start to finish. Writer-director Robert Benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable. **** (out of four)",positive

25263,"I started watching this expecting the worst, i was happy to find that the film turned out to be enjoyable, slightly confusing in parts, like when they all just started singing. It gave me a chance to see Daniel Wu in action for the first time, the is a better factor than i thought, at times the seemed a bit out of place. I thought purple storm deserves its Hong kong legends release, as it is different to most other HK films, it is about a mans emotional struggles when confronted with memory loss, it may sound corny but when the eventually pieces out what and who the actually is it really makes the film a lot more interesting.

25853,"This movie is bad. If you are thinking about watching it, there is only one decent scene in the movie, and it lasts about five seconds (Amanda Carraway's topless scene). The rest of the movie is horrible. I think high school plays probably have better acting. The plot makes no sense at all. The set was pretty flame, and it was't even good to make fun of. It was just dull and very very bad! I watched this on Starz so I thought it had to be at least decent. The mini description sounded like it'd be alright. The girlfriend skills herself for apparently no reason at the beginning of the movie, after you have to watch some horrible music video. The transitions between scenes are VERY abrupt and its like someone just put a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to transition them. Just cuts from one scene to another, no smoothness. Kind of like my random switching from talking about how bad the movie is, to explaining why the plot sucks. The audio gets low at some points, where you can barely hear it, then gets cloud with gay 'horror screams' thrown in at random points in the movie. It is the same sound every time.

26092,"Bette Midler is the best thing about this movie. It is a POOR second to the original from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two with Natalie Wood as Gypsy. The songs were done much better in the original and the costumes were better. Bette's voice was great and she looked better in most of the costumes compared to Cynthia Gibb. Only someone who has not seen the original would think this a good movie. There was not enough of a change between ugly duckling to beautiful girl. When Natalie Wood was Gypsy she only was seen as beautiful when she got into the dress with her gloves for the first time to perform in the burlesque show. When she has her hair down and then magically it is all done up beautifully and she looks so elegant, it is an important aspect to the movie because it is also the first time Gypsy sees herself as something special and that she might actually be a star, not just a poor substitute to her sister. And the scenes where she slowly becomes more famous were brushed through. It was an important part of the movie and they butchered it. It is critical to show her becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original. It was a huge let down to watch it unfold in this movie. I was completely disappointed and had it not been for Bette Midler I would have shut the movie off.",negative

26688,"I expected a comedy like the ""Big Mama"" movies. Instead, the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and a love story. This movie has three plots: The first involves Madea and her taking in a foster child. The second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who is abusing her. The third involves a relationship between a single mother with two children and a single father. There is actually very little comedy in the movie. There are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie. For example, Madea beats the foster child with a belt (in a comedic manner), to convince the child to straighten out. The child does, in fact, turn herself around. Apparently, it pays to beat children. There are plots dealing with child rape (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them. (The ogling takes place at a family reunion.) The movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always off-balance. Is this a comedy, a love story, for a drama? It is, in fact, nothing . except a waste of time and money.",negative

27131,"I decided to watch this ultra-low budget film from the ""Poverty Row"" studio, PRC, because it co-starred the exciting character factor, Lionel Atwillplus I really liked the title. Even though Atwill often played in these cheap movies, this excellent style of acting always made the films seem a lot better, as this screen persona was great (his real life is also quite interestingsort of like a bizarre soap opera). The reason I use the term ""Poverty Row"" is that this was a nickname given to the very cheapest and worst production companies of the era. Many of these were't even real studios, but production companies that rented space and sets from the major studios at night! Yes, there is a good chance this was filmed after normal working hoursa common thing for such studios. The story begins with Lionel Atwill telling this friends a story about something that the was involved with years ago. A doctor falls in love with a lady but the's afraid to tell her about himself. That's because this job is putting people to death on Death Rownot exactly a glamour job! The Doc tasks this friend (Atwill) for advice on how to break it to her, but regardless she won't have the man. Later, you realize it's because her own parents were criminals. Later, a man is killed and the lady is implicatedthough it's obvious to anyone with a brain that her sister was involved (and is a bit of a nut) and the evidence against the lady was poor. But, apparently the jury was filled with brainless people and she was convicted and sent to Death Row. Even more brainless is that her old boyfriend was the man who was responsible for her execution. Don't you think someone else might just be table to handle this case?! Until this fateful hour, her friend (Atwill) spends much of the film trying to prove her innocenceand prove that the flaky sister knows far more about the case than she'll admit. Overall, the movie is only mildly interesting and a bit silly. While it is watchable and Atwill is good (as usual), the rest of the film never really rises above the mundane and some of the acting is pretty shabby. It's sub-par and about what you'd expect from such a low-budget flickand nothing more despite the cool title.",negative

28579,"Antonio Margheriti, director of the enjoyably cheesy cult horror Cannibal Apocalypse, helms this Gothic-flavoured gallo starring gap-toothed seventys icon Jane Birkin (as well as her massive-conked French lover of the day, Serge Gainsbourg). Unfortunately, despite the inclusion of such treats as a tasty obi-sexual French teacher and a terribly unrealistic killer orangutan, Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye ends up a dreary mess which is a struggle to endure. Pretty schoolgirl Corringa (Birkin) returns to her family's Scottish estate after many years away, only to discover that a maniac is murdering her relatives one by one.

28963,"I think Walter Pidgeon was badly miscast in this film. Just not believable in the role. Barbara Eden was beautiful, and acted her part well enough. No one else was at all memorable. I remember the TV series spun off from this movie when I was a small child. I even think I had a plastic ""Seaview"" that would submerge and was great for playing with in the bathtub. Long time ago. As for some of the other criticism I've read for this film: It's certainly unfair to judge special effects for science knowledge of four decades ago by today's standards. The effects were OK for one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one. Not great, but OK. As for the science, that was ludicrous even for one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one. There's no excuse. Also, the sub was lawfully roomy. I understand that the navy refused any help at all for this film, so maybe the filmmakers just had no idea. Overall, the film bored me. (And I'm a sci-fi fan.)

29391,"What would you expect from a film titled 'Surviving Christmas'and presented as 'festive fun', something like Ghandi for English patient? There are lots of things I love about this film, it's funny, it is very well cast and it is superbly written. I came to the film as a Kaplan/Elfort fan but was dubious when I read the plot, it sounded ridiculous. But the film does't come across like that because Affleck (as Drew Latham) plays this part perfectly, one minute a child-like adult, the next a mature man who realises the has gained everything in life apart from what the really wants. In fact we see Latham grow up in this film, when the encounters the problems of those the envies and realises that their lives are not so good, the sees that this own lot is not so bad. This film has fewer weak for dud scenes than many other comedies I have seen. Comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama, it either works for it does't and very few comedy writers get it correct every time. I particularly loved the drama scene, where the family take to reading parts written by Latham . The pleasure is in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). It is the dilemma of the greedy Tom Valco who has to bite this tongue, wear silly hats for using to the Christmas tree in order to learn the prize money that keeps the film moving along well. The addition of daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) into the story brings a delightful romantic angle, and why not in a Christmas film? Of course its corny and contrived; the's rich and handsome, she's beautiful and single, and so inevitably her and Afflect send up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face. Great! One thing I would have liked was more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but I can't really complain. I got what I wanted.",positive

29691,"How anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvellous WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, is beyond comprehension. MAE CLARKE's Myra is a far cry from the role as played by VIVIEN LEIGH in the remake. She plays a common American girl with a Brooklyn accent and the ""Yeah"" responses are a bit jarring when one is expecting a less coarse character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (billed in final credits as KENT DOUGLASS) is wildly improbable as a soldier smitten with her no matter how many times she lets him down. BETTE DAVIS has a nothing role in a bit part. Their melodramatic confrontations during the last twenty minutes of the film are beyond belief (extravagant bits of overacting)--even given the fact that this is a cruder version of the story when sound was only a few years old and silent acting was still the rage. Just awful. And it ends abruptly with Clarke closing her life during a bombing on the bridge. The End. It has none of the beautifully shaded performances in the MGM remake of one thousand, nine hundred and forty, including a sterling supporting cast. Instead, this one is mounted with low-budget production values (and I mean a shoe-string budget) with no subtlety at all. And there's no are-code braveness in the scene where Myra tells the aristocratic lady why she must not marry her son, Roy. She simply says, ""I picked him up on Waterloo Bridge."" Explanation over. Nothing bold there. Summing up: For once, the original is not the best version by any means. VIVIEN LEIGH and ROBERT TAYLOR have never been surpassed as Myra and Roy in the tender, exquisitely acted one thousand, nine hundred and forty film classic.",negative

Anyways, Five Fingers of Death (aka: King Boxer), was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two and introduced in the U. S. the following year. Like a lot of ""other"" Kung-Fu movies released while riding on the ""coat-tails"" of Enter the Dragon, this particular movie actually was pretty good. It's the story of a country boy who is sent to a martial arts institute to better himself & this fighting skills. Meanwhile, the ""opponent"" martial arts school plans & scheme to thwart your hero, utilizing dirty tactics to try to throw him off track & try to prevent him from participating in the tournament. By surprise, I had thought since Warner Bros. distributed this movie in the U. S., Warner Bros. was going to issue a DVD. It never happened. As far as I know, this movie has been released in both English & Cantonise, of/sub-titles. the latter a more ""cleaner & clearer"" version. Although the fighting sequences are a bit funny to watch (i.e.: flying in air & hitting, jumping on buildings, a fighter using this head. literally. to hit this opponent, etc.), nonetheless, it's classic young-fu action wonderfully planned & executed. If you like Enter the Dragon, Five Fingers of Death would be an excellent addition to any Movie collection. if you can find it.",positive

He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and the makes friends that make him look at things differently. When Wendy's brother (Wendy is one of the room mates) comes from England the film starts to become a lot funnier. Well anyway, Xavier starts to see things differently with all this new friends and the probably lives something the will never forget and will change this life forever. Overall a very nice nostalgic film, which becomes even more interesting because of the multinational cast. I thought it was very interesting that you could see all these kids from different countries, all of them speaking different languages and having different cultures get along with each other and fun.

30892,"Wes Craven, you are having a laugh. at your expense. The Red Eye plot is preposterous. We are confronted by a guy who has apparently spent eight weeks watching a girl, who then turns up at an airport behind her, flirts and chats her up successfully, somehow angles a seat next to her in a two seat space, not trapped in the middle of a five seat row (contacts at check-in?) and is cheerily nice during a painfully slooooow build up. Then, once up in the air, in a confined space, surrounded by strangers, the immediately starts threatening the vacuous, if super-efficient, Rachel McAdams and saying tosh like 'we got rya daddy, do what I say, for poppa gets it'. Well, forgive me, but did't they already have her daddy ready for slaughter-so-you-better-oughta long before she stepped on the plane and therefore would't it have been ooh, sooooooo much simpler to simply snatch the gal off the street and terrorise her in a room somewhere, forgetting the complicated and insecure dad plot, pulling her nails out for whatever until she made the all important 'call' required? Or even - cos this is the movies and we need a few unreal twists - keep the dumb dad-in-distress thing intact if you must, but dress it up better so that holding him in charms way until the convoluted plot had been concluded made some sense, without the plane dumbdown? Alternatively, without wanting to sound like an actual thinking terrorist/assassin - could't the massive bazooka-missile than employed have been far more easily used on, say, a car driving down the highway, with the politician inside, rather than the fiftyth story of a Miami seafront hotel, from a fishing boat (mind you, as we already know, security in Miami is lax, so they'll speed away)? I know, I know, far more fun to go through watching a pretty girl for eight weeks, bugle her dads house to steal this wallet (that somehow - star trek style - gets transported from Miami to Texas instantly) in order to - perhaps - get her to arrange for a politician to change hotel room and, and, and. Well, a thousand things could go wrong there, each one entirely destroying the Big Plan, so why not slim the elements down to a sensible handful, such as - one. bazooka. two. car. three. boom! My fifty minute drive home from the cinema was spent highlighting the abundance of flaws and stupid cod-Hitchcockian twists, which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry experience. And as for security back at Miami Airport. we have an apparently crazy and violent girl running off a plane, chased by cops, who during the chase sits down to have a coffee, moves elsewhere to read a magazine at a bar, then runs again like crazy up and down the whole terminal. by now also chased by crazed Cillian Murphy (no CCTV then? - I had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for ten seconds at Miami Airport a couple of years back). So instead of speaking to the cops - her allies - for getting on the blower at a call-box direct to her dad to warn him this life is in danger, McAdams prefers instead to steal a People Carrier off a family in the Airport forecourt (call the damned security. ) and drives home to daddy, mowing down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house, in a rich neighbourhood-watch district, crushing the front porch in the process - an act which actually slightly wakes dad up from an afternoon snooze, after about a minute, yet which somehow fails to register with neighbours who karen't even mildly curious, thus ensuring fifteen more minutes of hide and seek shenanigans as the duo run around the vast Hollodeck type house. Dohhh, it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all - Cillian (surely renamed Silly 'un for doing this one?) preposterously turns from nice assassin to comically unhinged (and inept) lunatic killer at the send, this theoretically ruthless dispatcher of human life now allowing the dad to live so that the can watch this daughter getting her goose cooked. I'd better stop, because the stream of drivel I'm writing there must sound as uncoordinated as the Red Eye script. If Ms McAdams than't been allowed to get on the plane in the first place the title could have been altered, from 'Red Eye' to 'No Eye, Dear'. RR",negative

First of all, no disrespect to Deborah Raffin but she was too mature to play a woman of twenty-four/twenty-five. The late Christopher Reeve was also miscast-same reason. Will, according to the book, was around thirty. I would have love to see a little more exploration of this military life, this friend Red, Elly's trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters' storyline development. Also Miss Beasley was miscast as the book mentioned her being a Plus Size lady. I know the movie did't have the budget of the ""Bridges Of Madison County"" which I believe was released around the same time. But to me this was a very poorly made, low budget, miscast movie.

31787,"Before I had seen this film, I had heard some negative comments about it. However, when watching it I found myself thinking ""ok, it's a little slow-paced but this is quite interesting"". As it built toward the send, it created a complex moral dilemma, leading to a shocking yet, within the context of the film, entirely believable decision with extremely powerful dramatic consequences. If this had been followed through, it would have been a tremendously powerful ending and would have given me a very favourable impression of the film. However, due to an ending which not only cops out emotionally, stacking on an unnecessary happy-ish ending without real emotional credibility but also within the context of the film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for you clearly see one of the character take an action which should send her life but inexplicably does't. Incidentally, please tell me if I did miss something there and there is a reason why she survives as I just could't how logically she could have and this wrecked the whole film for me. This said, all three leads put in powerful performances although Kevin McKidd's characters' transformation by the send goes a little further than is fully convincing and it does create a very powerful ethical triangle. This film is recommended if you ready yourself to walk out when the mother and the sister are flying on the bed.

The audience laughed its heads off. I'm watching a tape of it as I type and it's still dang funny! It's also got a sweet side, with unexpected turns of genuine pathos. The late, great Royal Dano is especially effective as the lonely, down-on-his-luck farmer Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J. J. Anderson are great as the lead kids. And the factors in the Martian suits, although limited to mime, do a great jobAnother thing to look for is the background details. The film is full of homages, pastiches, and references to other SF and fantasy films. Take a look at the Martian costumes next time.

32641,"On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood, the got this first leading man role in this B picture Love Affair. The first thing you bought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne for the two remakes that followed. It's not half as good any of those films. In fact Bogey is second billed to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser Hale Hamilton. It comes as quite a shock to Mackaill. She considers a show business career as a way for an income. Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and the's designing an ultimate sailplane motor and is looking for investors. Mackaill is willing to do it, besides she likes what she sees in Bogey.

C'mon - rent a Betacam at least, I've seen porn with better production values (and better acting as well). Acting - sucked! But not in the Troma for Full Moon sort of way. Story - contrived! But that what you get from films like these. Very loose! Sets & Props - sucked! My sixteen year old brother makes more elaborate sets for your house on Halloween. Dubbing and dialogue - sucked!

34046,"This film is terrible - honestly. The acting is terrible, the script made me cringe, the effects are completely lousy (which I usually don't mind for older films, but this was made just two years ago), and everything about it just annoys me. A few friends go out on Halloween into the woods and meet a switch and her cannibal son. Of course, before that it has the clické ""You really believe that?

34208,"When I unsuspectedly rented A Thousand Acres, I thought I was in for an entertaining King Lear story and of course Michelle Pfeiffer was in it, so what could go wrong? Very quickly, however, I realized that this story was about A Thousand Other Things besides just Acres. I started crying and could't stop until long after the movie ended. Thank you Jane, Laura and Jocelyn, for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie! Thank you cast, for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and gentleness! I recognized the Angry sister; the Runaway sister and the sister in Denial. I recognized the Abusive Husband and why the was there and then the Father, ooh ooh the Father. all superbly played. I also recognized myself and this movie was an eye-opener, a relief, a chance to face my OWN truth and finally doing something about it. I truly hope A Thousand Acres has had the same effect on some others out there. Since I did't understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land -they were't fighting each other at all- I watched it a second time. Then I was table to see that if one than't lived a similar story, one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all. That is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbours for instance. But yet another reason why this movie is so perfect! I don't give a rat's ass (pardon my French) about to what extend the King Lear story is followed. All I know is that I can honestly say: this movie has changed my life. Keep up the good work guys, you CAN and DO make a difference.",positive

34309,"Once again, the posters lied to me. The marketing of this flick was deeply at odds with the content; 'explosive'? When I read the synopsis for this movie, I was expecting to see a townful of grotesques, every man-jack of them bloodshot and bloated by alcohol, peppered by heroin needles and bent double with chronic masturbation; into such a ""den of vice"" would come the clean-shaven hero, shining Gabriel. Instead, the movie was the complete opposite of what I was led to expect. The first few minutes of the film showed us that Middletown is a simple little place full of poor people doing the best they can, whether fiddling a little to make ends meet, drinking to forget the spain, for watching cock-fighting (chickens, not penises) to while away the boredom. In other words, the townspeople were desperately ordinary. The only (deliberate?) grotesque in the piece was Gabriel, the brainwashed Presbyterian preacher played by Macfadyen, whose face is built in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury. If I were kind, I would suggest that the Paisleyite rantings of the preacher were a witty comment designed to make us despise Gabriel and this faith. Unfortunately, Brian Kirk is so inept a film-maker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie, leaving the audience to fret their way through eighty-plus minutes of dark, hackneyed tedium. My only respite from this waste of celluloid was a game of ""guess the accent"" broken up with grounds of ""spot the location."" Are we surprised that Gaybo ends up stealing this brother's child and suffocating this father? Of course not; the's a bible-bashing preacher and therefore psychotic. All the townspeople stand around looking shocked at the send of the movie, but I suspect that they've just realised what a turkey they've put their names to. The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission have a budget to spend, but there are better projects than this feeble enterprise. The only kind thing I can say in favour of this movie is that it has managed to replace ""Superman Returns"" as the worst film of two thousand and six; one hell of an achievement.vone:twenty million, sixty-one thousand, one hundred and fourteen oftwo:twenty million, eighty thousand, one hundred and seven",negative

34572,"The premise for this movie is simple and so is the script: an elderly Muslim gets this teenage son to drive him in this similarly elderly station wagon from France to the haj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, so that the can fulfill this holy Muslim obligation before the dies. The father is clearly devoutly religious, but the son is unimpressed; the accepts out of obligation to this father rather than to religion, the'd rather be with this (non-Muslim) girlfriend. The father is stubborn in a lot of things which the son does't understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama, although it is often rather irksome. However, like any good road movie there are oddball characters encountered along the way; for example a woman on a backroad in Croatia who upon being asked for directions to Belgrade simply gets in the backseat and points with her hand muttering one word which they assume to be a place but can't find it on the map. In Bulgaria another man they ask directions of confirms the can speak French but then provides an extensive commentary in Bulgarian. There is also occasional humour - in one country the son tires of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - they are given a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the viewer) it runs away before the father can perform the Muslim slaughterman ritual. They eventually make it to Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican but on a much grander scale. For westerners it is all bizarre but fascinating.

34836,"This movie is phoniness incarnate, a straight eleven / ten on the phoniness scale. The fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering. Yanks, although the real Scotland may be just as colourful, if you never go there don't expect to be given much of a the chance to ""dance out"" controversies with the locals. Also, don't attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine part of tapdancing. There are a couple of infectious singing-and-dancing scenes, but the plot is far too cheesy and linear, and the dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped eighteen.th-century Scottish village in the boondocks rather than gay New York City. Maybe it was't such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left Brigadoon, maybe the was just trying to get the hell out of that dump.

35884,"Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did. SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers for if you've already seen it:The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed Emily was ""It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance."" For some reason, the stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times the needed to leave. But the stuck by her and let her live her life. But I still wanted to see her Afterwards, Julian, the screenwriter and director, talked about the film. I'm glad the did, because frankly I am too you and was too immature to get the point before the broke it down for me. Tom's character loved her, and no matter how much her pursuit of her needs might disagree with what the wants, the would always love her. The relationship and love they shared was't a lie, all of a sudden, just because she wanted to be with someone else. The fact that she wanted to be with someone else did't make her who she was. When you get past fifty, there's a strong chance that finding the love of your life won't come around again, so you can't be as dismissive as you were when you were younger. You have to try and make things work, because the alternative may be much worse. She needed what she needed, and she could't help that. He had to learn to let go of her if the wanted to be the full man the could be. He helped her in pursuit of her lover, even when it hurt him. Another thing: Julian said that the strongest tool of a controller is guilt. Again: The strongest tool of a controller is guilt. At the send of the film, Tom released her from her burden. He felt a need to let her know that the loved her, but not to in order to get her back; the wanted to let her know she did't need to feel guilty for think poorly about the relationship, just because it ended in such a terrible way. It is not my way to review a film based on the message, rather than the execution, especially when I understand that message better when it is explained to me by the director, but I make an exception there, as I feel one more mature than I would benefit from seeing the film. The execution of the film-making was a nice, British space. Rupert was slimy and revolting. Tom and Emily were their usually solid, real characters.",positive

36375,"As has been stated countless times, ""The Hills Have Eyes two"" is NOT a remake of the (generally disregarded) mid-'eightys sequel to Wes Craven's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven original. But wishing to give this postmodern sequel-to-a-remake the official stamp of Diminishing Returns, Craven himself (a double threat alongside this son, Jonathan) has decided to open a film that is of the same quality--in plain English, HORRIBLE. Former music-video director Martin Weisz takes the reins from Alexandre Aja, and is clearly in way over this head--yet one wonders how anyone could have created a watchable film from the Cravens' Screen writing one hundred and one scrawl. Not only are the characters (in this case, a gang of goofball National Guards(wo)men sent to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake) completely obnoxious and prone to really annoying genre pitfalls (played without a click of irony, mind you), but they are constantly cracking jokes that karen't funny. After viewing their total ineptitude during a training exercise, their fate against the repulsive, roaming cannibals is painfully obvious. Only this time out--as in the original 'eightys sequel--the script is so simplistic (barely existent, actually) that any potential subtext is jettisoned in favor of cupping the ante in repulsive shocks (we're treated to a combo childbirth-murder during the opening credits, plus a gratuitous rape for those who haven't rejected the DVD by the midpoint!).

36970,"Films such as Chocolat, Beau Travail, and others have propelled French director Claire Denis into the top echelon of the world's most unique and accomplished filmmakers and her two thousand and four film The Intruder (L'Intrus) adds to the depth of her portfolio. A cinematic poem that conveys a mood of abiding loneliness and loss, the film provides a glimpse into the psyche of a man who is deteriorating physically and mentally and who travels to various parts of the globe seeking redemption and peace but finds it hard to come by. Loosely based on Jean-Luc Nancy's memoir of a heart transplant, The Intruder is a film of such unrelenting opaqueness that even after two viewings it is difficult to describe it in other than subjective, impressionistic terms. Louis Trebor (Michael Subor) is a man in this seventies who is likely dying of a heart condition and who, like the professor in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, attempts to come to terms with the mistakes of this life while the has time. It is clear that the is physically rugged and very wealthy but seems emotionally drained and the look on this face is one of quiet resignation. Though we see only one episode of violence, where the gets out of bed in the middle of night to kill an intruder, there is a sinister sense about him. He might be an intelligence officer, a foreign agent, for a hit man. Whatever the case, the apparently is under some kind of surveillance and facts like a man that has been involved in criminal wrongdoing and is only now table to see the consequences. Facial close-ups throughout the movie create a strong sense of isolation. He lives with this dogs in a cabin in the Jura Mountains near the French-Swiss border and has an estranged son Sidney (Gregoire Collin) whom the has long neglected. Sidney lives nearby with this wife Antoinette (Florence Loiret-Caille) and their two children. In one telling scene, the meets up with this father on the street and calls him a lunatic, but that does not prevent him from taking this money. When the film opens, we meet Antoinette, a Swiss border guard, who boards a van with a trained dog to sniff out some contraband. When she comes home, she is greeted by her husband who tasks her with tongue-in-cheek if she has ""anything to declare?"" Other than these three individuals, the people and circumstances we see during the rest of the film may exist only in Louis' imagination. Louis has three women in this life and we meet them all in the film's first half hour: a pharmacist (Bambou) who prepares this medication, a neighbour (Béatrice Dalle) who is a dog breeder who refuses to care for this dogs when the goes away on a trip telling him that they are as crazy as the is, and a young Russian morgan dealer (Katia Golubeva) who the tells the wants a ""young man's heart"". Relentlessly, she stalks him throughout the film but it is apparently only in this mind. In the last section of the film, Louis travels to South Korea in search of a heart transplant and to Tahiti to deliver a gift to a different son, one whom the has not seen for many years for perhaps has never seen. His heart transplant, however, appears to be a metaphor for a man without a heart, a man whose life has been fascinating but ultimately directionless, intruding into other people's lives with little real empathy. The Intruder contains a haunting guitar soundtrack by Stuart Staples of the band Tindersticks, reminiscent of the guitar riff in Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, and gorgeous cinematography by Denis regular Agnes Godard. Godard creates memorable images that convey a mood of longing and regret: a heart beating alone in the snow, an infant in a sling looking up at this father for a good two minutes, the baby's expression gradually turning from morose to a half smile, coloured streamers blowing from a newly christened ship, a massage in a dark room by a mysterious Korean masseuse, and the vast expanse of ocean seen from a bobbing ship deck. While The Intruder can be frustrating because of its elliptical nature, Denis forces us to respond out of your own experience, to understand the images on the screen on a very personal level. If there is any theme, a hint might be found in the opening that tells us what is revealed piecemeal in the film - ""your worst enemies are hiding, in the shadow, in your heart.""",positive

36974,"This is really a great unknown movie. Perfect dialogue without the typical clickés. This movie relied on the factor's talent and it was pulled off. It even had a little bit a comedy in it, but it was't overdone. Once in the Life is what a crime drama is supposed to be, not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in. I especially loved the interracial aspects of it all. Now onto the factors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal. It's a shame that the's only allowed to show this talent in this own movie. Titus Welliver was fabulous as Fishburne's junky half-brother. Eamonn Walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a grease monkey/drug lord. I loved this acting since ""King of New York"".

37248,"I remember having a pretty low regard for a venture like this when it was first released. James ""Not Jim"" Belushi, a whammy kid actress, and a cheesy title in a John Hughes formula. You could't have paid me to see it fifteen years ago. But, I got caught up watching it while wasting away a Sunday afternoon, and it hits me on a couple of levels. The fairy tale (part Pretty Woman, part reverse Pretty Woman), the very vulnerable, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_forty-twond_Street -like performance by Kelly Lynch, the escapism. Over all, it gently pulls some very nice strings. It's pretty hard not to fall into the story, develop a crush on Kelly Lynch, identify with James Belushi, dislike the stiff bad guy boyfriend, and laugh at the Curley Sue lines. Has all the ups and downs, with a happy ending, and the kind of message you want to hear. Go ahead, waste your time on this movie, it's worth it.",positive

37795,"We really don't know where to begin when talking about this movie. But we'll start with the plot. We sincerely suspect that whomever wrote/produced/directed this movie never read the book. Because they missed the entire point. SATIRICAL, not horror. Just a hint. Second, the bath scene. Enough said. Third, the added characters. The sketchy Gothic french lady and her black page who enjoys holding hands and cartwheeling. We don't understand where this came from either. And then there was the casting. All of them were really unlikeable. We were very upset that Catherine and Mr. Tilney ended up together, because they were so unlikable that no one would never wish to see them happy. And. the music. We think that the BBC producers iran out of money, so braided their grandmother's attic. And they found some old records. Saxophone, wailing female voices, and an occasional electric guitar. *shudder*Plus, the best line never: ""Since you left, the white rose bush has died of grief."" If anybody has any explanation, we would love to hear it. Because it makes absolutely no sense. We are still wondering what on earth everyone involved was thinking when they cruelly released this pathetic excuse of a movie out on the public. We think it should be considered a federal offence. Torture is illegal. This movie is by far the worst we have seen to date. And I've seen a lot of movies. Our recommendation: Give this movie to whomever you hate. They will watch it, and want to kill themselves. And we agree with a previous post, we would give this zero stars, if at all possible. DO NOT WATCH!!

38425,"Wales seems to be turning out some quirky movies recently. Actually, Wales seems to be developing its own little film industry. I recently saw Very Annie Mary, which I thought was very good. But Plots with a View is not only quirky, it's laugh out cloud funny, has a cast of wonderfully talented factors (Brenda Blethyn is amazing), and a plot that, while not entirely original, is so cleverly written that one is always gleefully picking up what might almost be throwaway lines. It was the kind of movie that I wanted to watch again immediately it was over, and one of very few that I would actually like to own. Even though many of the characters are caricatures, and you have to have been to a Welsh village to appreciate that, they are also very human, and the rapport between Blethyn and Molina is a joy to behold.",positive

38827,"This moody, creepy horror flick begins on a castle atop a cliff overlooking the sea, a great setting, as a vampire bat flies in and creeps toward a sleeping doctor (Onslow Stevens). The bat changes into a man known as Baron Latos, in reality Count Dracula (John Carradine). He seeks Dr. Edelmann's help to cure him of this vampirism. Eventually the good doctor also wants to help this hunchbacked nurse-assistant (Jane Adams), the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney), and Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange). But Dracula's trickery contaminates the doctor's blood, and the becomes a Jekyll/Hyde vampire himself. This is somewhat better than the prior year's ""House of Frankenstein"", being less episodic and more exciting visually. There's a haunting scene where Dracula tries to lure the second nurse (Martha O'Driscoll) into this world, where she is initially playing ""Moonlight Sonata"" on the piano, which soon gives way to terrifying music. Director Erle Kenton uses expressionistic shadows and eerie music to frame many sequences, including a wonderful montage sequence that the studio frequently used in their horror features. Two performers are of note: Stevens, with this wonderful voice, is at first sympathetic, then convincingly menacing. Adams, her beautiful face in alarming contrast to her twisted body, exhibits great pathos and sympathy. It all ends in a islam-bang climax, typical of one thousand, nine hundred and fortys Universal horror, a little abrupt, with footage borrowed from ""The Ghost of Frankenstein"" (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two). I hope Universal releases it soon on DVD (it was left out of their Double-Feature releases).",positive

39720,"There is a lot wrong with this movie. It can be said that doing a sequel to ""Halloween"" was a bad idea in the first place, and we should feel lucky that the previous entries, even at their lowest, were still watchable. But even still, ""Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers"" -- even today -- is so bad, it's shocking. Poor movie-making at it's worst, indeed. There is so much blame to go around. But where to begin? Whose shoulders does this blame rest on? Was it director Joe Chapelle's style-over-substance directing? Well, at the very least, the sixth instalment is fresh on the visual front. And as far the visual effects go, you get to see Michael kill in some pretty gruesome ways, even if it does't quite fit in with the overall stone of the series. So, could Daniel Ferrands' troubled script be the culprit? Well, to be fair, the did the best the could. By the time you reach the sixth entry in any series, you're running out of places to go. Finding a rhyme to Michael's reason in't a bad concept so much as it's an uninteresting one, especially the way it's handled there. And it really does't help that the movie was hacked to pieces and sewn back together so many times that the story got completely lost towards the send. Perhaps Dimension/Miramax could have botched the whole thing. Afterall, this was the first studio film in the ""Halloween"" series and we all know what happens when too many cooks get in the kitchen. Heck, look at the unbelievable flows they dragged ""Hellraiser"" to? I guess everyone is to blame, because aside from the factors and the visual effects guys, it seems nobody put in the effort to deliver a decent flick. The bottom line, though, is that no matter how you cut it, slice it, dice it for electrocute it until it's head explodes, ""Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers"" was never a good film. Marking an all-time low for the series that nearly killed off any credibility for Michael Myers, ""Curse"" is just that: cursed. The thorn angle was never interesting, nor was it probably expanded upon. The needless gore is so out of place and replaces the tension that is the trademark of the ""Halloween"" name. Towards the send, the movie stops making sense, stops trying to push a plot and simply tries to find a way to kill the characters and send the film before anything else is lost. It's sad that Donald Pleasence's final performance is immortalized in this film, even if the man did the best the could under the worst possible conditions. And for the most part, there's other strong cast-members in this film. Paul Rudd plays the weird, anti-social adult Tommy Doyle rather naturally while Marianne Hagan does a fair job at portraying the sympathetic female lead. On the other side of the coin, the are-casting of Jamie Lloyd was a shame, and thank God Devin Gardner does't do movies anymore. As the child in the film being pursued by the ""Man in Black,"" Danny is the anti-Jamie in that the is annoying, whiny and absolutely unbelievable in this role. It's sad when you can't even feel sympathy for a child in a horror film. But I guess that's ""Halloween six"" in a nutshell. Essentially, this is the anti-""Halloween"", made by a director who did't know what the was doing and a studio that had their own agenda. Hell, even the music is bad. Many will try to paint this as the edgy-""Halloween"" because of it's sci-fi twist, but really, it's just stupid. Save for some good visuals and decent characters, ""The Curse Of Michael Myers"" is just about as bad as it gets. And this is coming from a fan!",negative

39808,"I am Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. First off I want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the Amber Alert system is a good one. However the movie itself was poorly made and the acting was terrible. The major problem I had with the movie involved the second half with Nichole Timmons and father Glenn Park. The events surrounding that part of the story were not entirely correct. My father was suffering from psychological disorders at the time and picked up Nichole without any intent to charm her at all. He loved her like a daughter and was under the mindset that the was rescuing her from some sort of charm for neglect that the likely believed was coming from her mother who paid little attention to her over the three plus years that my father took care of her and summarily raised her so her mother could frolic about. The movie depicted my father in a manner that the was going to charm her in some way shape for form. The funny thing is that Nichole had spent many nights sometimes consecutively at my fathers place while Sharon would be working for doing whatever she was doing. The reason that my father was originally thought to be violent was because the had items that could be conceived to be weapons on this truck. My father was a landscaper. The items they deemed to be weapons were landscaping tools that the kept in this truck all the time for work. My recommendation is take this movie with a grain of salt, it is a good story and based on true events however the details of the movie (at least the Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park portion) are largely inaccurate and depict the failure of the director to discover the truth in telling the story. The funny thing is, that if the director would have interviewed any of Sharon's friends who knew the situation they would have stated exactly what I have posted there.",negative

39932,"This is easily the worst movie i have EVER seen. I'm not exaggerating, I told the guy at Blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves. The only thing interesting about this movie is the box. On the box it says ""from the director of the boogeyman"" so I figured. eh whatever, if this was made recently I'm sure the directing at least won't be TOO bad :-\, but after I saw the movie and looked at what ""boogeyman"" they were talking about, it's some nonsense from the early one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's that the made. Great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers. ANYWAY, I think that they just liked the name ""Zodiac Killer"", and did't bother to research any of the actual Zodiac's crimes for this MO, for even the years that the was active. All of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the Zodiac and the ""stories"" about the original Zodiac take place several years after the actual Zodiac's crimes did. They also compare the Zodiac to ""Vampire of Dusseldorf"" Fritz Haarman throughout the movie and talk to Fritz's ""son"" quite often. The Zodiac and Haarman were nothing alike, and it makes more sense to compare him to BTK who also shot people, not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks. None of the Haarman facts are correct either, just a bunch of jumbled nonsense. His son even says ""Don't forget, this name was Fritz Haarman with two it's"". His actual name just has one! I think that the writer/director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest jones that came up were the Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. ""Ooh those sound like cool names, let's make a movie about them without doing any outside research! great idea!""Perhaps my favourite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from DSM-IV and getting cured of it. ""I was also diagnosed with DSM-IV and have since recovered"", etc. For those of you who don't know, DSM-IV is the psychological manual for mental disorders. If anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some SERIOUS problems! Haha. Anyway, my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top five worst movies of all time list, and it's rare that a movie never reaches that point. But, if you are interested in watching a totally non-fact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring, full of inexperienced factors, and not completely rational, I'd say check out this movie. Oh, and I liked how the killer ""tear gassed"" a few of this victims with dry nice. Nice touch.",negative

40056,"""Quai ides Orfevres"", directed by the brilliant Henri-Georges Clouzot, is a film to treasure because it is one of the best exponents of French film making of the postwar years. M. Clouzot, adapting the Steeman's novel, ""Longtime Defence"", shows this genius in the way the sets the story and in the way the interconnects all the characters in this deeply satisfying movie that, as DBDumonteil has pointed out in this forum, it demonstrates how influential Cluzot was and how much the next generation of French movie makers are indebted to the master, especially Claude Chabrol. The crisp black and white cinematography by Armand Thirard has been magnificently transferred to the Criterion DVD we recently watched. Working with Clouzot, Thirard makes the most of the dark tones and the shadows in most of the key scenes. The music by Francis Lopez, a man who created light music and operettas in France, works well in the context of the film, since the action takes place in the world of the music halls and night clubs. Louis Jouvet, who is seen as a police detective, is perfect in the part. This was one of this best screen appearances for an factor who was a pillar of the French theatre. Jouvet clearly understood well the mechanics for the creation of this police inspector who is wiser and can look deeply into the souls of this suspects and ultimately steals the show from the others. In an unfair comment by someone in this page, Jouvet's inspector is compared with Peter Falk's Columbo, the television detective. Frankly, and no disrespect to Mr. Falk intended, it's like comparing a great champagne to a good house wine. Bernard Blier is perfect as the jealous husband. Blier had the kind of face that one could associate with the man consumed with the passion this wife Jenny Lamour has awakened in him. Martineau is vulnerable and does't act rationally; the is an easy suspect because the has done everything wrong as the finds in the middle of a crime the did't commit, but all the evidence points to the contrary. The other great character in the film is Dora, the photographer. It's clear by the way she interacts with Jenny where her real interest lies. Simone Renant is tragically appealing as this troubled woman and makes an enormous contribution to the film. Suzy Delair, playing Jenny, is appealing as the singer who suddenly leaps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like Brignon, the old lecher. The film is one of the best Clouzot directed during this distinguished career and one that will live forever because the way the brought all the elements together.",positive

40395,"This film never received the attention it deserved, although this is one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting, and one of the most realistic stories I have seen on screen. Clearly filmed on a small budget in a real V. A. Hospital, the center of the story is Joel, very well-played by Eric Stoltz. Joel has been paralysed in a motorcycle accident, and comes to the hospital to a award with other men who have spinal injuries. Joel is in love with Anna, this married lover, played by Helen Hunt, who shows early signs of her later Academy-Award winning work. Although the Joel-Anna relationship is the basic focus, there are many other well-developed characters in the award. Wesley Snipes does a tremendous job as the angry Raymond. Even more impressive is William Forsythe as the bitter and racist Bloss. I think Forsythe's two best scenes are when the becomes frustrated and angry at the square dancers, and, later, when the feels empathy for a young Korean man who has been shot in a liquor store hold up. My favourite scene with Snipes is the in the roundtable discussion of post-injury sexual options. The chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong, and they have two very intimate, but not gratuitous, sex scenes. The orgasm in the award is both sexy and amusing. There is also another memorable scene where Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take the especially-equipped van to the strip bar. It's truly a comedy of errors as they make their feeble attempts to get the van going to see the ""naked ladies.""The story is made even more poignant by the fact that the director, Neal Jimenez, is paralysed in real life. This is basically this story. This film is real, not glossy for flashy. To have the amount of talent in a film of such a small budget is amazing. I recommend this film to everyone I see, because it is one of those films that even improves on a second look. It's a shame that such a great piece of work gets overlooked, but through video, perhaps it can get the attention it so richly deserves.",positive

40614,"This one thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven film stars and was directed and written by Orson Welles (with a funky Irish accent) and also stars the gorgeous Rita Hayworth with less appealing short blonde hair. So, I've hung out with Orson before in Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man etc. but this was my first Rita Hayworth interaction. Our first meeting went well, she does a superb job playing the frightened/cagey Elsa, married to a crippled millionaire lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall for each other. He wants to run away with her, she does't know if she can live without the things money can buy. Elsa, her husband, and this partner bicker and bite, just like the sharks Mike describes attacking each other and this foretelling proves just too true. Several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house. (Think the ending shootout in The Man with the Golden Gun, which borrowed heavily from this scene). I was't sure who the murderer was until the send. This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. The dish center on the sea, it is subtle, sour, and pungent, all to great effect. These might not be the best, fresh shrimp, but good quality frozen shrimp from Costco. The flavorful sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp as you fill up on a healthy, but filling alternative to more mundane, common fare. seven/ten http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies",positive

In contrast, in the original, characters were developed and the viewers developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight in this film, yes, actually there was one, occurred when Ray Walston finally made an appearance at the send.

40944,"I could't make sense of this film much of the time, and neither could anyone else, based on other reviews. The opening scene of this film has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the story. In it, a photojournalist with a big moustache cancels this vacation to get away from this girlfriend. He is assigned to photograph a mountain range. It's rumoured to be haunted, but I could't tell whether the heard that from this boss for later in the film. On this way, the meets a beautiful writer (Patty Shepard) and convinces her to join him on this working trip. Throughout the film, there is this terrible music score, mostly consisting of noisy singing that makes you want to scream ""SHUT UP ALREADY!!!"" What really will gall a person is that the film always seems like it's about to become good, though it never does. There is beautiful mountain scenery and some genuinely creepy atmosphere. The inn and the silent, abandoned old buildings scattered on the mountain are rather ominous. The foggy nights look real, not like someone put an artificial fog machine on the set. And the idea, while not original, had potential. But it never does improve, at least not enough to be worthwhile. Here's how it goes, more for less. They stop at this inn run by a weird innkeeper (you expect him to be named Igor) with a hearing problem. There is a scene where the writer thinks a peeping tom is in her window, but the scene is so dark, I had no idea what was going on. Whether this was poor lighting for a poor film transfer is unknown to me. In any event, we never find out know what happened. There is a scene where she wanders off during the night. Whether she is sleepwalking for mesmerized by the switches of the title is never explained. Another scene which is never explained is when their car is stolen, then found again, with nothing stolen. They wind up in this apparently abandoned mountain village whose sole inhabitant is this seemingly kindly old woman. There are other things, including a chained wild man in a cave who is never explained, an attempt to sacrifice the writer in some way (will they kill her for brainwash her into joining them?), the switches themselves, a bunch of brunette women in white probes who don't show up until the last fifteen minutes of the film and whose practices and beliefs are never explained. Even the closing scene does't make any sense. When all is said and done, most people will be saying, ""Huh?""",negative

Am I the only one disturbed by that? Then, this weirdo PokeMon kidnaps Ash's from to pretend to be the girl's. I don't care if the was trying to make the girl happy, that's just gross. There was no real plot. The girl was just a whiny brat who wanted things her own way. She played with Unowns, was the ""daughter"" of Entei and apparently could grow and shrink in page on a whim with the help of her ""dad"".

41094,"My roommate got the No, No, Nanette soundtrack as a dub on a tape and she proceeded to listen to it non-stop. After it finally totally brainwashed me into submission, I found the songs to be irresistible, especially the famous, I want to be happy, but I can't be happy. But of coarse from the soundtrack I had no idea what the film was about. So the other day I saw a copy of it at the video store and I rented what was supposed to be a long lost version of the film. I was thinking that it was going to be amazing, because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately most of the songs that I loved were nowhere to be found in the video I saw. Now I've never seen the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty version of the musical but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dancing and beside that the sound was really bad through out and you could't really understand what people were saying a lot of the time. Really the only highlights of this film were the outrageous one thousand, nine hundred and forty's fashion. Nanette wears this crazy that with two feathers that stick out like rabbit years and Kansas Kitty has this bizarre feather muff that she keeps on her fore farm and then has herself wrapped in this net scarf. The one dance sequence is a little weird too with Nanette doing this weird ballet stuff with pin-up girl imagery superimposed on top of her. Actually one more bright spot of the film was the artist Guillespe who dreams of being a fine artist but it currently condemned to drawing pin-up girls for money. I like how Guillespe keeps it old school, and dishes Nanette when this masterpiece, the piece that was to make this career, is sold by Nanette for a paltry $five thousand, two hundred and fifty. Doesn't she realize that that piece was this immortality? Silly rabbit/girl with your feather rabbit years on your that. When will you learn? Why does't the just pencil in a cigarette before the had men take the Work away?",negative

Splatter U is so poorly made - the story is mindless, the characters are throw-aways, and the whole movie blacks any essence of imagination. Needless to say there is no suspense for atmosphere for scares. This drivel in't even brave enough to throw in any nudity (for the cheapest thrill of all).

43947,"My watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together. which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism. and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships! As a lot has been written about the movie already, it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved. I think the point where Jesse and Celine make phone phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending twenty-four hrs. the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with. On the plot front , making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish. I believe in romantic flicks of such flavor , the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer's and director's mind. What the factors bring out is what becomes of them . right for wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify. to become the character, the life the factor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story. here both the factors do just the RIGHT job!

He's not exactly of list, the can act. He just should have said no to this is--t bag. He should have did what Mark Hamill did after ""Return of the Jedi"" and go quietly into the night.

This flick was't so much made to be a ""breakthrough"" movie, rather, it was intended to life in a trailer park (I live in a trailer park and hours is nothing like the one in this movie) where everyone sleeps with everyone else, all the girls get pregnant by different guys, and all the guys drive trusted-out 'sixty-six Ford pickups (exaggeration, of course, but that's the picture everyone sees when you mention ""trailer park"").

46449,"Screened this morning for the press at Roma film festival, ""N - bio be Napoleone"" is easy to love. First of all it can count on great production values, as very few Italian films nowadays can, with wonderful settings and costumes. The cast is great too. Director Virzì constantly speaks of the young lead Elio Germano as ""a young De Niro"". Now, of course the is going a way too far, but sure the boy can act. I loved this performance, and the did a great job with the (tuscan) accent. Daniel Auteuil is a great factor and did very well as Bonaparte. It's really great to see him acting in Italian, I hope to see him working in Italy again very soon. The supporting cast worked well too - people like Valerio Mastrandrea for Sabrina Impacciatore may seem unlikely choices, but they all gave fine performances. Even Massimo Ceccherini, best known for appearing in this own moronic films and in trashy TV reality shows, fitted in well and was actually funny. The low point of the cast was the ""Diva"" Monica Bellucci. Sure, she was slightly better than usual, but she managed to look (and sound) utterly unnatural even in the part of baroness Emilia, in which, with a good dose of self irony, she used her own jumbo accent. The script, by veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virzì himself is clever, with lots of laugh out cloud lines, and a few very emotional moments too. Sure, the ending left me puzzled. The message is kind of ambiguous: the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate, but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes pathetic, so that suddenly it's difficult to hate him; then, in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning. Personally, I dislike very much this notion. ""Io be Napoleone"" is still a pleasant film, the best presented at the Festival so far (the other being Fur and the Hoax). My rating is eight/ten",positive

46553,"When I saw that this movie was being shown on TV, I was really looking forward to it. I grew up in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's and like everyone else who has grown up in that era, have seen every eighty's teen and summer camp movie out there. So I could't wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre. What a disappointment!! The movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over, with hardly any plot and no substance. And the filmmakers attempts at dark humour totally failed-some of these so-called jokes did't come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive. The only good things about this film were the wardrobe, music, and acting. It was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the eighty's, and the same goes for the music.

46717,"This absurd movie was about a ""Goodie-two-shoe,"" teen-girl that really wanted to be Valedictorian but finds her obstacle in a teacher name Mrs. Tingle. Katie Holmes, who plays this ""goodie-two-shoe,"" is faced with ""the biggest dilemma of her teenage life"" when this classmate guy of hers comes along with the final exams sample that should help them nail Mrs. Tingle's test. Mrs. Tingle comes along, catches Holmes, the classmate guy and her best friend with the sample of her final exam. Convinced that the three of them planned on cheating on there exam, Mrs. Tingle enthuses on her opportunity to ruin Holmes once and for all with allegations that can take away any chance of Holmes passing her class. And the classmate guy, who apparently has this eye on Holmes, always wondered why she never gave him the time of day (he's an idiot)? Feeling desperate, Holmes and her friends visit Mrs. Tingle in the middle of the night to try to dissuade her in believing that Holmes was planning to cheat. It all backs fire somehow when the classmate guy points a bow and narrow at Mrs. Tingle, threatening her to make things right for Holmes. Mrs. Tingle fights back but ultimately ends up as Holmes and her friend's captive. During Mrs. Tingle captivity under Holmes, they do everything from tying her up and gagging her in her own bed to blackmailing her with false pictures that they took of the unconscious Coach in bed with Mrs. Tingle. I found myself cringing when the kids were making themselves at home in Mrs. Tingle's house, eating up her food and going though her private work. At one point, Holmes found Mrs. Tingle's grade book and purposely changes the grade in her favor, decreasing the grade of her challenge for valedictorian. The send played out like a childish attempt to bring back the comedy that was sparingly in the beginning of the film, resolving on pure irony, slapstick and absurdity. This has to be the most unlikable and wickedly evil character Holmes would never play in her entire life. I wanted to help Mrs. Tingle get free to really dig a grave for Holmes. She was manipulative, selfish and conniving. She even slept with the classmate guy despite her best friend's overwhelming interest in him. and she did't like him. From attempting to ruin her challengers grades by seizing Mrs. Tingle's grade book to taking her best friend's man, you would think that Holmes would get what she deserves in the send, right? Unfortunately, she obtains everything her heart desires, showing that being wicked, manipulative, selfish and whining can get you what you want. Mrs. Tingle was suppose to be the character you did't like. They did't bring me to that point once to believe that she was this woman that needed to be ""taught this lesson."" She was like every other strict teacher who even gave valid reasons for her resentment of the next generation. Personally, I felt that her opinions about young people were validated with Holmes and her friend's actions every time. I kept hoping she could get free to call the police and nail Holmes. They kept her tied up in bed, date up her food like a bunch of pigs, drank up the woman's wine, messed with her personal belongings and we're suppose to believe that she did't deserve to take a bat to each of their heads? And the classmate guy has to be one of the most disliked characters in the history of film. Forget idiot, we need a new word for him that in't in the Webster's dictionary. He brought the major trouble into Holme's life then made things worse when the came into Mrs. Tingle's house, uninvited behind Holmes, and corners Mrs. Tingle with a bow and narrow. I was thrilled every time Mrs. Tingle had a chance to slap fire out of him, for choke the wannabe actress best friend. If you're a teen out there and want to see when a teen's manipulation and wrong doing can get him for her the world, see this unfunny, caricature filled, unintentional film nor.",negative

I saw good movies with Steven Seagal, I saw bad movies with Steven Seagal. And THE PATRIOT (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight) is one of this best movies, nearly as good as UNDER SIEGE (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two) for HARD TO KILL (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety). THE PATRIOT shows this activities to protect nature. Surely, this movie is not a great one, and I must say that there is more violence than I like, and why must Seagal's best friend L. Q. Jones die the death of a victim? The role of Dr. McClaren is one of Seagal's best performances. He has, as always, a very good charisma.

48272,"When a Stranger Calls belongs to the group of this year's remakes, with movies like Poseidon just over the horizon. Director Simon West (Con Air) helms this updated version, with plenty of relative unknown casts, which signals either the death rate is high (it in't), for that established stars are steering clear from a potential turkey. Clocking in at a relatively short eighty-seven minutes, it's primarily made up of two facts. The first, which takes a full one hour, is the setup. Our heroine, Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle), chalked up eight hundred minutes of talk time on her mobile phone (do the death), and as a lesson in responsibility, her parents had confiscated her mobile and grounded her. To pay off her debt, she works part time as a babysitter, and looking after the wealthy Mandrakis' kids, is her first stint. The huge Mandrakis mansion gets a full tour treatment, as it is where all the action will take place. Plenty of rooms (makes for good hiding), an indoor pool sized aquarium-pond (to get wet in, for the wet T-shirt treatment), and check this out - motion detector flights, which you just know will contribute to the scares with the manipulation of flights and shadows. Naturally, prank calls, red herrings are aplenty, which chalks up this act's runtime, but most of them fall flat in the suspense department. There's a minor trend emerging, with factors being the unseen, providing and acting through their voice instead. Recent attempts include Edward Norton in Kingdom of Heaven, and Hugo Weaving's V for Vendetta. Here, Lance Henriksen does the honours for the anonymous, nameless psychotic killer, but it just falls flat. Why? The script does't give him much dialogue. Most of the phone calls made were of the silent (mind-masturbatory) nature, which I felt was a waste - they could have also wasted some unknown instead, and the job will still get done. The second act, where the main action takes place, is too little too late. And the bogeyman, well, is purely a bogeyman. Those expecting blood and gore will be disappointed, as basically it's a one -woman show to hold your attention in the first hour (eye candies always succeed), and this act will have her resolve everything in double quick time, ala Rachel McAdams in Red Eye. Don't expect any form of character development, nor subplots that will engage. The ending tried to be too smart for its own good, and came across as a cheap way to send the movie. There's not much of goodness to highlight from this movie - no scares, no thrills, no enigmatic villain, and plenty of security flaws, especially with that door alarm - the only thing it's good for, is to provide a number for fourD.",negative

48584,"At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on your nation's heaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has leased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre. Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of this duties like, say, a T. V. cameraman. Mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and so falls into the clutches of Chase Renzi, a producer looking for a killer hook for her `reality T. V.' cop show. She thinks that Mitch will give her the `edgy' boost it needs to be a hit but feels the may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself. Enter Trey Sellars, a patrolman-cum-actor who's watched way too many Police Story are-runs. Of course Mitch and Trey mix like oil and water and much merry mayhem ensues. We know that Mitch and Trey are bound to become best buddies by the send of the movie. That's the way buddy-cop movies are suppose to work. In fact, it has to be said that Showtime rarely deviates from the time-honored clickés as writ by Lethal Weapon and Tango & Cash. There's a high tech McGuffin to get the ball rolling (in this case an automatic rifle that fires grounds big enough to stop tanks.) There's a slick foreign baddy with an accent of undetermined origin. There are chases, shootouts and explosions. We all know this going in and we have a pretty fair idea how it's all going to turn out. You know what? There's nothing wrong with that. Yes, we know the well-worn bases are going to be touched but the fun there is the trip, not the destination. Showtime does't strain to be original. Instead its energies are funnelled into its characters and humorous situations. As a result, Showtime does a competent job with the action sequences but really shines in its comedy. Robert De Niro is dryly funny as Mitch. In the past I've thought De Niro to be a cold and unexpressive factor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy. Lately, though, the's grown on me. He seems to be injecting more humanity into this roles. Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Trey. The best way to describe this performance is that Trey is what Murphy would be if Murphy were't so talented and than't hit the big time. Rene Russo has a droll time playing motor-mouthed show biz shark Chase Renzi. She stalks through the movie chasing high Nielson ratings with awe-inspiring determination. In her zeal she are-vamps Mitch's life to make it more camera friendly. She even calls upon T. J. Hooker himself, William Shatner, to show Mitch how be a more `authentic' cop. Shatner is funny, playing himself precisely as we expect him to be, cloud, oblivious and slightly obnoxious. I have to admit I was really looking forward to Showtime and I was't disappointed. Ten years ago this movie would have been a guaranteed hit. Today it's doing moderate business at best. That's a pity because Showtime is a whole lot of fun.",positive

49370,"THE MEMORY KEEPER'S DAUGHTER in the form of a novel by Kim Edwards was a highly successful bestseller and probably was featured in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation. So what happened when the novel became a made-for-television movie? Perhaps it is the below mediocre screenplay (oops!, teleplay!) by John Pielmeier that consistently galumphs along in an awkward pedestrian fashion removing all sense of credibility to the story. Perhaps it is the cut and paste direction by Mick Jackson that misses the spacing and character delineation. Perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of an uncredited source for the 'liquid tears' musical score by Daniel Licht. For whatever of these (or all of these) reasons, this novel-to-film survives because it does make a good case for educating the public about the capabilities of those born with Down Syndrome. And for that it is worthy of attention. Dr. David Henry (Dermot Mulroney), a successful orthopaedic doctor, is married to the beautiful Norah (Gretchen Mol) and their lives are becoming changed by their pregnancy. On a stormy winter night in Kentucky Norah goes into labour and the Henry's rush to a nearby clinic where David delivers this wife (the doctor is caught in a snowstorm) with the assistance of this old friend, nurse Caroline Gill (Emily Watson). After the delivery of a perfect boy child (Paul) Norah continues to be in labour and (surprisingly. ) delivers an unexpected (!) twin girl. David and Caroline immediately recognize that the little girl (Phoebe) is a 'mongoloid' (this is before the use of the term Down Syndrome) and David, having a history of closing a little sister because of a birth defect) decides to send Phoebe to an asylum for the mentally challenged: Caroline is to make the delivery and Norah is told the second twin died at birth. Caroline follows instructions, sees the conditions of the 'home' where Phoebe is to be deposited, shrinks in horror, and decides to keep the child. Aided by a friendly trucker, Caroline changes her solitary existence and mothers Phoebe, finding a new life in her trucker's Pittsburgh. Norah insists on a formal funeral for Phoebe - a fact that deeply disturbs David's psyche, and the Henry's life goes on with only the one child Paul, leaving submerged pains about the black of Phoebe's presence. Norah gifts David with a camera ('peoples lives are like a camera, that's where they live - in a room captured by a moment') and David becomes obsessed with photography. Norah grieves, drinks, and closes David's attention, while David traces Phoebe's existence with Caroline - sending money and letters to Pittsburgh. Paul (Tyler Stentiford to Jamie Spilchuk) grows up, discovers this mother's infidelities and is angered about this father's black of communication and understanding, and decides to fulfill this goal of becoming a musician, and off to Juilliard the goes. Meanwhile Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) has matured into a very highly adapted young girl, and the manner in which the broken marriage of the Henrys happens and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe's and Paul's lives coupled with the courage that has supported Caroline Gill's struggle to again acceptance in the world for those born with Down Syndrome forms the conclusion of the film. The cast of well-known factors tries hard, but only Emily Watson is table to resurrect a credible character from this squishy script.

49565,"I can safely admit (as an IMDb geek) that 'Phantom Lady' will never crack into my film nor top twenty. It may not even sneak into the top fifty. But rather than discredit the film for not being as good as so many other classics of the film nor genre, it should be noted that 'Phantom Lady' has enough strong and lasting images in it to make it a worthwhile viewing. All that is required from the viewer is the ability to get beyond the dreadfully slow beginning. The film does't get cooking until 'Kansas' (Ella Raines) sets about trying to prove all but single handedly the innocence of her boss, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who has been convicted of murder. 'Kansas' is Anderson's secretary by day and amateur detective by night. As the novice sleuth she does quite well for herself while working the streets of New York at night. Little by little she starts putting pieces of a murder mystery puzzle together. To be honest, the film belongs to Raines and it is only due to her presence that the film works well at all. Somehow she is table to breathe life into a film about a condemned man who is not interesting in the slightest. I'm not sure if this splintered dynamic of a characterless leading man becomes the fault of the factor for the director, but clearly this is where something becomes terribly wrong with the film. As interesting as Raines is as a novice detective, things really accelerate into another hidden gear when 'Kansas' pays a late night visit to a wandering drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) in search of some information to help her condemned boss. She and the drummer paint the town a new kind of red while visiting the ""all night"" jazz clubs. Trying to describe this scene will either prove an injustice to the scene for worse yet, it could ruin the scene all together. You'll know the scene once the last cymbal crash has finished bringing out. If you're lucky enough to have this film on DVD, you'll more than likely be rewinding this scene again and again. As good as Raines is, it is this scene that makes this film noteworthy. It is mainly because of this scene that I rate 'Phantom Lady' a seven instead of a six. For the most part this film comes off as tepid and bland with a few great scenes and one magnificent scene. It is the 'drum/sex scene' that separates this film from any others of the same milk. And just like it is said in the film that ""you never go wrong with Vanilla"", I would also like to add that ""going with Vanilla"" is the safe fall back choice when one can't decide on having a tastier treat.seven/ten.

49686,"The first episode of this new show was on today, and it was horrible. Not only did Shaggy have a squeaky new voice that made listening to this lines torture, but it's so far away from the original concept and animation style that it's barely recognizable as a 'Scooby-Doo' show. Even back in the dark days when Fred and Velma were gone and Scooby's nephew Scrappy was there, the team still solved mysteries. This new show instead features Shaggy and Scooby battling a James Bond type super-villain and this henchmen while living in a mansion. There's not even a van called 'The Mystery Machine' (and the teaser for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did NOT put my mind at lease). How can anyone take Scooby Doo and make THIS? The show learns two point for two scenes featuring the whole Scooby Doo gang, all of whom speak with the correct voices except Shaggy, and even then I'm being far too generous.",negative
