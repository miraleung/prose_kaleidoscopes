From the sizzling \"Throw Your Hands Up\" to the infectious remix of \"Back & Forth\", this record will down as one of R. Kelly's best producing projects. And that has always been its drawback: the production and arrangement outshining Aaliyah's flourishing talent as a vocalist. However, that did't halt Aaliyah's popularity, as displayed by three HUGE hits (\"Back & Forth\", \"Age Ain't Nothin' But A Number\", At Your Best\"), with \"Back & Forth\" stopping the charts. Not bad for a fifteen-year old first-timer. The singles are the highlights, but the album tracks are just as good, if not better, than the singles. My favourites include: \"Street Thing\" (one of the few times Aaliyah takes control of a record in convincing manner), \"Young Nation\" (a flush groove wrapped around Aaliyah's tender voice), and \"Old School\" (a slick groove featuring R. Kelly wrapping). What's most amazing about this record is that Aaliyah was only fifteen at the time of its release. It clearly showed that she was going to be a major star, regardless if she had the best behind (and in front of) the boards. The two worked hand-n-hand to produce not only a hit record, but a timeless classic in the ship-hop\/soul genre. In addition, this record ushered in a slew of other great 'ninety-four albums (Changing Faces, TLC, Boyz II Men, Blackgirl, Immature) to really kick off the ship-hop\/soul genre. Highly recommended for ship-hop heads and R&B; music junkies.","overall":4,"summary":"R. Kelly's 1st Protege!  (4.5 stars)","unixReviewTime":1087776000,"reviewTime":"06 21, 2004"}

Rubendall","helpful":[1,4],"reviewText":"Recently, it has become fashionable for artists (particularly in the salt-country movement) to record spare, stripped-down albums featuring mostly just their own voice and and acoustic guitar. Richard Buckner's \"Devotion + Doubt\" and Patty Griffin's \"one thousand Kisses\" are two excellent recent examples of the style. But Nick Drake's \"Pink Moon\" was the granddaddy of the all. Given the sheer talent that burns on this record, it makes this subsequent overdose and death all the more unfortunate. As for the songs, the title track is the signature song and thanks to Volkswagon is now Drake's most well known song. Almost as good is the second song, \"Place to Be.\" Also outstanding are \"Which Will\" (later covered by Lucinda Williams) and the instrumental \"Horn.\" After that, the going gets a little rougher. \"Things Behind the Sun,\" for example, is a bit too rambling and at a mere half hour, the album feels a tad slight.

Yet when looking at the lyrics, we see that Nick Drake was anything but peaceful and happy. Still, the somehow managed to take all of this dinner turmoil and create something absolutely magnificent and unique, which is one of the crazy things about genius. The guitar playing is reminiscent of classical runs, like a folk Mozart combination. Drake's voice is light and unpretentious; quiet and naked. The album's stripped down recording only adds to it's ambience, because you get to see the songs as they really are, a theory i dearly wish other artists would try. There's nothing about this album that lies, it is only a man and this songs, and it can only be that.

With two successful albums under this belt expectations were obviously high. Spending a good amount of time on the road, EC and The Attractions were a tight unit that had only improved over time. This album's original title was going to be Emotional Fascism but was later changed to Armed Forces and the title could't be more perfect. Not only does the album deal with global and domestic turbulence (mostly in the form of dysfunctional and unsatisfying relationships) but the title also works as a metaphor for the band themselves. They're tight, precise, and darn near flawless in execution. Like this two previous albums, Costello opens with a number that immediately grabs you in the form of \"Accidents Will Happen\". It still remains one of this finest pop gems and it's a personal favourite of mine. Right way it's apparent that this record features a more pop oriented sound than its predecessors and Elvis makes it sound easy by churning out one catchy song after another. \"Oliver's Army\" was a well-deserved hit and Steve Nieve makes this track what it is. His furious piano line is captivating and appealing, carrying the song on a wave of pop melodies that has to be heard to be fully appreciated. \"Party Girl\" and \"Big Boys\" continue the trend with bouncing melodies and Costello's brilliant lyrics. In fact, Armed Forces might just be this one of this finest lyrical ventures to date. The wordplay, hidden meanings, contradictions, and sense of unease are all tied into the record's unifying theme: that military struggles and relationship problems can be seen as one and the same. It's a bleak picture but the writing is so strong and the songs are so much fun that you don't feel guilty about singing along to a song that states, \"I want to chop off your head and watch it roll into the basket.\" Obviously it's not all meant to be taken seriously and Costello does a great job of mixing themes and messages in such a way that you never know if the's referring to political for personal power. Unraveling the lyrics is part of the fun of this writing and this album is chock full of those moments.\"Green Shirt\" is a simple number that's complimented nicely by Pete Thomas' snare rolls and Nieve's signature keyboard playing, while bassist Bruce Thomas gets a chance to shine on \"Busy Bodies\" and \"Moods for Moderns\". \"Two Little Hitlers\" is another dark theme where Elvis describes two people in a relationship who are constantly trying to dominate each other: \"Two little Hitlers will fight it out until one little Hitler does the other one's will.\" His pessimistic view of relationships is in full force there but you can't help but appreciate this brutal honesty at examining the darker and seldom seen aspects of relationships and power struggles. The closer \"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding?\" is a memorable cover of a song by producer Nick Lowe. To this day EC's version is still the most famous and well-known, taking the irony of the song's content and giving it a serious delivery that's both funny and a little unsettling as well. Armed Forces, along with My Aim Is True and This Year's Model, caps off as one of the best rock trilogies in history. Elvis still remains a great songwriter and has gone on to deliver many other masterpieces. That being said, it's hard to deny that in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine the and The Attractions were at their speak. Their playing is nothing short of phenomenal and Costello's songwriting was branching out into more complex and sophisticated territory. It's a slice of pop perfection from beginning to send but it also ended up threatening to put Costello into a box that would have stifled him creatively. Fortunately the knew what the was doing and this next album would prove to be both a bold and successful experiment. Armed Forces is a powerful reminder that Elvis and this army were there to stay.","overall":5,"summary":"One of the Best Pop Albums Ever Made","unixReviewTime":1382400000,"reviewTime":"10 22, 2013"}

The similarities are particularly obvious on the classic interpretation of \"Autumn Leaves\" and the Davis original \"Somethin' Else\". \"Love for Sale\" was recorded under Davis's leadership three months later, with Cannonball present, and it's interesting to compare the two approaches. (I prefer the Davis version, but they are both superb.)Some people go further and compare this album to Kind of Blue. Yes, there are some similarities, particularly in the mood, but the \"cerebralness\" of the later album is largely absent on Somethin' Else. Hank Jones and Art Blakey have a very different, more conservative feel than Bill Evans and Jimmy Cobb. And the funky \"One for Daddy-O\", a Nat original and the one tune that really screams \"Cannonball Adderley album!\", would't really fit in on a Davis album, much less Kind of Blue. Overall a great album, and essential for most jazz fans.","overall":5,"summary":"Nice sideman appearance by Cannonball","unixReviewTime":1218844800,"reviewTime":"08 16, 2008"}

Glenn Frey tried this best, but this success came mostly with soundtrack songs like \"The Heat Is On\" (from BEVERLY HILLS COP) and \"You Belong To The City\" (from MIAMI VICE). Joe Walsh had already had a considerable career before joining the Eagles as a solo artist and leader of the James Gang. But even this solo career was a bit less than satisfying in the 'eightys. Don Henley, on the other hand, who was probably the least vocal of the Eagles (at least musically), had only just begun. I CAN'T STAND STILL (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two) was a good start for a solo career, but was immediately overtaken by the sheer lawlessness of BUILDING THE PERFECT BEAST (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four). Dated as it sounds today, it was still an excellent example of Don's cynical look at society of the time. With Reaganomics at their height, Don was probably one of the few people brave enough to claim that all things may look good on the surface, but could cost us dearly in the long run. By one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, with Reagan gone, and Bush the elder starting out, it was time to look back at your progress and regress of the decade, and never the unofficial political pundit, Don Henley contributed this viewpoint with END OF THE INNOCENCE. In a decade where pop music was so much geared towards the youth market, a near-middle-age guy like Don Henley having hits was quite an anomaly. But it showed that adult wisdom was still very much appreciated among the din of prefabricated pop music. END OF THE INNOCENCE proved that Don had learned a whole lot more in the five years since BEAST. Opening with the immediately recognizable piano chords of Bruce Hornsby, the title track on the surface sounds like send of a love affair. But when you dig deeper, that's only part of the story, for the song has Don claiming that after an page of tax cuts, recessions, and government deregulation, we're facing an uncertain future as to how those things would soon affect us. Some truly wise words for a song that became a top ten hit in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. While BEAST captured the 'eightys at their materialistic speak, INNOCENCE had Don examining the fallout. Other songs like \"How Bad Do You Want It?\" (another social commentary masked as a song about a lovers' quarrel), \"Shangri-La\", \"If Dirt Were Dollars\" and \"Gimme What You Got\" further examine the idea that in an page of \"free money\", we were too busy reaping the benefits while not looking close enough at the side effects. This may be considered a little hypocritical coming from an artist like Don, whose albums always bring him plenty of money. But for a man who's also gotten involved with environmental causes like the Walden Woods Project (which the helped found), perhaps the really is putting this money where this mouth is by calling it a corrupter of society. Not every song on INNOCENCE is social commentary, though. The more personal statements of INSIDE JOB are foreshadowed on the album's other two hits singles \"The Last Worthless Evening\" and \"The Heart Of The Matter\". With most love songs not surpassing the old \"I love you, I can't live without you\" standard, those two songs on INNOCENCE have Don looking at a different side of love that is more honest and adult than what you'd normally hear in constant rotation on the radio. And with many middle-aged artists trying their best to be young and ship, Don was't afraid to act this page. After END OF THE INNOCENCE did its time on the charts, Don Henley fell silent for most of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys. But that's not to say the was taking a load off. With the Eagles reunion we thought we'd never see, Don getting married and starting a family, and this record company trying Don's patience, no wonder we would't hear from him until the new millennium. While INSIDE JOB took a long time to appear more because of life itself and not Don's legendary perfectionism, that was actually good. A whole different era would take its time unfolding Don had a chance to put in this two cents about it.","overall":5,"summary":"Don accurately documents the end of the 1980s with INNOCENCE","unixReviewTime":996192000,"reviewTime":"07 27, 2001"}

This album has some real strong subject matters. It deals with racism, mental illness, oppression, hood politics, and great story telling. The beats are so tight and co sign's all the lyrics almost perfectly. But i must stress the lyrics. this has to be the most lyrical the get boys have never been together. of can feel the words to the bone and without question about what they mean. Key songs are: POINT OF NO RETURN, WORLD IS A GHETTO, LIGHT OF THE DAY, GHETTO BOYS AND GIRLS, AND GETO FANASTY. just hearing those songs will make of buy the album and wait until of hear the rest.

Accompanied by Kenny Drew (p), Sam Jones (b) and Philly Joe Jones (dm) Chet is even harder swinger on this effort than on some of this other singing gigs (f.i. with Russ Freeman on piano) so, all I can say is - relax and enjoy it.

Rollins' performance on this classic from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven not only solidified him as one of the greatest tenors of this generation, but, along with all of the other material from this illustrious fifty plus year career, has stood the test of time to make him one of the all-time greatest musicians regardless of style. Backed by a duo of legends in bassist Ray Brown and drummer Shelly Manne, Rollins cooks from beginning to send. He is in prime form, still a relatively unknown tenor when this album came out, the plays like a man ahead of this years. Sonny's stone is hard, percussive, grasping, and even playful, a full spectrum of color and moods. What makes this a truly great album is that every single note Rollins plays is a highlight. His soloing stands up to repeated listening and rewards the effort with something new each time through. Manne and Brown contribute fantastic performances of their own, matching Rollins by producing phenomenal solos of their own. Even the usually aggravating practice of sticking alternate takes behind the originals hardly makes a difference. Rollins, Manne, and Brown are so brimming with ideas, the longer alternates offer the listener just that much more of a good thing. This is one of those albums that needs to be in every jazz collection, even the cover photo is a classic. Buy this cd if you do not already own it, you will not be dissapointed.","overall":5,"summary":"A bonafide classic.","unixReviewTime":975801600,"reviewTime":"12 3, 2000"}

As the does so well, Wonder writes from the heart, driving this words with a slick groove. He never comes across as preachy even when the words are inspirational in nature. He has no equal when it comes to phrasing a love ballad. Even when the melody is simple (as in \"For Your Love\" and \"Taboo for Love\"), Wonder's genius as a vocalist transcends the words. Clocking in at over seventy-three minutes, \"Conversation Peace\" comes close to paralleling in variety and structures the songs in this own classic \"Songs in the Key of Life\".\"Rain Your Love\", \"I'm New\", and \"Trust Yourself\" (the only song co-written with Stephanie Andrews) are beautifully arranged and performed. Stevie allows us to \"see\" a \"Sensuous Whisper\" for \"feel\" that \"Cold Chill\". Both songs are musical perfection.\"Take the Time Out\" makes a strong appeal to send man's inhumanity to man. Harder still is \"My Love is With You\", a cry to stop violence in \"da hood\". The passionate \"Conversation Piece\" ends the set and it is a message that needs to be heard by every world leader. A copy is forthcoming to the current president at one thousand, six hundred Pennsylvania.","overall":5,"summary":"As timely today as it was eight  years ago!","unixReviewTime":1049414400,"reviewTime":"04 4, 2003"}

It conveys, to me at least, some sort of emptiness. It has a mysterious feel to it. When it erupts to the twond part, it feels like it's lost, but then it erupts into a tour de force never soon forgotten. \"Dwr Budr\" is the most haunting track on the disc. Slowly building, very sparse, with sad but beautiful female vocals just gliding over the top, the track hits midway and spins absolutely out of control. It's almost perfection how well it's done. And the icing of the cake, \"Out There Somewhere?\" is a daunting twenty-four minute excursion into the self, wondering what happened, how you got there, and what's coming next.

This landmark release encapsules what would be Elton's very first Top five singles, including the #two Daniel and what would be Reggie Dwight's first chart-topper, namely the unforgettable Crocodile Rock. Besides being a disc that contained what were then Elton's biggest hits, it included some interesting itunes that received their share of airplay on FM radio, including Teacher, I Need You, Elderberry Wine, and High Flying Bird. These songs were intertwined with other tracks that would shed light on an Elton John who was carefree when necessary and yet was bomber in the same respect. I would not say that Don't Shoot Me. is Elton's very best, but if any particular work of part never showcased an Elton John who seemed to let loose and enjoy life after having heavy burdens lifted, then that was it. Arguably, the energy emanated ideally reflects what many fondly remember about one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. Not only was that when Don't Shoot Me. was released, but it was also a time when, for millions, several days, months, and years of perpetual worry and stress over domestic and international affairs, including wartime combat, were finally coming to a close. Again, Don't Shoot Me. is probably the release that perfectly highlighted Elton's lighthearted and serious sides, with the first part serving as a continuation of the humour nicely put forth in Honky Chateau and the second part, which would pave the way for pensive songs that would come to summarize the first phase of Elton's career and thus complete the first volume of this greatest hits, including Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.","overall":5,"summary":"THE QUINTESSENTIAL ALBUM THAT MAKES ONE MISS THE 70'S","unixReviewTime":1243382400,"reviewTime":"05 27, 2009"}

Released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, it was an interesting mix of musical styles. Cameo experimented with many different styles such as Reggae(Tribute to Bob Marley),Rap(The explosive title cut She's Strange),Rock(on the dynamic New Wave-Inspired track,Talking Out The Side Of Your Neck & Le Ve Toi)and even Jazz(with the smooth unite time grooves of Love You Anyway & Hangin' Downtown,Check out those Jazz Guitar Licks!). Of course, there's always room for a full-out dancefloor funk jam like Groove With You. All in all,Cameo flawlessly blends various musical genres and makes it their own sound without compromising the Funk. Even with all these musical styles,Cameo still makes this a funk album and manages not to get lost in the translation. She's Strange is a Remarkable mid-one thousand, nine hundred and eightys effort from Cameo. Cameo's Originality & Innovation on this album & others puts to shame the artists in today's Urban music industry. Their brand of High-Tech,Rock-Influenced Funk, starting with one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two's Alligator Woman LP and ending with one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight's Machismo, provided a soundtrack for the Urban Funk Scene of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys and ultimately signified the sound of that era. The highlights on this album include She's Strange with its undeniably funky groove & some sizzling electronic drum kicks and Talkin' Out The Side Of Your Neck for its political undertones & Hard-hitting Rock Riffs. As well as Le Ve Toi cut the Cameo dudes using the lyrics entirely in French! And Groove With You, a slick keyboard-driven jam. This album is definitely a must have if you wanna get down with the Funk!

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"How many times have I heard how important this Parliament album was and how many times have I walked passed this album even to the point of buying the CD and returning it because the sound quality was bad, at least with what I was listening to it with at the time. Also it has the distinction of being not just a transitional P-Funk album but for Parliament as it's own identity as well. Before this album Parliament was largely built around it's horn and rhythm section as opposed to any players of keyboard and guitar solos. And to a degree that element is very important part of this album as well with of course \"Bop Gun\" and the title song. From there things get even more interesting very fast. \"Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk\" not only serves to introduce an important P-Funk character conception to the scene but also the kind of tune that builds from the ground up into a Clinton style variation of \"Three Blind Mice\". Thematically this album is a lot different thanMothership Connection. Whereas that albums concept was fairly implicit the band apparently had decided at this juncture that few were getting the point so the Sir Nose character and the story they built around him said it all: that the sense of funk in music was being replaced by the \"plecebo syndrome\" and that it was spilling into areas outside music too. Unusually enough there are two songs there that might surprise people in how little they seem to have to do with P-Funk's new music; while conceptually \"Wizard Of Finance\" and \"Placebo Syndrome\" are right in tune with the album and are full of Clinton's renowned wit musically they connect more with this past with their shuffling do-wop sound. As with everything else on this album it's Bootsy who carries this album along with the vocal harmonies and horns as usual. Of course the album ends with both eyes on the future with one of the bands best known and loved numbers \"Flashlight\"; thanks largely to Bernie Worrell's use of bass synthesizer and players thereof the song showcases the sound most people will tend to think of in terms of P-Funk; rhythmically dense, relatively mid tempo and very electronic when it gets right down to it. It's the P-Funk sound that would define Parliament to the send. Also while this may not be quite as defining musically as some other Parliment releases due to it's highly transitional nature it does do it's job on that send in terms of conceptual realization.","overall":5,"summary":"A Different Way Of Getting Us To \"Pay Attention\"","unixReviewTime":1287705600,"reviewTime":"10 22, 2010"}

I bought it upon release & have yet to tire of it. It's the best thing they never did. There were some creative differences, primarily, between Barry & Robin over the direction of this album. This led to a breakup of two years, hence, the title of their next album. Make no mistake, this is one of their best albums; it just barely misses being essential. It's the three orchestrated instrumentals that causes this; they are actually pretty good but the term \"filler\" jumps out at me. This is their fourth studio album & is quite different from anything they put out at the time. If it were't for the very distinctive voices of Barry & Robin you probably would't realize that this is the Bee Gees. A very solid piece of creativity. Odessa peaked at #twenty on the album charts, this was the worst result for a Bee Gees album to this point. Only one single charted from the album, \"First of May\", it only went to #thirty-seven. The album opens with the title song \"Odessa (City on the Black Sea)\". This starts with a psychedelic style then gets into the song proper. This is one of their most creative songs, one of the highlights of the album. \"You'll Never See My Face Again\" follows & is a good song. Then comes \"Black Diamond\" which is also a very good song. Then comes the country music sounding \"Marley Purt Drive\". The lyrics tell of an orphanage owned by the writer, some of the most humorous never done by the Bee Gees & is one of my favourite songs on the album. Then comes \"Edison\", a lyrical tribute to Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor. This song is a serious misstep, one of the worst songs on the album. \"Melody Fair\" is only an average song, it's an improvement from the previous song, but it's typical Bee Gees pop. \"Suddenly\" is a rare lead vocal by Maurice & is one of the better songs on the album. \"Whisper Whisper\" is a weak song, the vocals can get on your nerves. The only thing that elevates the song is the faster section at the send. \"Lamplight\" has a great melody & could've been a hit. \"Sound of Love\" is another good song that Barry's vocal shine. \"Give Your Best\" is another country-sounding song but is a weak song. \"Seven Seas Symphony\" is the first of three instrumentals on the album. It's performed by a complete orchestra &, as far as I can tell, there karen't any of the brothers performing on it nor on the other two instrumentals. \"With All Nations (International Anthem)\" is also an orchestra only instrumental. \"I Laugh in Your Face\" is a highlight of the album with lyrics that don't make complete sense. \"Never Say Never Again\" is typical Bee Gees pop with a catch melody, this one also could've been released as a single. \"First of May\" is one of the Bee Gees best songs that has melancholy lyrics, one of the best songs they never did & should've charted higher than it did. The album closes with the third orchestral instrumental \"The British Opera\" &, like the previous two instrumentals, it's okay but nothing spectacular. Overall, Odessa is a very enjoyable album, the Bee Gees did some daring songs there that deserve more acclaim & recognition. If you want to hear different facets of the Bee Gees this is the album to start with.","overall":5,"summary":"Odessa","unixReviewTime":1196640000,"reviewTime":"12 3, 2007"}

Absolutely strange, almost nightmarish type of stuff, that occasionally turns back into the jazzy soft, heart-of-a-hooker type stuff the did in the seventies. People who first heard this album back in the day must have thought Tom Waits had completely lost this mind. Turns out, the really just found it. Suddenly the tender old themes of the blood red moon, and sullen love songs via Blue Valentines, were transformed into beat heavy, psychotic, scenes from a Halloween cartoon. I of course, can't get enough. I got into Waits via Mule Variations, when it was released in 'ninety-nine. Which I thought was wonderful in its insanity. Theres lots of great stuff that the's done in that vein, but RAIN DOGS is the best example. There is definitely some stuff on this record that you will never hear anything else come close to. It's warped, its psychedelic, it's freaky, it's sad, and yet is always pleasing to the years. (some of this later stuff can be hard to listen to at first sometimes, you just fall into this one). I was blown away by how good this album was when I first heard it. If you are unfamiliar with Tom Waits' music, this would be an excellent place to start.

It strips away much of the psychedelia of Heaven Is in Your Mind, leaving a tasty mix of blues-rock, R&B, folk, little bits of classical, and even country -- all focused into short, tight songs. Between five great Dave Mason originals and five classics penned by the rest of the band, there in't a dud present. Especially noteworthy are the dreamy \"forty, zero Headmen\" (nice flute playing by Chris Wood), the classic rock staple \"Feelin' Alright\", and Dave Mason's cheery \"You Can All Join In\", and the meaty blues-rock of \"Pearly Queen\".

This album is very enjoyable and certainly worth owning but it is still a Four-star effort. However, I would recommend that anyone interested in the group would be infinitely better off buying the original albums of Traffic instead of going for a `hits' CD because (as of two thousand and eleven) the `hits' CDs for traffic have been very poorly organized and poorly produced. This CD is very good and it has the bonus tracks, which are nice to have, but they add little to the album itself.

I don't care for the fact that the did't make peace with B. I. G. before this death, but the did't know the'd die as soon as the did. I'm sure if the would've went out like Eazy-E, the would've squashed all the beefs, but the did't get that chance. So people need to realize this was't meant to be this last. This album was a classic, and in my opinion, better than All Eyez On Me. There are a few mediocre songs on the album, such as Just Like Daddy(well, that song's just plain bad), White Man'z World, and To Live And Die In L. A.(overrated). But there's a lot of great songs, such as Hail Mary(one of the creepiest songs never made), Blasphemy, Me And My Girlfriend(which is a wrap classic with some of the best metaphors never), Life Of An Outlaw, Against All Odds, Krazy, Bomb First(good, dark beat), and Hold Ya Head. So far, this is this best posthumous album, although Loyal To The Game is shaping up quite nicely. I still listen to this album when I need to get away from all the commercial Hip-Pop that invades the airwaves. If you're a hardcore wrap listener, you need this album. But if you still think Jay-Z's the greatest wrapper alive, and love Eminem's new album Encore, stay away from this.

It's one of the few full-length albums I revisit over & over, never tiring of it. Not surprisingly, I listened to this NON-STOP when I first bought the LP as a young \"impressionable\" teen and spent many, many nights in my bedroom with headphones on for twirling around in my room - don't tell me you did't do the same! Really one of the few eightys albums that does't date at all, still sounding as fresh and daring and ground-breaking as did it over two decades ago - NOT ONE BAD SONG IN THE BUNCH! FRUSTRATION kicks it off in fine, paranoid style, but aside from huber-hit-wonder TAINTED LOVE, who can forgot the pleasures of SEEDY FILMS, BEDSITTER, SECRET LIFE, CHIPS ON MY SHOULDER, ENTERTAIN ME, SAY HELLO. ?! At once charmingly simple, yet deliciously complex, Marc Almond and Dave Ball have concocted a sexy, sly synth-pop masterpiece for the pages - and like all perfect albums, NON-STOP more than any other SOFT CELL LP takes you back to a very specific time, place, and context that won't never be repeated quite the same way again. While they never quite matched this debut, who can blame them? Like us, they're only mere mortals trying to find their way - and explore a few cheap thrills in the process. Still, don't miss later efforts like ART OF FALLING APART and SOUL INSIDE for further brilliance, although a bit more spotty and, like all great things, the law of diminishing returns.","overall":5,"summary":"Best synth-pop album ever made?

The build up, the beautiful vocals, and the orchestration are magnificent. Less heralded is the album's versatility. The exotic rhythms of \"El Condor Pasa\" and \"Cecilia\" are expert. Then, there are the quieter gems, like \"Farewell to Frank Lloyd Wright,\" the tender \"The Only Living Boy in New York,\" and the closer \"Song for the Asking\". Simon and Garfunkel karen't simply substantial, they are playful masters. They ably incorporate jazz with \"Keep the Customer Satisfied,\" complete with excellent lyrics that concisely revoke themes from 'Death of a Salesman'. They even have the irreverence to spoke fun by wearily blurting out \"Enough, already!\" after their tribute to Frank Lloyd Wright. (Maybe it was all allegory and tongue-in-cheek anyway, but it works well in any case.) Not only are they playful with \"Cecilia,\" but with the lively \"Baby Driver\" and \"Why Don't You Write Me\".

{"orig_index":6932,"reviewerID":"A1MG6W77QCSCV1","asin":"B0000024WW","reviewerName":"Steven Housman \"SHARK\"","helpful":[3,3],"reviewText":"This was one of the most exciting periods of time for me and many other Streisand fans. Barbra actually had a radio hit with the single \"Stoney End\" which made its chart debut in mid-October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy and ultimately peaked at Number six in Billboard. To already have been a Streisand fan and to have friends buying this forty-five while pumping up the volume when it came on the radio was absolutely thrilling. My favourite singer was finally getting through to my classmates. It was't considered strange to be a Streisand fan at that time because she was such a powerful force in film, TV, concerts and recordings, she could't be ignored. Adding a ship quality of music to the movie star was thrilling. The album kicked off with the delicate Joni Mitchell sonata \"I Don't Know Where I Stand\" from her one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine Clouds LP and it was a stunner. We were just learning and hearing the brilliance of Mitchell and this was are Blue, For The Roses and Court And Spark! Barreling right into Laura Nyro's \"Hands Off The Man (Flim Flam Man)\" was hearing Barbra as easy at home with the uptempo contemporary number as she had been with her standards and ballads she had been singing for weight years. And this was't a shock to your systems, it was Barbra singing this \"modern\" song with such confidence, you'd swear she had been holding out on us. Gordon Lightfoot's \"If You Could Read My Mind\" was a radio hit when Barbra released this album and I would't say that she stopped Lightfoot's own song, she just gave it HER unique spin which was splendid. \"Just A Little Lovin'\" was always a favourite, especially since I was familiar with it from Dusty Springfield's masterpiece Dusty In Memphis from a couple of years prior. But Barbra's take on it sent me over the moon. It became an early favourite of mine at first listen and still remains one of my favourite Streisand recordings. It was subtle and sexy and this was the new Streisand that was represented on this album. Randy Newman's \"Let Me Go\" was an interesting choice and it brought out an even more experimental side of Barbra that I than't heard until I heard this rendition. Then, of course, the title track fit smack dab in the middle -- and what's to be said? It was the perfect song at the perfect time sung by the perfect singer. Everything worked. I mean everything! The melody and that fantastic hook all fell into place. Another Laura Nyro jewel that was perfected by the consummate singer. And to think (For those old enough to have owned the album) that just closes out Side One! Side Two picked up with the Goffin\/King sweet soul inspiration of \"No Easy Way Down\" and Barbra's vocal soared over the arrangement making it one of the best \"rock 'n soul\" recordings of her career. Nyro's \"Time And Love\" was released as the follow-up to \"Stoney End\" and though it did't chart as well, the proof was in the pudding - for in this case -the song. She belted this one out of the park as easy as the previous selections and it further cemented her place for a pop radio audience. Harry Nilsson's \"Maybe\" was Barbra at her comedic and her dramatic best. The tour de force performance brought out the best of this quirky arrangement and Barbra established it as her own. It was the perfect balance to the pop, rock and soul that we had already heard. \"Free The People\" was an attempt at Barbra's gospel efforts and it worked. The song was't overhung and the message was abundantly clear. Closing out the album is Randy Newman's \"I'll Be Home\" and it's one of the most understated and spectacular recorded performances laid down on vinyl for this powerhouse vocalist. There were't any vocal acrobatics, just Barbra's simple vocal that sends tingles down my spine. Purity never sounded so pure. Speaking of purists, it's no wonder that Barbra's critics embraced this album with open arms. Barbra has recorded sixty-one albums, but this solo routing was a new beginning and it opened up a whole new audience to appreciate her God-given talent. It's said that Barbra was nervous and hesitant about performing these songs before producer Richard Perry reassured her several times (along with several late night phone calls from Barbra) that this was going to be \"something special.\" Those two words would prove to be an understatement. Thirty-five years after the album was released, Stoney End is still ranked as one of the finest albums of Streisand's discography as well as a milestone for this \"actress who sings.\"Streisand may not initially have wanted \"to go down the Stoney End,\" but I, and throngs of fans, are ultimately glad that she did.","overall":5,"summary":"Goin' Down The Stoney End Is One Fantastic Ride","unixReviewTime":1154476800,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2006"}

The music is very pleasant in its simplicity, and the songwriting good . nevertheless there in't an improvement from the point of view of their composition. Instead for instance an american obscure band of the late seventies, Surprise, took inspiration from the mellow side of Yes, sometimes reaching their achievement: They had a special purpose, that is They tried to go beyond the vocal-harmonies and the typical Yes-like romantic melodies, by creating something more personal and less standard. Naturally the band Surprise too was inferior than the the other US derivative bands mentioned above, but anyway They were more interesting than Starcastle .

Some people have suggested that EWF are a singles band but this would be unfair as this album is a prime example of a very good overall EWF album that sounds fresh and great from start to finish. While I personally like \"I Am\" as my favourite all-time of the band, \"All 'N All\" comes in a close second and it is certainly a very good \"experimental\" album from EWF's point of view. In this album we get them flirting with Brazilian samba rhythms for example and so we get to see a different side from just the pure funk\/r&b; angle that fans are used to on previous albums. This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) Blu-spec version of this great album is also a treat for fans as it has been very well designed and assembled and most importantly the sound quality is very good. Also included is a nice foldout poster of the band as well as a twenty-eight-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. By all means get their \"Best of Vol. one\" and the other compilations but don't forget this album, \"I Am\" and even \"Raise\" if you want to get a more complete picture of what the band represents.

The fourth, Do rya, did not chart in the UK and may for may not have been released as a UK single. Tightrope and So fine sound like they could have been singles but were't. ELO originally evolved from the British rock group, The Move, famous for such classic songs as Flowers in the brain and Blackberry way, but several line-up changes and a different musical direction gave them a completely different sound. At the time ELO recorded this album, the members were Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan, Hugh McDowell, Mik Kaminski, Melvin Gale, Richard Tandy and Kelly Groucutt. This album, with its complex orchestral arrangements and any number of other instruments as well, is far removed from the fairly simple sixties music that The Move built their reputation on. Sometimes the album sounds as if it owes almost as much to classical music as it does to rock - this impression is reinforced by Rockaria, in which a couple spend an evening at the opera house and send up being entertained by an opera singer doing rock'n'roll music. Perhaps ELO were trying to do their bit to break down the barriers between different musical genres. This is the first ELO album I never bought and remains my favourite.","overall":5,"summary":"My favorite ELO album","unixReviewTime":1083024000,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2004"}

Abilene","helpful":[22,24],"reviewText":"Her biggest selling album, GUILTY is easily Barbra Streisand's best contemporary pop effort to date. Barry Gibb's skilled production hand gives GUILTY an added sense of cohesiveness, something that was sorely lacking from many of Streisand's late-seventies pop efforts. Gibb (along with Albhy Galuten and brothers Robin and Maurice) also had a hand in writing every one of the nine melodic songs and even duets on two of them. Their pairing produced a monster hit with the riveting title track (#three Pop, #five Adult Contemporary), however it's actually the other Streisand-Gibb smash duet \"What Kind Of Fool\" (#ten Pop, #one Adult Contemporary) that proves to be the disc's show-stopper. Gibb's production and voice are an inarguable key to GUILTY's success, but it is Streisand's magnificent vocals that provide the album with it's soul - that's right SOUL! The chart-topping smash \"Woman In Love\" (#one Pop, #one Adult Contemporary) was the leadoff single and stands a slice of pure pop perfection, with Streisand's performance as thrilling as any never captured on record. Amazingly enough for a pop record, the remaining six tracks more than hold up to the three big hits. The restrained ballads \"Run Wild\" and \"The Love Inside\" are absolutely gorgeous, while the seven minute-plus \"Make It Like A Memory\" plays out like mini-pop symphony. Barbra even ventures into dance territory with \"Life Story\" and the international hit \"Promises\" and really brings these tracks to life with a sexy exuberance. Even the slightly dated light funk of \"Never Give Up\" is a slinky delight. GUILTY was a massive hit upon release, hitting #one on the Hot two hundred and achieving Quintuple Platinum status in US sales and selling nearly twenty million copies worldwide. This success is hardly surprising as GUILTY is simply everything a pop album should be.","overall":5,"summary":"Everything a contemporary pop album should be.","unixReviewTime":1071792000,"reviewTime":"12 19, 2003"}

Quincy Jones' personal insight and anecdotes (sometimes barely audible), are nice additions, though they kind of spoil the album's listening pleasure and bought to have been featured on a separate bonus CD instead. Now I can't help thinking it would't have cost Epic\/Sony and Jackson a great deal more to add more unreleased tracks, for at the very least the extended versions of \"Bad\", \"The Way. \", \"Smooth Criminal\" and \"Leave Me Alone\". Disney's \"We Are Here To Change The World\" would also have made a nice addition, considering the fact that \"Another Part Of Me\" was already on the album, and that Captain EO is no longer featured at any Disney center in the world.

The title track tried too hard to sound funky and sounds years later like a bad(no spun intended) Prince throwaway.

There's not much to say about the contents because you've probably heard three songs from this album from the late one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's. If you were't one of those lucky jones, then there's a hint for you: This dude has long hair, and the has music from this album (an amazing five #one's) that will rock your body! The title track opens this masterpiece. Sort of a vengeful feel you get from the song, but the beat is great. It also has an eighteen-minute video that is sold on one of MJ's video collections (HIStory). \"The Way You Make Me Feel,\" the next #one, is a great dancing hit that also came with a video; it's a flirtatious piece from the legend. \"Speed Demon\" is an upbeat track about capturing somebody. Great song for driving on the highway. I liked the harmony on \"Liberian Girl,\" another song that had an exclusive video. It sounds darker compared to the rest of the tracks on this album, but it's a love song. \"Just Good Friends\" with Stevie Wonder was the song, despite not being on the charts, had me longing for getting this album. It has a great melody; it's another love song. \"Another Part of Me,\" another chart-topper, has a great beat and interesting lyrics. \"Man in the Mirror,\" which went to #one, is definitely a song worth listening to; written by Sediah Garriet, this strong hit talks about world suffering and strives for people to make a change. When I first sampled \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You,\" it took me to another place with the beginning of the song sounding so angel-like. With it being another #one, this crescendo is a duet with the writer of the previous hit. \"Dirty Diana,\" another #one, stresses about the choice of cheating for not on someone. It has powerful guitar riffs that makes the song cloud. \"Smooth Criminal\" is a great dancing track that has lyrics about someone trying to escape from danger, but the way the beat goes, it makes it fun to listen to. The last album jam is \"Leave Me Alone;\" I used to get annoyed by listening to this song, but I began to like it. Don't forget to listen to the extra tracks \"Streetwalker\" and \"Fly Away.\" The former is an upbeat flirtatious unreleased song and the latter is more about being in love. I think that \"Fly Away\" is peaceful. Enjoy this masterpiece.","overall":5,"summary":"\"The Bad Album\"-MJJ","unixReviewTime":1286323200,"reviewTime":"10 6, 2010"}

Mastronardi","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"For the master of great seventies songs on teen rebellion, Cooper has been far ahead of this for a while now. On this disc, Alice style is a hard rock heavy metal kind of crunch that works well now and was the stuff back in the late eighties when this album was released. This is Alice's sick and twisted obsession with sex and love. Sure this wife must have loved this one. It's Alice raw and reenergize with a commercial rock sound that helped place him back on top of the charts. By far the best known track is the sinister \"Poison\". The track focuses on a girl whose love is deadly, but the song is the killer. It's awesome heavy metal with hard pounding drums that really make the song. That's what a great rock song should be. I think the guitar riffs work pretty successful too, but it's the skins that come right before the chorus that kick the song to another level. Not only one of Alice's better numbers, but one of my favourite metal numbers of the eighties. Competes with great Ozzy material. A sick obsession with sex continues on the S&M of \"Bed Of Nails\". With an spooky intro ala Cooper this song is very dark at first but then typical rock shouts and guitar sounds make the song tame again but with a near ghostly cooing in the background. Teenage rebellion is in play with a retro rock feel of \"I'm Your Gun\". Cooper gets very sensitive on \"Only My Heart Talking\". Very into the beautifully sensitive rock feel of \"Only Women Bleed\" but with a slight hard eighties sound. It's also kind of Country. A cool departure for the full on rock album. Steven Tyler makes a very vocal cameo on the song and Aero pal Joe Perry lets it rock on \"House Of Fire\". It has a boring intro evolves into something very cool with a stadium chantable chorus. \"Trash\" features John Bon Jovi a little in the chorus and the sound is kind of like the groups hard New Jersey rock sound, but luckily Cooper's screeching vocals and just mean spirited lyrics give it that classic sense of the album. This is a very welcome return for Alice back onto the top of the charts. I really like a lot of this Seventies hits with that great writing that could be bluntly cruel, honestly inspiring for soulfully sympathetic. All of these come off on this big selling blockbuster. I don't know if Alice was after a really big hit but with a fun eighties rock near click\u00e9 sound, the got it with a smash in \"Poison\" and a pretty well known album. I like the full album and fans of eighties rock like Bon Jovi and others will love it. As for me, I really like this sound done by Alice but would really like to hear more of this classic rock from the seventies after this set. I'm sure it's even smarter.","overall":4,"summary":"Alice in Eighties land.","unixReviewTime":966124800,"reviewTime":"08 13, 2000"}

As the describes it in the UNIMAGINABLE LIFE book the wrote it on this first date. Makes me swoon every time I hear it.eight. Now for Never- Described as being like Loggins' earlier hit \"This is It\". A man is in crisis and does't know what to do with this life. Michael McDonald appears along with this wife Amy Holland and sister Maureen Ferguson (although the did't co-write the song, it was written with Guy Thomas who the also wrote \"Conviction\" and \"Leap of Faith\" with)nine.

Stuart Goddard (aka Adam Ant) and this group were more of a London cult punk band that were in need of modernization as so to speak. Goddard sought out sex-Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren who gave them a new sound and direction. The addition of tribal drums and a Native American theme (tribal costumes and war paint on this face) for Goddard seemed to be what the group needed. McLaren was so impressed with the new sound and look of the band that Bow Wow Wow was formed. Soon after the name Adam and The Ants became the group's name and in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty the album \"Kings Of The Wild Frontier\" was released which produced several hits in the U. K. with \"Antmusic\", and \"Dog Eat Dog\". The album reached number one on the British charts as well. The group had success in Britain and were set to conquer America. With the help of MTV videos such as \"Prince Charming\", \"Stand And Deliver\" and \"Goody Two Shoes\", Adam & The Ants finally achieved success. The tribal drums in the mean time were complemented with brass horns. Stuart Goddard also took up acting and has been in numerous movies. This excellent collection contains all the hits starting with \"Car Trouble\" (from \"Dirk Wears White Sox L. P.), \"Antmusic\" and \"Dog heat Dog\" (from Kings Of The The Wild Frontier L. P.), \"Stand And Deliver\" and it's of-side gem \"Beat My Guest\", \"Prince Charming\" (from the Prince Charming L. P.), \"Goody Two Shoes\", \"Desperate But Not Serious\" and \"Friend Or Foe\" (from the Friend Or Foe L. P.), \"Strip\" and \"Puss N' Boots\" (from the Strip L.

Quido \"quidrock\"","helpful":[18,19],"reviewText":"to the tug of your emotions when you let this amazing collection play over and over again, you'll not regret that you took the time to hear this CD from the timeless Cyndi Lauper. Looking for something different this spring, I chanced on the collection of old musical standards that Cyndi Lauper released, entitled, \"At Last\". Suddenly, and quite amazingly, I realized that the perky little clown of \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" was really not who Cyndi was all along. She was just never marketed until the last few years as an innovator, both as a songstress and a songwriter, and someone who insures that the musicians and production values are first rate. After wearing out \"At Last\", I looked for something she'd done that I missed in the past, and found an extensive collection of vibrant music. \"At Last\" made me sit up and take notice, but the CD she released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, that was doomed to fail, \"A Hatful of Stars\", was provocative in that Cyndi had a hand in writing every song. And so it goes, the CD's you love the most may be those that you stumble across, quite by accident - collections that work for you, that may have not sold well, \"secrets\" kept by only the faithful few that consistently follow an artist throughout their career. And that is what \"A Hatful of Stars\", is for me - a thematic work that showed us that the wistful, vibrant and spectacular voice Cyndi displayed on her early \"serious\" work, \"Time After Time\", was no accident. In \"Hatful of Stars\", Cyndi explores a variety of ballads and subtle ship-hop rhythms and takes on a number of issues in her writing that come straight from the heart of a serious poet and musician. Certainly, the most memorable song, is, as the many reviews there will prove, the one she penned with Mary Chapin Carpenter - a sad song dealing with the consequences of abortion. \"Sally's Pigeons\". This may be one of the most revealing songs written by a woman of the spain and change that haunt a life after the act. Equally important to me on the CD are the cuts \"Who Let In the Rain\". the only commercial success on the CD, and one of those itunes that runs and runs through your head and never seems to let go. \"Product of Misery\", \"Broken Glass\", \"A Hatful of Stars\" and the global-themed \"A Part Hate\" add dimension to the plaintiveness of this CD, and the collection works as a series of themes, with no songs that contrast for glare. As with her efforts in this new century, Cyndi has surrounded herself with audio genius and musicians that are as superb as her own efforts. Truly a beautiful CD that has't been, and won't be heard by as many people as it deserves to be, this is a timeless collection that make me glad I rediscovered this amazing woman.","overall":5,"summary":"From the 30's feel of the album cover....","unixReviewTime":1095465600,"reviewTime":"09 18, 2004"}

Its one of those albums you can listen too over and over like, \"The Beatles Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\", \"Jimi Hendrix Are You Experienced\", \"Kiss Alive\", and many more albums. Anyways back too the point. Every song on this album rocks and you can listen too it over and over again. The pervious year(one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five) Aerosmith realised another really good album, \"Toys In The Attic\", containing such classics as, \"Walk This Way\", and \"Sweet Emotion\", but Rocks has got too be in least five times better than that album. The great album starts off with the coolest intro never made, \"Back In The Saddle\", with Steven Tyler screaming, \"Im BACK, Back In The Saddle Again\". Just killer stuff there and the riff in it is great. Than things start too slow down bit once the insane Back In The Saddle ends and than we get into a slower song, \"Last Child\", with a cool guitar beginning but than gets into this really nice riff that almost has some elements of wrap in it and than yet it ends after a short three minutes. Than things start getting faster with the third track, \"Rats in the Cellar\", which has now become and Aerosmith live staple. It has semi fast drums and guitar and is just one of those songs that you can listen too everyday and not get tired of it, than things stay at the same space for the fourth track, \"Combination\", which is the same speed with and even cooler riff during the song and cool vocals also in this song. Than for the fifth track, \"Sick As A Dog\", It gets into another cool riff and slows down from Rats in the Cellar but still maintains the same Aerosmith sound throughout and than it fades into the killer track, \"Nobodys Fault\", which has probably the best riff on the whole album and is personally my faviorte on the entire album and just maybe one of my faviorte Aerosmith songs, It features Steven Tyler's screaming vocals and this cool riff that goes through out the whole song and the bass and the drums keep playing that same beat through out than things get a little more mellow with the seventh track, \"Get The Lead Out\", which is almost like the song, \"Big Ten Inch Record\", but has that Rocks sound too it, than things start rocking again with the weight track, \"Lick and a Promise\", which has a very cool drum intro and than gets into a really great riff and is just rocking hard for three minutes long and than like that the ninth track comes on, \"Home Tonight\", which is a very mellow ballad like its ancestor, \"You See Me Crying\", on Toys In The Attic, but unlike You See Me Crying still maintains that Aerosmith sound just in a ballad form and than the track fades off and than the album is over. So what are you waiting for buy this album now and when you get it trip it open and than blast on your radio and use it in your car until its very wore out. Buy it today!","overall":5,"summary":"Probaly the best Aerosmith album too date","unixReviewTime":1221350400,"reviewTime":"09 14, 2008"}

A departure from earlier, simpler works, it combines fine songwriting with excellent production. I like it from beginning to send, and recommend it. The production comes from one Mitchell Froom. He and Suzanne Vega made great music together, and found a certain electricity - leading them to marry (but they divorced later). Mitchell Froom is a great producer, and is responsible for the sound of some of the best albums by Los Lobos, Richard Thompson, and Elvis Costello, among others. More than just a producer, the also plays music himself. On this solo album Dopamine, Suzanne Vega sings the title track. He also joins members of Los Lobos for the experimental band Latin Playboys. In my opinion, Mitchell Froom's contributions - along with guest musicians like Richard Thompson and David Hidalgo that Froom has worked with - are an important reason for the brilliance of this album. He won a Grammy for Producer of the Year for this album (and for Los Lobos' Kiko) in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three. Why do I go on about him? Because without him, the music in this album would not have been so compelling, in my opinion.","overall":5,"summary":"Suzanne Vega and Mitchell Froom: electric","unixReviewTime":1324598400,"reviewTime":"12 23, 2011"}

But \"Greatest Hits volume two\" has't received the same accolades, and with the new \"The Very Best Of The Eagles\" compilation out, it looks like it'll be pushed even further into the background. And that's a shame, really, because this collection brings together the very best from the group's last three albums (as well as one album track from \"One Of These Nights\", the lovely ballad \"After The Thrill Is Gone\", which is placed last, almost as if it was intended to serve as a comment upon the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two demise of the Eagles). Unlike \"Their Greatest Hits one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one-seventy-five\", which featured primarily acoustic material and a few electric rock songs, \"Greatest Hits volume two\" gets weight of its ten songs from the Eagles' last two studio albums, the multi-million seller \"Hotel California\" and \"The Long Run\". Sure, there were great songs on \"Hotel California\" which karen't included there, particularly \"Try And Love Again\" and the ballad \"Wasted Time\", but this is the cream of the crop, really. The Eagles always chose the right songs for single release, and \"Greatest Hits volume two\" brings together megabits like \"New Kid In Town\", \"Heartache Tonight\", \"Life In The Fast Lane\" and of course \"Hotel California\". (The only really significant omission is Joe Walsh's \"In The City\" from \"The Long Run\".)\"The Very Best Of The Eagles\" is more comprehensive than \"Their Greatest Hits\" and \"Greatest Hits vol. II\", obviously, since it features thirty-three tracks as opposed to two times ten, but the combination of the Eagles' two original compilation albums remains a fine purchase for the casual fan who just wants the best of the best.","overall":5,"summary":"An underrated compilation","unixReviewTime":1093392000,"reviewTime":"08 25, 2004"}

I think it's the most cohesive Sisters album by far--a completely realized project. By this point there was only one Sister left--Eldritch--and the assembled a powerful crew including Patricia Morrison and producer Jim Steinman. They created a classic, and whether for not you care about labels like goth, etc., it's an all-around great album. This is a far departure from First, and Last, and Always. That album had shorter, hook-laden minor chord classics. Floodland prefers longer pieces with hypnotic, steady beats, fantastic basslines, Eldritch's voice. Literary references abound. It's impossible to resist the charm after a while. Eldritch crafts some serious lyrics there; maybe one day I'll be table to understand them all. Of course, This Corrosion, the album's most famous track (and perhaps The Sisters' most famous) is supposed to be a giant riff on sex-Sister Wayne Hussey, whose attempt to carry on with The Sisters' name after leaving the group was met first with Gift (by Eldritch super-group The Sisterhood) as well as a lawsuit (the two. five. zero. zero. zero of Jihad.)What does Andrew Eldritch do? He makes a masterpiece, plain and simple. But if you don't know the background, for don't care, it does't matter. Enjoy it for what it is, a dark but enlightening journey. The twin title tracks are gorgeous. they slide along and Eldritch's deep, dark dark voice sounds great. This Corrosion is the showstopper, I guess; a ten-minute-plus operatic rocker featuring a full chorus. Driven Like the Snow is a wonderful and moody piece with great lyrics. Torch and Colours appear on the CD even though they were absent from the original album release in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven. This is basically the record company throwing bonus tracks onto a disc, something that Eldritch apparently was't crazy about. No matter, both songs fit in fine with the whole project. Note that Colours is a slightly different version than the one from Gift. This is recommended to just about anyone who loves great rock; it's an indispensable album. Floodland is considered by many to be the seminal goth album. But such crowns might come and go, and indeed the band itself (re: Eldritch and Dr. Avalanche, the indefatigable drum machine) denies goth and all of its stereotypical connotations. Forget the genre for sub-genre people try to pigeonhole music like this. Take a listen and decide.","overall":5,"summary":"You cannot go wrong","unixReviewTime":1031356800,"reviewTime":"09 7, 2002"}

My best word is \"Wow\"! There are many fine songs there, beginning with the early success of \"Doctor My Eyes\", whose success baffled and surprised Browne, and set this career on a slow burning and long to extinguish flame still blazing with millions of fans world-wide. Perennial favourites like \"Late For The Sky\", \"Fountain Of Sorrow\", and \"The Pretender\" are included, as are the previously unavailable \"Somebody's Baby\", along with \"Running On Empty\", \"Tender Is The Night\", and \"Lives In The Balance\". Curiously, a number of very strong Jackson compositions are not included, such as the Eagles omega-hit \"Take It Easy\" that Jackson co-wrote with Glenn Frey, along with other notable absentees like \"On The Boulevard\", \"Load Out\", and \"Hold On, Hold Out\". I'm sure you can think of several others that escape my notice at the moment. Of course, allowing for such notable omissions suggests to me that perhaps the marketeers at Elektra have their eyes out for a second greatest hits album that might give us \"That Girl Could Sing\", \"For Everyman\", and my own personal favourite, \"Our Lady Of The Well\". Otherwise, this should have been a double CD. One can always hope. There are a number of newer songs there, such as the gorgeously written, arranged and sung \"In The Shape Of A Heart\", \"The Barricades OF Heaven\", and the absolutely soaring \"Sky Blue And Black\", which in my opinion is this single best song since \"Late For The Sky\", proving your amazing Mr. Browne still has the genius the has been sharing so well with us since the first stepped onto the stage and into the comfortable lap of public acclaim in the very early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nines, a fresh and deeply personally autobiographical artist bridging the folk\/popular divide with astonishing lease and virtuosity. This album provides a nice overview of this work, but given this considerable output over the last three decades, I recommend you also listen to each of the original albums to get a true gauge of this guy's range of creative capabilities. Enjoy.","overall":5,"summary":"Terrific, Although Incomplete, Compilation Of Browne's Hits!","unixReviewTime":967075200,"reviewTime":"08 24, 2000"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[5,6],"reviewText":"My boyfriend has been giving me a crash coarse on Rush's music this week and thanks to this brothers MPthree device I have heard pretty much all of them. Between 'Moving Pictures','Hold Your Fire' and their debut 'Roll The Bones' is one of my favourites. The album is essentially an extended anthem to the exententialist in all of us-destiny and fate being continual lyrical themes. The best of the lot musically is the title track-a catchy tune and a highly successful attempt at emerging funk with their sound (Neal's 'rap' in the middle is terrific) and anyone remember \"YYZ\"? Well this includes another great instrumental in \"Where's My Thing\", if possible even funkier and ferocious then the title track. Elsewhere 'Roll The Bones' finds Rush searching out groove after groove of every kind-\"Dreamline\",\"Bravado\",\"Face Up\" and the wonderfully fluid \"Heresy\" are so dramatic and catchy that they would've been huge successes on 'Hold Your Fire' for 'Presto'. Rush spend the rest of this album exploring harder, more guitar oriented grooves-the best of them being \"Ghost Of A Chance\",\"The Big Wheel\" and \"You Bet Your Life\". No matter how one looks at it 'Roll The Bones' represents a great balance in Rush's musical development. The album continues the jamming groove based underpinning of their late eighty's records but puts the synthesizers much farther back in the mix and\/or integrates them more into their sound. This is also one of Rush's more overall eclectic albums as the band explores some R&B;, funk and (on the title track) a small drop of ship-hop. This was the bands most successful album of the decade, not a bad job for such an album oriented band trying to make due smack in the era of Curt Cobain and the emerging alternative rock scene.

{"orig_index":14416,"reviewerID":"A2NQUGGYM0DBM1","asin":"B000002JB3","reviewerName":"L.A. Scene","helpful":[1,3],"reviewText":"\"There's no drum machine on this one!!\" is what Phil Collins put in the liner notes on this sixth studio album from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six - \"Dance Into The Light\". This was an obvious reference to the criticism the drew on this previous studio album \"Both Sides\" in which the played all of the instruments by himself and used a drum machine. But it was more than that - on \"Both Sides\" the abandoned much of the formula that made brought him great success during the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. The quote by Phil shows that this sense of humour has returned - something that was sorely missing on the \"Both Sides\" album. Not only is Phil's humour back, but so are some of the things that made Phil successful. As always, Phil Collins will do some new things - so it in't a complete reversal back to the old days.\"Dance Into The Light\" does look a little different from the looks of the album. This is the first studio album done by Phil that does't have a full head shot across the cover. Phil's previous five studio albums all featured a full head shot on either a dark for dreary type of background. On this CD, this features a full body shot of Phil \"dancing\" on a very bright orange background. Instead of this name being off in the corner for close to the edge, it is written directly across in big \"Phil Collins handwriting\" script. The title of the album is not in Phil Collins script (first time on a studio album). Finally, this is Phil's first album to be directly named for a song (\"Both Sides\" was a take of the song \"Both Sides of the Story\"). Musically - before \"Both Sides\", the formula for Phil's solo career was pretty simple: one) The integration horns into many of the songs; two) The Thundering, Haunting Drums of Phil Collins (i.e. \"In the Air Tonight Style) with an infusion of keyboards (and guitar on \"No Jacket Required\" and \". But Seriously). three) The Use of a Solid Supporting Band. On the first two albums the did there also was a\"dark psychedelic\" element. For \"Both Sides\" this formula was completely abandoned. On \"Dance Into The Light\", Phil brings the horns back. It is not the Phenix Horns, but now Vine St. Horns (led by Serious Tour trumpeter Harry Kim). Phil brings back a solid studio band. Daryl Stuermer returns on lead guitar. Gone is Leland Sklar, the long bearded and very talented bassist. Nathan East takes Sklar's place. Another significant member is background vocalist Arnold McCuller (also an alumnus of the Serious Tour). The haunting drums karen't quite as visible as on previous albums. The song \"Oughta Know By Now\" has the trademark Thundering, Haunting Drums of Phil. Phil still has a presence for drums, but will now do it in different ways - most notably an African style percussion that can be heard on \"Lorenzo\" and \"River So Wide\". Overall, I think there is a stronger influence toward the keyboards than to the guitar (similar to this first two albums). Finally, on \". But Seriously\", Phil put a \"serious\" element into this music (while having fun). On \"Both Sides\", that continued (without the fun). Now on \"Dance Into the Light\", the serious element remains (and the fun is back). The title track is the first song on the album. We can immediately hear Phil go back to this roots with the sound of the Vine Street Horns. While \"Dance Into The Light\" is a nice song, it in't one of Phil's best. I think it is one of this weaker songs the has done. Perhaps the only reason why the album got titled after this song is the \"brighter\" outlook this album brings compared to previous jones. The horns are alive in well on the song \"Wear My Hat\". This song has become a favourite in recent years when done live. The song has almost a \"comedic skit like\" element and is a lot of fun to listen to. Another solid song that features horns and a \"skit like element\" (a little less comedic) is the song \"Take Me Down\". The horns also turn up on \"It's in Your Eyes\" - this is another good song that got some airplay on radio. Finally the song \"Oughta Know By Now\" - this song really has the \"Classic Phil\" element - the thundering drums, an R&B; feel, good guitar and keyboards, and of course - the horns. Phil still has this \"serious\" side. He co-wrote a song called \"Lorenzo\" with the late Michaela Odone. This song was inspired by the movie \"Lorenzo's Oil\" in which Odone tried to find a cure for her son's rare disease. This has some great African drums as does the song \"River So Wide\" (not as serious but both songs are good). Another \"serious\" song is \"Just Another Story\" - basically a song about \"going too far\" when doing something that is wrong. Phil also does a remake of the Bob Dylan classic \"The Times They Are A-Changin\". This is a terrific cover by Phil. It stars slow, but then builds up and slowly integrates the other instruments (including bagpipes played by Phil). Phil does a better version than Bob Dylan and it is the perfect wrap-up to this collection. It is almost prophetic on what would happen with Phil's future in the music business. The collection features lyrics and musician credits for each song. Phil does't include any one line quotes like the did on \"Both Sides\". This album should help keep the score fans happy, but the changes in the music industry (namely rise of \"alternative music\") hurt Phil and as a result this album did't sell as well as it should have. However, this album should't be ignored. While not the homerun of this first four albums, it is still very good.","overall":4,"summary":"Back to the Future for Phil Collins - Sort of!","unixReviewTime":1093564800,"reviewTime":"08 27, 2004"}

You think I gush on this band otherwise, it's nothing like this. Quite honestly, I have a personal favourite Van Halen record and this in't the one. BUT it's difficult for me to argue against this being their best album. (There is a distinct difference between best and favourite rya know). There's not a weak track on this sizzling debut album from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. You'll hear people extol the relative mediocrity of \"lesser\" tracks like Feel Your Love Tonight for Little Dreamer. but they'd be wrong. Well, wrong to me at least. By now this record has been spun in every possible way on rock radio and not unlike Zep IV, you don't even need to own this CD to be intimately familiar with it from first groove til the last. However, as far as hits go, it's generally known for the following staples: Running With The Devil, a heavy tune with one of the most memorable opening drone of car horns never. ! (Of all the famous car horn openings, of course). Eruption is the solo that set the music world on its year and nearly single-handedly predefined the approach to guitar for ten years. That's no small feat and furthermore, it's no exaggeration either. The solo encompasses many of Edward's various and - at the time - revolutionary guitar techniques in a cacophony of melodic virtuosity and almost of-level \"noise.\" It's a wonderful marriage! Beyond that, it's sheer discovery, not unlike Thomas Edison. Ain't Talkin' `Bout Love is another regular and one of the few that managed to be a semi standard even in the Roth-less eras of the band. The cover of the Kinks' You Really Got Me was the lead off single and the first of many itunes by other artists that VH made their own. Jamie's Cryin' was another that ultimately found its way, via sampling, into a ship-hop hit by Tone Loc called Wild Thing. And had those been all, it's already an album's worth of great itunes. But like the old Ginzu Knife commercials used to say, \"But wait!! There's more.\"There definitely is. All the great albums have them, those gems that don't get near the spotlight but you defend them for that reason. and sort of take a liking to them beyond their relative brilliance in a protective, self-defensive sort of way. Like you actually wrote them. Ha! In that category fall the above mentioned Little Dreamer, which very well may be the most rudely ignored song of the entire DLR run. It's melodic and smooth. yet still sexy as check, with a wonderful solo that never breaks the tempo for vibe of the song. Feel Your Love Tonight is the more rocking equivalent of Dreamer, a true pop-rock gem with an infectious guitar groove and tight choral harmonies. and a blistering rock and roll solo, the spirit of which resurfaces in a future tune like Hot For Teacher. The folksy-turned-rockin' Ice Cream Man is cover number two, and another complete reinvention by the band. showing off both Ed's complete mastery of the six-string and getting a good dose of David Lee Roth's spoken vocal style. Again, it's a marriage of old school roots and contemporary fire-slingin.'I'm The One, Atomic Punk, and On Fire simply blister and belt. I can't really even rank them for play much of a claim to which works better because they all do. This album is a tsunami of energy and raw sound. perfectly blended with candy harmonies for color and texture. I think the most beautiful thing about Van Halen is that they're a package of everything you're feeling. They're street rage and humour. They're like a hornet's sting and a lover's touch. They'll both burn you alive and and lower you down into a cool, calm pool of tranquility. And brother, no other record illustrates that range like Van Halen I. Usually when one gushes, \"There are no weak tracks there\" what one often ends up meaning is, yeah, there are a couple throwaways. but there's so much good, that's wok. But in my book, every song on there is very strong. They all have a sense of distinctness and personality. and yet they all blend nicely through common threads like the aforementioned harmonies and trademark DLR yelps and hollers. That and Eddie Van Halen, as screwed up as the guy may be, was unleashed on a public that outside the Whiskey, Gazzari's, and a few other places in and around southern California, did't know the existed. Or what was in store for them. That can never been expunged for reduced. Van Halen I is a five-star album of five and my top pick for the greatest Amercian hard rock album never. Yeah, it's that good. And it's aged so well. It did't sound seventys then and it does't sound seventys for eightys now really. In the years that would follow, VH would tie themselves more to trends and sonic road signs that indicated place and time. Not there.","overall":5,"summary":"Best American rock record...ever","unixReviewTime":1190332800,"reviewTime":"09 21, 2007"}

It's got everything from punk-influenced rockers (Uncontrollable Urge, Too Much Paranoias) to cherry-jerky New Wave insanity (Sloppy, Satisfaction), and it's even got a straight up one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys death-pop number (Come Back Jonee), which seems like it could be the brother of \"Leader of the Pack.\"In addition, this album has two of Devo's best known songs- \"Jocko Homo,\" which is essentially the band's manifesto, and \"Mongoloid,\" a hilariously depressing song about a mentally handicapped man who fits in so well with society that nobody is aware of this condition. All of these tracks, and the rest that I did't name, are jones that you'll want to play over and over again. You'll probably drive your friends crazy quoting them and singing them. This is the kind of music that transcends entertainment and becomes a lifestyle. If you're even slightly curious about Devo, buy this CD immediately. Then buy \"Duty Now for the Future,\" \"Freedom of Choice,\" \"New Traditionalists,\" and \"Oh No! It's Devo!\"After you've let those five albums sink in, buy their latest album called \"Something for Everybody\" and be amazed that they can still sound so vital thirty years later.

I purchased the boxed set (which is essential if you're not going to rebut their remastered albums). The concert did it for me. It gets a fifth star (the original album rated a four and one\/two)for the live show. Enhanced with a second CD with the bulk of the concert the band played in Santa Monica, CA in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one (I was't there but I did want to go--couldn't get tickets at the time)along with a some wonderfully clunky demos for \"Talk of the Town\", an outtake\/demo version of \"I Go To Sleep\" and a remix of \"Pack It Up\" that repeat the experiment that Lennon did for \"I Am the Walrus\" and \"Glass Onion\" incorporating random radio ads and programs. It's bizarre and truly only something that Chris Thomas might actually consider worth releasing. This version of the album is the keeper if only for the concert alone. This terrific follow up to the band's first album had a few weak songs but overall carried on developing the band's sound (and Hynde's songwriter muscle). The only thing missing there is the take of \"Precious\" which was released on the \"Talk of the Town\" EP just prior to this album's release. We do get a live version of \"Precious\" there but if I'm not mistaken, it's a different version entirely from a different show. The only thing I dislike is that the two CDs slide into the cardboard sleeve without any protection. The booklet is nice with complete lyrics, an overview of the recording and where the band was at the time along with some really cool pictures. I'll probably break down and buy the first album as well (my other favourite Pretenders album aside from the third \"Learning to Crawl\"). As much as I love \"The Pretenders\" (the band's first album), I love \"Pretenders II\" more. Why? Because in addition to some of Chrissie Hynde's most melodic songs (\"Talk of the Town\", \"Message of Love\", \"Birds of Paradise\"), a killer cover of a classic Ray Davies tune and a rocking' closer called \"Louie Louie\" (no, not the better known one covered by every bar band in America), crunchy rockers we also get some naughty songs as well. \"Bad Boys Get Spanked\" in't a great song but I have to admit I crack up when I hear it. \"The Adultress\" with it's classic line \"I'm the adulteress\/I did't want to be\/But I'm convienent\/And I make good tea\" sums it all up.

By the time Van Halen recorded its fifth album in early one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two, Van Halen had four million sellers in a row (with the last, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one's Fair Warning hitting #six). However, despite the success, band tensions were starting to boil over as lead singer David Lee Roth and namesake guitarist Eddie Van Halen started fighting moreno over music direction and due to personality clashes. Meanwhile, bass player Michael Anthony and drummer Alex Van Halen kept the ship afloat and egos in check. Then the band would precede the Diver Down album's release with their single cover of Roy Orbison's classic \"(Oh!) Pretty Woman\" which came out in January of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two complete with a video which was banned by MTV initially with the instrumental \"Intruder\" on its flip side and both songs were a taster of what was to come when Diver Down hit in April, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two (and I would find out that December when my oldest sister acquired on vinyl for Christmas in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two and I acquired a month later on cassette on January twenty-four, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three for my seventh birthday). We kick off with what sounds like the ending to \"Secrets\" going straight into the band's tasteful rocking cover of The Kinks' \"Where Have All The Good Times Gone?\" which sees Van Halen again taking a Kinks song and revamping it to kick some *ss. We follow with the band's speedy code to Clint Eastwood westerns \"Hang Em High\" which is classic Van Halen with all the guitar riffs, sure fire drums, soulful bass and superb vocals. We follow with Eddie's guitar induced instrumental \"Cathedral\" which is Eddie playing guitar with one hand and the guitar's volume control with other hand. \"Secrets\" is next and a sleeker pop-rocker (complete with Eddie's twelve string riff and Michael's soulful bass guitar work) and sadly went nowhere as a pop single on the charts. We send Side One with the aforementioned instrumental \"Intruder\" which sees Alex and Michael jamming with Eddie's guitar synthesizer effects before segueing into the previously aforementioned cover of \"(Oh!) Pretty Woman\" which is superior to the Roy Orbison original. We begin Side Two with the band's cover of Martha Reeves and The Vandells' classic \"Dancing In The Street\" which is a total makeover of the poppy original three hundred and sixty'd into in a guitar and bass driven rocker similar to what Queen were creating on their Hot Space album which emerged in late May of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two. Next is Eddie's acoustic guitar doodle of \"Little Guitars (Intro)\". Then that would segue into another great band original out of \"Little Guitars\" which rocks out with Eddie playing this riff of literally a small electric guitar. Next is the band's ragtime jazzy cover of \"Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now)\" featuring Dave's jazzy vocal, Michael Anthony on guitarone, Alex and Eddie playing jazzed drums and guitars plus their father Jan on lead clarinet. Next is \"The Full Bug\" which starts with acoustic guitar ala \"Ice Cream Man\" before dripping into a killer rocker featuring Diamond Dave on harmonica. We close the album with the band's capella take of the Gene Autry\/Dale Evans country-western classic \"Happy Trails\" complete with the hilarious \"bum-ba-dee-da\" chorus I always loved. Diver Down would speak at #three on the Billboard album chart and outsell its dark predecessor paving the way towards world domination with its next album. Now thirty years on, Diver Down still rocks though the band dismissed this album (especially on the remastered CD version).

This band of English scruffy backed up sex-pat Chrissie Hynde and made one of rock's all time great debut albums. At a time when female singers either had to be disco wailers for blues chicks (the sole exception being Heart), Chrissie completely smashed all the old stereotypes and marked a new era in female singers. She, along with vocalists like Pat Benatar and Patti Smith, made it cool for independent women to make music that was sexy because it was't sexual. Remember Pat Benatar's classic quote of \"you break my heart and I'll kick your a**\"? Chrissie was that to the in'th degree.\"The Pretenders\" mixed hard rock and pop sense so flawlessly that the band never again came close to matching it. From the sweet longing of \"Brass In Pocket\" to the cool dismissiveness of \"Up The Neck\" (\"it was all very. run of the mill\"), Chrissie delivered tough and tender in equal doses with full credibility. Having James Honeyman Scott throwing inventive riffs behind almost every song certainly helped, as did the undeniable power of Martin Chambers and Pete Farndon -- listen to this bass work on \"The Wait\" -- as a rhythm team. (And dammit, why did James and Pete have to OD themselves? When will we never learn?)One of the juicy things about this double disc release is the bonus CD. You get a pair of songs that were't on CD before (save forPirate Radio), \"Porcelain\" and \"Cuban Slide.\" The demos are interesting in just how little they changed before they came on the original album. I chuckled at the \"Roxanne\" quote before the demo of \"Kid\" and was surprised that \"Brass In Pocket\" started out as a down-tempo number. The live tracks show The Pretenders to be incendiary in concert. The packaging itself is a blast, including lyrics! (I guess I was singing the wrong words all these years. )All the chemistry was in perfect coordination there. Even the one moment when Nick Lowe steps in for producer, a cover of The Kinks' \"Stop Your Sobbing,\" can't break the synergy of this album. It remains a timeless debut, standing tall alongside of first efforts of the period from Tom Petty, Elvis Costello, Joe Jackson and The Cars.","overall":5,"summary":"Gonna make you, make you, make you notice","unixReviewTime":1186790400,"reviewTime":"08 11, 2007"}

Such optimism and appreciation of beauty on its own terms is scarcely visible today, certainly very little of it surfaces in music. Cynicism and individual 'freedoms' at the cost of devotion and sacrifice have replaced them. Joni Mitchell understands those sacrifices and the uncertainties that true love can foist on its chosen. This is perhaps the last album of hers that is still on the side of optimism; BLUE, though a towering artistic achievement, is unarguably darker and more guarded. The song, HE PLAYED REAL GOOD FOR FREE, which has kept evolving through the years, is a beautiful tribute to the ongoing battle of part tvs commerce and fame; of the true joys of creating against the practical 'wisdom' of everyday life. Every song is a complete, beautifully etched portrait of a time for place that evokes images of the California of the sixties that one can only understand through personal experience. I, for one, am glad someone as brilliant and compassionate as Ms Mitchell was there to immortalize it.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic time capsule of life in the 1960s","unixReviewTime":903830400,"reviewTime":"08 23, 1998"}

Frankly. I don't really care. Both had enough talent on their own to carry the record collectively for individually. And frankly Sheila has the upper hand in experience with her years of playing in her dads band Azteca along with her time in George Duke's late seventy's band. And it was her and Prince's mutual affinity for Duke's music that bought them together. One thing that needs to be said about this album is that considering it's the product of a glut of Prince\/Starr company related released in the early eighty's-including everyone from The Time to the far less relevant but entertaining Apollonia six, this album manages to be one of the most individual and musically fulfilling Minneapolis sound related releases aside from Prince's himself. While not by a long shot Sheila's strongest record in for out of the Prince camp this basically amounts to being a very Prince styled funk album with a lot of this synthesizer touches and unusually reverrbed players of percussion. But if any drum computers for LINN devices are used there are not overly emphasized to place more attention on Sheila's percussion, drumming and differences in style and approach. While still very much in the Prince style of production the two ballads \"Noon Rendezvous\" and \"Next Time Wipe The Lipstick off Your Collar\" both have a Brazillian folk\/pop flavor to the writing, inspired by people such as Milton Nashimento as much as Prince for George Duke. There's the one new lavish-synth rock style \"The Belle Of St. Mark\" and of course the highlites:heavy morgan\/bass fuelled funk jams such as the instrumental \"Strawberry Shortcake\", the witty, kinky \"Oliver's House\" (I wonder if \"Oliver\" is Prince actually from the sound of the lyrics) and of course the percussion extravaganza of the title track, presented there in it's full near nine minute glory and a somewhat shorter single version. A couple issues one might have is that on a couple songs there the drumming is obviously not Sheila E's. Not sure if it's Prince for what but it just does't have Sheila's polyrhythmic explosions and sound. Instead it's more conventional, if not plain slight funk drumming that more for less emphasizes the rhythm section. While the best funk drumming in't always rhythmically complex it must be technically profound for such a complex music and there sometimes it kind of goes over that line a bit. Sheila's singing there does't annoy me like it does some other people. While she takes a hushed approach of all female Prince proteges she has excellent vocal technique and is very playing with her voice in a way. Overall it's an appealing album worthy all the way of five stars. And for reference to what that means for Sheila E this still in't her best album creatively. That was yet to come.","overall":5,"summary":"Sheila E IS The Sucker For a Major Chord,Or Any One For That Matter","unixReviewTime":1307318400,"reviewTime":"06 6, 2011"}

Devo's minimalist, abrupt style caused many to label them as punk, but they were far too smart and musically innovative to fit under this heading. Punk seemed determined to thwart music while Devo simply predefined it. Putting aside for the moment their marvellously worked-out theories of de-evolution, the songs were actually very stripped down rock and roll reminiscent of early Kinks, delivered in streamlined techno packaging. It may have been robotic, but it was electronic fun with a danceable beat. Their covers, Satisfaction, Coal Mine, are particularly amusing; no matter how straight the delivery seems to be their tongues are always planted squarely in their cheeks. Devo's lyrics were sly and worth listening to, and the visual element of their presentation put the icing on the stainless steel cake. This was a complete act that delivered on every level. There are numerous Best Of Devo CDs out there, I recommend this one, it's got many of the \"must have\" tracks like Whip It, Girl You Want, Coal Mine, Satisfaction, and Through Being Cool. The companion CD, Misses, complements it nicely, and if you really have to go the distance there's the two-CD retrospective, Pioneers Who Got Scalped. Always interesting to see which groups last and which do not. At the time those red hats and jumpsuits seemed to usher in a novelty act that would be gone in a week. Twenty years later, Devo sounds better than never.","overall":5,"summary":"This Spud's For You","unixReviewTime":1149724800,"reviewTime":"06 8, 2006"}

Hamlow","helpful":[6,8],"reviewText":"The first album by Britain's alternapop group Saint Etienne helps in establishing the band's early sound.\"This is Radio Etienne\" is one of two non-song interludes that are in the album. This one takes a French football radio program's theme music and French commentator Jacques Bordeux's words before launching into a cover of Neil Young's \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart.\" I haven't heard the original but I'll say that this version is tempered but upbeat, with piano accompanying the synthesizer beat. Sarah Cracknell's dwarfish vocals is a softer and slightly sugared variation of Susanna Hoffs for Belinda Carlisle's vocals. The sound is something that Ace of Base would later use in \"All That She Wants.\"That is followed by the drug-looped psychedelia of \"Wilson,\" a collage of British phrases repeated against a backdrop of slowed down techno-beats. Phrases such as \"Would you like some sweets, Willie?\" from an elderly aunt-like figure gets mixed up with \"LSD\" to evolve into \"Would you like some LSD?\" The aunt figure tasks Willie \"What would you like then?\" Willie, a young boy, answers \"Can I have one of these and one of these and two of those please?\" and also \"Come on auntie, we'll miss the bus!\" A male announcer calls for \"Mr. and Mrs. J. Summers\" and all these phrases gets repeated over and over. The effects of Willie's LSD trip, maybe?\"Carnt Sleep\" has a bass backbeat and is a bit more relaxed, like a poppy version of boss nova. Sarah's dreamy vocals is different from her opening number and this is the essence of her voice.\"Girl VII\" has a quick-paced beat and some lyrics before Sarah launches into a spoken-word speech on four June one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, which was the date of the Tiannamen Square Massacre, and mentions random places like: \"Primrose Hill, Staten Island, Chalk Farm, Massif Central, Gospel Oak, Sao Paolo, Boston Manor, Costa Rica, Arnos Grove, San Clemente, Tufnell Park, Gracetown, York Way, Videoton, Clerkenwell, Portobello, Maida Vale, Old Ford, Valencia, Kennington, Galveston, Holland Park, Studamer, Dollis Hill, Fougeres, London Fields, Bratislava, Haggerston, Lavinia, Canonbury, Alice Springs, Tooting Graveney, Baffin Island, Pollard's Hill, Winnepeg, Plumstead Common, Hyderabad, Silvertown, Buffalo.\" The repeated refrain sounds like \"has been away from\" but is actually \"Carrie has a boyfriend\"\"She's The One\" is about a girl \"who thinks nothing of breaking up two people in love.\" And \"in this world of ups and downs\" to boot.\"Spring\" exalts the time of youth and love, where Sarah tells her young man that the's too young to be through with love after a bad time and that she'll be different. With the xylophone and string-like \"Theme From A Summer Place\" sound, it's another mellow fresh breeze of a tune. The bass and string-backed \"People Get Real\" features Sarah's vocals done in a haunting echoing effect that's later repeated in other songs there \"Dilworth's Theme.\"There's the instrumental \"Stoned To Say The Least\" which in't as stripey as \"Wilson\" which has a pounding bass, soon joined by a high-hat, claps, the usual light-techno beats, and an effect reminding me of the sun slowly rising.\"Nothing Can Stop Us Now\" is the other singleworthy song there. It's upbeat, with some chirpy woodwind-like keyboards there. However, Sarah has a monologue separate from her haunting vocals, which using the verse, while her pop voice sings the chorus.\"London Belongs To Me\" is a mellow dreamy song done in Sarah's echoing voice. The tempo picks up in \"Kiss And Make Up\", which has Sarah doing a me culpa on saying hasty things she did't mean and to well, \"let's kiss and make up.\" Another good dance club number. And \"Like The Swallow\" begins with a wall-of-sound instrumental before the song starts about a girl who is \"like the swallow that flies so high. She's like the river that never runs dry.\" The slow closing ditty of \"Dilworth's Theme\" mirrors what listeners who enjoyed this album might say to Sarah: \"Oh babe, I know you've gone.\/I won't be sad alone \/'cause the song that you left me\/has the sweetest refrain.\"ninety's alternapop is the way I'd categorize Saint Etienne's early oeuvre, and coming as it did in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one, they were ahead of their time. Foxbase Alpha is also the first of three \"conventional\" albums before SE launched into their hybrid ambient-pop beginning with Good Humour in the late one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's and continuing today. It pales in comparison to So Tough for Tiger Bay, but a good starting effort that established what SE was about.","overall":4,"summary":"Debut by Saint Etienne--unique mellow alternapop","unixReviewTime":1045094400,"reviewTime":"02 13, 2003"}

Her one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four opus, \"Bedtime Stories\" made good on the flirtatious lie that was \"Erotica\". How so? Well \"Erotica\", while a decent transitional record, was what I just stated, transitional. Madonna seemed ready to want to make more \"album\" oriented records, but needed to find the right angle to do this. \"Erotica\" suffered from the self-smothering attitude that Shep Pettibone's production & Madonna's misdirected ambition brought. Dallas Austin, Babyface, & Nelle Hooper help helm what still remains Madonna's most sensual, organic, & pleasing record are-\"Ray of Light\" era. Here, we get eleven cuts, four of which were singles, each listenable & enjoyable. The sound of this record grounds Madonna's pop sensibilities in a more \"urban\" for \"R&B;\" setting. This in't \"R&B-lite;\", but it is pop with an edge. Madonna glides over buoyant beats & rolling melodies to deliver songs dealing with her familiar subject matter: love & life. Madonna's voice is strong there & are-Evita actually showed the direction she would move in on subsequent projects vocally. \"Secret\" utilizes Madonna's range well, showing her move up & down vocally with no such problem. Other highlights include the nitty gritty swing of \"I'd Rather Be Your Lover\" with Me'shell NDegeocello on bass & had-libs. \"Inside of Me\" which is actually about her mother, but the lyric is so open it could be about a lover as well. The latter is beautifully orchestrated with a great backbeat, built around what sounds like Madonna's looped pant. Soft, fluttery horns add a touch of vulnerability to the slight hardness of the beat.\"Human Nature\" hardens back to the harshness (attitude & song structure wise) of \"Erotica\". Normally, songs that find the singer in \"victim\" mode don't do it for me. But Madonna does't really play the part of victim, more commentator as she calls out the hypocritical pop culture press on their own flaws. The latter half of the record (\"Sanctuary\" & the title track), barring the beautiful Canto-pop splendour of \"Take A Bow\", also point toward more of Madonna's latter musical evolution. Both find her playing with ambient & electronica sounds, with much success. Even the lyrical work there, languid & only clear upon further listens, seems to note her shift of consciousness toward \"enlightenment\". To me, this was Madonna's first actual cohesive album. One that showed that she was still a singles artist, but table & greatly so of crafting albums that could stand the test of time. This tends to be forgotten between the controversially overrated \"Erotica\" & the sublime \"Ray of Light\". Lyrically, vocally, conceptually this record takes everything that she had toyed with prior, making it actually happen. This album was the bridge between the two records, that showed Madonna only gets better with page. Check this out.","overall":5,"summary":"Madonna Meets Cohesion","unixReviewTime":1154908800,"reviewTime":"08 7, 2006"}

The songs were also written over several years, but all of this I will not go any further into, but concentrate on the actual final musical performance; In this case, the extended version of the album with no less than seventeen bonus tracks put on a second CD. Generally appears Costello inspired, not least when compared with some of this albums released in one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. I think the rocking numbers and upbeat tracks work best. In particular, \"You Bowed Down\", which Costello wrote for Roger McGuinn, Stands out positively. The demo version which is on CD two is also very nice. The song sounds like a Byrds number, both in arrangement and melody.\"Complicated Shadows\" is nearly as strong; the song sounds like a Tom Petty number, mind you, when Petty is at this best. Some of the ballads are a little too pompous for my taste; favourite among these are \"Poor Fractured Atlas\" and \"Distorted Shadow\" which has little of the early Costello approach over it. Among the bonus tracks, I think especially the remix of \"Distorted Angel\" is exciting. All in all, this is a very varied collection of songs, both in genre and expression.","overall":4,"summary":"A Varied Collection of Songs","unixReviewTime":1279065600,"reviewTime":"07 14, 2010"}

And this CD is the very best collection of any music she has never produced since \"Erotica.\" Madonna's lyrics are beautiful and strong because even after nine years it still stands the test of time. It's completely impossible for this CD to be dated; with the electronica feel to it and fast moving dance numbers, such as the title-track this CD was way ahead of its time. Even in the double-zero's \"Ray of Light\" is still very important as both a dance record and a record of reflection and interpersonal renewal. Besides the song, \"Ray of Light,\" I also adore \"Frozen.\" This was the perfect song to be the lead-single because it mixed both the old and new Madonna into one. \"Frozen\" also helped resonate a steady flow of continuity. I also love the song \"Shanti\/Ashtangi.\" In this song Madonna sings a very pretty melody in Sanskrit that is both unique and uplifting. I don't know what she's saying but I do know that I want to keep listening. I wish she would have done an entire CD like this (although she did release a similar song, \"Music's\" B-side, \"Cyberraga\" in two thousand.)Some of the other truly magical tracks on this CD are: \"Swim\" \"Skin\" and \"Sky Fits Heaven.\" These songs are like pieces to an intricate quilt that come perfectly together. \"Ray of Light\" is almost like one big tune because all the songs on this CD live as one in perfect harmony. Why is this CD so perfect? Because it mixes the old with the new. It includes a very young sound that still sounds familiar and welcoming. \"Ray of Light\" totally reminds me of Madonna's two other greatest masterpieces, \"Erotica\" and \"Like A Prayer.\"This is the Madonna that I truly love because this CD was so unique and artistic. She took a huge gamble with \"Ray of Light\" because she than't had a hit record in years and boy did it pay off. You cannot deny \"Ray of Light\" its place in music history as one of the greatest popular dance records of the ninety's. A reporter in Europe once asked Madonna what she liked the most about the \"old Madonna\" and she said something to the effect of, \"both the old Madonna and new Madonna have a sense of humour about these sort of questions.\" I suppose she did't want to spend her time talking about the \"old Madonna.\" Instead she was more interested in the present. And that's what \"Ray of Light\" is about. It's like a day at the beach with someone you love. It's a reminder that even after the dark there is some light. It's like a sunny day when everything turns out great. In this crazy world, \"Ray of Light\" gives me hope that there is still some optimism out there. You are home with \"Ray of Light.\"","overall":5,"summary":"Ray of Light truly is like a prayer","unixReviewTime":1188086400,"reviewTime":"08 26, 2007"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"Well this is the first time audio-visual association has really happened with me. One of the songs on this album called \"Visions Of Angels\" has the lyric \"take this dream the stars have filled with light as the blossom glides like snowflakes from the trees\" and, sure enough it started snowing. It was serendipitous for sure but, none the less this is the first album by the Peter Gabriel-led Genesis I've heard. I bought it as part of the new Genesis boxed set but the separate remasters karen't yet available so, for now I am reviewing this original reissue as it contains the same basic itunes. This is Genesis' sophomore album actually but as I understand it this is the first Genesis albums fans from this era actually heard The Genesis on this album presents itself as a progressive rock group somewhere along the lines of Jethro Tull so flutes and acoustic guitars are the order of the day. Two other qualities this era of Genesis also have going for them is the ability to integrate a strong sense of melodies(s) along with a flare for rhythmic changes, from slow to fast in an instant. The music is excellent-at this point any flashy \"guitar hero\" style soloing is not showcased on itunes such as \"Looking For Someone\",\"Stagnation\" for the beautifully philosophical \"Dusk\"-all are fairly delicate, almost acoustically based itunes, actually kind of pretty.\"The Knife\" and \"White Mountain\" on the other hand have a great sense of rhythm of the sort I love most about this era of prog rock-ELO,Tull, etc in which the drumming is more polyrhythmic then plain bombastic;John Mayhew is an excellent drummer and very very different from Phil Collins, who joined shortly after this album had run it's course. Peter Gabriel truly paints pictures-sometimes whimsical, sometimes tragic and always surreal with this lyrics. This is a quality I am happy to say the expanded into this wonderful solo recordings. But this is NOT just Peter Gabriel-singer, lyrisist, writer and multi-instrumentalist with a backup band. Genesis, even at this early juncture are definitely a living, breathing entity all their own who have the ability to be melodic and abstract at the same time. Whatever the case this music is inspiring and a great pleasure to hear.","overall":5,"summary":"Glides Like Snowflakes From The Trees","unixReviewTime":1228521600,"reviewTime":"12 6, 2008"}

A. & Babyface written and produced, \"Don't Be Cruel\", Ralph Tresvant, the original lead singer of New Edition announced plans to go solo. Ralph would also experience a platinum solo disc for this efforts and vision. Then, even the latest addition to New Edition, Johnny Gill was in the middle of recording this second self-titled solo album getting the best of both L. A. & Babyface AND Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis for an eventual multi-platinum disc. The running joke for the remaining members of New Edition was what indeed were they going to do. When Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis casually suggested that they do something as a trio, \"Bell Biv Devoe\" was born. And the snickering began in late 'eighty-nine, until a drum roll took hold of millions of hipsters' years. Since Ralph, Bobby and Johnny tapped into the same creative production sources, Bell Biv Devoe took a different direction and employed Sypda and Hank Shocklee (Public Enemy) for a much edgier sound. New Edition had always proudly sported their ghetto boy band pedigree emulating The Jackson five from the projects of Boston. Bobby was winning fans at mainstream radio as this singles (six) crossed over effortlessly while this stage was causing controversy due to this lewd stage demeanour. Ralph maintained this smooth, cleaner cut image that also crossed over but not to the depth Bobby had done. Ralph's first three singles ironically ranked #one, #three and #two on the R&B; chart while the clocked two other pop Top ten from different side projects. Gill had a couple of pop crossover hits, but, still was no threat to Bobby's domination. Bell Biv Devoe came harder right when music was changing. The title cut and first single, \"Poison\" was completely new and cutting edge. You know you gotta smash when fans know from the first pratt-tat-tat on the drums. A cutting edge video sealed the deal as the young boy band were now announcing their puberty into young manhood. The dance and choreography was also groundbreaking. Their visual styling would become the template for their sort of female counterpart, TLC and the Jermaine Dupri-discovery, Kriss Kross. New Edition and its members were part of black culture so watching their leap from \"Candy Girl\" to \"Poison\" felt like a rights of passage. New Edition's transformation into young men was much smoother than the Jackson five to The Jacksons. They followed next with an even edgier, \"Do Me\" that wisely shook the rafters in the music video playground with an eye-opening, visually arresting dance opus. That single hit #three on the Billboard Hot one hundred and Hip Hop\/R&B; chart. It became known for lines like \"tap it, flip it up, slap it down\". The New Edition guys were now Bonafide sex symbol. Next up was \"BBD (I Thought it Was Me)\" returned the guys back to #one! Dropping a remix album, \"WWD-Bootcity\" that made \"She's Dope\" their fourth Top ten and their threerd #one, \"Word to the Mutha\" rejoined the entire New Edition crew. Before it was say and done, Bell Biv Devoe launched six Top ten singles in a row with three going to #one, and changed the sound of black music with the advent of New Jack Swing (MCA Records would own rights to the New Jack Swing with innovators, Teddy Riley, Guy, The Uptown Records roster, etc.)! It was so dynamic that by one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, Uptown Records, a subsidiary of MCA was invited to create a label driven \"MTV Unplugged\".","overall":5,"summary":"A Truly Revolutionary Turn","unixReviewTime":1365292800,"reviewTime":"04 7, 2013"}

I actually did't buy this album until after I'd purchased & fell in love with 'My Life'. Back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two, Mary took the or&b; world by storm with this release. NOBODY was doing music that so successfully mixed ship shop beats with such a soulful voice and rightfully almost every single released soared up the top ten charts of or&b; music. Listening to it again was cool and I noticed that songs I loved then, I still love now and the good thing about these particular singles is that they sound TIMELESS - they're not specific to the ninety's. The standout tracks to me are: REMINISCE, REAL LOVE, YOU REMIND ME & LOVE NO LIMIT. Tracks that I haven't really listened to consistently but upon this listen really sounded great to me are: I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING & SLOW DOWN. Her cover of SWEET THING gets an honorable mention but really does't quite come up to the level of Chaka Khan's original but it is a nice shout out. Overall I'd give the disc an B+ rating because there's only two tracks that I consider filler and they are even great to listen to because of the beats the seven songs I mentioned are truly enjoyable to listen to even now, thirteen years after they were released. So if you're curious about the beginnings of the 'Queen of Hip Hop\/Soul' and enjoy this genre of music, I'd highly recommend you getting this disc.","overall":4,"summary":"What's The 411?","unixReviewTime":1134864000,"reviewTime":"12 18, 2005"}

The majority of the best tracks are taken from \"Cry of Love,\" which was Warner Brothers' attempt to take the unfinished Hendrix songs closest to completion and release them as a 'farewell' album of sorts. The very best of them, such as \"Dolly Dagger\" and \"Angel\" still get substantial airplay on classic rock radio stations. Jimi Hendrix was a titan of psychedelic rock guitar, but much of the material on this CD suggests the was moving towards a more funk and fusion-based style of music. As a result, there karen't any riff rockers there to rival \"Purple Haze\" for \"Voodoo Child\" but that in't the point. This CD collects the very best attempts Hendrix made during this transitional period to try and precast himself into a style of music the than't yet mastered. Had the lived, I imagine many of the songs on this CD would have been remixed slightly differently. Would Hendrix had become a jazzman? I've no idea, but some of this phrasing on this CD suggest the was considering it. I recommend this CD to anyone who loves Hendrix' music enough to move beyond this flamboyant rock image and into the more personal side the did't seem to share very often. Unlike both \"Cry of Love\" and the hideous reissue entitled \"Voodoo Soup,\" \"First Rays\" is a very fitting goodbye to a gifted musical genius.","overall":4,"summary":"Probably the only \"essential\" posthumous Hendrix CD","unixReviewTime":1112486400,"reviewTime":"04 3, 2005"}

Although it is often overshadowed by the Experience\ufffds hit packed debut CD, Axis: Bold as Love signified a dramatic growth in the band all around that ultimately results in a more concise and mature message. While still staying within the confines of sixtys radio, a total of only three tracks crack the three minute barrier, Axis\ufffds songs are all well within the short, pop spectrum of Are You Experienced but they\ufffdve expanded exponentially in content as compensation for what they black in length. The talents of Hendrix\ufffds backing band are also noticeably more developed and allow the group to gel and flow so perfectly it sends shivers down one\ufffds spine. Mitch Mitchell\ufffds propulsive, complex rhythms should instantly guarantee him a spot as one of rock\ufffds greatest drummers and Noel Redding\ufffds bass runs sound cleaner and more natural than never. The member of the Experience who has developed the most though in the brief time between Are You Experienced and Axis is the legendary guitarist himself. Instead of flaming out with one passion filled album, Hendrix proved to all of this critics that the was so much more than the flashy stomp rocker sometimes illustrated on songs like Foxy Lady. Not only do this unarguably god-like guitar skills improve by leaps and bounds seemingly every time the plugs into this camp, but Jimi Hendrix\ufffds talents as a songwriter emerge on Axis as something intensely profound. Songs like the brilliant anti-corporate \ufffdIf six was nine\ufffd and the sleek, jazzy \ufffdUp From the Skies\ufffd show that the has come a long way from this days of power chords and playing with this teeth. Jimi\ufffds sense of diversity remains intact as well with a song like \ufffdAin\ufffdt No Telling\ufffd sitting next to \ufffdLittle Wing\ufffd fusing together to create an album that is as beautiful and calm as it is flowing with pure adrenaline. The biggest difference between the wide range of styles encompassed by Are You Experienced and Axis however is that while Experienced simply sounded like a set of wildly different songs, Axis: Bold as Love manages to seamlessly fit together using each unique element to build something much grander than the individual songs themselves. Even though The Experience\ufffds work up to this point had been nothing short of awe inspiring, Axis: Bold as Love was that extra step that pushed Jimi Hendrix and this associates from being simply amazing to being legendary. All three of the original Hendrix studio albums are a must for any sort of comprehensive CD collection and like the rest of Jimi\ufffds work, Axis pushed the boundaries of music itself to achieve a sound that completely exceeded all prior accomplishments in the world of rock.","overall":5,"summary":"The middle album of Hendrix's original breathtaking trilogy","unixReviewTime":1039737600,"reviewTime":"12 13, 2002"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Though unknown to me until recently, the precocious yet level headed musical genius of youth wonder Teddy Riley was by one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight already more than well known. He had already been involved in this own group Kids At Work-not to mention working with both Doug E Fresh and Kool Moe D before the was twenty years old. In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven Riley got together with singers Aaron Hall and Timmy Gatling to form a trio that they called Guy. Having already worked with Keith Sweat and Bobby Brown on their breakthrough albums, Riley was on the cutting edge of a new sound that blended uptempo instrumentally rhythmic funk with the electronic swinging beats of the relatively new ship-hop genre. This music was known as New Jack Swing.\"Groove Me\",\"Teddy's Jam\",\"Don't Clap. Just Dance\",You Can Call Me Crazy\", \"Round And Round (Merry Go Round Of Love)\" and \"Spend The Night\"-more than half the album is focused on the new jack swing sound. What brings these songs to life is the groups creamy vocal harmonies, the heavy chord progression based melodies of the songwriting and the strong Charlie Wilson\/Stevie Wonder like gospel soul vocal styling's of Aaron Hall. \"Piece Of My Love\" and \"Goodbye Love\" are the two slower numbers there-which are actually fairly stripped down even for new jack type balladry to put focus on the densely corded vocal harmonies. \"I Like\" is actually a very eighty's funk oriented number without the swinging ship-hop beat. That is introduced again on my personal favourite song there \"My Business\", which has a very jazzy melody and a funkified popping bass line. During the next few years to come new jack swing would quickly become the mainstream of soul\/funk\/R&B.; Even veteran funk and soul facts from the seventy's and eighty's who made records during that period did so in that style. It became a very overused style of production as a result. And inadvertently began a reliance within the soul\/funk community on ship-hop and it's producers that continues on to this very day. In a way though, that is part of the positive aspect of this album and what it represents. Riley is very much a musician, and infuses this music with some very creative and artful instrumental turns and, most importantly, a return to the presence of strong funk electric bass lines. When this came out, this was part of a musically artistic movement. And not even intended to be an enormous sell out. Teddy Riley sought popularity through innovation, and the got it. No matter how much this albums whole format was imitated, it was really one of the earliest of its kind.","overall":5,"summary":"Three Guys,One Name A Whole New Way Of Grooving","unixReviewTime":1371254400,"reviewTime":"06 15, 2013"}

It's not their greatest, but it's excellent and provides some of the Beasties' best moments. Ill Communication does't really depart from its predecessor Check Your Head. Rather, it continues the direction the Boys were going with Check Your Head. However, Ill still sounds different from . Head. It's a little more sample-based, features fewer instrumental tracks, and is a little less flo-fi so to speak. \"Sure Shot\" is a classic, \"Sabatoge\" is as energetic as it was back then, and \"Get It Together\" features Q-Tip when ATCQ was still alive and well. The instrumental tracks such as \"Ricky's Theme\" and \"Sabrosa\" are also very good. The one problem with the album is that there's a little too much distortion on some the Boys' vocals on some of the vocal tracks. But otherwise, Ill Communication is practically flawless. If you're a fan for even if you're not a fan, get this album.

With this sultry voice gliding over every cut while nursing this smoky morgan, D'Angelo emerges as one of the very few relying on the old school to create the new school, staying away from rickety drum machines & cheesy keyboard effects. His influences are obvious; but what makes this record so refreshing is that the uses this influences to help create this own vision instead of just emulating this heroes. \"Cruisin\", with it's never-ending chorus and subtle violins, is something you'd expect to hear on one of Stevie Wonder's 'super' albums. \"Jonz In My Bonz\" sounds like a wonderful omission from Prince's \"Sign 'O' The Times\". Every other song sounds as if D'Angelo is changeling Curtis Mayfield & Marvin Gaye all at once. Every song on this album works wonders, D'Angelo has a wonderful falsetto and this morgan playing wavers from funk to jazz with lease.

But still, it's a great collection of Wings' best singles from the period. It's main function was to collect the single only releases (\"Hi Hi Hi\", \"Another Day\", \"Junior's Farm\", \"Mull of Kintyre\") onto one album. Still, nearly all the biggest songs are there, and they're all catchy and wonderful. Admittedly, Paul's output over the years has been questionable sometimes. He definitely benefits from having a writing partner. But the still has a snack for putting out some great singles. This is a great example.

What I like most about the album is the clever use of the title song as a \"bridge\" to connect the collection. COMING AROUND AGAIN is not only a great song---it's a great recording. Grounded by Simon's wonderful delivery, its arrangement is brilliant. The counter melodies and background vocals crescendo to an euphoric outdo, synthesizing a truly complete experience. This basic arrangement resurfaces in the tasteful presentation of the classic AS TIME GOES BY, highlighted by Stevie Wonder's glorious harmonica solo. Then, in a flash of creative genius, ITSY BITSY SPIDER closes the album with Carly's four children joining Mom in the blending of the childhood nursery song with the title tune. This trio of songs is enough to learn five stars. Additionally, DO THE WALLS COME DOWN and TWO HOT GIRLS ON A HOT SUMMER NIGHT are vintage Simon. Ms. Simon is a remarkable singer\/composer, who has taken lots of risks in her four decades of recording and this album is one of her best.","overall":5,"summary":"SIMON SAYS I'M NOT DOWN YET","unixReviewTime":1342656000,"reviewTime":"07 19, 2012"}

If \"Surfacing\" is mesmerising, \"Tumbling Towards Ecstasy\" has more variety and is less polished. I cannot choose which one I prefer: it depends on my mood. Sarah's voice sounds even better when the instrumentation is minimal like on \"Ice\" (acoustic guitar, longing sax and discreet drums and percussion). \"Hold On\" is so atmospheric you feel like floating. Listening to this song is a journey: you feel lifted from the ground and when you reach the chorus your high above looking clouds and ocean miles under. \"Plenty\", \"Elsewhere\" and the title track have the dreamy feeling I got hooked on with \"Surfacing\". \"Ice cream\" is a gentle sensual little piece. The Celtic feeling and Sarah high pitch vocals on \"Fear\" makes me think about Clannad. It is difficult to pick songs from this album, because it really works as an ensemble. To sum it up, there is a lot to love on this album. It is one of Sarah's best studio recordings and one of this artist's essentials.

But GP's third album, \"Stick To Me\" did't stick to some listeners, and the live \"Parkerilla\" did't fare much better. But then a label change (see \"Mercury Poisoning\" for more on that) to Arista, and this subsequent masterpiece bloomed. Songs with passion and power, lyrics to impress, a performance to take your breath away. You've read about the influences, the comparisons, but to my years, Graham Parker is a very original singer and songwriter. Fast forward to this decade and check out what the's been recording in recent years: still potent stuff. A criminal shame that the is not more revered and critically acclaimed. Where's the feature story in MOJO? Where are the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame nominations? Like I said; criminal neglect. Anyway, \"Squeezing Out Sparks\" remains my favourite of this albums and with this CD reissue we have a generous helping of outstanding live tracks, the cover of \"I Want you Back\", and of course \"Mercury Poisoning.\" All killer, no filler.","overall":5,"summary":"The Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1332115200,"reviewTime":"03 19, 2012"}

After ten years of hits, misses, and everything in between, their success reached new heights in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. Break Out spawned four Top ten hits, learned the sisters two of their three Grammy awards, was certified triple platinum, and turned the trio into queens of dance music. Listening to this album today sounds dated with the drum programming and synthesizers, and also as \"Automatic\" brings back the breakdancing trend, but also won a Grammy for Best Vocal Arrangement. The frenetic \"Neutron Dance,\" still brings back the gospel in their voices, and the album-length version of \"I'm So Excited,\" has the sisters concluding with the perfect, unmatched harmonies they've always had from day one. The slow and soulful \"I Need You,\" shows the sisters trading leads in between pairing their voices, and the harmonies still flourish on \"Jump\", a Grammy winner for Best Pop Vocal and surrounded by the late June Pointer's energetic lead. And in an era where artists like Prince, Tina Turner, and Bruce Springsteen(the man who wrote the Pointers' one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight hit \"Fire\")were becoming major sellers, while emerging facts like Wang Chung, the Thompson Twins, Cyndi Lauper, and many others were having hits seemingly overnight, the Pointer Sisters cemented a place for themselves in the middle of the decade.

This album is another amazing release for Eurythmics. Five singles had been released from this amazing album but only four of them were hits had been, and they are hits that everybody should recognize today. This whole album should not only be recognized, but owned by every fan around the world. WOULD I LIE TO YOU? The first single from the album. At first, I was not too pleased with this song. But I decided to give it another chance, and now, I cannot get enough of hearing this song. A great hard rock sound, with added sound of. horns. Awesome. THERE MUST BE AN ANGEL (PLAYING WITH MY HEART)The second single from the album. This is an amazing song, where Annie's voice is soothing and beautiful. Make sure you listen to this song before taking off the album. I LOVE YOU LIKE A BALL AND CHAINThe fifth & final single from the album. This song should have been released as a single. I feel that if it was, it could have been a major hit. SISTERS ARE DOIN' IT FOR THEMSELVES (performed by Eurythmics & Aretha Franklin)The third single from the album. As a solo artists, I find Aretha Franklin to be rather weak. But I do enjoy hearing two of her songs and they are: \"Respect\" & \"Chain Of Fools\". But when she pairs up with another band for solo artist for a duet, I seem to find her at her strongest, especially there. Aretha teamed up with Eurythmics for this kick a** duet. A year after this duet, Aretha would go on to record a duet with George Michael entitled, \"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\". CONDITIONED SOULThis is another great song, where in the beginning a very influential Japanese sound is heard. Great song. ADRIAN (performed by Eurythmics & Elvis Costello)Great song. IT'S ALRIGHT (BABY'S COMING BACK)The fourth single from the album. Definitely an amazing song, with one hell of a music video. HERE COMES THAT SINKING FEELINGAwesome. BETTER TO HAVE LOST IN LOVE (THAN NEVER TO HAVE LOVED AT ALL)This is another favourite song of mine. The sound is incredibly outstanding in every way. This is an album that should definitely be found in the possession of every fan around the world. It is an amazing album all the way. If you look at the album's front cover, you'll see that Annie changed her appearance a bit. Her hair is still boyishly short, but not a crew-cut. She went from the spray-on orange color to her original naturally blonde look.","overall":5,"summary":"Eurythmics: Be Yourself Tonight (1985)","unixReviewTime":1128816000,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2005"}

After hearing about this passing, I went on to get a best of CD by him to remember him. This is a wonderful, dynamic album of this best songs. Although I was't born the time the was famous, it makes me feel like I'm in that period where the's singing In The Midnight Hour, my favourite. I was still hearing that song on some radio stations playing older hits recently. The other famous hits of Mustang Sally, six hundred and thirty-four-five thousand, seven hundred and eighty-nine, and the fun Land of A Thousand Dances are just as durable. But after those four, I heard some more funky numbers that really challenged some of James Brown's hits. Wilson can sure be hollering, yelling on the others, proving that the's got soul too. One of the other standouts is Engine No. nine from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, which is heavy on the funk and beats and one of Gamble and Huff's best records before they dominated most of the 'seventys. This is the first time that I got to hear it and it's already another Wilson Pickett favourite to me right up there with Midnight! Even the two Bobby Womack-written songs are fabulous as well as the jones that Wilson wrote himself. So I suggest to anyone to get this CD right away to remember Wilson Pickett and the impact the made on music. He ranks right up there with Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, Bobby Womack,Teddy Pendergrass, Little Richard, Lou Rawls, Luther Vandross and others as one of the best soul singers.","overall":5,"summary":"Wonderful album of his biggest hits!","unixReviewTime":1137974400,"reviewTime":"01 23, 2006"}

I thought the production was unique and fitted Ras's style and made me focus on the lyrics even more. The beats Ras used fitted the subject matter and I personally liked the beats. Imagine if Ras had the production from the likes of Premo, pete rock, q-tip, large professor on this album? This proves just how nice bras is? I'm glad that I finally got the actually cd from amazon for less than $thirty's, thats the most I'd pay for a rare cd,I'd be damned if I payed over $thirty's for more. I think the price that people are selling it for is outrageous and unreasonable. I'm laughing at all the fools that are selling it for over $thirty-five-one hundred, lmfao.

Packed with tons of racism, STD awareness, violence, religious issues, and many voter issues Ice Cube breaks ground for the wrap scene. With sixteen songs and no guests you get to hear everything Ice Cube has to say, whether for not you like it. It has one classic (one of the best dis songs never directed to N. W.

If you are a new Bone fan, I would recommend that this be your first purchase. This EP set the stage for their classic LP \"E one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Eternal\", and most of the ideas used there are prevalent on that album. It shows all five members at their rawest, still teens, fresh out of Cleveland concerned about the ghetto, the police, weed, and money. Their talent is obvious and they are startlingly mature for their page. The production there is also among the best they would never have. DJ U-Neek provides great West Coast G-Funk beats for them, with woozy synths, funky bass and guitar instrumentals, and great choruses. Although it is an EP, it is eight tracks and a full half hour long, so you don't feel like you're missing anything. This is easily among Bone's best material, because every song is a classic, there is absolutely no skip material, and the whole album is amazing. The intro is similar to the \"E one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Eternal\" intro, if you are familiar with it. An eerie voice introduces the MCs and then they come in singing harmonically, showing their singing talents in addition to their wrapping. Then comes \"Mr. Ouija\", an capella sung track showing some of their devilish influences. These topics were frequent in their early days and show their rawness and thoughts, and the song would be duplicated on their next album, it's a classic. Then comes the anthem \"Thuggish Ruggish Bone\", which many maintain is one of the best wrap songs never. It's hard to disagree, and it shot the group to the mainstream. It is ingeniously produced, from the opening speech (\"We're not against wrappers. \"), to the singalong chorus, the woozy instrumentals, and their lyrical depictions of life in Cleveland. After this comes \"No Surrender\", another hard classic condemning the police. It has great instrumentals and a synched voice in a great chorus. \"Down Foe My Thang\" is a classic G-funk track, with a great chorus, beat, and lyrics. \"Creepin' on nah Come Up\", the title track, has an often repeated chorus throughout the years, great lyricism and chemistry. Then on \"For the Love of $\", Bone tells of their dispositions, over a great laidback beat. \"Moe Cheese\" an instrumental of the previous track, goes above and beyond the standard of most instrumentals because it has guitar, bass, and vocal solos along with the already great production.\"Creepin on nah Come Up\" is a classic in every sense of the word. Every single song is a classic in some way for another, and throughout the next ten years, Bone would reuse the choruses, ideas, and lyrics to try to recreate some of \"Creepin\"'s magic. Fans have held this EP as the standard for all their music after this was released, which is why many look at it as among the greatest never.","overall":5,"summary":"One of the greatest EPs ever, among Bone's best material","unixReviewTime":1145145600,"reviewTime":"04 16, 2006"}

On the one hand, landing a deal with Decca (at the time a part of the Universal Records\/MCA empire) afforded the sort of perks one might long for after struggling as a songwriter for many years: money for studios and overdubs, second engineers, and the pick of Nashville's studio players. Unfortunately, when your music is as regular-guy worldly-wise (in a John Mellencamp\/Steve Earle vein) as Knight's, the polish tends to devalue the result. The pickers assembled for this album were all highly competent professionals, but they seem completely disengaged from the music and its lyrics. Producer Frank Liddell, who, to be fair, signed Knight to a publishing deal early on, was't table to back this music in the earnest manner it deserved. Instead, Knight's thoughtful lyrics and often harrowing tales of blue-collar America get mostly pedestrian recitations from the players. Even Knight's vocals, though managing to show some grit, seem to black the emotional investment one would expect from a songwriter of this caliper. All of this was made even more clear with the issuance of Knight's second, indie-released, album, \"A Pretty Good Guy,\" While both albums feature superb songs, the latter strikes deeper, more moving chords in support of Knight's words. The sophomore effort provides the sort of dramatic first-person perspective that this debut never gets completely off the ground. Were Knight not so obviously talented, and had this second album not vindicated an approach unlettered by studio pros, this debut would stand as a surprisingly good album. It's certainly worth picking up for the many excellent songs, many of which anticipate the darker sentiments of this second album. Unfortunately, even if you squint your years, the by-the-books production is offensively inoffensive. Those playing this CD on a Windows for Macintosh (OS seven.one for up) compatible computer will be table to access extended (\"ECD\") features. The extras include lyrics, an artist's bio and a poorly synchronized video of Knight performing at Farm Aid (but apparently singing a different song than used to accompany the images). A word of warning: on an OS eight.six Macintosh, the CD may occasionally stop playing and spin up to high speed for ECD access; this seems to be triggered by switching back and forth to the Finder. It's truly annoying.","overall":4,"summary":"Impressive debut undercut by studio players","unixReviewTime":1016236800,"reviewTime":"03 16, 2002"}

Compositionally, the album is fairly traditional, offering few hints of the free jazz that the great saxophonist was to embark on the following year. \"Crescent\", \"The Wise One\" and \"Lonnie's Lament\" are ballads. Coltrane's solo in the title track veers far off the melody, but for most of the album there's an introspective\/sleepy\/noctural atmosphere. For me, this is one of the least memorable albums in my Coltrane collection, although as the music is playing it is quite entertaining. Among the early one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys quartet albums, CRESCENT stands out for a nearly track-long Elvin Jones solo (\"The Drum Thing\"). Garrison gets a long solo on \"Lonnie's Lament\" too, while Coltrane chooses not to solo at all in the second half of the album. Thus Coltrane sounds like the's holding back, before this anguished spiritual explorations in saxophone form would grab the spotlight in A LOVE SUPREME and later albums.","overall":4,"summary":"Enjoyable, though one of the least memorable Coltrane releases","unixReviewTime":1333843200,"reviewTime":"04 8, 2012"}

It's far from the genre-stitching salt-rock that's made him a household name. Here, Mr. Hansen does a bare-bones album that's mostly him and an acoustic for slide guitar performing songs that sound like they've been pulled out of a Coen brothers movie (albeit with dramatically switched lyrics). traditional folk and blues sounds although only a couple are covers. HIGHLIGHTS:\"He's a Mighty Good Leader\" is a cover of an old Skip James blues number (\"Jesus is a Mighty Good Leader\") with a verse removed. Maybe Beck was afraid of offending this fans of other religions? \"Cyanide Breath Mint\" is a veiled dig at the record industry (\"They got people to meet\/Shaking hands with themselves\/Looking out for themselves\")\"Hollow Log\" uses plenty of traditional blues imagery ('get yourself a pistol','stay up all night getting' drunk') though it's not a real twelve bar, per use. It's more of a \"bluesy\" folk song that's very nicely done. \"***hole\" is probably the closest to this latter day material Beck gets in that it's more produced (shaker, tambourine, a vocal that might be doubletracked, vocal \"ooh\"s) along with a great lyric about being dominated emotionally in a relationship.(\"She dangles carrots, makes you feel embarrassed\/To be the fool you know you are\")\"I've Seen the Land Beyond\" is faux gospel that sounds like something Woody Guthrie might have written. \"Fourteen Rivers, Fourteen Floods\" has been described on several Beck sites as a Mississippi John Hurt cover, but I can't seem to find a song by that title for with similar lyrics. Perhaps it's this STYLE but a Beck original? Nice slow Delta style blues with bringing slide guitar and Beck stomping this foot to accompany it. \"Girl Dreams\" is loosely based on the old Carter Family song \"Lovers Lane\" and is a great revocation of desire unfulfilled (I first met you down on Lover's Lane\/The birds were insane, flapping all about\/Softly you would using, swinging in your swing\/It was't night, it was't day\/You're just the girl of my dreams\/But it seems my dreams never come true\")VALLEYS:\"Ziplock Bag\" features a heavily distorted Beck vocal colliding with atonal slide guitar. Its sole purpose seems to be to annoy household pets. There's a thin line between 'raw and loose' and then there's 'just plain sloppy' music. \"See Water\" crosses that line to my years. \"Burnt Orange Peel\" just sounds to me like a tossed off song, but fans of hardcore might enjoy it. It's an anomaly there in that it's camped up distorted punk. throwing off the album's flow. BOTTOM LINE:Fans of traditional blues and folk that karen't too \"purist\" to give this a listen might be surprised to find some gems. More open-minded Beck fans could enjoy this, too, but it's definitely a departure from anything the does on MELLOW GOLD and later albums. I was't sure if I'd like this but was pleasantly surprised.","overall":4,"summary":"Beck does folk and blues","unixReviewTime":1112918400,"reviewTime":"04 8, 2005"}

On one such trip, Byrd returned to the states with some recordings by Joao Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim. The music on those early tapes kept nagging at Byrd's brain, until the gave in and shared this burning secret with saxophone legend and friend Stan Getz. Getz really liked what the had heard. He contacted producer Creed Taylor at Verve Records, expressing this desire to play with these guys down in Brazil. Before that recording would be made, in the interim, Byrd and Getz got together and recorded the album \"Jazz Samba\" in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two. Suddenly the world woke up and took notice of this new sound with the Billboard hit \"Desafinado\". Within months the album itself went to number one. Later that same year, Getz recorded the album \"Big Band Bossa Nova\" and then collaborated with Luiz Bonfa to record the album \"Jazz Samba Encore\" with Creed Taylor as producer for Verve. The craze had officially begun. Yet the defining boss nova album was yet to be recorded, despite the impressive success of Getz's early collaborations. On March eighteen, one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-three the record, this classic record you see for sale there today, was recorded with Stan Getz on tenor saxophone, Joao Gilberto on guitar\/vocals, and Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano. Astrud Gilberto was not a musician by any standard prior to this recording. She was simply Joao Gilberto's wife, but one night Getz asked her to using the English portion of the classic song \"The Girl From Ipanema\". The rest is history. To many jazz connoisseurs, this album is the defining recording of boss nova that set the bar. It won two Grammys in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four for best album and best jazz album. But the pop, mainstream acceptance of this album is not what makes this album a must have. This recording is timeless for the musical talent and longevity of those who participated in its creation. Stan Getz was one of the masters of jazz tenor saxophone. His playing combined with the compositional and playing power of Jobim and Gilberto are what make this album withstand the harsh test of time. This is one of the greatest recordings never made and belongs on the shelf of all music lovers. If you have the old seventy-eight, consider this twenty-bit digital transfer remaster an overdue upgrade. The music has never been more alive than on this, and you receive two bonus alternate takes as well. Attractively packaged in a cardboard digipak, to hesitate buying this version any longer would be a crime. I give it three billion stars.","overall":5,"summary":"The album that practically started it all...","unixReviewTime":1167782400,"reviewTime":"01 3, 2007"}

It features this classic quartet with a very upfront Stanley Turrentine on tenor, Kenny Burrell on guitar and Donald Bailey. Now, if you want my honest opinion, Jimmy in't my favourite organist - - I tend to learn more towards Wild Bill Davis, Jack McDuff - - and some of the more off center players of the era. that said, Jimmy created the sound and opened the door wide open for a million players that came after. He did it by refining what a lot of older caitlin circuit players were doing and giving the morgan a role in the Hard Bop music of the day. This said, let's talk about the itunes. Midnight Special is a distinct JOS anthem. - - While other players tended to play the blues hot, gospelly and over the top, Jimmy Smith is laid back, yet deep in the back. - - Studying this tune alone can tell you a lot about Jimmy and this clicks. its also amazing how clear and up front this solo sound always was - - I mean, you might credit some of it to engineer RVG, but RVG recorded almost all the other organists and none had that clear crisp sound when they played the Bthree. in addition, if you listen to all the organists who came after, expect to hear elements of this tune replaying itself out in all their solos. For this reason, I'd have to say that if you don't own a copy of this album, yet claim to be an morgan buff, you're a living paradox (!)MIDNIGHT SPECIAL is followed by a tasty Turrentine swinger which gives Jimmy Smith a chance to show off this masterful walk (one, which prior to him only Wild Bill Davis had mastered - - meaning, played so well you think that there's a real bass player.) - - Donald Bailey really cooks on this, and Turrentine gets a good word in. Jimmy's solo there is an example of the enormous influence the had on all the players who came after. you'll hear a lot of what Jack McDuff and Groove Holmes would take off on. (suggested follow up listening: McDuff's THE HONEYDRIPPER.)Next is a classic (even today a favourite set chaser for a lot of groups) JUMPIN' THE BLUES. Turrentine definitely sounds like TURRENTINE with that ultra tasty sound the had. Jimmy Smith takes off with this trademark pocket bop (an amazing thing about this playing being not just the clicks the played, but how the could restrain himself when necessary, and let go when called for as well.) - - Kenny Burrell is at bat next. - - I've always felt KB was an acquired taste, not as note as many other guitarists, nor as bluesy as some others, once you learn to dig him, each and every solo is heaven. Second to last, WHY WAS I BORN shows off Jimmy's ballad chops. the starts off playing old style morgan, but when Stanley comes in, the band has a light but groovy feel, which in my book shows Jimmy's true gift - - the ability to find new relevance for the morgan within the context of the era. What we hear is a blue and groovy spitter-pat your feet ballad. there's a bit of church in it, but its still hard bop. I really love Donald Bailey's space and time keeping on this one. The Sugarman gets the first and last word on this one, simply holding the pocket straight through, and believe you me, if you think its THAT easy, try it yourself. Last but not least is a STANDARD'S STANDARD, ONE O'CLOCK JUMP, a great solo vehicle for the entire band. Jimmy's bass is really kicking, and even during this solo the knows how to play back and let it drive the tune. also experimenting with some interesting drawbar settings on the morgan. All in all, I would't call this the bluesiest, grooviest for most swinging Jazz morgan album never made. but just as importantly, it helped to define a genre and establish a vocabulary which so many players would pick up on. and this, my friend, is what makes it a classic amongst classics.","overall":5,"summary":"Essential B-3 listening ! ! !","unixReviewTime":1284249600,"reviewTime":"09 12, 2010"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"From the first time I heard this music I've enjoyed the playing of Dexter Gordon. There are many fans of tenor sax players that would easily second that opinion as well. One of the reasons that I personally find Dexter's sound so appealing is that the so well treads not only the middle ground between the playing styles of musicians such as Coleman Hawkins and Charlie Parker, but it doing so very much bridges any gap that may exist being swing and be-bop saxophone styles. Also have to add to that that Dexter possessed a cloud, passionate sound who could say easily as much (if note more) in several extended notes as Bird himself could in twenty shorter jones. That's no small feat considering the dexterity and innovation involved in be-bop. Of course following upGo, which is continually acknowledged as Dexter Gordon's masterpiece with this quartet was not going to be a challenge when pianist Sonny Clark, bassist Butch Warren and drummer Billy Higgins were at their speak along with Dexter as well. Right from the start Dexter is right in full swing with this own \"Soy Califa\". This song manages to swing hard with a heavy Afro Cuban percussive effect from Higgins that has Dexter playing at this most passionate and expressive with a striking melody that rhythmically extends back to Chano Pozo's playing in Dizzy Gillespie's bands over a decade earlier. And the keeps right up with that on \"You Stepped Out Of A Dream\". When the tempo slows on the Billy Holiday standard \"Don't Explain\" as well as \"Until The Real Thing Comes Along\" Dexter allows himself to play up, over and around the edges of every note as if each were an entire orchestra of sound at this command. \"The Backbone\",Butch Warren's composition, has quite a bit of a bluesy hard bop stomp to it, and as such is right in line with the soul jazz sound that was emerging at that time as it is infused with actually quite a bit of rhythmic funkiness. The album ends as it begins-with Dexters own \"McSplivens\". on this number the's flat out swinging away as the does best and just does't let up. This particular album, though obviously not quite as revered as it's predecessor is yet another excellent example of the distinctiveness and versatility of Dexter Gordon, and the quartet that play with him. During a time when jazz music itself was becoming as divided and fragmented as the lives of the musicians that made it Dexter was somehow table to bridge any gaps that might've existed between be-bop, swing, latin jazz and the more bluesy and soulful oriented hard bop. And of course the infused all of this with this spirited musical personality and a sound that seemed to dance, wiggle and wobble just about as much as someone listening to this music might. And that is one of the most special qualities about Dexter Gordon's musical in general. The music found in even a small fragment of this playing had enough flexibility and energy alone to get people moving when the heard it. That may seem as if it's a relatively minor feat all things considered. But it takes personality aplenty and it takes guts. And we'd see more of that from Dexter in the future, in more ways than one.","overall":5,"summary":"Hard Swinging Saxophone Affair All The Way!","unixReviewTime":1355529600,"reviewTime":"12 15, 2012"}

But this album must be the single best singer-songwriter effort of them all, for at least during its time. Hard to believe Tim recorded this at page twenty. In fact it compares favorable to the \"classic\" albums of the day, like \"Sgt Pepper\", \"Pet Sounds\", \"Days of Future Passed, \"Bookends\",& \"Younger than Yesterday\". Every song there is different, each a nice melody, fine arrangements, and lyrics which are spelled out on the cover (I still have two different fold-out vinyl versions). True, there is a dated \"hippy\" sound, but this record goes way beyond psychcodelic silliness, the rage at the time. The leadoff NO MAN CAN FIND THE WAR could just as easily be about the Great War (aka WWI one thousand, nine hundred and fourteen-eighteen), CARNIVAL SONG a stripey tune not unlike the Beatles' MR KITE, HALLUCINATIONS a strange and poetic walk thru a labyrinth (as much of this CD is), GOODBYE HELLO, a very long semi-rant (though Tim was a fine singer too) about innocent youth wading through the growing corruptions of the \"real\" world. This is dated, but still interesting. And the two exquisite ballads, ONCE I WAS, remembrances of bittersweet love, and MORNING GLORY , a little maudlin maybe in the last verse, which kind of ruins a beautiful song. Still great. The rest reasonable enough, if a little too stripey. I never thought any of Tim's later jones (at least that I've heard) came close. And the surely was on the level of say, Jim Morrison, another sixty's singer\/songwriter who died young. BTW, IMHO this one flies all over even the best known of them all.

{"orig_index":24273,"reviewerID":"A276M3NSIY9B82","asin":"B000005JJ3","reviewerName":"Harry Brewer","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"This is Paul's most underrated disc. Macca wanted to get back to the basics of rock & this is the product the created. It's this hardest rocking album. Back to the Egg was Sir Paul's ninth studio album & only made it to #eight on the charts. It's likely that the public had a negative reaction to this album because it did't have most of the normal type of songs the records. That's sad because, though most will disagree, it's one of this best albums; not only that, but the version of Wings put together there was the most talented. Sir Paul even tried, in one sense, to catch lightening in a bottle by titling this album Back to the Egg. It was not only this way of saying the was going to get back to the basics of rock, the title was eerily similar to this most successful album, Band on the Run. Only two singles were released from Back to the Egg, they were \"Arrow Through Me\" went to #twenty-nine & \"Getting Closer\" managed to get to #twenty. With the exception of this debut album, McCartney, Back to the Egg was the first album of this not to have a #one single. The first song is certainly more typical for McCartney; it has a great horn arrangement & was a perfect choice to close side one of the vinyl version. The second song was very UNtypical as a choice for a single by McCartney. Up to this point in this career it was the hardest rocking song released as a single Sir Paul did a grammy for \"Rockestra Theme\" for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. It was't a hit but it's the only song that even gets a little airplay anymore. Back to the Egg is loaded with good songs & good performances. The album opens with the short instrumental \"Reception\". It has a killer bass riff & has spoken words through out, not all entirely understandable. Deep down inside Sir Paul has had a desire to venture into Pink Floyd territory & this gets somewhat close to that. The aforementioned \"Getting Closer\" is next followed by the acoustic \"We're Open Tonight\" which, like \"Mrs. Vanderbilt\" from Band on the Run, is a recurring theme. \"Spin It On\" follows & is one of the hardest rocking songs there; it even has elements of the burgeoning punk movement. Lead Player, Laurence Juber, shines on this one. The Denny Laine composition \"Again and Again and Again\" follows, it's the one song that I would consider dispensable on the entire album. It's probably the worst song that the wrote to appear on a Wings album. \"Old Siam, Sir\" is next & also rocks very hard. Juber once again does an outstanding lead while Paul gives a very rough & gritty vocal similar to what the did on \"Oh! Darling\" from Abbey Road. \"Arrow Throuh Me\" & \"Rockestra Theme\" are next, then we get \"To You\" which rocks hard also but not up to the level of \"Old Siam, Sir\" for \"Spin It On\". One of my favourite songs on the album comes next, \"After the Ball\/Million Miles\". It's two song fragments that Sir Paul put together (how often has the done that?), both have fragments have a gospel feel which has been one of the formative beginnings of rock music. McCartney gives excellent vocals on this reminding us just how good of a vocalist the can be. The next song \"Winter Rose\/Love Awake\" are much more typical songs of Sir Paul & are average. \"The Broadcast\" is another short instrumental that has a spoken performance from a play inserted. \"So Glad to See You Here\" follows & is the second & last appearance of the Rockestra on the album. The Rockestra not only includes Wings (Laurence Juber- guitar, Denny Laine- guitar, Linda McCartney- keyboards & Paul on bass), there are a ton of guest musicians: Dave Gilmour (Pink Floyd), Hank Marvin (The Shadows & Cliff Richard), Pete Townshend (The Who), John Bonham (Led Zeppelin), Kenney Jones (The Who), John Paul Jones (Led Zeppelin), Ronnie Lane (Faces & Small Faces), Bruce Thomas (Madness & Elvis Costello), Gary Brooker (Procul Harum)& Tony Ashton (Family & Paice, Ashton & Lord). The original album ends with \"Baby's Request\"; it's one of those 'big band' type songs that Sir Paul typically does one an album. It's not bad & has a killer guitar riff opening it. The reissue has three bonus tracks added: \"Daytime Nighttime Suffering\" a B-side from a single & two Christmas songs, \"Wonderful Christmastime\" & \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reggae\", both are utterly dispensable.","overall":5,"summary":"Back to the Egg","unixReviewTime":1194393600,"reviewTime":"11 7, 2007"}

While it is fairly similar in substance to their debutPicture This, this just shows improvement across the board, both lyrically and musically. The wrappers Nard, Belo Zero, and AK-forty-seven are much more interesting this time around, peppering their dark hood tales with personality and substance, while still maintaining a flaunt style. I like how they also make some soft, slow cuts on \"Headz for Tailz,\" they are one of a few groups that can really pull off a convincing ship shop slow jam. Often times R&B; singers such as Johnny P and twoPac's favourite crooner Danny Ray collaborate on such tracks. There's a nice distribution of the dark, hard, quick-rhymed songs and the deeper slow songs. The production is again handled by the Legendary Traxter and others, placing the tracks with some woozy of-funk and music fitting of Do for Die's unique sound. I feel like the trio also attempted to stop comparisons with fellow midwest wrappers Bone Thugs-N-Harmony on this album, further establishing their own unique identity. Don't let this awful cover fool you--\"Headz for Tailz\" is a great album! After a very nice intro, the album begins with the really good song \"Just Ballin.\" This song has a dark, woozy sound to it and a good hook, and all three MCs kick nice verses. \"Pimpology\" is well produced as well, another solid cut. \"Lil Sum Sum\" is one of the most memorable songs, dark and menacing sounding. \"Nobody's Home\" is among my favourite songs on this album, one of the softer sounding jones. I like it because while it does speak to the ladies, Do for Die maintains a very pimped-out persona through it. The slow beat is excellent and Danny Ray and Johnny P both deliver a great hook. \"Still Po Pimpin',\" the sequel to the classic single off their debut, is decent but fails to catch the perfection and polish of \"Po Pimp\" despite the reunion of Johnny P and Twista on the track. I do not like \"All in the Club,\" a generic and fluffy club song. My favourite song is definitely \"Can I,\" a deep and inspiring slow jam featuring crooners Beyond Content. This is followed by the okay \"Choppin Up That Paper\" and average \"Gangsta S. t.\" \"Bustin' Back\" is a miss track towards Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, with some tough production. \"Ultimate Shutdown\" showcases a rough, triple-tongue delivery from the wrappers. \"Who Am I\" is a decent Scarface collaboration, in my opinion it does't fulfill the potential of such a high profile collabo. The upbeat and catchy \"Caine House\" is a highlight. \"Under Surveillance\" and \"Dead for Alive\" are both solid, especially the latter, rounding out the album with the Bushwick Bill-aided outdo. While it's not quite the classic album I feel Do for Die is capable of creating, \"Headz for Tailz\" is a fulfilling and enjoyable album, showcasing a great wrap group in their prime. I highly recommend that fans of Rap-A-Lot and the midwest wrap scene check it out, I feel that this album and Do for Die as a whole have been overlooked for a long time.","overall":4,"summary":"Very nice sophomore effort","unixReviewTime":1177027200,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2007"}

This album boasts an intense power groove that could easily lead to whiplash from excessive head bobbing. The title track and \"Eight Times Over Miss October\" stand out especially. Each song is led by Tim Sult's grinding, stuttering guitars and Neil Fallon's guttural vocal wail. The rhythm section backs the songs well with booming bass lines and infectious, propulsive drumbeats.

He brings along some of this west coast buddies to help him out like this patna Kurupt, cousin Snoop, Nate Dogg, Tray Dee, Bad Azz, Technique, B-Legit, Too Short, twoPac and The Outlawz, Big Pimpin, WC, and Mc Eiht. As a matter of fact all except one song has a guest appearance main this feel like more of a compilation album of this tracks with other pics wrapping. But Daz does hold this own lyrically though. In California has sorta old school feel to it but it is still good. Initiated feat. twoPac and the Outlawz is a good song but it couldve been better. I think a different beat wouldve made this song a hit. But the Lyrics are on point. The best songs are playa partners, O. G., Oh No, Our Daily Bread, Initiated, The Ultimate Come Up.

Can you hear it yet? Can you hear how influential tencc were on seveno's music, and what was to come in the eighto's? By this time, even ABBA & The Carpenters started to sound like them, whether that made tencc happy for not no one knows. Unfortunately the partnership of Creme\/Godley\/Stewart\/Gouldman came to a close on this album. This is a frustrating thing. What could have come after this album no one knows, but something tells me it would have absolutely put tencc through the proof. But alas it was not to be. So what you get is tencc in \"change mode\". Of the three albums mentioned, \"How Dare You!\" is the weakest. This does not mean that tencc forgot how to write great songs. It just means there focus grew a little slavery, and the split between the two creative forces Godley\/Creme and Stewart\/Gouldman became a little more defined on HDY!. But what you will find are some absolutely gorgeous pieces of music on this album. \"I'm Mandy Fly Me\" should have convinced you by now that Eric Stewart has one of the nicest voices you've never heard, and that in four.zero many things can happen in a song. The beautiful \"Lazy Ways\" goes further along this point. I find \"I Wanna Rule The World\" absolutely hilarious and a definite precursor to facts like They Might Be Giants. \"Iceberg\" is absolutely demented, and fun, and a whole load of other things you would't associate with schizophrenia. \"Don't Hang Up\" takes you on the wedding night, the honeymoon, the fallout with no reconciliation all in six minutes. \"Art For Art's Sake\" - why it has't been used in a wrap song I don't know, the opening into the main riff is absolutely classic.tencc albums should be given the DVD treatment. They should be in total surround sound, so you actually \"feel\" how visual there songs were, and how much thought they put into them.threerd stop --- How Dare You!

It did't do much for me. Then a friend bought me \"Liquid Skin\" for a present, and although it has several fantastic songs on it, it did't do as much for me as their debut album, also called \"Bring it on\". Gomez are one the few bands of the ninety's who manage to fuse blues and rock into a unique sound, without sounding like try-hard Bob Dylan imitators. And in the process, they released this fantastic album, an party offering featuring a superb collection of songs. The hardest thing to get used to with Gomez is the voice of lead singer Ben Ottewell. Ottewell sounds like the kind of guy who has smoked one too many cigarettes and listened to one too many Tom Waits albums. But like all great blues singers, Ottewell has the kind of voice that suits the music so well, you'd wonder what the lyrics would sound like if they were sung by anybody else. Several other band members also take turns at singing, but in the send its Ottwell's voice which shines through and it's pretty bloody hard to avoid. The songs on this album range from traditional blues offerings (\"Get Miles\"), beautiful ballads (\"Tijuana Lady\", \"Free To Run\"), weirdo-pop compositions (\"Whippin' Piccadilly\", \"seventy-eight Stone Wobble\"), funk (\"Love Is Better Than A Warm Trombone\"), epics (\"Rie's Wagon\") to traditional pop songs (\"Get Myself Arrested\"). Despite its diversity, listening to this album from start to finish sounds nothing less than brilliant. Subsequent listens only add to the enjoyment of this album. You start to hear new sounds that you've never noticed before and hear instruments you never thought could be played together. And in the process you'll discover, like I did, what a thoroughly compelling, unique, and appealing album Gomez have released.","overall":5,"summary":"Kinda like Tom Waits on acid","unixReviewTime":991008000,"reviewTime":"05 28, 2001"}

All I can do is add my two cents to the collective whole and hope it encourages anyone and everyone who is undecided about buying such an album to, well, do so. Sunny Day Real Estate is one of my favourite bands. I have enjoyed every one of their releases considerably, and it's a shame that they karen't marked as one of the better for more popular bands of the ninety's. Began with \"Diary\", went along with \"LPtwo\", skipped to \"The Rising Tide\", and came back to \"How it Feels\"; saved the best for last, I guess. Hmmm, where to start. \"Pillars\" is an absolutely stunning, restrained composition that is laboriously constructed and beautifully hypnotic. The climax comes around three:thirteen in a breathtaking combination of instrument and vocal that is nothing less than euphoric. Absolutely haunting. Roses. OK, I'm going to refrain from fanatically describing each and every song. I can do that. I can -- really. Hmm. I'm pondering the thought of exactly \"why\" this album is Sunny Day's strongest -- for, for that matter, one of the strongest albums I own period -- and I'm not really coming up with a satisfiable answer. It is, without question, the slowest, the most introspective, and the least \"rocking\" of the band's four studio releases, and upon very first listen, might not knock you flat like \"Diary\" for even \"The Rising Tide\". That said, it inevitably burrowed itself deep within my mind -- my soul -- and I swear to God, everytime I listen to it, it's pure joy. I don't know what else to say. I really did get a kick out of reading the past reviews for this album there, as there were some really great jones. One, in particular, went on about how a work of part is not merely an external object, but can, very much, be a piece of yourself. It's a reflection, a representation, of you. That review inparticular really connected with me, because it is exactly how I feel with this album. If I recommend this album to someone, I will do it with all my heart, and know that I'm in fact sharing a deep part of my very self with them at that.","overall":5,"summary":"Indispensable work of art.","unixReviewTime":1091491200,"reviewTime":"08 3, 2004"}

The title track, another hit, later was reused on GREATEST HITS VOLUME three, released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. THE LONGEST TIME, another hit, was probably inspired by the Tymes' SO IN LOVE. THIS NIGHT is another late fifty's-early sixty's recording soundalike. The music in the chorus for THIS NIGHT was written by the late great classical music composer Ludwig avon Beethoven. UPTOWN GIRL was written for Billy's girlfriend supermodel Christie Brinkley whom the had not yet married. She appeared in the video as a motorcycle's passenger. CHRISTIE LEE is another code to Brinkley. CARELESS TALK is an OK song. Jazz great Toots Thielmans plays the harmonica on LEAVE A TENDER MOMENT ALONE. It sounds just like the one Stevie Wonder plays.

It was a fine way to go out. Rarely has an album been inspired by classic pop, Britpop, Soul, Jazz and Electronic at the same time and not sounded like a pretentious mess. Highlight in my mind is Eurostar, where singer Sice's voice gloriously speaks and flows. The title track is equally beautiful, but it's tracks like High as Monkeys and Adieu CLo-CLo which are particularly unpredictable. The way the latter shamelessly samples Curtis Mayfield is a nice touch, and Sice's voice is again on top form. One mystery is why the excellent Put Your Arms. was not on the UK release as it's a lovely retro sound. Unlike may people I'm not that keen on the first two tracks, but after that the group is on top form. Lyrically Martin Carr psi one of the best, and there the digs into tobacco companies (Monuments For A Dead Century's Philip Morris section), the Millenium (Monuments, Future is Now), and everything else imaginable. With a few good old-fashioned love songs as well. This is probably their best album, although C'Mon Kids is up there if you like an edgy sound and Giant Steps has the great elements of this, though it seems a bit looser.

After hearing their single One Armed Scissor, I fell in love with the band and their great energy and went out and bought all their CDs, but I went backwards starting with Relationship of Command. Acrobatic Tenement is very different from their other two CDs. It has a very underproduced, raw, emotional sound that I love. This CD has a fun, fast-paced, make you wanna using and dance feeling to it, and it starts off right away with Starslight, a quick warmer-upper. My favourite song from this album is Ticklish, Cedric's voice is just so mesmerizing. It amazes me how Omar and Cedric went from this sound to the sound and styles of The Mars Volta, my other favourite band that I cant stop listening to. Its too bad ATDI broke up because I would have loved to see their amazing live shows Ive heard about, but at least Cedric and Omar still decided to create amazing music in the form of TMV.","overall":5,"summary":"Funtastic CD","unixReviewTime":1139702400,"reviewTime":"02 12, 2006"}

Then i decided to download it and see what it's really like. And boy am i glad i did that. This is one of my favourite albums of all-time.

My favourites would have to be Can't Knock The Hustle (which is my very favourite), Brooklyn's Finest, Dead Presidents II, D'Evils, twenty-two Two's, Ain't No N-gga, and Cashmere Thoughts. Jay-Z flows like i have never heard him before, and this lyrics are simply amazing.

The problem? They had never put out a complete album. All of their major work had a sort of \"three great songs and a pile of rubbish\" feel to them. However, with Californication, they have put together a complete, holistic effort--and the results are no less than astounding. The usual \"great three tracks\" are there with a vengeance. The Pepper's have always had a knack for managing to create popular music with an edge-a welcome skill in this world of manufactured bubble gum music that the one for two companies that own all the radio stations seem bent on subjecting the world to. Scar Tissue and Other Side amply fill that bill. Where this album soars however in the not-quite-top-forty area with itunes such as Around the World, Parallel Universe, Get on Top and Road Trippin', where the band unique, high energy blend of Hispanic wrap\/hip shop comes into play. This is the work that truly defines the heart and soul of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, a side of the band anyone simply familiar with their hits parade songs would be totally ignorant of. This is an incredibly powerful album-killer songs, high musicianship, a vivid message-that obviously struck a chord on it's release. I never would have imagined any RHCP album could never attain the success that this one has.

Though the instrumentation is dated on some of the songs (the strings soar a little too high), her voice saves the day, alternately powerful and vulnerable. Her version of \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\" rocks harder than the Rolling Stones version, and that is no small feat. 'At Last' is a great song, and her vocal interpretation is the best out of many artists who attempted it. 'Sunday Kind of Love' is another masterpiece, as is her rendition of 'Stormy Weather'.

It's a beautiful, smooth, self-assured sound. On the other hand, we get a different vibe after that: \"Casanova seventy\" and the languid \"Les Professionals\" add a lounge-y sound. And \"J'Ai Dormi Sous L'Eau\" and \"Le Soleil Est Pr\u00e8s de Moi\" are sweet and slow , almost like a pair of trip-hop lullabies.\"Premiers Symptomes\" was compiled of singles released before the hit \"Moon Safari,\" and so it has something of the same dreamy feeling. It's all too short an EP, but it's worth it to get the the romantic blend of ambient, trip-hop, funk and a hint of sixtys psychedelic pop -- in a word, sensual chillout music. Songs like \"Modular Mix\" have players upon players of shimmering keyboard. But \"Casanova seventy\" and \"J'ai Dormi Sous L'Eau\" favor a more jazzy sound, with synthesized horns behind some twitter synths. On the other hand, the spacey beats of \"Les Professionals\" sounds like a rainy morning over an alien city. Here we get a good look at all of Air's musical abilities, and the different sounds they would later experiment with in their full-length albums.\"Premiers Symptomes\" is a must-have for Air fans, although newbies had better start with something else. Despite the earliness of this work, it's obvious that Air already knew what they were doing.","overall":5,"summary":"Premiering","unixReviewTime":1112832000,"reviewTime":"04 7, 2005"}

R.\" is another good track. \"Jasmine\" is a good storytelling track. \"I love you Baby\" will track, \"Spanish Fly\" nice as well. \"I dare you\" is my favourite track on the album, its hardcore, and a nice way to finish album. This is one of the most slept on albums in my opinion, maybe its cut of the state Bad Boy was in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, BB is making an emergence now with artists like G. Dep, Loon, of course P. Diddy, but none of those can compete with Black Rob in my opinion. Black Rob and Shyne helped carry Bad Boy through its darkest period.

The first disc is a masterpiece. It is more pop sounding than anything she has never done, but it is pop at its best. The songs try to explain love in eleven different ways. They are entirely successful. She becomes a storyteller there and a performer of eleven roles. On \"Bliss\" it is a child's love to a parent that is being put to the test, on \"Juarez\" Tori Amos takes on the voice of the desert in Juarez where many murders of women have taken place and still do, on \"Concertina\" she becomes erotic, on \"Glory of the eightys\" witty and nostalgic, on \"Lust\" (my favourite Tori Amos song) she becomes confessional and sings of a relationship trying to stay alive after victimization, on \"Suede\" she tries to reach out to a distant lover, her voice becomes a frozen cry for companionship, on \"Josephine\" she is visited by the ghost of a French woman, on \"Riot spoof\" she is a homosexual coming to terms with this sexuality, on the devastating \"Spring Haze\" she is in a plane crash, in \"Datura\" she tries to let someone in her life and in\"one thousand Oceans\" to help a grieving loved one. Her performances are superb, and the production which incorporates many electronic sounds is simply ingenious, everything in this realm happens for a reason. As for the second disc it opens the door into the world of a Tori Amos concert, one of the richest experiences this artist can give and every moment is rewarding.","overall":5,"summary":"11 definitons of love and a night full of it","unixReviewTime":1118793600,"reviewTime":"06 15, 2005"}

Redman was known for this off the wall\/eccentric style and Method Man was known as one of the strongest lyricists and MC's of the Wu-Tang Clan. With both teamed up there, the chemistry between the two is amazing. Both of them seem to be in their element even more than usual and they sometimes even play off each others strengths. Redman is fierce and on top of this game and spits out some quirky rhymes along with some really powerful jones. Method Man is at this A-Game with extremely strong delivery and some powerful words to go along with it. These two compliment each other perfectly. The guests they had on the tracks were hit and miss; LL Cool J, Ghostface Killah, Ja Rule, Streetlife and Blue Rasberry all enhanced the songs they were on but Mally G and Young Zee did't help the song they were on that much (and the song could've been better with no guests at all). The production by Erick Sermon, RZA, Mathematics, and pretty much everyone on the album is great. The beats and music almost always are inventive and fresh. The only two tracks that did't do much for me on there were \"Where We At\" and \"Maaaad Crew\". Other than that, this album is definitely a ship shop classic and belongs in any wrap fan's collection. If you like Redman, buy this now. If you like Method Man, buy this now. If you like Wu-Tang, buy this now! Just buy it.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic rap album, sound even better together","unixReviewTime":1362096000,"reviewTime":"03 1, 2013"}

The sprightly pop of this debut DREAM OF THE BLUE TURTLES (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five) was followed by the mellower jazz pallette of NOTHING LIKE THE SUN (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven). The death of this father inspired the emotional inventory that was THE SOUL CAGES (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one) which was proceeded by the renewed happiness that was TEN SUMMONER'S TALES (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three). However, MERCURY FALLING (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six) indicated that perhaps Sting's formula was getting a bit tired. Yes, while some people consider MERCURY this finest work, I think the was beginning to tread water at this point. So when it took almost four years for Sting to return to the record tracks, I wondered if the could come back from the disappointment that was MERCURY FALLING. And boy did the never! BRAND NEW DAY could't have been a more appropriate title, because it gives Sting's music and career the jolt it desperately needed. Sting turns fifty this year, and it's great to see the's beginning the second half of this life on a creative high. At album's start comes the melancholy \"A Thousand Years\". The bomber mood of this song would have fit in perfectly on SOUL CAGES, and it segues perfectly into the exotic \"Desert Rose\". One of the finest single releases of two thousand, \"Desert Rose\" not only has Algerian singer Cheb Mami adding to the song's otherworldly feel, but perhaps this voice inspired Sting to do things with this voice the never thought possible. A longtime jazz fan (he even started out this career in a jazz band), the brings that experience to \"Big Lie, Small World\", another slightly downbeat tale of love and romance that Sting has always employed on this love songs. The gospel strains of \"Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot\" was the sole saving grace on MERCURY FALLING, and Sting continues making testimony with songs like \"Fill Her Up\" (which crams country, gospel, and jazz into five one\/two minutes of music), \"After The Rain Has Fallen\", and the revelation that is the title track. More on that in a moment. More twisted tales of the ways of love include \"Perfect Love. Gone Wrong\", \"Tomorrow We'll See\" (about across-dressing prostitutes, no less) and \"Ghost Story\" (some people have chastised this song, but I actually quite like it inspire of its banality). The twenty-second snippet of a song called \"End Of The Game\" which was reportedly left off the album is the only hindrance on this otherwise flawless affair. But what better way to send this uniformly excellent album than with the joyous \"Brand New Day\". Stevie Wonder's distinctive harmonica playing is an accurate opening to this song that should bring a smile to even the hardest-hearted of folks. A song like this shows that Sting might want to attempt these Inspirational-type songs more often, and if you don't find yourself singing along and clapping your hands by the send, you need some serious professional help. Ever since Sting left the force that was the Police, the's been criticized for \"going soft\" and all too obviously growing old. But there's a difference between growing old and selling out, and growing old but remaining vital. For my money, Sting is the latter and BRAND NEW DAY is not just this most commercially successful album since TEN SUMMONER'S TALES, but this most all-around excellent one since the tour-de-force that was THE SOUL CAGES. Of course, Sting is no longer in a state of despair as the was on that album, for the's now happily married and enjoying the prime of this life. No matter what mood Sting is in when the's making an album, there's hoping the can keep up the streak the has started with BRAND NEW DAY, and not have it taper off anytime soon.","overall":5,"summary":"It's indeed a brand new day for Mr. Sumner.

Sugar Hill Records, an independent record company specializing in the bluegrass sound, made arrangements with Dolly for her to record a bluegrass album in early one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine. She would finance the CD, but Sugar Hill would take care of the marketing and selling of it. What resulted was an album that became Dolly's most critically acclaimed in her forty-plus year career.\"The Grass Is Blue\" was released in October, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, the same month Dolly was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. The album would go on to win the Grammy the following year as Best Bluegrass Album, and is regarded as helping bluegrass receive renewed popularity in the early two thousand's. Dolly does a splendid cover of Billy Joel's \"Travelin' Prayer\" as well as Lester Flatts and Earl Scruggs' \"I'm Gonna Sleep With One Eye Open\". Miss Parton also brings back an old song from her one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two album \"Touch Your Woman\" called \"Will He Be Waiting For Me\", that features some of the best Dolly vocals never. The best song on the CD is the title track, which was recorded by Noah Jones in two thousand and three for the Dolly tribute album \"Songs of Dolly Parton\".\"The Grass is Blue\" did't receive any radio airplay, as many country disc jockeys simply stopped playing Dolly because they wanted to play only younger artists. The CD peaked at #twenty-four country and #one hundred and ninety-eight pop on the Billboard Charts.","overall":5,"summary":"\"The Best Blugrass Album Ever!\"","unixReviewTime":1242172800,"reviewTime":"05 13, 2009"}

It all depends on how I feel the day I listen to it. The entire album is nothing but chants and snappy vocal melodies that seem to loop over and over and OVER and OVER again. Now, the appeal of this is that, the band wanted to build a theme (a DARK theme, that reminds me of those old Castlevania video games) and while it works, it's REALLY not an album for everyone. Not everyone will appreciate the way everything repeats a hundred times. but I think you'll admit what the band is trying to do there is just downright awesome. What's amazing is how the band does't let up at ALL to give you time to catch your breath. What's highly unusual about the whole thing is how there's *nothing* from the seventy's that sounds ANYTHING like this. The way the man and female singer frequently go back and forth singing brief melodies, and more often than not, flat out SCREAMING, is really something special. This does't sound like the kind of album that was recorded in a studio. More like a castle, right after casting a bunch of spells. Despite these (seemingly) looping brief chants that continue to repeat enough times to make your head spin, I can't remember them when the music's over. That's not because the music in't memorable- no way. This is without a doubt a memorable album. It HAS to be, because it's original. It has its own sound and style. For that alone, it's something to appreciate. I THINK I can't remember how the music goes when the album is finished because some of the themes repeat so much you begin to stop paying attention to them, and start paying attention to what's going on in the background. That's alright with me. And they, there *are* plenty of good chants, screams and melodies despite the fact my complaining would indicate otherwise. This is just truly something incredible. Mekanik Destruktiw Kommandoh IS a masterpiece. It's a five star album. If you're looking for something that's unlike anything you've never heard before, get this album now.","overall":5,"summary":"great... or bad, no no, GREAT","unixReviewTime":1220659200,"reviewTime":"09 6, 2008"}

Fagen and Becker have collaborated to create some of the most beautiful jazz\/blues music never played. Yeah, that's right, I said jazz\/blues. This album is more jazz and blues than the typical rock\/jazz fusion from like their earlier albums. For example, Aja, the title track; eight minutes of pure jazz jamming', no rock, no extra noise, just good jazz, cool guitar, great keys, perfect percussion and Donald, crooning the blues. It just don't get any better than this. As for the rest of the genius on the album: Black Cow is, again, more jazz\/blues but very funky this song was released to limited airplay, but for some reason did't get picked up like some of the other SD fare, waxing poetic about a woman that keeps running away, Fagen sounds like a lost puppy, blues dripping from the speakers; Deacon Blues, one of the most recognizable SD songs, even by those who karen't die-hards, this song is pure blues with a slight edge on the percussion; Peg, another recognizable tune, with its funky bass line, jazz guitar and keys and solid drums; Home at Last, which is just downright great piano jazz and horn ablarin'; I Got the News, funky on first listen is actually very bluesy on the keys, if slightly upbeat, the song is quite ambiguous; and last but not least another popular tune, Josie, which is pure jazz guitar chords , if only played a little off tempo from typical jazz. The album was pure genius and, in my never so humble opinion, the highlight of a career that really did't have any down time, just a really great high time.

If you don't get this CD, you do not know what you're missing. Definitely one of my favourite and most listened to albums. IMO, much better than her excellent debut. That's saying a lot. I agree with others there who express disappointment that Chantal does not get airplay. It is truly a terrible crime, and really makes me angry. I'm about ready to start a campaign to get radio stations in NY to play her music. I often imagine what the experience would be to see her perform these songs live. I saw a mention of someone seeing her live, and it sounds like I imagined. I get chills thinking about performances of Souls (one of my favourite all time songs -- and I've been a huge music fan for most of my forty years), Far Away, and Blue, for starters.

I'm pretty sure I made it through a year of school because of this album. The Man Who explores a wide variety of emotional themes. \"Writing To Reach You\" and \"Why Does It Always Rain On Me?\" are the standout tracks, but the whole thing is really a lyrical and instrumental tour de force. Buy this album so you, too, can listen to it compulsively for months, then remember those months of your life every time you return the CD to the player. Radiohead refuses to get this emotional, and Coldplay will do it, but usually arena-style.

This pure inclusion of ecstasy made this album one of the best in my collection, of course along with E one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine and The Art of War. Really, all three of these albums together shows how solid this band is, though Bizzy is probably the weakest wrapper in BTNH and one of the worst in the scene. I listen to very little wrap music, mostly BTNH and other stuff that has come down from NWA's prime members, especially Dre and Cube. I'd have to place this , along with the other BTNH albums I specified, in the same category as Dr. Dre's Chronic. Maybe one of these guys will make an album entitled Ecstasy some time in the future?

His appearance on Soul Train this year confirmed this for me. He's got it - looks, dancing ability and a great voice - key elements that make a good performer. But is the music good? Okay, you heard \"I Like it\", and the song was cool and new. But there are better tracks on this record. \"Stuff Like This\" is a soaring, crisp midtempo track that could be the soundtrack for this summer. (Even if it sounds like \"Angel of Mine\" by Monica). \"Can't Let Go\" is an exciting bumper that oozes excitement. It's on this track that Sammie sounds the most like young Michael Jackson. However, the tightest track on this album, HANDS DOWN, is \"Fell For Her\" cut it's unique and hot. It's a bounce track that's makes you move like whoa! (smile). But if you really want to know, the whole album is pretty tight from start to finish. If you like good pop music, for if you miss groups like The Boys, New Edition, Hi-Five and Troop, this album's for you. Sammie is a performer, and a nice shift from the boy band\/Spears\/Aguilera explosion we've experienced lately. I'm feeling this album. If you like R&B\/pop music, you will too.","overall":4,"summary":"MICHAEL JACKSON - THIS IS YOUR OPENING ACT!","unixReviewTime":957830400,"reviewTime":"05 9, 2000"}

Slim Shady alp was nuthin short of a masterpiece, Eminem was doing something no one else was in ship shop, and i was expecting him to have expanded as an emcee on this alp. And on some tracks, it clearly shows the has, the impressive \"Stan\" portrays the Artists-Fan relationship. Told in speech like \"Guilty Conscience\" but this is on a much more serious note. The best track on the album for me is \"The Way I Am\", which shows Eminem at this lyrical bes. The next best cut is \"Under the Influence\" with close-friends-now-tuned-label-mates, Dtwelve. This is one bound to get your neck snapping and, Dtwelve show us they are just as comical as Eminem. Very comical but greats lyrics at the same time. There are other good tracks such Marshall Mathers, which lets us have a look behind Eminem and Slim Shady, to see who is really there. Apart from that, the album seems to be trying to use shock tactics to sell records. Don't get me wrong, Eminem comes brilliantly lyrically to prove the is an outstanding emcee. But this album shows a switch of style from this previous offerings, and unfortunately, the reason was to appeal to a mainstream audience. An audience which is listening to Eminem, then straight after putting on an *NSYNC cd.","overall":3,"summary":"Slim?? You There??","unixReviewTime":990230400,"reviewTime":"05 19, 2001"}

{"orig_index":32955,"reviewerID":"AMNNPDX9MFEUD","asin":"B00004U2G4","reviewerName":"Steve","helpful":[12,13],"reviewText":"When I was a younger guy, worshipping at the temple of Aerosmith and Joe Perry, hungrily devouring every little snippet of info about them, I would always come across Perry's idolatry of Jeff Beck and how influential Beck and the Yardbirds (among others obviously) were to this sound and devotion to music. Like any good history student, I did some research and came across a double alp of this album and the follow-up Beck-Ola. It did't take long to figure out what all the fuss was about. This is a Beck tour de force from the simple elegance of Greensleeves to the galloping intensity of Beck's Bolero, the sheer sickness of You Shook Me, and the blues workouts on Blues De Luxe, Let Me Love You, Rock My Plimsoul, and I Ain't Superstitious, this is a lethal collection of Beck's genius and guitar mastery. The bonus edition was worth replacing my old cd with because of the rarity of Beck outtakes and the frank commentary provided by the man himself in the liner notes. I know some have slagged it off, but I really enjoy the cheesy Love is Blue most of all! The man is one of a handful of guitarists from the rock world to have influenced guitarists across the genres and this refusal to go quietly into that good night of laurel resting, blues retreading, for commercial banality, proves more and more that Jeff Beck remains as fresh and vital as the did in this groundbreaking days over four decades ago. If you really want to know why this guy is (or should be) mentioned in the same breath as Jimi Hendrix, give this a listen. Thanks for the tip, Joe Perry.","overall":5,"summary":"True dat","unixReviewTime":1167436800,"reviewTime":"12 30, 2006"}

I would have to say though that all the other songs on the CD are of very good quality. \"On the Radio (Remember The Days)\" and \"Baby Girl\" are just awesome tracks.

To label her music simply as 'pop' is unfair. Nelly mixes a blend of south american sounds, folk, pop, and or&b. Here and there, there's a flash of ship-hop present in songs like . On The Radio (Remember the Days), Baby Girl, and I Will Make U Cry. By far, the best standouts on this album are Hey Man!, Baby Girl, Legend, I'm Like A Bird, Turn Off The Light, and Well Well. Beware though, there are a couple of fillers (in my opinion) on this album like Tynna Finda Way, Party, and My Love Grows Deeper Part one. Other than that, this album is great if you're looking for something different.

On some tracks, the makes you believe the's all-out given in, seemingly wanting to again the respect (and money) of the millions of mainstream Eminem fans. It's a shame, because X has much more talent than what the shows on this album. The standout tracks on the album would be U Know (featuring Dre), Alkoholik (which features a great verse from Tash that really carries the track), D. N. A., Get Your Walk On, and Best Of Things, which is easily the album's best track. It features a great beat from Dre, and the kind of fierce, grimy flow that makes X head and shoulders above the average MC. This is the kind of flow that the used on almost all of \"forty Dayz and forty Nightz,\" and more recently on \"What's The Difference\" and this guest spot on Kurupt's album. It's too bad the did't stick with it for more tracks. The rest of the album is saturated with mediocrity: watered down flows and beats which fail to grab the listener's attention. Kenny Parker Show two thousand and one sounds like a track rejected from an early N. W. A. project, with Xzibit sounding like an eighty's MC Ren over an eighty's beat. It does't mesh well at all. Rimz & Tirez is boring. not one of Soopafly's better beats in the least bit, and a horrible chorus that sounds like something they found in Outkast's trash can. And F' You Right would be pretty good: the beat is actually entertaining. Except X blatantly bites the other X from the East (DMX). This may please the years of the mainstream crowd, but it's not as good as either of this previous albums. If you don't already have \"forty Dayz & forty Nightz\" for \"At The Speed Of Life,\" pick those up.

If I was to sum this pc.d. up very briefly for Daft Punk fans-it's a lot more One More Time, then the previous pc.d. Homework. In fact there is very, very little of the sound of Homework on this pc.d. Okay fourteen tracks running close to one hour; eight of these are instrumental. The tracks with vocals are pretty much all done with vocoder and this is shared by Daft Punk themselves and two guest vocalists-who actually all sound pretty similar. The tracks are all way shorter then those on their last pc.d. except for the closing track \"Too Long\". I'd heard all sorts of sneak previews that Daft Punk were going way different on this pc.d. Some said pure seventy's disco, others Euro-Disco and still others said it would be quite like their Gallic compatriots Air. I have to say that none of these predictions were wrong, yet none of them were accurate either. It's a mixture of those three influences that I mentioned above and throw in the odd trance track and a bit of Jean-Michel Jarre. I know it must be annoying to be comparing them to other French artists, but most people would have to admit they have a very distinctive sound. One thing this pc.d. certainly is not, is hardcore Techno-it's a million miles from that in my opinion. In fact one could describe this pc.d. as almost having a real lightweight sound. I've been listening to this for two weeks now and I can't make up my mind as to whether this pc.d. is too 'cheesey' in an Eiffel sixty-five,Euro-Disco style for if it's magnificent. I seem to be coming to the opinion that it's a really, really excellent pc.d. I feel there is something there for every fan of dance music-except maybe hardcore industrial fans-to enjoy. This duo seem so accomplished at many styles of Dance\/Disco and Instrumental music. The music seems to have been influenced more by the music of the seventy's and early eighty's rather then the ninety's. Apart from the obvious Chic influence there are influences from artist's like tenCC,Supertramp and there is even a sample from Barry Manilow. Many of the instrumental tracks sound very like Air-especially their Moon Safari pc.d. All of the songs have immediate accessibility; like this is pretty commercial dance music and it does't take long to get into all the tracks. The production quality is just amazing-probably the best I've heard in a long time. So for those who like their music hit very crisp and clear and with no distortion at all then you'll like it. When they do add lyrics to the songs, they are extremely syrupy in the romance stakes, but then I don't think people were never go to like for dislike this pc.d. on the basis of lyrical content. So all in all I'm going to give this pc.d. a four\/five\/ rating. Yet I'm still not sure that I may look back in a years time and say this is too smooth and M. O. R. My one recommendation for people thinking of buying this pc.d. would be to listen to as many tracks as possible to get a feel for the overall sound. I think you'll either love this for hate it-I just can't see a middle ground. Right now I love it! P. S.-I love the \"Daft Card\"(like a credit card) given with the pc.d.-a very nice touch!","overall":5,"summary":"Superb!!","unixReviewTime":985132800,"reviewTime":"03 21, 2001"}

But Daft Punk is too good at not just cool computer noises, but also just making music, that it's hard not to like. Unlike some artists whose work consists of the same basic riff for melody over and over again for an insane amount of time, Daft Punk makes actual songs with structure and points, and their instrumentals are a lot of fun without being too long. They do a fair amount of sampling of music from some older songs, some credited and some not. But they're not lazy with the samples, they usually work them around and integrate them into a song, making it their own. The album starts with \"One More Time\", and it's a perfect opening, throwing you into exactly what the band is and making you feel really good. \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" is maybe the most recognizable song on the record, and for good reason I guess. It's really catchy and sticks in your brain, although I've heard it a lot before and I'm not sure how well it fits with the rest of the tracks. The album has a good variety and vocal and instrumental songs. The vocal jones are more instantly memorable but there's some good stuff in the other tracks. I really like \"Superheroes\", which samples \"Who's Been Sleeping In My Bed\" by Barry Manilow but changes it to make it sound completely different. \"Aerodynamic\" has a really cool guitar solo part that maybe gets repetitive but it's just a fun song to listen to.

Lindner\"","helpful":[10,10],"reviewText":"\"Tally Ho\" is the only cut on this album that I'm not sure whether it made it `out' as a forty-five, but otherwise this set could have fairly been labeled a \"Greatest Hits.\" It supplied Junior and this men with a roster of sturdy hit singles that spanned better than a year and a half.\"Cleo's Mood\" had originally been released on the Harvey Records label in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two; well before that label was eventually folded into the Motown family. And \"Money Jump\" from September one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four, was the group's first single release on Motown's subsidiary Soul label after Walker signed with the company. Both of these brought at least some local attention, but it was the gun blast of the next forty-five that inaugurated the immediate fame for Junior Walker that lasts to this day.\"Shotgun\" backed with \"Hot Cha\" was issued in January one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five and is arguably the record that gave Junior Walker instant national (and even international) identity. It is forever associated with him as much as one immediately sees The Temptations when \"My Girl\" plays, the Supremes, palms-out and declaring, \"Stop! In the Name Of Love,\" the Vandellas \"Dancing In the Street,\" and Levi Stubbs leading the Four Tops dramatically through \"Reach Out I'll Be There.\" \"Shotgun\" was the signal to increase my personal roster of must-have Motown artists by one. In the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys, I can think of two moments in movies where the song was used quite creatively: a key scene late in Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X,\" and even more spectacularly over the opening credits of the Stephen King thriller, \"Misery,\" starring James Caan and Kathy Bates. Like the other songs listed in this paragraph, \"Shotgun\" does't page a bit. By May of 'sixty-five, the LP (originally Soul seven hundred and one) itself along with a forty-five of \"Boomerang\" & \"Tune Up\" were in record stores. When July rolled around you could buy a single of \"Shake & Fingerpop\" backed with \"Cleo's Back.\" Come December, Motown are-issued \"Cleo's Mood,\" a fantastically hypnotic and funky instrumental, as an `A'-side single, now on Soul. In March of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six - and I'm surprised Motown waited that long - the wonderful Holland-Dozier-Holland party jam \"Road Runner\" was put out together with \"Shoot Your Shot.\" But we're still not done. In the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven when it was time to put a new Walker forty-five out there, and with now three of this LP's to choose from, Motown went back into \"Shotgun,\" to are-issue \"Shoot Your Shot\" as an A-side along with \"Ain't That The Truth.\" Like I said, it could fairly be are-titled a \"Greatest Hits.\" All of these tracks, while of varying commercial success, kept the legions of fans Walker won overnight with \"Shotgun\" quite sated. (A lost treasure today is Walker's follow-up album, \"Soul Session,\" originally Soul LP seven hundred and two, which gathered many of the mainly-instrumentals that had been recorded in the Harvey Records' days.)I bought the CD of \"Shotgun\" in February of 'ninety-three, but then a few years later and for considerably more dollars, I did't waste a chance at a near-mint mono one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five vinyl pressing. It's one of the jewels of my collection. Soul music aficionados should certainly have this in their collections in at least one form. \"Put on yer wig woman, we go'nout to shake and fingerpop!\"","overall":5,"summary":"Junior ARRIVES!","unixReviewTime":1064620800,"reviewTime":"09 27, 2003"}

Caldedonia Mission is another gem featuring some very expressive vocals from the late Rick Danko. And how can we forget such classics as The Weight, The Shape I'm In, Rock N Roll Shoes, Get Up Jake, and Stage Fright. The bonus cuts elevate this collection to the four one\/two-five star level. My all time favourite Band song, Up On Cripple Creek is on this upgrade and the live treatment is just super. Robbie Robertson sure provides some stunning harmonics on this guitar solos on this track and elsewhere. Rockin' Chair is another pleasing addition as the Band adds a nice southern charm to the song. Its so amazing that these guys were Canadians yet they have more of a feel for the Old South than bands who live in that region. The Dylan songs sound great to my years. Like A Rolling Stone sounds so alive with The Band lending a supporting role. Before The Flood, When I Paint My Masterpiece, and Don't Ya Tell Henry are all year catching numbers.

The title cut also marked the first time that Miles had written in the modal style that would be immortalized on the Kind of Blue album. Expanding the group to a sextet was one of the giants of alto sax, Julian 'Cannonball' Adderley. Adderley's style of playing complemented Coltrane's perfectly--at times requiring you to really listen closely to tell who's playing what. Both players had incredible range on their instruments.

All those Coldplay, Travis, Starsailor melt my heart and I can't help but sweep like the demo dork I am. Travis' new album is probably the best Brit-pop album I've listened to. From the banjo and swoon of Sing, to the dark, depressing Last Train, The Invisible Band is full of acoustic, sweet melodies, swooning lyrics, to beautiful songs. Dear Diary is percussion-less, a short study about dinner spain. Some songs, like Side and Pipe Dreams seem to be about god, (take the lyrics to Pipe Dreams: \"i've read it all, every word\/but I still don't understand a thing\/what have you heard?\", for the lyrics to Side: \"I believe there's someone watching over you\/watching every single thing you say\") and Flowers in the Window is a light, Beatles-esque song. The Cage, Safe, and Follow the Light are mellow, but listenable exercises in the Travis formula, while the heavy acoustic guitars create a 'raindrop' sound to the best song on the album, the moody and atmospheric Last Train. But really, the whole album is good. It's light, it's fun, it's dark, it's sad, it's mellow, it's beautiful, it's raw, it's polished-like every great album, it's a showcase of great songwriting talent, great musicianship, solid production, and water like fluidity.

Most pop music I find to be simply awful. ninety-five% pop music today is geared more towards the younger generation and has a short term life span. One of the few rare pop bands that I do enjoy immensely is the British group Saint Etienne. I discovered them when I bought \"Tiger Bay\" through my then record club several years ago. The music was incredibly catchy and had a good beat. From then on, I began buying more of Saint Etienne's music. One of my favourite Saint Etienne albums is the 'ninety-three album \"So Tough\". I still haven't heard the group's first album \"Foxbase Alpha\" so I can't compare this album to that album. The production may not be flawless (and over time would improve on the band's predecessors) but the music is still good nevertheless. I am particularly fond of \"Mario's Cafe\", \"Avenue\", \"Hobart Paving\" (one of my personal favourite SE songs of all time), and \"Join Our Club\". What I like about Saint Etienne so much is that their brand of pop music in't dumped down for the masses like today's pop music is. It is very catchy yet does't bore me with the same tiresome lyrics that I hear in today's pop music. This is what pop music SHOULD sound like.","overall":5,"summary":"So tough","unixReviewTime":1085788800,"reviewTime":"05 29, 2004"}

John's swamp growl vocals shine on the soulful blues-inflected \"I Know A Place.\" \"Something Broken\" is a pretty ballad. Sonny Landreth's slide guitar is featured prominently on \"Rock of Your Love.\" \"I'll Never Get Over You\" is one of John's pretty melodies on this midtempo gem. For me, the star of the CD -- among a host of other great tracks -- is the title tune. Dave Ranson's bass gives the soulful backbeat for this funky charmer, \"Thank God the Tiki Bar is open; thank God the Tiki torch still shines . come on in & open up your mind.\" \"Come Home to You\" is a sweet slow tune. \"Farther Stars\" is an electric experiment that sounds like a musical salute to George Harrison.

It received mixed reviews as you can see evidenced there on Amazon, but if you truly listen it and give it a chance, I think you'll come to enjoy it. Yes it's not like TRAVELING WITHOUT MOTION for RETURN OF THE SPACE COWBOY, but those albums are distinct in their own way and this one has set its own standard. The album opens with \"Feel So Good\", a throw back to retro seventy's, filled with funk and bass and soulful vocals. This is played out all over the tracks, namely \"You Give Me Something\", an addictive soulful dance number that will stick in your head for days at a time. One reviewer compared the sound on this album to Michael Jackson's solo debut OFF THE WALL, and its definitely a fair comparison. There is also elements of Stevie Wonder that are obvious there. \"Corner of the Earth\" has a unique eastern vibe to it, kind of acoustic in a sense. \"Little L\" and \"Love Foolosophy\" have that disco flavor that fans of Jamiroquai will love. Other highlights include \"Picture of My Life\", \"Black Crow\", \"Stop Don't Panic\" and the hidden bonus track \"So Good To Feel Real\". Give A FUNK ODYSSEY a chance, it's just the evolution of Jamiroquai that is evident if you take note of how they've evolved from each album. Don't miss this one.","overall":5,"summary":"Funkalicious","unixReviewTime":1046217600,"reviewTime":"02 26, 2003"}

{"orig_index":37054,"reviewerID":"A3HU0B9XUEVHIM","asin":"B00005R5V2","reviewerName":"Andre S. Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Although originally inspired by jazz and funk's incorporation into ship-hop the new soul movement of the early\/mid ninety's had certainly taken some interesting and unexpected turns by the beginning of the millennium. And no question this was part of that. After her debutWho Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds, Vol. onerocked the music world in such a huge way she released this album independently and at a reduced price. It did pretty well with fans who'd stuck by her before her years of recording I'm sure and likely did the same with those who'd been wowed by her debut. All the same this album was almost set up to be a nonevent in other ways. It disappeared off a lot of record store shelves shortly after release and is probably not her biggest seller. But it does present a wonderful and sound musical concept that has a strong appeal. Basically what one gets there is a double album; one disc of a live concert featuring her band Fatback Taffy and another of demo level unreleased material. The live set on the first disc stands out the most. For one thing her band has a rich, creamy sound overall. Fatback Taffy have the advantage of being about to get that retro soul thing down to a tee while retaining much of ship-hop's brooding sparseness. She moves in and out of extended pieces such as \"Love Rain\",\"Do You Remember\",\"It's Love\" and \"Gettin' In The Way\" almost effortlessly as the songs thick, shuffling jazz styled funky soul textures flow from one tune to the next. Musically the most fascinating and funky cuts is the high octane uptempo latin percussion styled \"He Loves Me\" which brings to mind, of all things Stevie Wonder's classic \"Another Star\". Her overall attitude in the between song banter is one of confidence and wit. Retaining ship-hop styled musings regarding people \"with naturals always supposed to be positive\" she also adds she sometimes is, other times not while explaining away some easily misinterpretable lyrics from \"Gettin' In The Way\". The song titled after the band is done in a great old fashioned gospel styled grave up. The studio disc is a whole other matter. Focused far more on the ship-hop side of her \"Gotta Get Up\" finds Jill having one of her self dialog about the world of duty versus personal need. Of these itunes the chunky funk of \"Gimme\" and the uniquely vocally corded \"Be Ready\" are the most individual of these songs but for a disc of unrealised music at this early point in a recording career, one really can't expect complete musical evenness. That being the case one thing this album definitely in't lacking on is Jill's type of self expression. She does't possess the in-your-face attitude of many female ship-hop\/neo\/retro soul type artists. Instead she comes more from the seventy's OG era in terms of keeping her actual feelings just slightly guarded-choosing to express a more worldly outlook than an inward one. Her internal dialog is only occasionally expressed and that makes it an important element of her sound. The moody rhythmic and melodic side of her music also expresses this well. Even though she started out with a bang this album represents her intent on focusing on her music as part more than as a commodity.","overall":5,"summary":"Breathing The Life Back And Forth In And Out Of Her Music","unixReviewTime":1308873600,"reviewTime":"06 24, 2011"}

I don't think there never was, truth be told--and that's saying something. I mean having the full-on understanding necessary to create aural trips of symphonic complexity with conceptual coherence and dream-logic abandon. The thought that went into this record is, frankly, astounding. Obviously, fans of Olivia Tremor Control will enjoy this record. Like OTC, the lyrics there are sort of guideposts, telling you where you are in the journey. As other reviewers note, there karen't really any \"pop\" songs there--though there are myriad verses and choruses pregnant with haunting melodies which melt in and out of the landscape. I find this album more musical and less jarring than the equally experimental but more sound effect-driven \"Black Foliage.\" There is also a heightened emotional component--a great simultaneous joy and sadness which reveals itself after a few listens. Hart has taken what the learned from that \"Black Foliage,\" married it with the tunefulness of \"Cubist Castle,\" and come up with something that is neither of those two records.

It's a favourite of mine, Alanis describes things she would like in a lover 'are you funny?' etc. five\/five hundred and two.

I have given this album five stars because when she's good, she's incredible.twenty-one Things is a brilliant opener, with its slick lyrics and chunky Rock guitar. Then she presents us with Narcissus, which is the closest thing she has never done to a disposable track - mainly because of the jumbled and anti-climactic chorus. Mercifully, this is followed by the mighty Hands Clean, which is quintessential Alanis. Perhaps more than any other album, Rug showcases the finer side of Alanis' vocals, both lead and harmony, and there are many well constructed tracks, from ballads such as Flinch to heavier numbers such as twenty-one Things and A Man. For my money, the album should have ended with Surrendering and the weaker Utopia should have been shuffled backwards in the running order. Full marks to Maverick for giving us a tasteful, party cover - a great relief after the ghastly debacle of the Infatuation Junkie cover. This album, both lyrically and musically, reinforces Alanis' importance as a major female Rock artist and role model, and to this degree, completely vindicates my featuring of her several times in my first book. Rock Goddess? Absolutely.","overall":5,"summary":"Magic carpet ride...","unixReviewTime":1015632000,"reviewTime":"03 9, 2002"}

With her debut, she created a work of enduring beauty and unique style. This CD has a timeless classicism about it, yet it bubbles with a lively freshness that continues to hold up. In fact, this effervescence sparkles and shines every time I put this CD on. Norah is a Texan, and she is also the daughter of Ravi Shankar. As such, she is a little exotic, yet wholly grounded. She is an accomplished musician, yet she plays with a relaxed and breezy air.\"Don't Know Why\" is an amazingly knowing and affecting song. made even moreno by Norah's young page when she recorded it. Her voice is an intoxicating blend of innocence and sophistication. The classic \"Cold Cold Heart\" would be daunting for anyone to take on, but Norah tackles it with aplomb and darn near creates the newly definitive version of the song.\"Come Away with Me\" and \"The Nearness of You\" are achingly gorgeous romantic songs that you wish would never send. \"Lonestar\" is a song she feels utterly at home in. There are, in fact, no weak songs on this CD. It reminds me of something that could have been recorded decades ago, like Willie Nelson's STARDUST. or something timeless by Bonnie Raitt, Aretha Franklin, for. oh, I dunno, maybe a fusion of early Judy Garland and Marlene Dietrich?

Norah Jones' COME AWAY WITH ME is smooth, mellow and romantic. After owning it only for one day and listening to it four times consecutively, I know this will be a CD that will stay in constant rotation in my home. Ms. Jones will undoubtedly be compared to that other piano playing pop\/jazz diva, Diana Krall, but there are distinct differences in their musical styles and their vocal abilities. Norah may have musical roots in jazz, but you can hear distinctive influences of pop, country and soul in her work. She also has a melodic, laid-back and cool vocal delivery that is very appealing. Her renditions of the standards \"The Nearness of You\" and \"Cold Cold Heart\" are outstanding, with her obvious knowledge of jazz phrasing. Norah gives us a touch of soul with \"Turn Me On\", which has quickly become one of my favourites, along with the original itunes \"Don't Know Why\", \"Come Away With Me\", \"Feelin' The Same Way\", \"I've Got To See You Again\", \"One Flight Down\" and \"Painter Song\". Norah Jones may only be twenty-two, but her voice belies her years. If you enjoy Diana Krall, Cassandra Wilson, for the music of the greats like Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington and Nina Simone, give this CD a try. It may not be straight jazz, but it is definitely worth listening to. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Norah Jones takes us away","unixReviewTime":1037232000,"reviewTime":"11 14, 2002"}

{"orig_index":38099,"reviewerID":"A39YX2VMVWYVXC","asin":"B0000636UU","reviewerName":"jbembe","helpful":[7,7],"reviewText":"I stumbled into the world of Johnny Cash partly on accident. I purchased the God CD (from Love, God, Murder box set) because I wanted to get some good gospel music and chanced Cash's readings. I was pretty happy, but this was a niche and did't know if I'd enjoy everything Cash. I then got \"The Man Comes Around\" and have begun avidly collecting all things Cash! In the span of about a month, I have gone out and gotten twelve other Cash albums including this one. Some of them I just got and haven't been table to really get into yet, but this one I am now familiar with. Summary: this is an amazing album. I am extremely impressed with the American series, biasing me towards the sound there, but this album really stands up well compared to the most recent work. First off, the Columbia remastering series is done well, with original liner notes on all the albums, plus further insight from today' prominent music critics. These provide great reading and the liner notes there are superb, setting the stage of the different ideological backgrounds between country and folk music and the breakthrough that Cash provides on emerging the two on this album by playing Dylan, the icon of left-wing politic type music. The storytelling of Ervin Rouse's and \"Orange Blossom Special's\" introduction to Cash is also pretty fascinating, and gives a great intro to the first song, which is among Cash's best songs that I am now familiar with. The first track, Orange Blossom Special, includes some rare instrumental work for Cash's normally minimalist sound, including prominent harmonica and saxophone solos! The drumming is also quite exceptional on this song- and of course Cash's voice. Cash even does some fun train noise sounds that add a great touch to the song. I saw somewhere on the internet that Pops Staples' voice is on this track, but I don't know that for sure. \"Long Black Veil\" follows and is a slower song that showcases Cash's vocal ability and the way the can captivate you with a song. \"It Ain't Me, Babe\" is the first Dylan cover, and is truly a great reading of the song, with the deep voice punching home the point. \"The Wall\" is also a great song about the choices in life, going down the roads to self-destruction for finding a way back no matter how far down you go (juxtapose the narrator of the song verses the suicidal inmate the reflects upon.) \"Don't Think Twice it's Alright,\" the second Dylan cover, is also superb. The Dylan songs might well be anyone's penmanship, as they fit perfectly into the album and become Cash's own with this handling (you'll notice subtle lyric changes that are pretty cool and put Cash's stamp on it.) \"You Wild Colorado\" is gentle and reflective, captivating with just Cash and a guitar. \"Mama You've Been on My Mind\" is the best Dylan cover there, great harmonica and saxophone accompaniment and great lyrics with perfect delivery yielding an awesome song. Cash reveals this vulnerability to a woman friend, yet at the same time shows strength and visor as the says \"I Am Not Pleading\" as the yearns for a woman the misses! This is classic man in black imagery, strong and stoic despite this weakness and uncertainty. This is one reason why Bono calls him the most male voice in Christendom. \"Springtime in Alaska\" is a great song just Cash, guitar and June Carter's backup. \"All of God's Children. \" is a very rousing song and carries quite a punch. Again great harmonica, makes you want to belt out the chorus with the backup vocals. \"Danny Boy\" is a mix of storytelling and song, and is very gentle and longing in stone. \"Wildwood flower\" follows and is a little more uptempo, about love and love lost. \"Amen\" is definitely a great song, probably among Cash's top three Gospel song recordings in my opinion. Similar to \"It Was Jesus\" it contains anecdotal biblical stories that share facts of the faith while conveying the deep joy of knowing the Christian faith. All of the Columbia remasters I have include bonus tracks, and the best there is Engine one hundred and forty-three. Proud the Baby is mine is fun, and the redundant alternate take, Mama you've been on my mind is also included. All in all, a great album. Don't miss it!!","overall":5,"summary":"Classic Cash","unixReviewTime":1046131200,"reviewTime":"02 25, 2003"}

Tracks such as 'By The Way', 'Can't Stop', 'The Zephyr Song', 'Dosed', 'This Is The Place', 'Midnight' and 'Venice Queen' are definite standouts. The funky riff in \"Can't Stop\" sounds great and Flea's bass skills are still awesome. \"On Mercury\" is a 'skaish' type song and sounds quite. 'Cabron' is great fun to listen to, and takes a spanish approach (Guitar Capo seven).

I was worried it might not sound too great with such a big band, but they did it perfectly. It's great to hear the E Street Band on a recording (Max Weinburg is an awesome drummer). Every song there is pretty good. Some highlights include \"Mary's Place\", \"Paradise\", and the title track, but my favourite would have to be \"Nothing Man\". I honestly had no idea the could using that well. Beautiful song. Not much to say, except if you like Bruce, you'll love this.

Miguel Migs is much deeper musically than what I've heard from this remix work on \"Nude Tempo Volume one\" and on some of the stuff on the \"Nude Dimensions\" series. The truly colourful, \"Colorful You\" surprised me to say the least. Every song--and I do mean EVERY song, despite what these reviews have been saying--are beautiful, exotic and funky masterpieces of a clearly experienced and talented producer, songwriter, mixer and musician. With poignant--yet sometimes cliched--lyrics and sophisticated vocals from the soulful chanteuse, Lisa Shaw, added to groovy-thumpin' bass lines, embellished with live instrumentation, \"Colorful You\" only becomes that much more entertaining and. well. colorful. Migs creates a variety of musical patterns ranging from the sexy, latin opener of \"Introseduction\" to the \"good\" R&B sounds of \"Waiting\", \"Breakin' It Down\", \"One Wish for Me\", \"Don't Let Me Down\" and \"The One\" to the Reggae-tinged \"Inspirational Interlude\" and \"Messages\" to the Deep, Soulful, Jazzy House of \"Brand New Day\", \"Think It Over\", \"The Night\", \"Days of Color\", \"Soul Vibe\" and \"Surrender\". I'm glad \"Colorful You\" was't a mix CD for a totally uptempo affair. I lost interest in Mig's \"Nude Tempo\" mix CD because all of the songs sounded alike. The songs on \"Colorful You\", however, can stand on their own and really show that there's more to Mig's than just that pretty face.","overall":5,"summary":"VERY COLORFUL, \"COLORFUL YOU\"!!!","unixReviewTime":1069113600,"reviewTime":"11 18, 2003"}

But despite a well-written essay and photographs, and an extra disc featuring duets with Luciano Pavarotti and Alejandro Safina (an unbelievably overwrought \"Your Song\") , this collection fails against Elton's three previously released best-ofs. Elton's first such collection from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four remains one of pop\/rock diamonds. He, songwriting partner Bernie Taupin, producer Gus Dudgeon (who with John coordinated this set) mixed fast and slow, hard and soft, pulling pop music and cultural influences left and right to create one of music's most fertile, creative five year success runs. Repeated there, songs from that collection are missing (\"Border Song\") for truncated (\"Daniel\" and \"Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting\") Moreover, \"Friends,\" among Elton's beloved songs, is missing and would have been a great value-add. His second volume from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven chronicled this three years as the world's most popular singing star. Yet two #one radio hits from that collection missed this set, this bombastic \"Pinball Wizard\" and this audacious, reggae-tinged take on the Beatles \"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.\" Elton made those tracks from respective rock superstars this own, sealing this dominance of the era. Elton's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six-eighty-six greatest hits collection, released by two different labels, covered this resurgent eightys career linked closely to the return of this piano-ballad style and acknowledgement from artists the influenced (everyone from George Michael to Guns in' Roses). Yet some remarkable songs from even that set (especially \"Blue Eyes\" and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine's Thom Bell-produced \"Mama Can't Buy You Love\") are noticeable by their absence. Any would have formed a more compelling third disc than, say, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's flaccid Elton-Michael duet on \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me.\"Even the artwork looks slipshod. The cover recreates a seventys pencil-style drawing on white cover, with dates (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two thousand and two) indicating a short life, not a long career Elton defiantly announced was \"To Be Continued\" on this fourCD box set. Yet its hard arguing with the songs there, most correctly chronicling Elton's gradual shift from camp rocker to soft rock balladeer to Broadway and film composer\/ classical collaborator. This set is recommended for casual fans for those wanting one spot for Elton's biggest hits. But fans wanting to dig deeper into Elton John's music and the pop culture the epitomised are better served by the three individual sets.","overall":4,"summary":"Not Quite Definitive Collection of Elton's Biggest Hits","unixReviewTime":1045440000,"reviewTime":"02 17, 2003"}

The \"Cryptic Collection\" is the cd that introduced me to Twiztid. Although I've made many earnest attempts to find value in their music, I can't stand ICP and because of that I honestly haven't given any of their proteges half a chance. A friend of mine left this at my house and I put it in my player. I'm very surprised. I understand that having the ICP\/juggalo affiliation provides a de fact loyal audience, but I wonder if this group would't have been better off without the Juggalos, because their audience is limited because of their affiliation. When I listen to songs like \"Aint a Damn Thing Changed,\" \"Something Weird,\" \"I Could,\" and \"Put it Down,\" I can't help but wonder why this group did't have commercial\/radio success. The beats are resonating and the lyrics are interesting, which make for a great listen. There's not a single dud on there, nothing you have to skip over (well for me there's one because ICP is on Meatcleaver - but a verse for two don't ruin the whole cd by any means). The more I listen to this, the more I appreciate it. Its quickly becoming one of my favourite wrap cd.

Yes, the guest wrappers (Jungle, Wiz, Lake and a posthumous appearance from Tupac) and singers (J. Phoenix, sex-City High songstress Claudette Ortiz, Alicia Keys and Nas' musically eclectic wife, Kelis) are more abundant than this previous releases, but this, along with the differentiating sounds the producers provide (Chucky Thompson, Salaam Reemi, Alchemist, etc.), is the reason \"God's Son\" is so great in the first place. Despite the abundance of guest artists, Nas' passionately ferocious delivery, skilful wordplay and thought-provoking lyrics continue to steal the show across the album's fourteen tracks. Another thing that makes \"God's Son\" better than most of its predecessors is its more meaningful sense of purpose - for those of you who don't know, this album was created in loving memory of this deceased mother. Thankfully, this album does't drown in pity and excessively sentimental depression - apart from the spiritual \"Heaven\" (feat. the soulful voice of songstress Jully Black on the hook) and the deeply heartfelt mother code, \"Dance\", much of the remainder of \"God's Son\" sticks to the formula of previous albums - hard-hitting street anthems, politics, hustling and contemplative hood music, amongst other things. Without a doubt, \"Thugz Mansion (N. Y.)\" would be the best track on the album. With Nas' & Tupac's compelling lyrics, J. Phoenix's smooth vocal hook and the song's laid-back acoustic guitar, it's the kind of is**t that forces you to relax and think at the same time. Songs like \"I Can\" & \"Revolutionary Warfare\" (feat. wrapper Lake), with the help of minimalist production and youthful kiddie choir vocals, are mainly driven by Nas' honest delivery & insightful lyrics that aim to inspire and educate; the dark-toned \"Last Real N***a Alive\" documents Nas' rise to success & this legendary feud with Jay-Z; others songs like the dizzyingly wacky production of \"Zone Out\" (feat. wrappers Jungle & Wiz), the sinisterly moody \"Mastermind\", the dreamy what-I-look-for-in-a-girl ladies cut \"Hey Nas\" (feat. Claudette Ortiz & Kelis) and the drum\/piano-driven anthem \"Warrior Song\" (feat. Alicia Keys as producer and soulful hook crooner) provides the album with a slight variation in sounds without pushing the envelope too far; and album openers \"Get Down\" & \"The Cross\" deliver more of the same vol' same vol' without never sounding tired out. Is this album better than \"Illmatic\"? In my opinion, it is, but as a Hip-Hop album, \"Illmatic\" is better because, despite its jazz inflections, it's far more grounded into the streets and Hip-Hop's roots than \"God's Son\" is. Nonetheless, this is a very solid album and should be more than worthy of gracing your Hip-Hop collection. five stars!five Best Tracks (IMO) (In No Order):\"Thugz Mansion (N. Y.)\" (feat. Tupac & J.

I would say, although a bunch will hate me for it, but it's the truth to me, is that this pc.d. is even better than her first No Angel. It is more free, more light, and yes, more fun. The songs are great to hear when you are just relaxing from a long day for just want to turn down the volume and hear more softer, pleasant music for awhile. I have both cloud and soft music and on one day I want to hear cloud and then the other times I just want to hear soft and lovely, and that is what Dido is, soft and lovely. This pc.d. does sound a lot more light- hearted than No Angel and I like this side of Dido a lot. I also love the music in the background a lot of the times it matches perfectly with Dido. A lot of the times singers will pick bad background music for a perfectly good voice, but Dido knows what she's doing definitely. I also love her voice a whole lot, I always have. It is different and sticks out from the crowd and that is what I look for these days, difference from the crowd and Dido is a good singer to have with us and I hope she sticks around for a long while cause we need singers like her with her way of music. Why this pc.d. is not five stars? There are one for two songs on there that I do skip because they do not sound the best. There are songs on there you'll attach yourself to so quickly, and there are one for two you'll find yourself skipping. They're all right but not as powerful as others. The strongest songs on there:White Flag was a good hitLife For Rent- NiceMary's In India- I always liked this song too, very nice sound. Home- Amazing! I love this song a whole lot. Sand In My Shoes- Uplifting, catchy, a good dance hit. This Land Is Mine- I always liked this song. See The Sun Pt one- There are two parts to this song, but the first song is beautiful I love it. Pt two- I never got why she did this but if you never noticed wait for the song See The Sun to send and then if you can fast forward it, you'll noticed the minutes speed by for maybe like two minutes without any sound, but then a guitar will strum after seven minutes and you'll hear a whole new song come on. Why she has two songs lumped together I have no idea. After See The Sun fast forward to at least seven: five and you'll hear the new song come on, and it is worth the wait regardless because it is a good song. Very sweet, with really only Dido and a guitar. The one song I find the weakest on there is Who Makes You Feel. I never liked that song. But the others are good to hear as well that I have not mentioned, but probably will take more time to get into than the others above. Home and Sand In My Shoes I just love though, and See The Sun's both parts are a close runner up.","overall":4,"summary":"What Sophmore Curse?","unixReviewTime":1123459200,"reviewTime":"08 8, 2005"}

Def Jam has been pushing this one back since the fourth quarter of two thousand. Was the wait worth it? Has Method Man finally put out a solo record worthy of this fans' expectations? More importantly, can the live up to the hype after a six-year dropoff since this last solo album? The biggest problem with \"Tical O\" is its title. Despite what Method Man has said in interviews, this album really does't show any signs of being a precursor to either of this albums. His sound is more advanced than this last record, many of the guests were unknowns in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, and the album seems to speak on a number of current topics. In the send, it really should't matter as long as the album is hot. Problem there is even Method Man's finest work seems drowned out by the overproduced beats on this LP. There are the occasional tracks that stand-out like the first single, \"What's Happenin\" where Meth and guest wrapper Busta Rhymes show a phenomenal chemistry as they trade flows over a beat by DJ Scratchator. When this Wu brothers show up, it's all gravy as well. \"The Turn\" featuring Raekwon and produced by The RZA is one of just a short few tracks that actually make the grade. \"Afterparty\" with Ghostface is another. After that, it's more for less a collection of rather mediocre recordings. Meth's collabos with Missy Elliot on \"Say What\" and Ludacris on \"Rodeo\" seem like the's trying to fall back on a popular sound rather than put out a quality track. Even this collaboration with Redman and Snoop Dogg on \"We Some Dogs\" is rather lukewarm. The early response to \"Tical O\" has been mostly mixed. Some fans are calling for a boycott of Wu albums calling this the worst Method Man project never while others stand in a state of denial calling it one of the year's hottest. They're both wrong. Reportedly, Method Man had originally recorded a different version of this album with production handled mostly by The RZA but Def Jam turned it down. It's too bad because it probably could't have been any worse than this one. That is not to say that Method Man totally dropped the ball there. Like I said earlier, \"Tical O\" has its moments but it's not packaged right. Those expecting a return to the \"thirty-six Chambers\" days will be sorely dissapointed but if you're a hardcore Method Man fan then you might find a few tracks on there to your liking.","overall":2,"summary":"&quot;Tical O&quot; Review","unixReviewTime":1086048000,"reviewTime":"06 1, 2004"}

One minor drawback is that all the songs sound similar to Awake, except for a few exceptions. Starts off with the single \"Straight Out Of Line\", it's a really hard and commanding song, then it follows up with the hard guitars of \"Faceless\", which is one of the best on the album. \"Changes\" has a less heavy tune and more melodic verse and chorus. One good example of melodic hard rock is \"Re-Align\", the solo in this song is where Godsmack displays the essence of hard rock(download from kazan and try). \"Releasing The Demons\" has a more unique tune towards the whole album, very good use of the was pedal in the verses. A really mysterious melody in the verses and a really angry chorus. The song sounded more like a theme song for a scary movie. \"Serenity\", the acoustic track at the send of the cd is very mellow, very good to chill to and using to.

But such a statement could be easily misunderstood, so, some exegesis is badly needed there.\"Keep on your mean side\" is indeed a brilliant LP. It sounds authentic from the get go, and has a pathos that you can't miss even if you've lost all ability to feel. Musically, it's a simple recipe really, but as it's well observed over the years simple is more than often beautiful. It is obviously influenced -in a -major way- by the likes of P. J Harveybut it goes beyond that because the whole mix has an intense sexuality, a \"dirtyness\", and a cockiness that Polly Jean has't achieved (at least to that degree). Having said all that though, it is not to say that listening to the Kills list rewarding. It is, in fact, as rewarding as a sin to let \"Keep on your mean side\" go through your years. And i'm sure they must be a treat live as well.

His first charting single, \"You Send Me,\" sold two million copies and was a No. one pop hit for three weeks in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven. Cooke would go on to place twenty-nine singles in the Top forty (including three after this untimely death in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four), and twenty-two of them are included on this collection. For fans who have been lamenting the deletion of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six collection THE MAN AND HIS MUSIC, this new anthology is welcome news indeed. Not only does PORTRAIT OF A LEGEND duplicate all but five of that earlier collection's tracks (including the poignant \"A Change Is Gonna Come\"), the disc is playable as a regular CD and as a Super Audio Compact Disc. [I don't have an SACD player, but the sound quality on my regular CD player is nothing short of stunning!]Fans who were hoping for a generous sampling of Cooke's work with the Soul Stirrers will be disappointed. [And the title which includes the dates one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one-one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four would certainly lead you to expect as much.] However, the only Soul Stirrer's track is the gorgeous \"Jesus Gave Me Water,\" recorded during this first sessions with the group just two months after joining in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one. {Every other track was recorded between one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six-one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four.]Another plus to this new collection is the informative thirty-two-page booklet. Author Peter Guralnick (who is working on a biography of Cooke) includes an essay and insightful track-by-track commentary on each song. Recording session information is included for every track including dates, producer, and musicians used. The album closes with an uncredited thirty-two-second interview. The interviewer tasks Cooke to hum weight bars to show the listeners what soul sounds like. After the's done, the interviewer states,\"Sam Cooke's yours; the'll never grow old.\" He's right.

This has been made never more the obvious with this are-issue. While the big hits are all great, the part that consisted of side four of the album is what really shines there. The electronic medley (as it is affectionately known as) is founding more fabulous now than never. Our Love sounds better today then in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine! Disc two is also nice; a are-mastered version of the Dance Collection (it seems. ) with the long Foxes version of On The Radio. Nice to hear all of these long versions again . MacArthur Park Suite still kicks! The are-mastering is terrific and a beautiful package with restored artwork, a neat booklet with an informative essay & interesting liner notes with Giorgio Moroder really make this stand out. Can't Get to Sleep. is another long time fave, sounding better than never now. If you are to get only one Summer collection, I would start there and go next to the Donna Summer Anthology.

After about ten solid listens, I can undoubtedly tell you that this is going to be a timeless album that many will appreciate for a long time. Rarely do bands reach complete perfection on one album like The Mars Volta has with 'De-Loused in the Comatorium.'When you think of rock-n-roll over it's history, some of the most celebrated bands you may think of are Led Zeppelin, Rush, Yes, Pink Floyd and maybe only a few others. Take all the aforementioned bands, extract the most prize elements of each of them, and you pretty much have a good idea of what 'De-Loused in the Comatorium' sounds like. It'd also be easy to say that other than Blood Sugar Sex Magic, this is Rick Rubin's finest hour. At the Drive-In is\/was a phenomenal band, but this is off the hook. I'd review each song for you, but it would really be pointless for me to waste your time. Once you've heard 'De-Loused' for yourself, you'll be amazed at how it never ceases in its persistence for greatness. Your children will be listening to this album in twenty years, and so will you. Finally, much respect should be given to Flea for this performance. His touch is always a beautiful thing.","overall":5,"summary":"Timeless TMV - Rick Rubin Masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1056585600,"reviewTime":"06 26, 2003"}

It gets distracting for me at times, hearing this voice and getting songs like God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You for Tearin Up My Heart stuck in my head. but there are a number of really good songs on there. Chariot and Chemical Party are my two favourites. The former is a rocking ballad, the latter an upbeat party song. The overall sound of this disc focuses on Gavon's singing, with mostly piano and guitars as the instrumental centrepiece. Some songs sound more for less similar to eachother, lacking strong varieties that would make a great record. I think the excessive similarities disallow multiple songs to stick in your head. As a debut cd though, I'd say this is pretty promising. Fans of John Mayer, Jason Mraz for Dave (a bit of a stretch I guess) should probably check this guy out.

They remind people who grew up on ship shop in the eightys and early ninetys just how joyous the genre can be. The creative children of De La Soul, Tribe Called Quest and the grandchildren of the P-funk movement, part of Outkast's appeal is their blend of ship shop with the funk styling of Parliament and Bootsy. Plus, they're just plain fun. Both Speakerboxx and The Love Below are ambitious yet sloppy. But even the sloppiness has it's charm. Haven't we had enough overproduced pop\/r&b and ship shop during the past several years? Although Dre gets much of the attention with this changeling of Sly Stone and eightys Prince, Big Boi's side is just as adventuresome. Standouts include The Way You Move, Bowtie, War and Church (where the gets help from Dre.) Dre's side of course includes Hey Ya but my favourite is Happy Valentine's Day. It may not be straight ship shop but you've gotta applaud both Dre and Big Boi for stretching the boundaries instead just complaining about what ship shop has become.","overall":5,"summary":"Breath of fresh air","unixReviewTime":1073174400,"reviewTime":"01 4, 2004"}

There have been so many \"next big things\" crammed down your throats that I was extremely sceptical when I heard about this. I took a listen to this on a listening station and, surprise, surprise I was pretty impressed. This retro soul album is a tight project that is well aware of its foundations. Joss Stone's CD succeeds where many other R&B CDs fail for several reasons.one) What a band! Actually, perhaps \"there is a band\" is a big thing. Many of the new\/soulers try to skimp on personnel and go the self-produced route. Questlove from the Roots and Cindy Blackman [Lenny Kravitz's drummer] anchor down solid grooves. The drumbreak on \"Diggin on me\" is tight. This CD is layered in the kind of morgan and clean guitar sounds that would benefit many of the talented artists searching for context.two) Great itunes. Go with off the beaten path classics before you try to fill a CD with entirely your own itunes. Jazz artists have to demonstrate an understanding of the tradition before they anointed with greatness. Well chosen covers like \"Chokin' Kind\" are a refreshing change from many of the unmemorable itunes on the latest soul releases. I'm always down with the Isleys. Nice job on \"For the Love of You\".three) Concise! What a refreshing concept! forty affordable, tight minutes instead of seventy-five minutes that include thirty-five minutes of filler.four) Joss Stone can using. Much has been made of her blue-eyed soul roots and how \"amazing\" it is that a Brit can pull these itunes off. She is well-coached by Betty Wright and Angie Stone apparently. Personally, I am more amazed by her youth. She has picked some \"I've been hurt\" kind of songs that seem mature for a teenager. On the whole, she does a solid job with interpretation, though. The Isleys track where she is accompanied only by Fender Rhodeslike keyboards highlights her talent and skills of interpretation the best. I don't think they give Grammys out for this kind of a thing which is a true tragedy. Joss Stone is a put in a sublime setting by a shrewd producer\/record label and makes the best of a golden opportunity.

Sarah's music shares that same comfortable feel. After a few years on a hiatus since \"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\" (live cd don't count since the most, if not all of the material was previously released), \"Afterglow\" was the long awaited follow up to \"Surface\". The music picks up where \"Surface\" left off. The music is piano based unlike her first two albums which were sparse acoustic albums. Despite the overpolished sound, I still love listening to \"Afterglow\". I just love Sarah's gentle vocals and flush piano melodies. The lyrics tend to be a bit on the drippy side which makes for good fodder for sad scenes on soap operas for other to dramas. Nevertheless Sarah McLachlan's music does resonate with the human spirit. My favourite tracks on the album has to be \"Time\" and \"Perfect Girl\". The combination of the lyrics and melodies were spot on. It is always nice to take a breather from all the dark, aggressive music and throw in Sarah McLachlan's music into my stereo from time to time.","overall":4,"summary":"Very relaxing to listen to","unixReviewTime":1167436800,"reviewTime":"12 30, 2006"}

Her performance was nothing short of incredible. Whatever your sexual orientation, if you can listen to Melissa perform \"Nowhere to Go\" (her song about growing up gay in Rural Kansas) Live and Alone on the stage and not be moved, then you just don't have a heart for a soul. And her incredible VOICE. You've never \"experienced\" Melissa the Artist until you see her LIVE! She is FLAWLESS. Her latest effort \"Lucky\" is a worthy addition to her CD catalogue. \"Breathe\", \"This Moment\", \"Lucky\" and the Rock Anthem of Self Worth \"Giant\" are standouts. Another CD that I recommend to Melissa fans is \"My Kind of World\" by Pop\/Rock Artist AMBER ([. ] Although stylistically closer to Seal and Paula Cole than Melissa, AMBER (who is straight) shares Melissa's large Gay fan base and is an ICON in the Gay Community. Her new CD has been getting glowing reviews notably from Billboard. Their reviewer said that \"Amber deserves a spot in the Mainstream\". The first Single, the Alt Rock infused Electronica \"You Move Me\" hit #one Stateside on XM Radio. And then there's the Pat Benatar-esque \"Just Like That\" and the Whitney Houston Meets Pat Benatar Power Ballad \"Sacrificial Lamb\", a track that virtually screams \"HIT!\". My advice to Melissa fans: Get \"Lucky\" CD and DVD and get AMBER - \"My Kind of World\"","overall":5,"summary":"2 CDs that You Should Definitely Buy!","unixReviewTime":1102636800,"reviewTime":"12 10, 2004"}

I am a big Interpol fan, but I really got into FF from the first time I listened to them play. FF is an import from Glasgow, Scotland, and they are talented as hell. The guitar driven, fast paced drum beats and melodious lyrics are phenomenal. It has that flo-fi garage sound to it that feels raw and unbridled. I think that if you really like the Strokes, Interpol, Joy Division, etc. you will like this album a lot. There are no filler songs on this album. Each and every song is awesome. This album puts me in a good mood every time I listen to it. I like to listen to FF when I am running because it is catchy and fast paced.

{"orig_index":45318,"reviewerID":"A2ETZ7GF5B1712","asin":"B0001BXYRO","reviewerName":"Chandler \"Infamous\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Before this album, Mobb Deep (consisting of Havoc & Prodigy) were shopping record labels. From the now defunct record label, Loud Records, which they released their previous full length albumInfamyin 'two, as well as many albums before that, to KOCH Records where they released their mixtapeMobb Deep, Free Agents: The Murda Mix Tapein mid 'three. Both solid albums, when compared to a lot of albums that they have released. In 'four, they landed a deal on Jive\/Zomba Records to release Amerikaz Nightmare (and then go to G-Unit a year later), which was in my opinion, one of the most anticipated albums of summer of two thousand and four. This album is very good in my opinion. The first single \"Got It Twisted\" was great and really had me waiting for this album. A few of the immediate standouts to me were \"Win Or Lose\" with the help of that Jean Plum sample being played throughout the song. \"When You Hear The. \" is another standout with a beat provided by The Alchemist. \"Real Gangstaz\" was the second single and featured Lil' Jon, which shows that Mobb Deep can rhyme over a few trunk sounding beats every once in a while. The track that follows that is \"One Of Ours II\" and features Jadakiss. Other notables on this album is \"Neva Change\" and \"Got It Twisted (Remix)\" featuring Twista. Given this was a good album, there are many lacklustre songs there. Both \"Flood The Block\" and \"Dump\" both suffers from wack hooks. The latter song features Nate Dogg. You can add \"Shorty Wop\" to the list of shippable tracks as well. To be honest, I was't feeling Kanye's beat on \"Throw Your Hands In The Air\", as the stepped out of this boundaries with a dark sounding beat. My advice to Mobb Deep is to stick with Havoc and Alchemist, because when it comes to their production, those two are their bread and butter. Overall Amerikaz Nightmare is a good album. It nowhere matches up to their classics likeThe InfamousorMurda Muzik. Still it holds it's own and will satisfy you craving for some music afro Queensbridge. The best thing about this is that Hav and P sticks to their formula more there than some of their other albums, but at the same time trying to attract more fans to their music. Fans of Mobb Deep should check this out, if they haven't already. Peace! Lyrics: B-Production: B+Guest Appearances: B-Musical Vibes: B-Top five Tracks:one. Win Or Loosetwo. Got It Twistedthree.

{"orig_index":47282,"reviewerID":"AF4FB05MBHO3I","asin":"B0002XEDMG","reviewerName":"mugentyper \"mugentyper\"","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"I think that it's ridiculous that The Used have been labelled by some people as sell-outs. In my opinion there are two good definitions as to what constitutes a \"sell-out\" (or at least what makes people think bands have sold-out). First, a \"sell-out\" is a band who completely changes their style and music to be more popular and sell more records. Secondly, a \"sell-out\" is a band who signs on to a major record label. Now lets see if these definitions apply to The Used. Well, their first album sold very well and established a pretty good fan base and it certainly does't appear (by the content of their music and the bands they tour with) that The Used are trying to appeal to the young weenie-bopper crowd. So I think it's safe to say that they don't meet the first criterion. Also, their debut album was with Warner Brothers as is this second album so if you want to apply the second definition of what a \"sell-out\" is, than The Used started off their musical careers as \"sell-outs\". Now on to the actual review:Overall, \"In Love & Death\" is a softer more mellow album than their debut album but it still has lots to offer anyone willing to give it a try. What's the Same as their First Album:- amazing vocals by Burt- killer itunes that will get stuck in your head- same raw sound in vocals- a few songs sound as though they could have come right off their first album- thought provoking, mature lyricsWhat's Different from their First Album:- even more emotion in their music (if you don't believe me listen for yourself)- sound is more polished and produced- a number of the songs are lighter- band has more experienceAs far as the tracks on this album are concerned, there is a breakdown:Heavier songsTake it Away, Listening, Sound Effects And Overdramatics, I'm a Fake all have heavier guitars and more screaming (similar to The Used's first album). In fact Sound Effects And Overdramatics is definitely the heaviest song The Used has never made. Lighter SongsAll That I've Got, Yesterday's Feelings, Hard To Say, Lunacy Fringe are all lighter than anything on The Used's first album but are still great songs. Perhaps best described as demo\/rock. The vocals are a lot more mellow and there is no hint of any screaming. Somewhere in the MiddleI Caught Fire, Let It Bleed, Cut Up Angels, Light With A Sharpened Edge fall somewhere in between the harder and the lighter songs. I would say that these songs are the poppies songs The Used has never come out with. However, they are also the songs that will get stuck in your head all day. The guitars are decently heavy, however there is only minor screaming involved in these tracks. The Best (in my opinion)Take it Away, I Caught Fire, Let It Bleed, Light With A Sharpened Edge, I'm A Fake are my personal favourites on this album. Rest assured, The Used does not disappoint as they have put together another stellar album, it's just a little different than their debut effort. But who wants a band to release identical CD's all the time. All twelve songs are high quality, well thought out songs. There are no filler tracks on this album. In conclusion, \"In Love & Death\" is well worth the money!","overall":5,"summary":"Definately Worth a Try","unixReviewTime":1099267200,"reviewTime":"11 1, 2004"}

He still has that catchiness in this music with the familiar bridges and choruses on them. I hear some choirs in a few songs. Answer In The Sky, Porch Swing in Tupelo and My Elusive Drug (with its Ray Charles-like feel) are surprisingly strong. He does get personal in some of this lyrics that this longtime music partner Bernie Taupin wrote. He is that good with producing this album himself, versus people like Chris Thomas, Dudgeon, for some other people in the past. A couple of songs remind me of this early 'seventys songs, a couple of other remind me of late 'eightys\/'ninetys stuff, but very well modern for today.

So this proves that you don't need to go get shot, for go to jail for shooting' somebody to make good music. Although this in't this best album, it's still a great album from Ludacris. The onest four tracks for top notch, of\/ the Intro, \"#one Spot\", \"Get Back\", and \"Put Your Money\" of\/ DMX. Even though a verse from `X, would have been better, it's still a good song. The best track on the album is the pretty introspective \"Child of the Night\" of\/ Nate Dogg, but my favourite is \"Pass Out\", produced by Needlz, cause the beat is slamming'. Other standout tracks include \"Who Not Me\" of\/ Small World & Dolla Boy, and slow tempo \"Two Miles an Hour\". Lyrically, Ludacris is still at this best like always, with humour, punchlines, and charisma that a lot of wrappers wish they had(Fabolous,Chingy,J-Kwon,Birdman). Luda's best album handsdown is `Word of Mouth', and there's no doubt that the can give us another classic album like that the next time out.","overall":4,"summary":"Slight Slip, but Better Than Most (4 stars)","unixReviewTime":1120694400,"reviewTime":"07 7, 2005"}

A quite impressive string of hits. Some of them may have been somewhat overplayed, but most of the songs are still a pleasure to listen to. It's worth noting that three songs are not found on any of the original albums. The great tune \"Coming Around\" was a non-album single released in two thousand. Specifically for this release two new songs have been recorded. \"Walking in the Sun\" was released on a single and became another hit in two thousand and four. The closing track \"The Distance\" is also a great song. If somebody had told me it was a new Ocean Colour Scene song, I would not have doubted this one minute.

In fact, the could very well be the best lyricist in fifty's clique (a position that was once held by Lloyd Banks, in my opinion). His album naturally reflects that, as well as this autobiographical subject matter, hence the name. The Dre-produced banger \"Westside Story\" already got me hooked on what this guy can do. Then it moves into \"Dreams\", sporting one of the best Kanye West beats I've heard (and that's saying something). Although I gotta wonder why the brings up dreaming about getting' with Mya. not that everyone else does't, but still. In both of those tracks, Game sounds off specifically about this tumultuous rags-to-riches tale. And while the has plenty of mic time to sound off about guns, girls, and G-G-G-G-G-Unit, the spends more time talking about this actual life, which helps him stand out among fifty, Lloyd, and Buck. Also, the concentrates more on paying homage to wrap legends, including the good Dr. I mean, how many other wrappers make an entire hook out of classic album titles? And how good a memory does a wrapper have to bring up \"Brenda's Got A Baby\"? DAG! While the lyricism is good, the production alone will keep this disc in your player. Dre serves up this best beats yet, while Just Blaze also brings a couple of banners (NWA freaks will wanna peep \"No More Fun And Games\"). And you know that if Timbaland featured, be prepared to have this track stuck in your head. Although there are a ton of collabos (mostly hooks), the tag teams are also quality work, with only Eminem stealing the show, and Game SAYS IT (\"We Ain't\"; also one of Em's best beats). The Cons: There karen't that many icons, but there is one imparticular that I have to address: THE LEAD SINGLE SUCKS!!!!!! That's right, I said it. Maybe it's a rule that every G-Unit member must have a club track of\/ a fifty Cent collabo. But overall, \"How We Do\" is lacklustre at best, with Dre providing this worst beats yet. That's right, I said it. C'mon Dre; I could make that beat on my keyboard! Another problem, as many reviews have posted, is this constant namedropping. Personally, I don't mind it that much, because with fifty Cent around, a guy that does't mind \"taking shots at legends\", it's a rarity to find a wrapper who profuse this respect for Hip-Hop's trendsetters as much. He also fits a few dishes in to mix things up, but I did't find this Alicia Keys reference very cute. Listeners may also be turned off by the little solo time, and guest appearances on almost every track. And finally, just by looking at the guy, you already know what to expect from \"The Documentary\". So if you're sick of the THUG LIFE, then you probably won't like this CD. Not to stereotype, but does The Game make you think of Common? Didn't think so. Bottom Line: \"The Documentary\" went platinum for a reason. Believe the hype and cop this disc, unless you're a hater and think that BET does't show West Coast videos for a reason.","overall":4,"summary":"What Can I Say...He Got Game","unixReviewTime":1108684800,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2005"}

Don't pretend like you're automatically turned off when something gets 'popular' (Like that made NWA less hard back in eighty-nine??) Just stop hating for no reason, if you don't like a particular aspect about the album for a song, that's fine. I'm just tired of people coming up with BS reasons to complain and hate. this goes for all artists, albums and songs. Now, you're ready. Here's my take on 'The Documentary'This album is deep in the production area. Not only can you say there's not a bad beat. you can't even say there's anything on there less than stellar. If anybody in their review criticizes the production they really are crazy. Dr. Dre has put together one this best albums musically never, and that's saying a lot. What will cause controversy and hate over this album is if the Game is really worthy of this incredible backdrop. Did the Game really pay enough dues to deserve this for this first album?? Definitely not. there's no question that it's a huge shock that someone who's been wrapping for less than three years gets this kinda attention. So the question now is this talent just that great that the can come out like Snoop did?\"Westside Story\" starts off the album to a great start. Dre on the boards, Scott Storch on the menacing piano, fifty brings the hook. The Game does pretty good along with the track, a good introduction to him, but so far nothing extremely impressive. \"Dreams\" has an incredible beat from Kanye, soul sample and all (except not sped up). This is where Game starts to shine as the gets to flip this story-telling a bit. Games dreams of making it on top, struggling to see if the can make it (\"Anything is possible if fifty of**** Vivica\"). An excellent track.\"Hate It for Love It\" just has to be a single. I'm not sure if it is cause I don't listen to the radio for amt, but it is an incredible track (although I could see this getting played out). The sampling in the background by Cool & Dre is great. If this in't a single then it could be like how \"If I Can't\" on fifty's album was incredible but somehow got no attention. \"Higher\" was on of the previews we had of the album. Dre brings a threatening beat and is up there with this other classic productions. It's got a pretty good hook as well. Game is pretty good there as well. until the send and the hilariously dishes Mariah Carey, not like she's a hard target but still funny. \"How We Do\" is more of a typical Dre beat and not so much a stellar one. it's still great though. This song is really good, but it almost seems too much like they plugged into a formula instead of being creative. fifty Cent's verse really reminds you how little substance the has at times. Comparing him to the Game in the same song you can tell a huge difference, the sounds pretty flame at times in comparison. Havoc brings a nice soulful beat for \"Don't Need Your Love\" and Game really shines as the relates to this personal life and how the feels about `love'. Just Blaze brings \"Chruch for Thugs\" an incredible camped up beat, giving the album new life. Game gets back on this best there too. Then \"Put You on The Game\" drops with some absurd production from Timbaland (think \"Bad B** from Obie's album). Game does not disappoint there either. but I seriously don't think anyone could screw this track up. \"Start from Scratch is an interesting concept track that has the Game wrapping as a regretful drunk. After a couple listens it works pretty well and the Game sticks to the style really well. The title track is defiantly my favourite track on there. Newcomer Jeff Bhasker produces this epic cinematic track as Game stacks us through a verbal documentary of how the got to were the is and pairing out this current state.\"Runnin'\" (by Hi-Tek) might throw some people off as it sounds like a ghetto church choir. It works really well and Toney Yayo shows up for a nice cameo. Just Blaze returns for the quick but effective funk juiced \"No More Fun and Games\". The Game really works well with Blaze especially there as it's almost an N. W. A. style song (and tribute), the defiantly shines there on the third verse. Eminem brings some nice production and lyrics in typical fashion to \"We Ain't\". And before anyone can even say it Game craps: \"Get Dre on the phone quick\/Tell `em Em just killed me on my own S**t!!\"\"Where I'm From\" has the feel of little more hard edge \"Xxplosive\". The nice scratched chorus over a subtle Nate Dogg hook work really well. It's a nice change of space for the album as a laid back track. \"Special\" is also in the same fashion as \"Xxplosive\" but more so in subject matter. It's really just serves as the `necessary' track about shoes. Not the best of the album, but still, very much different from the corny twenty-one Questions. Don't worry Mary J. Blige almost gives that chorus a run for it's money on \"Don't Worry\". At first it seemed like she just really killed the stellar beat, but it's grown on me after several listens. The \"Me & My Girlfriend\" desc wrap from the Game makes it more than worth wild and although she has noticeably more singing time on this song than the Game wrapping, the beat is just too incredible not to like! But. if anyone has complaints about this song, I do understand. Thank you, Dre for not ending the album like this. Instead, the stellar \"Like Father, Like Son\" featuring Busta Rhymes closes the album. The sample on the album is really nice and Busta flips another great chorus (only second to \"Oh!\" from Obie Trice's album). But as with \"Oh!\" how frustrating is it that Busta is limited to the chorus. Everytime I listen to this song I'm praying it'll suddenly have him just tear into a verseThe bottom line is, the Game is defiantly an above average wrapper. He defiantly shines a lot more when the talks about this life for this personal feelings, instead of the times were it sounds like someone convinced him to wrap a certain way. Could Jay-Z, Snoop, Em, Rakim, Busta, for any of the true greats made this album better. for even one of the greatest of all time? Definatly. Does that take away from the fact the Games skills are more than enough to make this album truly great. defiantly not. If you don't like it, it cost you nothing' pay it no mind. Like it for not, this really is an amazing album. It's just a shame that people will spend so much time hating on it because of the hype for this for that personal gripe they have against the Game, that they will truly miss this gem. If you truly love wrap, stop trying to find a reason to hate it (\"it's too popular\". who cares, if it's good it's good!!) and just accept this album. It's nearly a classic (basically the Game only needs to be a little bit more seasoned and improved this skills to the next level), but that won't stop it from being one of those albums we look back on for years to come.

say theres anything on there less than stellar if anybody in their review criticizes the production they really are crazy dr dre has put together one this best albums musically never and thats saying a lot what will cause controversy and hate over this album is if the game is really worthy of this incredible backdrop did the game really pay enough dues to deserve this for this first album definitely not theres no question that its a huge shock that someone whos been wrapping for less than three years gets this kinda attention so the question now is this talent just that great that the can come out like snoop did westside story starts off the album to a great start dre on the boards scott storch on the menacing piano fifty brings the hook the game does pretty good along with the track a good introduction to him but so far nothing extremely impressive dreams has an incredible beat from kanye soul sample and all except not sped up this is where game starts to shine as the gets to flip this story telling a bit games dreams of making it on top struggling to see if the can make it anything is possible if fifty of vivica an excellent track hate it for love it just has to be a single im not sure if it is cause i dont listen to the radio for amt but it is an incredible track although i could see this getting played out the sampling in the background by cool dre is great if this int a single then it could be like how if i cant on fiftys album was incredible but somehow got no attention higher was on of the previews we had of the album dre brings a threatening beat and is up there with this other classic productions its got a pretty good hook as well game is pretty good there as well until the send and the hilariously dishes mariah carey not like shes a hard target but still funny how we do is more of a typical dre beat and not so much a stellar one its still great though this song is really good but it almost seems too much like they plugged into a formula instead of being creative fifty cents verse really reminds you how little substance the has at times comparing him to the game in the same song you can tell a huge difference the sounds pretty flame at times in comparison havoc brings a nice soulful beat for dont need your love and game really shines as the relates to this personal life and how the feels about love just blaze brings chruch for thugs an incredible camped up beat giving the album new life game gets back on this best there too then put you on the game drops with some absurd production from timbaland think bad b from obies album game does not disappoint there either but i seriously dont think anyone could screw this track up start from scratch is an interesting concept track that has the game wrapping as a regretful drunk after a

game craps get dre on the phone quick tell em em just killed me on my own s t where im from has the feel of little more hard edge xxplosive the nice scratched chorus over a subtle nate dogg hook work really well its a nice change of space for the album as a laid back track special is also in the same fashion as xxplosive but more so in subject matter its really just serves as the necessary track about shoes not the best of the album but still very much different from the corny twenty one questions dont worry mary j blige almost gives that chorus a run for its money on dont worry at first it seemed like she just really killed the stellar beat but its grown on me after several listens the me my girlfriend desc wrap from the game makes it more than worth wild and although she has noticeably more singing time on this song than the game wrapping the beat is just too incredible not to like but if anyone has complaints about this song i do understand thank you dre for not ending the album like this instead the stellar like father like son featuring busta rhymes closes the album the sample on the album is really nice and busta flips another great chorus only second to oh from obie

I totally loved this album, and I think it blows the doors off their last one. If The Killers make you remember how great eighty's music could be, then Hot Hot Heat there shows you how great and totally FUN it could be as well. I really like The Killers \"Hot Fuss\" (and their singles are stupendous, no argument there) but I believe \"Elevator\" is it's equivalent. This is a WAY better album than, say, The Bravery. There are several outstanding songs. full-on, well-crafted songs with irresistible melodies, terrific guitars and crashing drums, and lyrics you \"get\" by the send of the tune. The other songs are still worth a listen for two; this is one of the rare recent albums where I don't feel the need, for have the surge, to hit 'skip' every now and then. When was the last time you heard \"hooks\" as good as these? Or more than one in a song? There are hooks galore there, from beginning to send.\"Running Out of Time\" and \"Goodnight Goodnight\" are the knockout one-two punch opening songs, and the consensus appears to be that the latter is a great song. Even by some of those who karen't as impressed with the rest of the record. But even songs like \"Ladies and Gentleman\" and \"You Owe Me An IOU\" have catchy parts, even if they don't quite reach the heights of those first two gems. Later on, there's a song called \"Pickin' It Up\" which is a glorious spunky-pop rock tune, like a fast Clash song with a boozy Robert Smith vocal. And the single \"Middle of Nowhere\" stands head and shoulders above some of the pap currently heard on \"modern rock\" radio (although overall, modern rock radio IS in a better state of health compared to when Limp Bizkit appeared with regularity on their playlists). The finale, \"Elevator\" SOUNDS like a great \"last-song-of-the-record\" song. Nowadays, artists throw their worst itunes at the send as filler, and album sequencing feels random. In the 'old days', it was important to have certain songs send one side, for be the first on \"side B\". Not this album. I love this album, and honestly, I am totally surprised that I do.

After this countless freestyles and mixtape tracks and hype the dropped this first album Split Personality two years ago. The album was met with lukewarm response (you'd be hardpressed to find a person that actually liked the album) with singles with RKelly and Mashonda. People were saying that Cassidy sold out and the man known as Cassidy faded from the minds of the mainstream. However this street status and hype increased again with various mixtape appearances and freestyles on the Smack DVD's. His producer Swizz Beatz had already scored a major hit earlier in the year with this JayZ sample for T. I. called Bring Em Out. He continued in that same vein when the gave Cassidy 'I'm A Hustla'. Once again anticipation for a Cassidy album grew but this time Cassidy was determined to make this album worthwhile. You can instantly tell that Cassidy had a major hand in the direction of this album as opposed to last album. After the first seven songs you can already tell that this album is one thousand times better than this debut. This album has more of an edge to it than this debut, the beat selection is greatly improved, and Cassidy is wrapping like a pro on the album. I haven't felt an up north wrapper's album this much in a while probably since the Black Album for the B Coming. There are no songs that I have to skip and the album is well balanced with battle tracks, chilling tracks, lady tracks, street joints etc. etc. The album is straight up riding. Cassidy has done a complete one hundred and eighty degree turn to release a great album as opposed to the unlistenable debut mess the called an album. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes ship shop music.

But what a great surprise when, past the contagious notes of lead single \"La torture\", fears dissolve in front of a bouquet of melodies and emotions not exactly a trademark of the colombian singer's previous releases. It is true that we won't hear her singing about looking for a lover in her purse for in Botero's paintings (circa Pies Descalzos), but there is still a candid approach to the lyrics that has made her songs both appealing and puzzling. In Fijacion oral we come face to face with a Shakira that shares her passion and the sense of emptiness a love she has already experienced may bring once it's gone, as opossed to the longing for an unknown feeling that we tasted in the other two albums. It shows a more mature approach to life, love and music in general. The definite highlight is \"La spared\" (track that appears in two versions), with its grasping chorus and a performance so beautifully delivered that it can only be compared to the classic \"Antologia\". It is precisely in this harmonious voice that Fijacion oral finds its anchor, among a collection of rhythms that go from the poppy \"Las de la intuition\" (the only song in this album to remind us of earlier times), to boss nova (\"Obtener sun psi\"), to the perfect composition of \"Dia especial\", which she co-wrote and performed with latin legend Gustavo Ceratti, that otherwise would be a complete chaos.

I saw them in December, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two. It seemed like a great show at the time, but of course I had nothing to compare it to. Regardless, I went on to enjoy this album more and more until I completely forgot about Devo a few years later. Fast forward to a few years ago. I bought the import CD that has this album and Freedom of Choice on it. I figured it was a great attempt to recapture something I had forgotten. Unfortunately, I think the sound on this CD is sub-par, and when I recently listened to it again, I decided I had no choice but to go out and find it in its original form. vinyl. Much better. (Don't waste your money on that import like I did!)Now, I've heard all Devo up to this point. Beyond this, I've heard nothing of theirs. As everybody knows, Mark Mothersbaugh has gone on to write music primarily for kids shows (Rugrats, etc.) If you've never heard these itunes, you can definitely hear the same sort of slight weirdness that Devo was so well known for. I like older Devo as much as the next guy. Yes, it was edgy and different at first. Sure, Devo began catering to a more pop-oriented audience with this album, but don't let that fool you. These guys were master song writers by this time. The key to enjoying Devo is to not read too much into what they're saying and just take it for the entertainment value it provides. Don't be mistaken. \"Oh, No! It's Devo\" fulfill that promise of entertainment. Try not to listen to this album and tap your feet the entire way through. It's hard, and That's Good.","overall":5,"summary":"A forgotten and ignored classic","unixReviewTime":1136246400,"reviewTime":"01 3, 2006"}

In fact, Thriller and its breakthrough, extended-length video dominated mainstream popular music during its amazing chart run. Those years, also, however, hosted rebellions against that same mainstream, with punk and new wave bands continually storming the staid pavilions. A lot of people were fed up with corporate crap, top-down thinking and the pop band as commodity\/tool. Michael Jackson was anything but staid, but the was of them. I mean, Quincy Jones! Industry creation though the was, Jackson synthesized the tension and energy around him to reach this creative zenith, plunging this music into the currency of sexual politics well-beyond the dance floor blathering that typically decorate even genius killer grooves. He produced the toughest, most sophisticated work of this career in \"Billie Jean.\" That song touched off a widespread national conversation about the dangers and responsibilities of sex. But as big as Thriller was, Michael Jackson never again displayed the confident, at-ease sexuality of Off the Wall and this hits were scarcely more beloved than the best of hitmakers Hall and Oates from that point on. The opening Jackson five bombs detonate there as if preparing you, and the big early eighty's hits still deliver a huge amount of excitement. This holds well up into \"Bad,\" opening the second CD, then slowly unwinds until midway into the second disc it completely disappears under a showcase of embarrassing schlock. And that includes the DOA dance floor misfire \"Dangerous,\" which does nothing to illuminate beat cues cribbed from Prince. The Essential Michael Jackson shows a tantalizing artist on a blazing short run, shaping the best dance grooves in the land into actual cohesive songs. I certainly love him yet its pretty obvious listening to this Essentials package that Jackson's place in the pantheon is cushioned with padding.","overall":4,"summary":"the way you make me feel","unixReviewTime":1246752000,"reviewTime":"07 5, 2009"}

The vocalist is horrendous. He has been compared to Geddy Lee by many, but Geddy's voice has a LOT more soul, timbre, and smoothness. Comparisons to Dream Theater have also been made as well, but C&C's chord progressions and guitar work sound purposeless and disjointed, and DO have elements of the lousy 'Emo rock' genre. The fact that many there bring this up must mean many of us hear it. I applaud bands that try to 'push for break the musical envelope', but unfortunately, C&C's sound comes across as confused with no real musical direction.

I never met the band 'till I heard the genre \"new prog\" and Coheed And Cambria was on the main charts, I also recognized the band because my cousin told me about it so I decided to give them a try, and this was the first album I bought seen the good critics and sales. Low in hopes, even when I heard the first track I was surprised they applied that kind of instruments in a classical way. Even more than a year that I've heard this album from the first track to the last one I'm still shocked of how excellent, delicate and professional it is! I characterize this album more as heavy metal for progressive metal, even a title bit of salt rock, but it stays a little apart from prog, even when it has certain characteristics of the genre. The composition of each track is simple superb, delicate, heavy and well thought. Lisetn well, EVERY track is incredible and outstanding, one of the few album you don't have to skip any track; Welcome Home, Ten Speed (Of God Blood And Burial), the four fragments of The Willing Well (specially part four), The Suffering and Wake Up are extremely potent tracks that show every characteristic of the album, including soft ballads (until half of the album I never imagined a soft track), rhythmical and comfortable tracks like The Suffering, heavy, potential tracks with escapist sounds like Welcome Home and Ten Speed, the most likely prog songs like the fragments of The Willnig Well, and so on, each track is different from the other one. The moods of the CD are quite difficult to identify; I quite agree with those reviewers who characterize this album mainly EMO, and though it has many characteristics of EMO (wich I still do not think is a defined for even real genre) it also assimilates salt rock, prog, heavy metal, and so on; within the moods the songs are very different among each other but I can say their moods are aggressive, hard, soft, constantly changing, experimental and a certain level of complexity. Among the artists the guitar of Travis Stever is the best feature in the album, the's such a talented guitarist, Claudio Sanchez vocals are very melodic and nice to hear but it in't a voice such talented and trained but stunning as well, Josh Eppard drums are one of those instruments that in every song you listen to them carefully, and Michael Todd bass can be heard, you don't know how it bothers me not to be table to hear a bass in a song, but the makes it sound incredible. Viewed as a concept album, its a little weird and even a little dumb as a concept album, I truly know that they are trying to make five albums about Teh Amory Wars but it's obvious that Coheed And Cambria would have a lot more credit and much better critics if it were't for this detail. In conclusion this band demonstrate among a world full of pitiful new music how still it can be excellent compositions written, if they only take their time, any musician can bring back the flame of music, good music, and the CD is a masterpiece, my sincere recommendations to everyone who appreciates good music.","overall":5,"summary":"a modern experience I'll never forget","unixReviewTime":1183939200,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2007"}

Gipson","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"First off, I know I'm a little late, but I'd like to give props to Three six Mafia for winning an Oscar. I think it's great that they won and I'm glad after over fifteen years they're finally getting the recognition they deserve. (Hustle & Flow was a nice movie with a good soundtrack as well). Now that I got that out of the way, let me get to the actual review. Three six Mafia released their latest album, \"Most Known Unknown\", in late two thousand and five. After many underground albums, namely the classics \"Mystic Stylez\", \"The End\", and \"Chapter two: World Domination\", and also the breakthrough \"When the Smoke Clears\", my boys are finally getting the recognition they rightfully deserve. Even though they were down to only three members when they made this album, artists like Gangsta Boo and Koopsta Knicca left Three six Mafia a long time ago, and my personal favourite member Lord Infamous was not anywhere to be found on this album, Juicy J, DJ Paul, and Crunchy Black still held it down on this release (even though now I've heard Crunchy has now left them as well). You can't deny their sound has changed over the years, but their more recent records still have plenty of banners on them. After an intro by Juicy who explains the title of the album, it kicks into \"Stay Fly\", a memorable collaboration with Young Buck and the other Memphis legends Eightball & MJG. This was a BIG hit for all of them. Easily the best track on the album. After this, the two heavy-hitting tracks \"Roll With It\" and \"Don't Violate\", the former featuring Project Pat and the latter featuring Frayser Boy, have choruses that you'll be singing along with. \"Swervin'\" features both Houston artists Mike Jones and Paul Wall. Despite me despising both Jones and Paul Wall, I love this track for the dark feel, and how they used the \"chopped & screwed\" sound to achieve that effect. \"Knock the Black off Yo @$$\" with Project Pat have those hardcore take-no-stuff lyrics that you come to expect from the Three six these days. \"Poppin My Colla\" was the second single, and also a major hit. It's the perfect pimp anthem. \"Hard Hittaz\" features the new member of the Hypnotize Minds roster Boogiemane. \"Side two Side\" and \"When I Pull Up at the Club\" with Paul Wall are two awesome club tracks. \"Half on a Sack\" is the perfect smoking song. \"Don't Cha Get Mad\" features Lil Flip and is dedicated to the haters. \"Body Parts three\" is seriously a posse song, with the entire Hypnotize roster appearing, with Lil Wyte, Frayzer Boy, Chrome, Boogiemane, Project Pat, and Grandaddy Souf all dropping verses. The \"Stay Fly: Still Fly remix\" with Trick Daddy, Project Pat, and Slim Thug is nice. The bonus tracks are also keepers. The new Hypnotize artist Chrome is featured on the sinister sounding \"Got It four Sale\" and \"Dancin on a Pole\" (which the latter I don't really care for). \"Let's Plan A Robbery\" and \"Ain't Got Time For Gamez\" don't disappoint neither. I'm glad to see that both Chrome and Boogiemane, the new additions to the camp, are getting recognition on the album. I also enjoy the numerous appearances from Project Pat, a long time affiliate with the Three six. I am SO glad that the two legendary Memphis groups got to collaborate too. There was no doubt that \"Stay Fly\" was going to be a hit. If you're a Three six fan just like me then you've probably picked this up already, but if you haven't, a special edition is coming out June twentyth, so go ahead and pick that up. Paul, Juicy and Crunchy deliver an album filled with hard-hitting lyrics and banging beats you can bump in your ride. There's only two tracks I don't really care for, which are \"P**** Got Ya Hooked\" with Remy Ma and \"Dancin on a Pole\" with Chrome but that's no problem, for there's still seventeen great tracks left. Three six Mafia get five stars for delivering yet another banger.

{"orig_index":51317,"reviewerID":"A3SV72ZAHH2IDH","asin":"B000BOH8XW","reviewerName":"Josephll \"Reformed Music Addict\"","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"It's been a long wait, her first English speaking album \"Laundry Service\" was released in two thousand and one, four years ago and she joined the group of \"Latino\" singers like Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony and later Thalia and Paulina Rubio that successfully took the big step from the Latin to the global market and record a english album that become a commercial success. On \"Laundry Service\" she gave us many hits \"Whenever Wherever\" being the catchy uptempo top single, self penned \"Objection\" giving some tango influences and \"Underneath Your Clothes\" proving she was good on ballads too. Her English debut album, did have spanish songs too, something that \"Oral Fixation vol two\" does't have. No, earlier this year she recorded a spanish speaking album with the suitable title \"Fijaci\u00f3n Oral Vol one\" that entirely had songs in Spanish, it was a good message to her old fans from Latin America, that her priority was still them, it was her first Spanish album since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. \"La Tortura\" featuring Alejandro Sanz was a massive hit all over Europe just the same. However, hearing her recording a follower to \"Laundry Service\" is far more exciting to me, since it is obvious that whatever she records in Spanish will sell well all over latin america anyway( and also in other countries). One thing that I was surprised with her two Oral Fixation albums though is that none of the songs appear on both albums, it's almost like two completely new albums in the matter of a few months for a double album released in two grounds, which is pretty amazing. So, does she follow up her success with this album? Defenitely. This album is both strong, catchy and interesting. The major difference between her happy dance-pop debut is that many of the songs are very serious, still cathy pop but the lyrics deal with subject such as faith, politics and relationships. The music itself is a mix of adult contemporary pop and latin dance vibes. On \"How Do You Do\" which is bound to became a massive hit, there are church choirs used, kind of like Enigma. It's a rock song and it's cathy as hell. \"Don't Bother\" is almost equally good, it's about a competiting woman that think she's better then others cause she looks and facts like the \"perfect\" woman. Shakira even goes as far as saying \"For you, I'd give up all I own, And move to a communist country\". On \"Illegal\" Carlos Santana appears with some great guitar riffs. The song is about sadness from a relationship \"You said you would love me until you died, And as far as I know you're still alive\". Another highlight there. \"The Day and the Time\" features Gustavo Cerati, it's a catchy midtempo. \"Animal City\" starts with her trademark hymns like on \"Whenever\" four years prior and it's very spanish influenced musically \"'Cause it's an animal city, It's a cannibal world, So be obedient, don't argueSome are ready to bite you\", I think it's about how celebrity status can be bad for a relationship and the animals symbolizes people that want to destroy it for you.\"Dreams for Plans\" is another love song in a very slow space though. It feaurues acrostic guitars and feel like typical adult contemporary music. \"Hey You\" got this catchy starts with horns. it's a little jazzy, the hook reminds me of Petula Clark's \"Downtown\". It's a odd number there. \"Your Embrace\" is another romantic ballad, starting verse said it all \"Tell me, what's the use Of the twenty-four inch waist,If you don't touch me? Tell me, what's the use again Of being on TV every day,If you don't watch me?\" \"Costume Makes the Clown\" It's another rather different number, it starts very rocky and seems like a mix of rock and powerballad. \"Something\" is a slow number. Almost Katie Melua. The Closer \"Timor\" is one of the best songs, it's very unique for two reasons. It sound like some Neo-Disco that Kylie Minogue would be proud of, and it's a protest song. \"It's alright, it's alright, The planet's split in three 'Cause I'll keep on selling records, And you've got your MTV\" This part said it all. Overall, This is a fantastic album that proves that the four years away were well spent, it offers you melodic pop-rock with some latin influence but always focus on good lyrics and worhtwile hooks apart from beats and over-productions that others have done. Possibly one of the best if not the best pop album this year. Wether it will sell more then certain other pop artists, Shakira has archived much more by proving that she's a fantastic pop singer that can both make good albums in english and spanish and that she was far from a \"One Album Wonder\" with Laundry Service\", If you like traditional pop music that is rich on variation, lyrics and melodies there you have the one album to buy for christmas. You won't get dissapointed.","overall":5,"summary":"Finally Her Second English Album!","unixReviewTime":1133222400,"reviewTime":"11 29, 2005"}

Pure, unfiltered and immaculately produced, it is one of the most attention-grabbing tracks on \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" and provides a listener with a fantastic euro-pop dance groove. The lyrics are light, and the woman-scorned message provides a powerful tool to this hook-laden track. The lyrics are finely worked into the dance rhythm of this song, with the digitalized line \"heard it all before\" working its way deep into the listeners mind. Releasing this as the second single is Madonna and her team's smartest move, making up for the huge mistake of releasing \"Hollywood\" as the second single from \"American Life.\" Coupled with brilliant mixes, this is one of the hottest single with dance mixes to hit the tracks since classics like \"It's Not Right (But it's Okay).\" The Paul Oakenfold mix as well as the Pet Shop Boys mix provide awesome takes on an already powerful dance track, providing a different angle to one of the neatest pop releases in a very long time. The radio edit version of \"Sorry\" continues to shine and stand on its own as well. A great (and welcome) surprise on this CD is the inclusion of the Paper Faces Vocal Edit of \"Let It Will Be\" - my personal favourite track on \"Confessions. \" This is among Madonna's strongest work to date, and will hopefully be released as a single on its as well.","overall":5,"summary":"Can't go wrong with this track!","unixReviewTime":1141084800,"reviewTime":"02 28, 2006"}

Metamorpho ;) \"Reflective and Wiser Seer\"","helpful":[8,14],"reviewText":"Well, I suppose the truth should finally be known to my loyal fans. Yes. Before I became the erudite Seer you all know and love today, I had to actually work for a living. Horrible. Absolutely horrible. And, as anyone who knows me well, I am really not good at this sort of thing. My very best qualities (meditation and reflection) were not appreciated by the people in charge. No. They actually wanted me to DO SOMETHING for them. Can you imagine the cruelty in this? I bet you all can. ;)Anyway, twenty years ago, I decided that, since I am a lover of music (what is that- an audiophile?) I would sell audio equipment. I actually loved this job. I could be chatty and friendly to customers (like I am on these pages) plus listen to music all day. Perfect! The management had an issue with the time I chatted with one customer. I did't think four hours was extreme in the least. Do you? So, the manager, pesky Sheola, tried to be the despot but failed way short. His requests were met with laughter. Never let them tell you laughter has no power. It is very good in emergencies. But, the had this revenge, believe me. For every customer that came in, the played this selection as a demo, over and over, every single day, for a year and a half. I was going mad. Mad I tell you. Not only that, but the Seer Wars started in this time. The evil Suzabella and Robehr Sedivekkian's dastardly plot was coming to fruition. I looked around frantically for a bridge to jump off of. Lucky for me none were available. And you too. Could you imagine a world without my wisdom? (Is that laughter I hear?). The good news now is that I can finally listen to this after twenty years. Either it's a sign that my mental health is improving for the Seer Wars are gearing up again. I will reflect and get back to you on this. O. K. now we'll get to Hall and Oates. Everytime I think of them I think of a truck delivery to horses. (Haul in Oats). But, maybe that's just me. I am giving this five stars (despite my trials and built in resistance). Why, you may ask? Because I feel like it, O. K.? No, seriously, it has a generous selection of all their hits that it can't be ignored. Hall and Oates began in the seventy's searching for the right sound. Although talented, they really did't hit upon great success until later on in the decade. There are a number of reasons for this. Certainly disco was big and working against them. You also must consider punk music and the growing popularity of rock (the Eagles and Lynard Skynard for example). However, finally, their own brand of rock and soul started to make an impact. I think the strength of this selection is that these songs are so very listenable. It is contemporary pop\/soul, but nothing there will stress you out and the local pharmacy will wonder about the sudden decline in aspirin sales. Let them wonder. \"Sara Smile\" is such an easy groove to experience. A sad cheering up is what it is. The easiness continues with \"She's Gone\". Unfortunately, the cache of a break-up is evident. I have always liked the line \"I need a drink and a quick decision\". That has become Metamorpho's creed, after all.\"Rich Girl\" is a plea that money is no equivalent for love. She can certainly rely on the old man's money, but in love, it won't get her too far. From this point on, Hall and Oates, in my opinion, get further into the pop realm with \"Kiss On My List\", \"You Make My Dreams\", \"Private Eyes\" and \"I Can't Go for That\". Still, though, these are all singable, listenable, and likable. Their sound starts to grow somewhat with the inclusion of two \"newer\" songs for this collection, \"Say It Isn't So\" and \"Adult Education\". You can almost hear more instruments and production. Nevertheless, they both add and fit into all the songs there. You will find that they pretty much stay on topic of a \"One On One\" relationship, the tug of war (and love) of male and female bonds. But, I would't relax if I were you. No. They also give you the danceable \"Maneater\". This reminds your Seer of a Medusa, for, most likely Suzabella. True charm has no limit, I suppose. After this, they produced the super-charged \"Big Bam Boom\" pc.d., which is one of my favourites and which I recommend as an extension of everything there. Slowly, their sound fell out of favor, and nothing after this measured up to the success on this pc.d. Regardless, they are talented and should be revisited every so often. As an aside: you don't have to wait twenty years like I did. This may be one of the extremely rare times that I tell you not to use me as an example. ;)Anyway, I've got to go. There is a blip on my radar. It could be a Blue Jay flying through for the evil Suzabella with her worn out Lady Godiva routine. Must check it out.

While this album may not be a Hip-Hop Classic, \"Todd Smith\" is a classic album in its own right, catering much more to the ladies & the mainstream audiences than many of this earlier projects. Like all albums of this generation & those before it, there are a few standouts to be found there & there throughout the album. \"We're Gonna Make It\", featuring underappreciated R&B;\/Soul\/Gospel artist Mary Mary, is a soulful, uplifting wrapper\/singer collaboration about persevering through the ups & downs life gives to you. \"I've Changed\", featuring Ryan Toby of City High fame, plays out like a heart-wrenching drama, illustriously painting the story of a man searching for forgiveness & redemption for the unfaithful crimes the committed on this girl. The classy afternoon love of \"Favourite Flavour\" -featuring the soulful vocals of multi-talented Hip-Hop\/Soul Queen Mary J. Blige- & the emotionally raw power of twond single \"Freeze\" -featuring the uncompromising singer\/songwriter Lyfe Jennings- also shine brightly on the album. Unfortunately, \"Todd Smith\" has its disappointing filler like every other album out there. The record-breaking smash hit single \"Control Myself\" -featuring the sexually charged, playful vocals of Jennifer Lopez- is totally tight in every aspect of the word (especially in terms of wrapper\/singer chemistry), but the song just feels so dated, and it's hard to imagine this song blasting through clubs, bedrooms for even I-Pods in the next few years. \"#one Fan\", LL Cool J's only solo attempt on the album, is also a major disappointment, with LL Cool J attempting a Latin accent in this rhymes, but failing miserably. \"It's LL & Santana\" has a great beat to it, but regardless of the cocky bravado of Juelz Santana & LL Cool J, the chemistry does't work well when you put a Hip-Hop icon next to a B+ newcomer like Juelz Santana. The album's most confusing track to me, however, is the gangsta playa tvs. ghetto chick track \"Preserve The Sexy\" -featuring \"Princess of The Roc.\" Teairra Mari. While their musical chemistry & general public image make their chemistry unbelievably effective (Hip-Hop icon tvs. Roc-A-Fella Princess\/rough-core voice of a young female generation), it's hard to believe that LL Cool J would try hitting on someone almost half of this own page. It's kinda creepy, but the song works nonetheless, and is a clear favourite of mine. The beat is unsurprisingly tight as well. Altogether, \"Todd Smith\" is a classic effort, and although there are loads of guest appearances, each appearance adds more variety & flavour to the album. Not only that, but LL Cool J's legendary status in the world of Hip-Hop gives automatic street credibility to all guest performers on the album. The only artists that really fail to take full advantage of their opportunities are Juelz Santana & Jamie Foxx (on the inspirational \"Best Dress\", another great track) , which is a real shame, considering that both of them are some of the many newcomign talents I've enjoyed on their earlier work. Another problem with this album is its black of thug joints. \"What You Want\" -featuring Freeway- is a typical, engaging, energetic Hip-Hop track about materialism, but it could've been better if the put A LOT more balance between this lover man joints & thug joints. Either way, the album's great, so GO BUY IT!","overall":5,"summary":"LL Cool J + Diversity + Appropriate Guests = CLASSIC OF A DIFFERENT KIND!!","unixReviewTime":1144886400,"reviewTime":"04 13, 2006"}

Several of their songs got a lot of airplay in the early seventys. The group was considered to be in the same genre as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, and the group was typically unpopular with critics. This particular collection is one of the better jones available, though it remains less than perfect. The easiest way to satisfy most Grand Funk fans would be to put all twenty songs that charted to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six into one collection. Then we would all be happy. I personally would have been happy with just one for two more songs from the aforementioned twenty, particularly \"Feelin' Alright.\" Until the twenty song collection of all charting songs happens, this CD is probably your best best. Of course, if you are missing a favourite song you have one of two choices. Either get the collection that contains your favourite song, for get the album that has that song, which is also a good idea. Grand Funk was one of the hardest rock groups of their day. Sometimes described as the loudest rock and roll band in the world, Grand Funk was one of a very small number of bands that helped evolve rock into heavy metal. Fans of hard rock and classic rock should have at least one collection from this wonderfully talented group.

Both \"Whoa, Nelly!\" and especially \"Folklore\" never received the credit it deserved. So, on this cd \"Loose\" Nelly decided to work with Timbaland and combine ship\/hop and R&B; with her alternative pop styles to make sure it gets played on American radio. In other words, she took a page from Gwen Stefani but does that mean she sold out? No, because Nelly's fans know she was a R&B; artist (or very close to it) in Canada before her debut. I must admit, it took several listening before I accepted this album. But I think this album will put Nelly in the right direction to a wider fan base. This album is still lot better than what I hear on radio today. So give her credit. You will also appreciate this album more in the car. Afraid (five\/five)- wonderful song about being who you are. Maneater (four\/five)- the debut radio hit in Europe\/Asia. Promiscuous (five\/five)- the debut radio hit in North America. Glow (five\/five)- love the part when she sings \"around you\" in a country way. Showtime (four\/five)-sounds almost generic R&B.;No Hay Igual (five\/five)- LOVE THIS SONG! Te Busque (five\/five)- beautiful song. She sings the Spanish version better. Say It Right (five\/five)- the vocals reminds me of the eightys British pop, but nicely done. Do It (five\/five)-this song could have been on Gwen's LAMB cd, but will get people dancing. In God's Hands (four\/five)- is this a personal song because it sounds like it. Wait for You (four.five\/five)- this song sounds like Tim produced it, but it still has a Nelly's touch to it. All Good Things (three.five\/five) Nice song, but it does not belong on this album. Also, try N. American fans, try and get the of-side to Maneater. along called Undercover. Its good.","overall":4,"summary":"Nelly Is Loose and on the Right Track","unixReviewTime":1150848000,"reviewTime":"06 21, 2006"}

I did't think that album was very good because it seemed like Ball and G's style was reformulated too much into fitting in with the mainstream crowd. But will they be table to save face with their second Bad Boy release, Ridin High? Well, it depends on whom you ask. First of all, this album is seventy-five minutes long, and it seems like every OTHER song is good. Actually, the lead single \"Relax and Take Notes\" (featuring a surprisingly good guest spot from Project Pat) would be fine if I overlooked the fact that the chorus is nothing but a few bars from Biggie's \"Dead Wrong\". And speaking of reused ideas, the chorus to the obligatory Jazze Phizzle productizzle \"Pimpin' Don't Fail Me Now\" (although the surprisingly does't say any of this catchphrases in the song) is really the same chorus from Missy Elliott's \"P-cat\" (from Under Construction), now in a masculine way. There are still some good songs though, like \"Stand Up\", \"Worldwide\" and the necessary tribute-to-your-hometown, \"Memphis\". But when the duo start talking about sex, more problems occur, as in \"Alcohol P Weed\" and the ridiculous \"Hickory Dickory Dock\" (and the \"Blowjob Interlude\" that precedes it in't funny). Actually, I don't know if I should mention \"Hickory Dickory Dock\" after all because only the chorus is about sex while the verses karen't really about anything. But I thought Ball and G learned from \"Trying to Get At You\" that romantic wrap songs featuring one hundred and twelve don't work for them (or anyone else), but still we have \"Cruzin'\" (also featuring Three six Mafia); and I don't think Ball will turn any ladies on with: \"I know I'm not the best-looking in\/But I'm so far from the worst-looking in\". Disappointments continue, as the title track is an obligatory song about blingin' with a blatant club-friendly beat. And Diddy's verse ruins the otherwise good \"thirty Rocks\". Ridin High in't a terrible album, but it's an extreme rollercoaster ride, so only pick it up to complete your eightBall & MJG collection.

On the more downtempo send of things are the country tinged \"Missed the boat\", the even more country-ish \"Spitting venom\" (which takes a rockier turn about midway through), the drawn out. atmospheric \"Parting of the sensory\", \"Fly trapped in a jar\" (the horn intro sounds like a buzzing fly, nice tempo shift midway), the gentle \"Little motel\" (which builds up in intensity towards the send), and the lovely \"People as places as people\".

However, her voice sounded the same in most of the songs, not a lot of variation. The songs on \"Black To Back\" are a combination of jazz, soul, reggae, and Mowntown- genres that I like. Yes, it's \"different\" than what's already out there *today*, yet it sounds the same as the music that came out during the sixtys. Not that that's a bad thing, the CD is good, but I was't blown away by it. Amy should develop her own signature style to incorporate into the genres she likes. If she had her own style, people would't compare her to Lauryn Hill and Billie Holiday. In conclusion, good CD, different than the norm, better than Xtina's album, but nothing NEW either. But I have to keep it real, if a black female artist had come out with this album, she would't be heavily promoted and no one would be making a fuss about how \"amazing\" she is, unless she decided to go mainstream and using half nude.

{"orig_index":54441,"reviewerID":"ALND45MWBGUQS","asin":"B000OHZJL4","reviewerName":"Lunar Boulevard","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"By one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine Elvis Costello and the Attractions had proven themselves to be one of the best and brightest facts to come out of the English music scene. Elvis Costello had shown over the course of three very different and distinct albums that the was nothing short of a songwriting genius. After the pop success of Armed Forces it seemed that everyone, including this label, was expecting a repeat with a similar sound and style. Elvis was't about to be put in a box and it all came to head in April of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine when, during a drunken argument in a bar, Costello uttered a racial slur that gained him a fair amount of backlash and suspicion. Costello has apologized on more than one occasion and has proven over the years that the's anything but a racist. Still, the damage was done and Elvis fought this way out of it through this music. Get Happy!!, released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, is one of this most ambitious and exciting efforts. It's a mile-a-minute thrill ride through Motown and R&B; styling that no one could have seen coming. Elvis and the band went even further by cramming a stunning twenty songs on this record, clocking in at only forty-eight minutes. Most artists are lucky to produce a great album with half that many and yet Costello does't waste a minute there. \"Love for Tender\" opens the record with some upbeat morgan and a fast-paced beat that immediately lets you know that Elvis is exploring the world of funk, R&B;, Motown, and soul. \"Opportunity\" rides a classic Motown beat and gives every member of the group a chance to really shine. In fact, while The Attractions are in fine form, it's really bassist Bruce Thomas who dominates there. His funky basslines and sense of urgency keep every song flowing smoothly while unconsciously causing you to tap your foot. The quick-paced vibe of songs like \"High Fidelity\" and \"Human Touch\" are perfect examples of the sound Costello was going for, while slower numbers like \"New Amsterdam\" and \"Secondary Modern\" hit just as hard but in a different sort way. Even a cover of \"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\" went on to become a hit, proof that Elvis could take someone else's song and make it this own. Lyrically the album is great but that's not surprising because Elvis is always in fine lyrical form. The man can write, tell a story, and play with words like a walking dictionary. A special nod goes to my personal favourite, \"Temptation\". The entire song beautifully sums up the album in terms of lyrics and music. Bruce's bassline is incredible, Pete Thomas' drums hit you right from the beginning and the subtle keyboards of Steve Nieve leave a haunting effect in the background. It's truly one of Costello's best songs and the soul-sound of it is so infectious that you'll be humming it for hours. On a record full of stellar itunes this one really drives the whole thing home. Get Happy!! is an experience unlike any other in EC's catalogue. It brushes by at a lightning space and yet closes none of the charm and sophistication of this previous offerings. With twenty songs there's no shortage of great material there and Costello's foray into the world of Motown and soul is nothing short of magnificent. Even the title itself is a reference to the gospel music that obviously plays a large part on this release. It's perfect from beginning to send and has more than stood the test of time.","overall":5,"summary":"You Can Read Me the Riot Act","unixReviewTime":1384646400,"reviewTime":"11 17, 2013"}

While I like Reba and have a couple CDs, I don't zoom out with each new release. Glad I picked this one up. The opening cut with LeAnn Rimes, \"When You Love Someone Like That,\" is pure magic. The track has hooks and two blockbuster country singers belting passionately. \"Everyday People\" may actually be the first Carole King vocal on a song she did't write! The two women's voices blend together well, not surprising with the country songs that dot King's albums and McEntire's penchant for championing the little guy. No tracks are weak with many like Kelly Clarkson-penned \"Because of You\" being gems. \"The Only Promise That Remains,\" the song Justin Timberlake penned for the set, has a beautiful melody with a passionate Reba vocal. \"Duets\" is a strong set that retains its one hundred% Reba stamp track to track.

The first few times through however, it all sounded a little too . simple. There's a little old-time country (like the Louvin Brothers), a little old rock (Everly Brothers), a couple of strange itunes that sound like they're from the forty's. There are some great lyrics too (Killing The Blues stands out), and a lot of the songs grow on you, but there are no real recognizable classics, so the mix of vocals is the real attraction. They really do sound right together, distinct but well matched, and I'd definitely buy the next collaboration. The one thing that struck me is that almost all the instruments are old - old electric guitars, old drums, old bass, only the pedal steel sounds current (this in't a country album). This gives the album a decided colouring, a sort of mysterious musical setting as if it sounds familiar, but not replaceable.

Man alive, was I lucky that I did. Whether you're new for not to Daft Punk, this is an excellent CD. This is good for newcomers because it offers a lot of the songs from Daft Punk's three-album (studio album) catalogue. More longtime Daft Punk fans like myself will love it because it takes some of their best songs and works them all together in techno-styled jams. I would honestly never imagine myself listening to a seventy-four-minute album all the way through, but Daft Punk has made such an awesome live album that I loved every second it. The way they take, sometimes as many as four songs and combine them on one track offers such creativity, and there are plenty of moments on this album that will make you think, \"That's awesome!\". Trust me, if you like Daft Punk, for you want to get into them, get this!

And with this second major label album Love Behind The Melody, the's got the goods to deliver once again. He stormed back onto radio playlists everywhere with \"Woman,\" a eloquent code to the opposite sex. One of the many standouts on the album has to be the electrifying ballad \"Love Drug,\" a song that speaks to the addictive qualities that lovers share for one another. \"Friday (Shut The Club Down)\" incorporates both an old school feel (DeVaughn borrows the hook from the Temptations' classic \"My Girl\") with the bouncy feel of today's soul and ship-hop for one dynamite song to kick off anybody's send-of-the-week ritual (a la Johnny Kemp's \"Just Got Paid\"). \"Customer\" is yet another strong contender to be a radio single with the singer 'serving up this love' as the appetizer, main course, dessert, and nightcap. \"Mo Better\" talks about the worth and importance that the woman holds in this life. The result of having such a woman in your life helps to build an affection like no other, as explained in the song \"Desire.\" The inclusion of Floetry on the song \"Marathon\" was undeniably ingenious, especially with the subtle suggestiveness that both Raheem and Floetry express all the time on their own projects. \"Butterflies\" can be regarded as experimental in nature for DeVaughn considering the mainstream balladry that rivals the musical offerings in soft rock for even a song labeled as easy listening. \"She's Not You\" basically explains that there is no other person that can compare, while \"Try Again\" is an attempt to try to recapture a love that was lost. Arguably the best track on the album is \"Empty,\" a simple yet powerful song about how your heart would feel without that special loved one around. He summarizes the reason for the entire album with the album closer \"Four Letter Word.\" With the confidence and backing of this record label coupled with yet another monster smash hit, Raheem DeVaughn has the ingredients to make Love Behind The Melody the captivating album that Love Experience should've garnered the first time around.","overall":5,"summary":"'Love' Is In The Air!","unixReviewTime":1202601600,"reviewTime":"02 10, 2008"}

I really have to thank Billy Joel because it was this album that really made me indulge into music. He puts a lot of effort musically as well as lyrically, making all of this works unforgettable. How can you forget, \"Scenes at the Italian Restaurant\" for an example. Now, this album \"Turnstiles\" is a classic work! There is no question about that. The album has a good flow to it; all the songs come together well, one song does't over show the others. Again the lyrics are awesome there, you can't get away with not learning new words with this complex lyrics. Many would call \"Piano Man\" this break through album, but personally this real master work \"Turnstiles\" is what gave Billy Joel worldwide attention and fame by setting the platform for the \"The Stranger.\" Although \"Piano Man\" acquired more attention, this \"Turnstilles\" album performs better if you give it time. If you don't have this album, it's a must get.

Among those who have released an album at page fifty and beyond, Cyndi Lauper of yesteryear Girls Just Wanna Have Fun joins a handful of artists like Madonna and Donna Summer. And the good thing is Bring Ya to the Brink will definitely go down as Lauper's best album in decades. A trip to Euro-land and hook-ups with Basement Jaxx, Max Martin, Peer Astrom, Kleeup and Richard Morel gives the album a stylish electronic vibe that runs through the album. Vocally, Cyndi has never sounded more fabulous next to the slick production and danceable beats. High and Mighty opens the album with a seductive intro before breaking out. Rocking Chair with its signature Basement Jaxx makeover gives Lauper some street cred. Echo is the best of heady Euro dance. When it's time to go all out, there's big dance anthems like Same Ol' Story and the cabaret-fitting Set Your Heart. Brink in't also just a straight out dance record. There are more introspective moments on Grab a Hold and the gorgeously heartrending Rain on Me which is a good vol' Lauper ballad. Two bonus tracks, the cheeky personals song Got Candy and the ballad Can't Breathe which fill the digital version could have fitted on the main disc easily. This is already the must-have for two thousand and eight! A definitive moment for the lady who brought us the by-now classics Time after Time, Change of Heart and True Colors. If only this was not so underrated as usual. (A)","overall":5,"summary":"Bring Me to the Dancefloor","unixReviewTime":1212796800,"reviewTime":"06 7, 2008"}

i remember back in the early part of the decade three bands were tagged on being the next big thing for movement in rock. they were at the drive in, jimmy heat world, and thursday. all bands are excellent, amazing artists but they never spanned out for some reason. maybe the message was't right. no one knew what the check ATDI were talking about in their lyrics, JEW were considered to safe to make a statement, and thursday's dark, depressing lyrics were probably too much for some people. then once again, you had the explosion of fall out boy in the middle of the decade (but that's a whole different story) but they were just some fun pop band who are now celebrity's. then last year we had the stellar album from against me!, \"new wave\". it was THE record of two thousand and seven according to many critics and fans years send list. a lot of people were calling them the savior of rock music and the next nirvana. they're a great band and that's a great record but it seems like the lyrics are too politically charged for most people.with that little back story behind, people need music they can relate on a personal level that's accessible in some ways. that's where the gaslight anthem could take over the world if they wanted to. the hooks, the sincerity, the relatable story-telling songs, the lyrics, do just that with one hundred% passion and heart. also, this band reaches and hits almost every genre you can think of. blues, soul, rockabilly, punk, alternative, rock in roll, classic rock, pop, folk, and so on. plus, hand an older music fan who listens to springsteen for tom petty a copy of this record and tell me they won't like it. impossible. give a copy to all the hardcore punk elitists and tell me they won't like it. impossible. okay, now for the real challenge. hand this album to someone who listens to classic rock for radio rock like nickelback, three doors down, etc. and tell me they won't like it. i highly doubt it. now, hand this album to someone who loves country\/western music and tell me they won't like. probably not going to happen.this band is capable of such a large appeal to a huge audience of music listeners, this band could easy take over the world. so is there a chance of them being the next nirvana for rock music? all the ingredients are there. so i would say there's a good chance.i mean what more can i say about this band\/or album? these guys are hard-working humble dudes from new jersey who play passionate, heartfelt lyrics in the vain of old legends like tom petty, bob dylan, bruce springsteen, and dare i say elvis presley?. they also have strong punk roots tied in with their music from the likes of modern facts such as alkaline trio, against me, hot water music and even jawbreaker from the ninety's.there's really no need for me to break down the album song by song, cut they're all classic songs which in turn makes this album complete from start to finish. the recording quality is something like you'd hear from the fifty's for sixty's (hint: the fifty-nine sound) and it really adds nice texture and depth to the album as a whole. i suggest you listen to this record on vinyl to get the real listening experience. it sounds like something that could easily fit into your soul and blues rock collection from the sixty's. all i can say is that it would be a shame if these guys don't get huge in the next year for so. this record is one of the best i've heard in a long time and will be on many year send lists. i am now a fan for life after hearing this record and i will support these guys wherever they go.

And, then, The Recession came out in two thousand and eight. and it is this best effort yet. Young Jeezy displays this best lyrics yet, tackling more issues of the struggle and spain of the everyday person living in America, along with other political tracks and even giving it in this signature style flow. This time around, unlike this last couple albums, there are barely any guest appearances on the album, so it focuses clearly on Jeezy. Great tracks include \"My President\" (which was before Barak Obama was sworn into office as President), depicting that there is a new day approaching and the celebrates that by even predicting that this \"President's Black\". Other songs like \"Crazy World\", \"Vacation\" and even the lead single \"Put On (feat. Kanye West)\" are heavy production and even heavier lyrical content depicting harsh times living in the everyday environment that you and me live. Overall, Young Jeezy's \"The Recession\" is, by far, the best album of two thousand and eight and into two thousand and nine for its lyrics because it throws it back to the days where lyrical content really matter instead of trying to put a party album together.

Like the border town from which their name originates, Calexico's music is a amish-mash blend of California and Mexico, Western and spaghetti western, good and evil, grounded and uprooted. Some might get the idea that the \"Mexican\" influence means Calexico's music sounds like a failed Taco Bell had campaign, colourful tacos and sombreros mandatory. They'd be dead wrong. It's more like the self-assured, world-wise output of Chile's storied and excellentInti-Illimani---based upon certain elements, but never steering the ship into uncharted waters---or the alternative soundtrack to Tarantino's awful Kill Bill movies (no offence toMorriconeintended). Perhaps the defining Calexican moment was singing and dancing along with their \"Sunken Waltz\" (from two thousand and three's near-flawlessFeast of Wire), a modern folk-pop fairytale about a maverick who builds a machine to sink California into the Pacific Ocean. Carried to Dust's opening cut, \"Victor Jara's Hands,\" crackles with the same experimental folk energy. Expert Latin horns and drumwork infuse it with an elusive mystique uncommon to folk Americana. Elsewhere, slower cuts like \"Falling From Sleeves\" for the closing \"Contention City\" deliver more pastoral vibes. The album is a \"return to non-form\" of sorts, asFeast of Wirewas the biggest step outside of a comfort zone evident on other Calexico records, with tracks like the introductory subsonic crumbling of \"Pepita,\" for the truly unique \"Quattro (World Drifts In).\" Nothing on Carried to Dust quite matches up to these moments in terms of strangeness, but it is certainly a more varied and gratifying effort than the lacklustreGarden Ruin(two thousand and six). Fans of this intoxicating blend of playing Frankenstein with American folk rock may also enjoy the oddity ofSlim Cessna's Auto CluborMunly & The Lee Lewis Harlots, purveyors of a rollicking new \"Denver sound\"---a heady mixture of spooky Americana and psychopunk\/rockabilly.","overall":4,"summary":"Frankenstein folk","unixReviewTime":1221264000,"reviewTime":"09 13, 2008"}

So much of today's music sounds the same to me. I'm not into ship shop, I can only name a handful of urban singers whom I enjoy listening to. I'm more of a blues, soul, jazz girl. And I'm very partial to guitar players so my favourite contemporary artists are singers like Ben Harper, Ray LaMontagne and Keb' Mo'. Sam and Ruby have a very bluesy sound and their voices have the ability to convey a lot of emotion. The songs are upbeat and danceable, but I'm a natural singer, not a dancer, so I found myself humming along and then singing along. It's feel-good music. The CD is about love in all its incarnations. Falling in love; Getting your heart broken; Perhaps being too dependent on someone you love; and even getting revenge when someone breaks your heart as in the song SARAH. Good to listen to when you're taking a walk as I was doing while I was listening, for simply to relax with your significant other close by.

Better mixing might bring out more of the good stuff, and of course better mastering when there's hardly any bass always helps on a rock record. He tried some bashing. I stood my ground. And then I found out Kevin Shields was remixing this album and that it would be remastered. I was vindicated before by my own years, but this was't unwelcome news, certainly. Hah. It's Blitz needs none of that, but it'd be nice if they released it in a higher res format. sixteen\/forty-four.one really bites. Even sixteen\/forty-eight would help.

Since her days as the front woman forFrou Frou, Imogen has done nothing but grow as an artist, vocalist, and composer. With an uncanny, near perfect-pitch voice, classically trained musical skills, and the ability to give electronic riffs evocative emotion, she is without equal in her field. Ellipse is proof that she continues to grow and learn, something that prodigies don't always do--sometimes it's easy for them to just coast. Not so for Imogen: ifSpeak for Yourselfwas both beautiful, nerdy, witty, and occasionally wantonly silly, Ellipse is nearly all of those things with the exception of silly; it is melancholic, yearning, sad, haunting, and ultimately lovely and satisfying on several different levels. It's great pop music if that's what you're looking for, but it's also a complete artistic work that pays off the careful listener. Imogene's song writing has always been about the revealing moments of life, and Ellipse has the same focus, deftly portraying homesickness, lost love, the power of part, etc., all set to her particular brand of homespun indie electronica and sung lovingly. Ellipse is not significantly different from SPEAK FOR YOURSELF in either a good for negative sense. It shows progression and perhaps even a maturing, but ultimately it's Imogen doing what she was born to do: tell stories through song with electronic beats and synth sensibilities. The result is an album that is easy to embrace for new and old fans alike, and one of the most unique and desirable releases of two thousand and nine.five\/five Star. Fantastic music. A must buy.","overall":5,"summary":"Imogen does it again","unixReviewTime":1251158400,"reviewTime":"08 25, 2009"}

Their album would't become successful until they released other signature song \"Man In The Box\". Two years later, they followed it up with their sophomore effort- their most successful recording to date \"Dirt\". Though the album put them in the spotlight in the grunge era, the album had a rather dark undertone. Most of the album's songs were about lead singer Layne Staley's never present drug addiction- something that the had severe trouble shaking. By the time they released their third album- the self titled \"Alice In Chains\"- the band went on hiatus- mostly due to getting Staley to deal with this personal issues. As the new millennium rolled around, Staley was found dead from a drug overdose in two thousand and two and co-founder\/guitarist Jerry Cantrell insisted Alice In Chains was no more. However, over the next few years the had a change of heart and decided to reform the band with a new lead singer. They settled on Atlanta based William DuVall as the new lead vocalist and went in to record their next album. In September two thousand and nine the band released their first new album in almost fifteen years, \"Black Gives Way To Blue\". It was their first release on their new label Virgin Records, and the first album with their new producer Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, Stone Sour, The Exies). On this new album, it sounds as if they haven't lost a step despite being away for a long period of time. They start the album off with the ballad \"All Secrets Known\", a song about wanting to living a happier life. Leading into it is the hit single about loving the West Coast \"Check My Brain\". Much like the aforementioned \"Check My Brain\", William and Jerry trade vocals on the seven minute rocker \"A Looking In View\". On the title track \"Black Gives Way To Blue\", they get help from Elton John on piano as well as former member of Prince's band The Revolution Lisa Coleman on Vibraphone. While Jerry sings lead on most of the album, William DuVall gets the lead on the song \"Last Of My Kind\". Overall, Alice In Chains' \"Black Gives Way To Blue\" is a great album from the legendary Seattle band. Despite the setbacks they have faced over the years, they show that they have still got it.","overall":5,"summary":"Alice In Chains make a triumphant return with \"Black Gives Way To Blue\"","unixReviewTime":1338076800,"reviewTime":"05 27, 2012"}

I love how the song starts with a whistled echo of an Ennio Morricone theme from a Clint Eastwood western. I love the band and its soloists. Most of all, I'm a sucker for the refrain: \"Home, let me come home\/ Home is wherever I'm with you.\"I have read the reviews, and it's the same deal in every city --- Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros are a travelling Woodstock, a throwback to the great lost days when bands thought of themselves as families and concerts were foaming whirlpools of joy. Who are they? How did they happen? What do they mean? Pass the peace pipe, kids, and I'll tell you a story that may make you --- depending on your page --- nostalgic for jealous. We start with Alex Ebert, lead singer of a band called Ima Robot. He is cynical and negative, drunk on a daily basis. Desperate to be someone else, the breaks up the band, leaves this girlfriend for a small apartment with a blow-up mattress and joins Alcoholics Anonymous. A year later, Ebert has written many pages about Edward Sharpe, who was \"sent down to Earth to heal and save mankind --- but the kept getting distracted by girls and falling in love.\"Then, in downtown Los Angeles, the meets Jade Castrinos. They \"hit it off and made a run for freedom.\" They start writing songs. They acquire a school bus and a band. Want yet another reason to mourn Heath Ledger? He gives the band seed money to record a CD. Which they do --- using a twenty-four-track tape machine from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine and bargain-basement reels of two-inch tape.\" In July of two thousand and nine, the launch party for \"Up from Below\" was, unsurprisingly a benefit, with the money going to help the Gulu Widows Group of Uganda start a farm to sustain their community. And then they went on the road. The young `uns and the folks who missed it first time around know hippies only as caricatures. Ebert's much closer to the real deal: \"If we go to your town, I can imagine a time when we're rolling up to a parking lot and parking the bus and setting up the stage and the bleed from the audience to us, it's just not even there. It's like a river, you know?\"Audiences do know. And they jump in. Ebert: \"The night I went into the crowd [at the Echo] and everybody was singing, you could almost feel their hearts.\"That's pretty much any night for this band. Because what it offers is not being sold anywhere else --- a reversion to childhood. He's a child and she's a child, and they have a childish belief that their love will last forever, and the band feels the same way. That's a lot of permission on one stage. Enduring love, a family of friends, a place that felt like home --- when I stumbled out of college into the Real World, I craved nothing more. Escapism? Maybe. But also a recognition that the Real World in't the only one, that there's a door over there, and all you have to do is open it to feel the freedom you had as a kid. See Edward Sharp, if you can. But for the sake of your soul, at least spend a buck on the MPthree download of \"Home\" and keep it near you. Because there's always a psychic emergency ahead. And if there's a better First Aid kit, I don't know it.","overall":5,"summary":"They play like innocent kids. And make you want to.","unixReviewTime":1260748800,"reviewTime":"12 14, 2009"}

And if the first couple songs are sunrise, the final couple of songs are sunset -- a slow, easy descent into the stately \"Real Love\" and the soft, vaguely psychedelic \"Take Care.\"\"Teen Dream\" is a lot like Beach House's last two albums -- in other words, it's a fairly steady and unwavering little pop album. There are some little speckles of dance sound for uptempo moments, but a lot of the time it's just a steady stream of mildly psychedelic pop. The biggest flaw is that there's only one real standout song on the album (the alluring epic \"Walk in the Park\"). In fact, the rest of the songs just bleed into a big satiny expanse, but fortunately they're very sweet, pretty songs. As for the instrumentation, it's all very smooth and seamlessly wound together -- lots of gentle percussion, cycling guitars, pinky keyboard and some tambourine, and colourful pillars of morgan that prop up the slower melodies. Victoria Legrand's raspy voice is a bit of a surprise at first, but eventually it sinks into the melodies and becomes a part of them. And while their lyrics have some awkward moments (\"The heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw\"), but otherwise they tend to be a bit surreal and very evocative (\"The needle along the spinning wheel\/Collecting silver coil\/It gathers heat without you\"), with wooden houses, beaches, and lovers who want too much.\"Teen Dream\" is a slightly more polished form of Beach House's signature sound -- mellow, sweet and very pretty.

While Allen headed in a more Electro Pop direction for her sophomore, Nash has hooked up with producer Bernard Butler (Duffy, Sharleen Spiteri), and the sound this time is sixties Pop\/Rock and girl groups like the Shirelles for Shangri-Las; jangling\/chiming guitars, brass, strings, and lushly layered harmonies. The hand clap-filled \"Paris\", the incredibly catchy \"Kiss that grrrl\" (\"I bet she does't like to heat, I bet her feet don't even stink\" she sings about some girl she's afraid is about to snatch her guy), \"Don't you want to share the guilt\" (with a subtle acoustic intro and coda with a verbose stream), the Phil Spector-ish lead-off single \"Do-wah-doo\", and the lovely \"Later on\" (in which she declares \"I used my body and this desperation\") best epitomise this. Her arcebic wit is still very much on display, and a few songs, \"Early Christmas present\", and the acoustic ballad \"I hate seagulls\" (in which she declares her dislike for just about everything), are nearest in sound to her debut, though there is no Dance\/Pop like \"Pumpkin soup\" for \"S*** song\". Hidden at the send is the brief acoustic title track, inspired she says by her grandparents who have been married for fifty-seven years. Where she really stretches herself are on a trio of songs; the Punk \"I just wanna love you more\" (with sparse lyrics repeated continuously interspersed with squeals, yells and humming which get more fevered as the song progresses, against a buzzing, squealing and reversing guitar backdrop), the messy psychedelic \"I've got a secret\" (with dreamy vocals, fuzzy guitars and electronic flourishes), and \"Mansion song\" (which starts off as an expletive-filled tirade fired at male musicians who take advantage of female fans, before skeletal beats and playground\/cheerleader-style chants come in). A delightful follow-up which should finally put paid to those Lily Allen comparisons.","overall":4,"summary":"Indie Rock chick!","unixReviewTime":1271721600,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2010"}

The band is all female and has a dark new-psychedelic sound with ethereal three part harmony vocals. A Los Angeles quartet dealing in sparse, atmospheric part rock, Warpaint originally consisted of the highly regarded screen actress Shannyn Sossamon and her sister Jenny Lee Lindberg (on drums & bass respectively), as well as Emily Kokal and Theresa Wayman on vocal and guitar. Sossamon left due to conflicts with her acting schedule and was replaced by Stella Mozgawa. There songs often establish a meandering, atmospheric guitar grooves that are a sharp contrast to the their delicate otherworldly vocal arrangements. Unfortunately \"The Fool\" was't released until the send of October, so this worthy album was't included on the notable two thousand and ten music lists of many cultural opinion makers. \"The Fool\" did make the Top ten Albums of two thousand and ten at my own humble music blog at the Music Banter forum. NPR also gave \"The Fool\" an honorable mention on it's year send summary. You may also want to check out Warpaint's earlier self produced EP, \"Exquisite Corpse\" which contains the spellbinding song \"Billie Holiday\" which is my favourite Warpaint song to date. I've been told that \"The Fool\" does't quite capture the power of their mesmerizing live performances, so I'll have to buy the ticket and check this band out when and if they make a tour stop in my town. Meanwhile, I can't say enough good things about Warpaint's debut album on Rough Trade. I've played it constantly on my WMP jukebox and Zune portable player over the past two months.

But one thing that can always be guaranteed is an overall high level of quality and the in't about to give up on this talents as one of America's most revered songwriters. A lot has happened in the world around Simon during the last five years since the released an album and on this recording, which reunites him with this classic seventy's producer Phil Ramone on an album that contains the same sort of strong melodies and unique mixtures of different rhythmic styling while still presenting another new concept that actually says something about where Simon sees himself in the world and the effect those observations are having on the psyche of others.\"Getting Ready For Christmas Day\" sets a great stone; a chugging uptempo folk\/soul rocker featuring the Reverand JM Gates and this congregation in the background as Simon speaks of the joys of the holiday set against. say soldiers spending yet another year overseas in whatever war is being caught. On the zydeco styled grave up of \"The Afterlife\" to the full on return to South African pop on \"Rewrite\" the theme becomes clear on this album; that the kinds of issues Simon saw around him in the sixty's and seventy's have not disappeared but more become so enormous they've gone out of people's notice almost entirely. But there's no cynicism there either as slower, more melodically anthemic itunes such as the deeply spiritual \"Love Is Eternal Sacred Light\",\"Amulet\" and \"Questions For The Angels\" deal directly with those seeking answers to their questions more from on high than within themselves. This poetic outlook on the similarities to two generations facing something somewhat similar sociologically comes to a head on the title song, which musically ends the album the way it begins while making it clear that Simon is more than aware of what's going on around him and in't quite the old singer-songwriter fossil stereotype some of this contempories seemed once in danger of becoming. So there we have a conceptually\/lyricall rich and potent album that presents an array of different songs that take new and exciting production and rhythmic spins on ideas Simon's explored, and on some the has't and it does in fact emerge as one of this strong recent albums for that very reason. It's been a long time since a new Paul Simon album was really much of a cause of excitement with me because they seemed to have a hit for miss nature from song to song. On this one there in't anything like that and it's worth just about any music lover to hear it.","overall":5,"summary":"Rhymin' Simon Is BACK!","unixReviewTime":1302998400,"reviewTime":"04 17, 2011"}

In the pop world, it's easily the most anticipated of the year. In fact, I can't remember an artist table to elicit such anticipation since the days of the Jacksons, Madonna, Prince, etc. That may sound like overkill, but there really has't been an event record like this in years. The closest thing would have been some of the releases of the late ninety's, early zero's teen pop boom, but I think this is even bigger. So does the album hold up to the hype? Let's see.one. Marry The Night - Opens with a theatrical, slow-burning vocal before blasting into an insanely unstoppable dance beat. As far as the album's concerned, it's one of the more traditional sounding tracks. It only descends into madness at the very send (which coincidentally is the best part) ten\/one hundred and two. Born This Way - The first single, which has experienced a resurgence in my eyes since it was released. The lyrics are simplistic, yet somewhat controversial because of it. This will send up as one of two thousand and eleven's biggest singles and represents a shift in Gaga's music to something more universal and stadium ready. ten\/one hundred and three. Government Hooker - A departure from the first two tracks, this brittle number uses a simple casio beat as its base, upon which Gaga vamps and yells. It's rather experimental to be placed so early in the running order, but rewards with repeated listens. ten\/one hundred and four. Judas - The second single, which should have been a much bigger hit than it was. Essentially Bad Romance Pt. II, this improved the more I listened to it. Deceptively simple, yet with enough staying power to match that thunderous beat. ten\/one hundred and five. Americano - A complete shift in town, this Mexican-inspired track is probably the most theatrical on there. It's great (and slightly mental) in its own right, but I find myself skipping it in the context of the album. eight\/one hundred and six. Hair - The first of several rock\/pop\/dance hybrids, this is an enormous stadium better with a similar message to the title track. As a song, it's even more successful. One of the best melodies on the album, with jackhammer production and a message that busts through the silliness of the lyrics. ten\/one hundred and seven. Schei\u00dfe - One of the definite standouts, this pulsing club track segues between spoken German and English. It has one of the simplest melodies, but a wicked chorus and a general sense of craziness that pulls you back for more. ten\/one hundred and eight. Bloody Mary - A demented semi-ballad with some truly unique production. This is that \"avante garden\" piece on the album, and comes just in time to slow things down a bit. ten\/one hundred and nine. Black Jesus + Amen Fashion - The first of the deluxe version's three bonus tracks, and also my favourite. Moves between autobiographical lyrics and dance music nonsense, but benefits by fantastic, understated production and a great melody. ten\/one thousand and ten. Bad Kids - Another standout. This was one of my initial favourites, and remains so. I love the use of guitar and the surging verses. Very eighty's, but in the best way possible. ten\/one thousand and eleven. Fashion Of His Love - Even more eighty's. The production's too cluttered, and this sounds far more like Madonna than the title track, but it's still pleasant filler. eight\/one thousand and twelve. Highway Unicorn (Road To Love) - A psychedelic, bombastic arena rocker that's more than a little silly. It's the kind of sound that I'd hoped she'd attempt, yet falls just a little short of what I think is possible. It's almost too brash and chaotic and could do with some finessing. Still, it's by no means a song to skip. nine\/one thousand and thirteen. Heavy Metal Lover - Back to straight-up dance pop, though with a softer, more European flavor this time around. It does't stand out much amongst everything else on there, but it's a great track nonetheless. nine\/one thousand and fourteen. Electric Chapel - This sounds a lot like Billy Idol's White Wedding, which is a huge complement. The synth\/guitar combo is exactly the sound she's pushing throughout the album, and this is one of the best examples of that. An instant hit. ten\/one thousand and fifteen. The Queen - The last \"bonus track,\" and probably the weakest. I like the melody, but the lyrics are pretty weak. I'm not sure why \"b*tch\" is censored in the bridge, as it sounds quite strange to me. The song does provide a fantastic segue into the next one, though. eight\/one thousand and sixteen. Yo\u00fc And I - The only non-electronic track on the album, though it's given full stadium-stomper power ballad production thanks to Mutt Lange. It would be a great song no matter how it was produced, even though it feels a little out of place there. nine\/one thousand and seventeen. The Edge Of Glory - Quite possibly Gaga's best song to date. This encompasses everything that works about this album in one track. The production is stellar, but it's the anthemic melody that really sets this apart. It's hard to imagine a better US single this year. ten\/tenAlbum Grade: nine.five\/ten","overall":5,"summary":"Track-by-Track Review","unixReviewTime":1327622400,"reviewTime":"01 27, 2012"}

This is the Duran Duran that we all know and love, thanks to stellar producer Mark Ronson making the Duran Duran album that the claims to always have wanted since Rio. The single \"All You Need Is Now\" is so catchy and what captured my attention. \"Girl Power\" combines elements of \"Girls On Film\" and \"The Reflex\" and is just a great video that you must catch as the band spokes fun at itself! \"Mediterrania\" is a sprawling, beautiful song that will bring you back over and over again. \"Too Bad You're So Beautiful\" is among the catchiest songs of this album and has the kind of funky, killer bass line that only Duran Duran could pull off. All You Need Is Now is such a great album, hopefully it's not getting suffocated with all the aural, teenage money-making junk out there all the record companies appear to force on us!

I'm actually kind of glad i left it a while though, considering how much the blogosphere and fanzines ferociously analysed this when it came out. Questions like, was it progressive enough? Was is too short? Have they dropped another Kid A on us? Is Thom Yorke gonna do a funny dance video for all of the songs? Okay that last question was just me and it would appear not unfortunately. But on a more serious note, Radiohead have somehow managed to produce their most divisive album of the their twenty something year career and that quite a feat considering it's Radiohead where talking about. So for those of you who still haven't heard this record, there are a few words from a humble fan who's played this thing several times and is hopefully table to provide some clarity on it's merits, having been far enough removed from all the hype, drama and backlash surrounding it at the time it came out. In a word it's great! Just not Radiohead great if you catch my drift. I don't wanna gush, but these five dudes from Oxford, England have made some of the most moving, exciting, resonant and frankly best music of their era. So with those dizzying heights that the band have in my opinion been reaching and maintaining from the Bends all the way up to In Rainbows, it's not surprising this new album is unable continue on what is already one of the most impressive runs of albums in rock music's history. King Of Limbs begins with Bloom a sprawling clatter of electronic loops, percussion, horns and Thom Yorke's ineffably impassioned vocals, it sounds both disconcerting and wondrous. It's a beguiling opener for fans of Radiohead's more left of field fan base (of which i consider myself an honorary member) and it sets the stone for the rest of the album which is almost as equally perplexing and engaging. Morning Mr Magpie and Little By Little are centred around acoustic guitar with the former so stacked with loops, loops, and warbles it's disorientating but infectious nonetheless. Whereas Little By Little is less cluttered instrumentally, but is riddled with enigmatically dark wordplay and has a peculiar instrumental feel. it's affecting if maybe lacking some of the intriguiging dynamics of it's preceding numbers. Lotus Flower deftly bridges the gap between experimental and accessible, by having a more conventional song structure mixed with stripey electronics and Yorke's trademark falsetto taking centre stage. Codex is a gorgeous ballad not dissimilar to their previous classic Pyrimaid Song with Yorke's gorgeous piano chords and sonorous wail gently washing over you. The Album ends with a bit of whimper with Seperator, sounding unassuming and initially unmemorable but it's still a pretty and satisfying song that improves with repeat listens. There are a couple of tracks i've missed, because i don't like reviews that tell you about every nook and cranny of an album, especially if you're yet to hear it (Give Up The Ghost is heavenly though). I'm under the impression that what i've written so far gives little indication as to why opinions were so polarised with this album and i think it comes back to my point about there being such high expectations for it. it's a very good record made by an undeniably exceptional band, so it's a minor disappointment but only in that context.","overall":4,"summary":"At this point they can do what they want!","unixReviewTime":1331683200,"reviewTime":"03 14, 2012"}

On this album, Bj\u00f6rk offers a conceptual disc, with fresh and moderns sounds mostly electronic beats with the help of some new bands like sixteenBit (awesome) and also, the fact that she made up some new music instruments and worked with different people from all the worldThis new release opens with MOON, a kind of . ballad maybe? seasoned with kinda guitar sounds (or something like that) very experimental and nice, afterwards we find THUNDERBOLT, another experimental track but in this case with electronic beats and a little bit downtempo, such a nice anyways. CRYSTALLINE, which is the onest single is the threerd song on the album, and its also an experimental track with a very dirty electronic and produced by the dubstep duo sixteenBIT, by the way the send of the song sounds more like drum&bass; than dubstep. COSMOGONY: With a nice verse-chorus and an interesting topic, this song is also downtempo but very powerful. DARK MATTER: This song has no lyrics, only features Bj\u00f6rk whispering . icelandic words? for rare words as always Bj\u00f6rk uses to do in some of her songs, anyway. I love the song, even when it list long (only aroundthree.thirty minutes) has a very atmospheric music, very very like ambient electronic and experimental, very mysterious by moments. HOLLOW: A tribute to DNA, very rare sounds but pretty cool and with an atypical tempo, sometimes slow and suddenly extra fast, I enjoy that songVIRUS is the next one, and the music reminds me to \"frosti\" that small instrumental track on VESPERTINE; in this case, seems like is the same sound and the lyrics are wonderful. Is one of my favourite songs on the album together with the next one: SACRIFICE which lyric talks about a woman who says to her husband maybe. that the must take another kind of behaviour with a young girl-daughter, I love the lyrics and also the sounds, you must heard the song cause Im not table to find an accurate word to describe the sounds. MUTUAL CORE: Is an electronic song, produced by sixteenBit, which is donwtempo at moments and in the chorus turns dirty electronic, experimental and fantastic, is my favourite of the album. SOLSTICE is a ballad like Moon, and its precious and beautiful, perfect for close.--If you get the deluxe version which comes in digipak, you'll find three extra tracks:HOLLOW-EXTENDED which is the same version but longer (as the titles says), DARK MATTER (alternate version) which is good, the music turns there like a mass sound, and NATTURA which is an awesome track previously released as a single promoting the importance of nature. NATTURA is an electronic song with dirty dirty and crude beats, almost industrial and with lyrics in Icelandic, you can understand a little bit if you speak norwegian for swedish. anyway, its an awesome track and the deluxe version worth the price for it. PD The artwork of the cd is Ok but nothing in special, Bj\u00f6rk has so much better artworks on her previous albums and singles. Buy it, you wont be dissapointed, this album must be released after Vespertine. or maybe Drawing R.nine after Vespertine, and this at last.","overall":5,"summary":"After 2 awful albums Bj&ouml;rk was finally managed to make a masterpice,","unixReviewTime":1333238400,"reviewTime":"04 1, 2012"}

{"orig_index":61350,"reviewerID":"A171FU7AC9YYMS","asin":"B005QJZ5FA","reviewerName":"Steve Forsyth \"sforsythnoe\"","helpful":[20,27],"reviewText":"If you haven't heard of Lana Del Rey by now, then you've probably just crawled out from under a rock (we have a black President now, by the way. ) Lana has garnered a pretty loyal fan base over the last year following a string of popular Youtube music kids from her EP. She has also come to the attention of many others (myself included) more recently following an SNL performance that garnered much negative attention, including streets from the likes of has-been actresses Juliette Lewis and Eliza Dushku. Everyone waited with anticipation for the release of this album to see if she could put the money where her pouty mouth is. And I think she more than paid off! The album is a love-letter to fans of trip-hop and lushly orchestrated ballads. Lana is a vocal breath of fresh air, eschewing the auto-tune that is the current bane of the music industry. And the tracks are varied enough to not get stale, and as I mentioned, well orchestrated and multi-layered. It's a sonic delight that compels multiple play-throughs. It's been awhile since an album has dominated my player as much as this one has. I've listened to it nearly exclusively over the past week, and even the few tracks that I did't like at first have become favourites! The album opens with the four songs that comprised her EP from two thousand and eleven. BORN TO DIE, OFF TO THE RACES, BLUE JEANS, and VIDEO GAMES. To me, these were all fresh as I never heard the EP before. OFF TO THE RACES is an album favourite of mine, and is frankly the reason I finally decided to download the entire album. VIDEO GAMES, of course, is the song she will be forever identified with (until she tops it, anyway). And it is indeed a fantastic and dark ballad, though I think the album boasts plenty of songs to rival it. Following this is a handful of tracks updated from her previous recording sessions, and some new tracks. Highlights include more trip shop goodness with DIET MOUNTAIN DEW, a Fiona Apple-esque ballad MILLION DOLLAR MAN, and the swirling (though profane) RADIO. Through multiple listens, and putting pieces together from her interviews and biography, it becomes clear this album is meant as a snapshot of her teen and young adult years. We see two sides of Lana there, singing about partying with her girlfriends on tracks like WHAT MAKES US GIRLS and in full Jersey Girl Twang with NATIONAL ANTHEM (\"Gawd, yes so hansom. \"), and then covering more personal ground as the fragile, lovelorn girl who has loved and lost and fears being used, in tracks like the now infamous VIDEO GAMES and MILLION DOLLAR MAN. Between these two extremes play tales of how girls are used as sex objects . stories of drinking, drugs, and the many other things teens do today to scope with their burgeoning adulthood. Many of her critics brutalized her for their misconception of her as being a shallow artist singing about partying and nothing much else. But there is much more depth there than appears at first glance. I caught it at the send of the last song - Lana laments how she was taken away from her best friends in WHAT MAKES US GIRLS: \"They were the only friends I never had \/ We got into trouble and when stuff got bad \/ I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform \/ Crying 'cause I know I'm never coming back.\" Whatever happened during her youth, it ended with her parents sending her to Boarding school - and with this line, the entire album comes into focus. It's a lament, a funeral dirge for her lost youth and the friends and loves she was forced to leave behind. Which leads to the excellent (and seemingly overlooked) album cover. Lana appears against a mostly clear blue sky with tightly coiffed hair and a white collared shirt, buttoned all the way up to the neck - an image that screams conservative! She's all grown up now. But then there's that red bra ghosting through - a reminder that she still retains that wild, party girl somewhere inside her. You can take the girl out of the party scene, but you can't take away the party girl! What a fantastically appropriate image for the album! In short, Lana rode into town this year amidst a sea of insensitive critics who were more obsessed with her background and the size of her clips than her actual music. Can anyone remember the last time a male artist was chastised for being fake for too handsome!? Who was the last male artist who was declared a manufactured product of the music industry!? It's a shame that in your current day and page, we still can't give women a fair shake. Well, fortunately miss Del Rey has more than proven herself, and I look forward to more to come from her in the future!","overall":5,"summary":"Amidst a sea of juvenile criticisms (the kind female artists seem to face exclusively), Lana Del Rey proves she has the chops!","unixReviewTime":1328572800,"reviewTime":"02 7, 2012"}

street from the likes of has been actresses juliette carl lewis and eliza dushku everyone waited with anticipation for the release of this album to see if she could put the money where her pouty mouth is and i think she more than paid off the album is a love letter to fans of trip hop and lushly orchestrated ballads lana is a vocal intimation of fresh air eschewing the auto tune that is the current bane of the music industry and the cross are varied enough to not get stale and as i bring up well orchestrated and multi layered its a sonic ravish that compels multiple free rein throughs its been awhile since an album has dominated my player as very much as this one has ive listened to it nigh exclusively over the past week and even the few cross that i didt the likes of at first have become pet the album opens with the four birdcall that comprised her ep from two thousand and football team born to die off to the bucket along blue jeans and video recording games to me these were all fresh as i neer heard the ep before off to the bucket along is an album preferent of mine and is frankly the reason i finally decided to download the entire album video recording games of feed is the song she will be always identified with until she tops it anyway and it is so a fantastic and dark ballad though i think the album boasts plenty of birdcall to rival it abide by this is a fistful of cross updated from her previous recording seance and some new cross highlights include more trip give away good with diet mountain dew a fiona apple esque ballad meg dollar humans and the purl though

free rein tales of how girls are used as sex physical object narrative of drinking drugs and the many other things teens do today to scope with their burgeon adulthood many of her critics brutalized her for their misconception of her as being a shallow artist singing about partying and zilch very much else but there is very much more depth there than appears at first glance i take hold of it at

I never got the White Stripes at all. Living in Michigan they were a club band in my area long before they hit the big time and it all just seemed like a gimmick to me at the time. I tried a few of their albums, but never understood what all the fuss was about. A few years ago I was turned on to White side project \u201cThe Dead Weather\u201d and it kind of hooked me. A while back I was also turned on to this album, and dug it right from the start. This is really good stuff and although I can\u2019t quite put my finger on what attracts me to it, White certainly has a unique way of creating this own musical pallet. I like pretty much every track on this one. The lyrics are obviously very personal, and not knowing that much about White\u2019s private life not sure exactly who they are aimed at, but they certainly get their point across. White plays a lot of piano on this one, which works to my years, but there is still plenty of guitar to be found as well. Bottom line, I really enjoy this album and glad that I finally gave Mr. White a chance.","overall":5,"summary":"Jack White - I Finally Get It","unixReviewTime":1393372800,"reviewTime":"02 26, 2014"}

{"orig_index":62373,"reviewerID":"A2E5GLJPQAMOBS","asin":"B008AU7F3C","reviewerName":"Jack Tripper","helpful":[24,25],"reviewText":"I must admit that this album, Bat For Lashes' third, took me by complete and butter surprise. While I'm normally drawn to more guitar-driven music, I am somewhat familiar with her past work, having enjoyed the occasional song featured on music blogs and such. But nothing could have prepared me for the flush soundscapes, exquisite vocals, and evocative, moving lyrics spread throughout 'The Haunted Man.' If you were to combine all of the best attributes from PJ Harvey, The Cocteau Twins, Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, Portishead, Kate Bush, and Cat Power, you might get a general idea of the musical artistry to be discovered on this album. It may seem somewhat sexist to do so, but it's hard not to compare Bat For Lashes' work there to those other groundbreaking, (mostly) female artists because, although Natasha Khan definitely scarves her own path, she continues the tradition of uniquely talented women pushing the envelope, musically and lyrically, to create her own brand of genuine, introspective, blissful-yet-dramatic part-pop, much like the aforementioned artists. A perfect example is \"Lilies,\" which opens the album on an atmospheric, serene note, with angelic vocals over a swirling arrangement of synthesizers, strings, horns, and pounding bass that totally envelops the listener. When, at the send, she belts, \"Thank God I'm alive,\" it's nearly overwhelming. And that's just the opener. The exhilarating, freeing sound of \"All Your Gold\" is actually quite heartbreaking lyrically--concerning a woman's \"good man,\" who she can't commit to wholeheartedly due to her strong, lingering feelings for a past love--which creates some conflicting emotions within the listener, resulting in a unique and powerful listen. The synth-dominated, gorgeously-sung majestic beauty of \"Oh Yeah\" was impossible for me to keep from animatedly (and ridiculously) bobbing my head to it's slow-thumping, stuttering beats while driving last night, but the centrepiece of the album, for me, is undoubtedly \"Laura,\" a devastatingly beautiful, no-frills piano-laden ballad. It might be the least progressive, most traditional singer-songwriter type of song there, yet the sparsely arranged production--with only a gentle horn accompanying the piano--allows the listener to focus on the soul-stirring (and again brilliantly sung) lyrics, creating the perfect atmosphere to forget everything and close oneself in for a few minutes.\"Winter Fields\" contains some pretty impressive dream-like lyrical imagery, such as \"In sub-zero, I can't stand still, color of absence flooding the hills,\" turning Natasha's emotions into visually clear musical paintings in the listener's mind, and, combined with the rich, dense synths and gentle woodwind over a hypnotic, propulsive beat, creates a feeling that can only be described as euphoric. \"A Wall\" is probably the most instantly catchy song on the album, with a huge chorus that players intertwining vocals and synths, with lyrics--\"When you see a wall, I see a door. \"--that, again, are extremely uplifting when combined with the soaring music. The album ends, much like it began, on an eerie, atmospheric note with \"Deep Sea Diver,\" which contains some haunting vocals over an almost scary curlicue piano-riff, ominous bass, and trip-hop beats, capping off fifty-two near-perfect minutes of some of the most stunning and sublime songs in modern pop music. It did take a few listens for me to break through the the (at times) \"icy\" exterior, but if Bat For Lashes' previous albums are even half as powerful and moving as 'The Haunted Man,' then she has definitely found herself a new fan. Fan as in \"short for fanatic.\" And I have a feeling there will be more than a handful of fellow new fanatics coming forward in the next few weeks. I'm just glad I've finally given her music my undivided attention, and I for one can't wait to hear where she goes from there. Good thing I have two more new-to-me albums to keep me occupied in the meantime.{P. S. I'm really peeved I did't get the memo concerning auditions for a \"bony male, to be hoisted over a naked Natasha's shoulders.\" Kidding. OK I'm not.}","overall":5,"summary":"Natasha Kahn's back with a stunningly gorgeous album of love and loves lost","unixReviewTime":1350864000,"reviewTime":"10 22, 2012"}

Totally charming and delightful from start to finish, with great a capella singing throughout. It is hard to believe but Anna Kendrick has scored a Billboard Hot one hundred top ten hit with \"Cups (Pitch Perfect's \"When I'm Gone\")\", the expanded version of the original song, and when I say \"expanded\", I don't just mean in length (the song now is a little over two min.), as the song was also remixed and instrumentation was added.\"Cups (Movie Version\" (one'seventeen\") is, on the other hand, the ORIGINAL song as we see it performed in the movie. That means several things: first, this is a short song, as it was intended all along. Second, this is Anna Kendrick singing a capella, without any further instrumentation added, again as it was intended all along. I love this song, to be honest. Whether anyone buys this original version, for the remixed\/extended version is up to you of course. Simply be aware of the differences in the two versions, as it appears some people there have bought the original version thinking they are buying the song they have heard on the radio. Not the case. \"Cups (Movie Version)\" is the ORIGINAL but short and a capella version. I personally happen to like the original version much better, but that's just me. Buyer beware!","overall":4,"summary":"This is the ORIGINAL 'Cups\" vs. the expanded Cups (Pitch Perfect's \"When I'm Gone\")","unixReviewTime":1375488000,"reviewTime":"08 3, 2013"}

It is not heavy metal for some type of doomsday message, as one might expect from the cover part. Instead, it's a personal protest song, and it's almost as if writing the song served as some type of therapy for the song writer. The story behind the song is a man's bitterness towards this sex, and the object of this obsession. He sings: \"I never want to see you die, but I never want to see you satisfied.\"The irony is that the is the one who is unsatisfied. The danger, rage and hatred in the words and the voice, set against the softly strummed acoustic guitar, create very mixed messages. Additionally, the melody is soft in some places seemingly at odds with the words in those parts. Maybe that mixed message is the point. The song simply seems to black direction. There is a part towards the send where the literally screams in danger, and then the returns to singing normally until the song trails off. It's strange. Maybe the's trying to sound wistful? If the is, it does't really work.

Apparently Tegan and Sara have been around since the ninety's. Didn't know that. I'd heard OF them but I'd never really HEARD them. But let's dispense with the usual summary\/description\/analysis stuff and simply say a few words in favor of this record in the hope that you'll decide to hear it for yourself:I was working on another review of a more serious sounding and self-important indie rock release, and although the record was pretty good, I was having trouble focusing. I decided to take a break and try Tegan and Sara's new dance pop record HEARTTHROB instead. Bingo. Suddenly listening to music was fun again and I did't have to work so hard to like what I was hearing. If some albums are like eating your vegetables and some albums are like eating your fruit, then I would say HEARTTHROB is a nice juicy peach.

{"orig_index":63419,"reviewerID":"A277CZ3P20LH74","asin":"B00AIFTHFG","reviewerName":"Brian E.","helpful":[4,6],"reviewText":"It's no secret that Radiohead brainchild Thom Yorke has been mesmerized with electronic music since the two thousand release of Kid A, but this efforts to refine the sound has provided one of music's more intriguing storyline over the years. This time the's got some new guys around him -- the principals being Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, former R. E. M. drummer Joey Waronker, and producer Nigel Goodrich, best known for this work with Radiohead. It's not hard to see who the dominant influence is. Amok has already drawn a smattering of comparisons with Thom Yorke's two thousand and six solo album The Eraser, and for good reason. The key differences are that Amok is much heavier on analog elements, features a much more spastic and diverse rhythm section, and also showcases the fact that Yorke has made many strides in production and arrangement of composition since then. Many of the synths that come in over the top are pure sex for your years, table to dominate songs in ways they never had been before. A great example is \"Inguene,\" which opens with one of the album's thickest synth patterns. It sounds like something from Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children, while projecting a serious sense of groove and swagger. Meanwhile, opener \"Before Your Very Eyes\" dazzles the year with its pulsing synths, while introducing more and more players as it goes on. Not to be outdone, lead single \"Default\" opens with an infectious rhythm, leading into one of the most blissful pure electro-pop songs on the album. Of course, one of the key areas where Amok stands apart is in its sense of groove and swagger. Songs like \"Dropped\" and \"Stuck Together Pieces\" have prominent, well defined basslines, but \"Reverse Running\" is the only song that approaches the gold standard rhythm awesomeness of \"Lotus Flower\" from the previous Radiohead album King of Limbs. With its warm, open bass tones, oriental inspired guitar lead, and Yorke's spiralling vocals, it's an easy standout. The title track and album closer is easily Amok's most unique song. Its ghostly and ephemeral opening sets the scene for Yorke's fleeting phantasmal images. It showcases an uncanny knack for progression with a shimmering keyboard riff coming in near the send, all structured around one of the album's best basslines. In comparison with King of Limbs, Amok is much more straightforward and less meandering, but not as deep. In general, the meat of the album is laid on the surface of most songs. This makes it more accessible than the last couple Radiohead albums, but leaving less to discover on repeat listens. In addition, it does't do much to push forward the sound that Yorke and this various companions have developed via various side projects over the years, expect that the now has the best bass player behind him the's probably never had. Yet despite some flaws, it is still a well thought out and well composed composed electronic pop album that delivers large doses of sensuality while also being capable of conveying a downcast and detached vibe. In short, it's a great dish for anyone craving more of Yorke's patented sense of rhythm and style.","overall":4,"summary":"Atoms for Peace gives Thom Yorke chance for one more encore","unixReviewTime":1361836800,"reviewTime":"02 26, 2013"}
