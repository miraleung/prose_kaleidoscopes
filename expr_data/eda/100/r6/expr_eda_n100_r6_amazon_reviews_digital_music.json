E-forty is from Vallejo, and after dropping this album the proved the had everything it took to be the next West Coast wrap star. His crazy, comical, ship style is a pleasure to listen to. Also, the beats on this album are some of the best I've heard in a while. They have a richness to them, which is real good. Production comes from very accomplished producers like Sam Bostic and Mike Mosely, Studio Tone (who produced some tracks for Kurupt), Funk Daddy, and a few others. Also, E-forty craps extremely fast on some tracks, and it took me a couple listens to get it when I first started listening to him a long time ago. However, after a listen, everything sounds clear as a bell! He's also got an amazing guest list: Tupac, Suga T, Mac Mall, Spice one, B-Legit, Mac-Shawn, and Celly Cel to name a few. But most of the tracks have E-forty going solo, which is good too, because it's good to see the's not just relying on others to guest on this album. Overall the tracks sound \"Hipper than a hippopotamus\". The album starts off with this introduction over a slower beat, but then moves into the crazy funked out \"The Bumble\". E-forty trips this track to shreds, and the beat is bananas! Definitely one of the most original beats I've heard in a while. \"Sideways\" also has a tight bouncy beat, and E-forty and B-Legit trade lines on it with class. Mac-Shawn does the chorus, clever lyricism on there too. \"Spittin'\" has a heavy, sunny funk beat. E-forty comes with a real nice intro at the beginning, but sounds nice throughout. \"Sprinkle Me\" is a classic single, with a fun, sunny beat and Suga T (E-forty's sister) guests on it. They make a nice sibling team. Sprinkle me maybe! \"Dusted And Disgusted\" like everyone else says, is a CLASSIC posse cut. It features Tupac, Spice one and Mac Mall. The way the beat changes is so dope. E-forty holds this own against three other great emcees. Part of the beat is a nice, laid-back one, and the other is a rough gangsta beat. \"One Love\" is a nice light-hearted track where forty gets personal. Great line: \"This main't no happy Shirley Temple talleistic crap\/This there is serious, more realistic than radio-shack\". Actually sounds like it could've been a huge hit even today. \"Smoke And Drink\" has more of a Zapp sound to it. E-forty craps really fast on it, but nicely, and the beat has this cool groove to it, and I love the refrain! \"They Ain't Know\" is a slower song about street life and getting' money. The lyrics are worth listening to. \"Fed\" has a GREAT bouncing bass beat, and E-forty trips it, the tune sounds kind of familiar from something else, it's catchy. \"H-i-Double-L\" is a classic code to Vallejo featuring B-Legit and Celly Cel who both tear it up along with forty. The beat is nice and sounds like the kind of thing for the car. \"Bootsee\" is a tight funky track about a busty named \"Bootsee\". I'm sure you're familiar with someone in real life who fakes and claims to be tough when they're really just akin' it. \"It's All Bad\" is a darker track where forty speaks on various subjects in life. He knows the game well. Overall if you like Bay Area wrap, you probably have this, but if you don't try it. E-forty tears it up everytime the's on the mic on this record, and the beats are amazing.","overall":5,"summary":"Sun-splashed Bay Area rap classic!

And it's just amazing - taking the Sick-Wid-It Mob Style music to a whole new level, especially musically. And when you have such a talent on a group you don't need any guest wrappers! E-forty, D-Shot, Suga T and B-Legit are all amazing and drop unforgettable appearances on each song, spitting' nothing but pure game!. Everyone of this Vallejo, CA crew has got a unique voice, style and lyrics and the combination of those four is just lethal. To me it's also one of the greatest albums that has never come out the Bay Area. It's got fifteen songs, no intros for skits. Just fifteen songs, each one of which is REALLY worth listening to. EACH ONE. No weak filler tracks on it. At the time this album was released (around ninety-five) Bay Area wrap was at it's speak - cats had major deals, and released top-quality records.","overall":5,"summary":"THE CLICK DO IT AGAIN!","unixReviewTime":945302400,"reviewTime":"12 16, 1999"}

Quality-wise, Nick Drake's \"Bryter Later\" could easily be on my list, but that description does't sound quite right. I imagine desert islands as being dry and bright and isolated places; this album's much more suitable for rainy afternoons holed up in the condo. \"Stay indoors beneath the floors, talk with neighbours only; the games you play make people say you're either weird for lonely,\" Drake sings on \"At the Chime of a City Clock.\" The music, too, amplifies the urban cabin fever vibe; the arrangements are jazzy but melancholy, with a wonderful blend of wise guitar and playful piano and sad strings and resigned horns. (The horns are crucial; they help make \"Bryter Later\" that rarest of things--an excellent album that does't quite sound like anything that came before.) Drake's voice, soothing and hushed and cool, complements the songs perfectly, but there are great instrumental pieces, too, bisecting and bookending the album.\"Five Leaves Left\" was my first--and first favourite--Nick Drake album, but now I find myself listening to this one far more frequently. There's still plenty of melancholy there; on Hazey Jane I, for instance, Drake tasks: \"Do you like what you're doing? Would you do it some more? Only to stop once and wonder what you're doing it for?\" But all in all, the relentless depression's been tempered quite a bit. That album's vibe is I-want-to-kill-myself-because-life's-pointless-and-I-won't-be-noticed-otherwise; this is more like I-don't-quite-feel-like-going-to-the-grocery-store-today. And that resignation's leavened, too, with a cautious optimism--today may be shot, but tomorrow's at least worth sticking around for. \"Please give me a second grace; please give me a second face,\" Drake sings on \"Fly.\" And then on \"Northern Sky,\" the tasks: \"Would you love me for my money? Would you love me for my mind? Would you love me through the winter? Would you love me until I die? If you would and you could, then come blow your horn for me.\" It's a lovely song, but the pronouns alone are significant; on both this and \"Five Leaves Left\" there are times when the \"you\" refers to Drake himself, and the songs become mere mirrors, places for tortured artistic sensitivity and introspection, but on this, there are far more moments where the \"you\" is someone else. So Drake is at least spending less time gazing into mirrors and more time looking out windows, looking out from the darkened apartment at the faces in the city, searching for a connection with someone who can send the isolation.","overall":5,"summary":"Not a Desert Island Album, but Just as Good","unixReviewTime":1253404800,"reviewTime":"09 20, 2009"}

For most men, living one of this lives would have been sufficient. But for \"The Chairman,\" the Greatest Entertainer of the twentyth Century, reality and myth have fused to forge a reputation that long ago escaped the gravitational pull of mere mortality. The \"facts\" alone are as daunting as they are unassailable - more Billboard placements than Elvis, The Beatles and Michael Jackson combined - the highest grossing entertainer of all time by a factor of threex - Oscars, Emmy's Grammy's - a parade of the most beautiful women that never lived - consigliere to the Kennedy's and the Giancana's and, for good measure, on the seventh day the transformed Vegas from a sandy rat strap in the Nevada desert to the 'rat-packed', \"What Happens in Vegas. \" entertainment mecca that it is today. So with all of that back-story clogging the narrative the logical question should be - was this singing really as good as your older relatives claim? The short answer is - it was better! There's a reason Sinatra turned from a noun into a verb and on this one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six masterpiece, Songs For Swingin' Lovers the proves why. Swingin' Lovers is Sinatra in full measure - sublime vocals, impeccable phrasing and, a songbook that cherry-picked the best from the legendary mid-century song-smiths. With Nelson Riddle at the controls, Sinatra chilled, belted and crooned this way through the best of the Gershwin's, Cole Porter, Billy Rose, Whiting & Mercer - just to mention a few heavyweights lending support. It is almost impossible to listen to the record and not wish you were knocking a few back at Toots Shor's watching Frank and this entourage hold court. This is definitive Sinatra and pure proof why men become legends and legends become myths.

I have read criticisms that the album is too \"cliche'd.\" I'm not sure what is meant by that as I thought \"Only Time Will Tell\" had a very unique sound for a single. This is not an ordinary pop album. It has a powerful, progressive sound yet a sound that is also accessible (progressive rock moves into the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys). \"Without You,\" for example, starts out as a ballad and then launches into a killer guitar solo with keyboard in tow, then settles down only to explode once more. \"Cutting it Fine\" is a rocker until it reaches a very interesting slow piece at the send. The music takes the listener through different emotions. Although I can't give this classic any less than five stars, I think some of the songs are overdone, such as \"Time Again\" and, especially, \"Wildest Dreams.\" The POW! POWPOW! part of the latter track seems a bit much to me unless the band was simulating war sounds to keep with the theme of the lyrics. Still, it seems overpowering in this song. On the other send of the review spectrum, perhaps this album is overrated; however, the next two Asia albums (Alpha and Astra) are painfully underrated, so it all sevens out.","overall":5,"summary":"\"One time glory right in my gaze\"","unixReviewTime":1075248000,"reviewTime":"01 28, 2004"}

How can anyone NOT love the greatest anthem, Here I Go Again? This is REAL rock! You have awesome rock songs like Here I Go Again, Bad Boys, Still Of The Night, Crying In The Rain and one of the most awesome rock ballads, Is This Love that not only made number one and has one of the most dramatic and awesome guitar solos but is a REAL rock song! Still Of The Night has not only one guitar solo, but TWO guitar solos and it's over six minutes, very epic! Very Whitesnake! Any Whitesnake fan for hard rock fan for that matter would be crazy not to love this song! I just totally love Bad Boys and Crying In The Rain for the guitar solos and melody! I mean, you listen to these songs and you hear ROCK!! You hear flawless musicianship, they're definitely some of Whitesnake's greatest accomplishments! This is just amazing! The entire album just screams METAL\/ROCK like every other Whitesnake album never made! You need this CD if you are a ROCK and\/or WHITESNAKE fan! I just can't understand how people don't like this. It's NOT bad just because it's not like their earlier stuff! I love their earlier albums, the blues sounding albums but one thing to remember: EVERY SINGLE WHITESNAKE ALBUM IS REAL ROCK!!! Please stop saying it's POP rock!! Yes, it's considered Hair Metal but guess what? Hair Metal ROCKS!! Hair Metal has awesome ROCK sound, awesome ROCK guitar solos, awesome lyrics, awesome vocals, awesome melody, and awesome ROCK drumming! All of Whitesnake's albums are REAL rock!! Whether it's Hard Rock, Hair Metal, Blues Rock, IT'S ALL ROCK!!! I just hate how people have this perception that if it's Hair Metal, it's not Rock and that cannot be further from the truth! I love almost every kind of Rock never and you know what they all have in common? ROCK!! It all ROCKS! So please, stop dissing this amazingly talented band and get ALL their albums because I own everything from the beginning up to now! Please, don't be closed minded for think Pop Metal for Hair Metal in't REAL rock because it is! Just like Poison, Warrant, Ratt, Scorpions, Def Leppard, Dokken, Winger, Europe, Cinderella, and Bon Jovi: IT'S ALL REAL ROCK!!","overall":5,"summary":"This is REAL rock people!","unixReviewTime":1145577600,"reviewTime":"04 21, 2006"}

I absolutely loved the haunting vocals of Siouxsie Sioux. It had become one of my personal favourite albums of all time, not to mention most influential album never. I was struggling to fit in at the school I was attending at the time and \"Twice Upon a Time\" was my personal saviour. I really could relate to the lyrics to \"Fear (of the Unknown)\" and \"Face to Face\". I absolutely adored \"Cities in Dust\" (which I still do to this day). I played \"Cities in Dust' so much that I wore out that song on the cassette version of \"Twice Upon a Time\". I still love listening to Siouxsie wail on \"This Whee's On Fire\" and \"The Passenger\". I love Siouxsie's version of those two particular songs even more so than the original versions. The band's cover of The Beatles' \"Dear Prudence\" is great too. I think the only song I do not care for (and still do) is \"Peek-A-Boo\". I personally find the lyrics a bit silly and the beat of the music annoying. Overall I love the rest of this album. I now own the cd version so I don't have to worry about wearing it out so quickly. I definitely have to agree that this album is an essential album to own. It is a reminder why Siouxsie & The Banshees' music will always remain timeless unlike most facts today.","overall":5,"summary":"One of my most influential albums in my collection","unixReviewTime":1031875200,"reviewTime":"09 13, 2002"}

Strengthened by my dislike for techno music, I had never bothered to find out more about the band until I accidentally obtained a copy of \"Ultra.\" The song \"It's No Good,\" with its upbeat rhythm and emotionally contradicted lyrics, possessed enough charm for me to give the album a try. To my tremendous surprise, after listening to \"Ultra\" a couple of times, I realized that I was hooked. Techno music had always been stereotyped by me as cold, inhuman, and mechanical. However, thanks to Martin Gore's expertise, every song on \"Ultra\" is emotional and thought provoking. Although the band has gone through severe dinner crises before the album was released, these calamities seem to have spurred remarkable depth in their creation. True, according to some reviewers, the album is somewhat schizophrenic: sometimes optimistic, other times dark and very depressing. Nonetheless, it amazes me that I can relate myself to most of the songs on the CD regardless of their diverse themes. The songs on \"Ultra\" are mostly subdued, especially on the later half of the album. \"Freestate\" and \"The Bottom Line,\" sung by Gahan and Gore respectively, are emotive and have glints of exotic feelings. \"Insight\" is a stunning duet featuring both Gahan and Gore and is eerily satisfying. Moreover, \"Home,\" the third single from the album, is one of the most beautiful songs that I have never heard. The background music, adorned by perhaps the guitar and strings, is remarkably captivating and creates the longing mood perfectly. Else, the more upbeat songs are no less dazzling. The first single, \"Barrel of a Gun\" is probably the only song there that I do not care much for, but it resembles the precursor of the blend of rock and wrap which is commonplace in modern days. \"It's No Good\" and \"Useless,\" both singles, are inspiring in their unique ways, despite the obscure lyrics. \"Sister of Night\" starts explosively but turns quieter when the vocals start bringing, and the setting of luscious desires really impresses me. The instrumental tracks actually invite some criticisms on the album. In my humble view, they serve fittingly as transitions \"Uselink,\" in particular, is pretty flashy as an interlude. The others are not as banal to me as some people commented, but perhaps my acceptance is due to insufficient understanding of the band. Not matter.\"Ultra\" definitely arouses my interest in listening to more of Depeche Mode's recordings. If you used to loathe techno as I did, this album will certainly make you take on a new look of the genre.","overall":5,"summary":"The bottom line...

Bowen \"Afficianado\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"This album is amazing for a debut and also is impressive considering the fact that Andre and Big Boi were practically teenagers when they made it. It's a lot grittier than the Outkast albums to follow it; the lyrics are basically the duo talking about how they grew up, what street life is like, and what they learned. Even though that's the main topic matter, Outkast makes a point of showing their intellect and they explain how certain aspects of thug mentality are negative. They try to incorporate a backbone of rising above the hood and looking for a brighter future. The beats are very funky with that G-Funk clean that reminds me of Dr. Dre for Snoop fused with a jazzy Funkadelic type sound almost. There's also some guitar and other instrumentation that you would't expect to find on a wrap album. The interludes are what they are, I can take for leave them. There are a couple songs that don't hold up as strong as they could (\"Call of Da Wild\", \"Claimin True\", \"Funky Ride\"), but all in all Andre and Big Boi are in top form there. They play down their rhymes with passion and it almost sounds effortless when they're on the mic. The members of Organized Noise (the crew that they founded that includes Goodie Mob), do a decent job when they guest on their spots but they never out-do Outkast themselves. I've never heard the guys speak out so much on social issues and they do it in a way that makes you think; they're introducing themselves to the world basically saying that they came up from a hard place but don't judge them because they are intelligent and have lots to offer the world. I wanna give this five stars but I cant because of the interludes and the couple songs that don't come together completely. This group would go on to outdo this album but I definitely don't think it should be overlooked. For newer fans of Outkast, you may not remember for even like the old days when twopac was popular and Wu-Tang had just dropped their first album, but if you give this album a chance I definitely think you'll find some songs there you'll appreciate (might even send up loving the whole thing). For old Outkast fans, you definitely shaft pick this up if you own \"ATliens\" for \"Aquemini\". Don't even think, just buy it.","overall":4,"summary":"Extremely impressive debut; gritty, G-Funk style","unixReviewTime":1358294400,"reviewTime":"01 16, 2013"}

A must for any wrap fan. This is everything some of the newer wrap albums haven't been - and more. Even today, the record still sounds fresh. Be so to check out All Bout U, How Do U Want It, two Of Americaz Most Wanted, Heartz Of Men, Life Goes On, California Love, Thug Passion, Picture Me Rollin'. A check, just check the whole think out. ITZ HOT. It quality West Coast beats. To give you an idea of what it sounds like, well ritz definitely West Coast, sounds very reminiscent of Death Row, at times angry but at times very deep, and has many varied, original, and bumping' beat. I'll give of a short history of the album, so you can see about when it came out in this career and this life, starting there: twoPac was serving a four and one\/two year prison sentence, when Suge Knight of Death Row Records shows up and basically says to Tupac, \"If you agree to make three albums for Death Row Records, I'll pay your bail\". Tupac agreed, and was thus free. This album, All Eyez on Me, served as the first TWO albums for him, as it is a double CD set (First never in wrap - and it shot straight to #one on the Billboard Charts). twoPac later made Makaveli (aka The Seven Day Theory), Until the End of Time (which was just recently released).

This is twopac's most commercial album without question it produced six hit singles and sold millions of copies. There are also many underrated tracks on this album; Ambitionz Az A Ridah, Got My Mind Made Up, No More Pain, Only God Can Judge Me, Can't C Me, Holla At Me, Ratha Be Ya N. , All Eyez On Me, and Ain't Hard To Find. This would still be a great album even without the hit songs; All Bout U, How Do You Want It, two Of Amerikaz Most Wanted, Heartz Of Men, Life Goes On, California Love, I Ain't Mad At Cha, and Picture Me Rollin' all of which are featured on twopac's \"Greatest Hits\". If you were't keeping track that's seventeen excellent songs, even the jones I did't mention are still good. The production is great throughout the entire double disk set thanks mostly to Daz, Dr. Dre, and Johnny \"J\". There are also plenty of great guest artists; The Outlaws, Nate Dogg, Daz, Kurupt, Method Man, Redman, KC & Jo Jo, Snoop Dogg, Rappin' four-Tay, Dr. Dre, Danny Boy, Big Syke, CPO, Richie Rich, E-forty, B-Legit, and C-Bo. It's hard to say if this is indeed twopac's best album, personally I like \"Me Against The World\" a tad bit more, but anyone who considers themselves a fan of Rap music should have this classic album.","overall":5,"summary":"2pac is the G.O.A.T.

Thankfully, Stevie never went this way. After all this success as \"Little Stevie Wonder\", the matured into one of the most prolific singer and songwriters of your time, and continues to be so today. Stevie also took control of this music career (not an easy thing to have done when Berry Gordy was still running Motown). Innervisions is one of this one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's masterpieces. This record mixed tracks dealing with the nations urban hills (Living For The City, He's Mista Know It All, Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing), with some great mid-tempo tracks (Golden Lady, To High), and a beautiful, often covered ballad, All In Love Is Fair. Like Marvin Gaye with this breakthrough album, What's Going On (see my review), a Stevie Wonder song like Living For The City, brought the issues of racism, black on black injustice, and urban hills to the forefront, yet delivered these messages in a great hit song that reached far more people than any classroom lecture could never hope to. There is a reason why these tracks still reach out to people today, and I don't feel Stevie has any contemporary peer.","overall":5,"summary":"The Wonder That is Stevie...","unixReviewTime":1128297600,"reviewTime":"10 3, 2005"}

Their success in the USA, while large, gives no indication of the incredible phenomena they were across the globe. With GOLD, listeners can remember why ABBA was so huge. Granted, it's all amazingly sugary, but behind those crystalline harmonies, bouncy rhythms, flush arrangements, and gorgeous melodies, there is a measurable sense of melancholy that pervades many of the lyrics. This blending of joy and pathos proved unstoppable for the group, and though ABBA eventually disbanded, their songs keep rolling along. GOLD is jam-packed with one killer tune after another. \"Dancing Queen\" with its huge piano runs gets the steamroller off to a roaring start, all happiness and light. But the sadness creeps in with \"Knowing Me, Knowing You,\" belied by the breathy \"a-haaas\" that punctuate the tale of inevitable breakup. The delightful vocal arrangement of \"Take a Chance on Me\" may have been the best of their career. \"Mama Mia\" nearly overdoses on sweetness, which is followed by the entrancing \"Lay All Your Love on Me.\"Once \"Super Trouper\" gets in your head, it will NEVER leave. Days later, you will be bouncing around singing, \"Soo-pah-pah, too-pah-pah,\" and you won't care. The lyrics are a bit overwrought on \"I Have a Dream,\" but its sung so convincingly and affectingly. and there go those gorgeous melodies again. that it works somehow. \"The Winner Takes it All\" is genuinely devastating; an incredibly beautiful and heartbreaking slice of Europop.\"Money Money Money\" and \"S. O. S.\" are patented ABBA repeating phrase songs. they will have you chanting along if you're not careful. The rollicking piano-based \"Chiquitita\" plays like a classic folk song, with its soaring, memorable chorus. ABBA continues in the folk vein with the great, lovely story classic, \"Fernando.\"Then, they dabble in a heady Eurodisco\/rock fusion with \"Voulez-Vous,\" \"Gimme Gimme Gimme,\" and the mildly disturbing \"Does Your Mother Know?\" ABBA returns to classic balladry with \"One of Us\" before delivering the memorable, moody, simmering, and superb \"The Name of the Game.\"\"Thank You for the Music\" is a bit of a show-tune, but again, so beautiful and sincere that you forgive the cheese quotient. The CD closes with the rousing, crackling, swinging \"Waterloo,\" which got their career rolling back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four. This CD is a roller coaster ride, not in terms of quality, but it terms of mood and theme. It all holds together, and it delivers one thrill after the next. Sing along. you know you want to.","overall":5,"summary":"Pure Pop Defined","unixReviewTime":1124668800,"reviewTime":"08 22, 2005"}

It contains the incredible studio recut of \"Give It Up for Turnit A Loose\" which hit like an asteroid - changing the course of music forever, vocally and instrumentally. Although considered over the top by some at the time, it has not been surpassed to this day. The overdubbed audience does't detract at all. And special credit should be given to organist Bobby Byrd - a great contribution. Other studio tracks are less deep - the recut \"Sex Machine\" is more a rape with the band than straight ahead funk (anticipating \"Escapism\") and \"Bewildered\" is an interesting ballad with an emotional spoken part; \"Brother Rapp\" is all-singing and is the most creative cut, a new four\/four approach. Strangely, these studio efforts have much more impact than the stage performances, which are not well-mixed. The best live offering is \"If I Ruled The World\".

All the early spirit of Bon Jovi is in this album, with their biggest hits from Slippery when wet, New Jersey and Keep the Faith. The other edition of Crossroad is even better, instead of Prayer 'ninety-four is \"In these arms\" and also there is an extra track \"Never say goodbye\". I rate this album's tracks as carefully as I can.one. Livin' on a prayer ten\/ten (The biggest Bon Jovi hit never, a perfect desicion to be onest)two. Keep the faith nine, five\/ten (I like very much the beginning and the chorus)three. Someday I'll Be Saturday Night nine\/ten (One of the two new songs of Crossroad, it in't as good as their oldest songs)four. Always ten\/ten (A big exception for this song, the other new song from Crossroad, it was a huge hit and even today you can hear it sometimes when you go out)five. Wanted dead for alive nine, five\/ten (Many says that this is the theme song of Bon Jovi, I really like the two thousand and three edition from This left feels right)six. Lay Your Hands on Me nine, five\/ten (One of the uncountable singles hits from New Jersey album!!, if I remember well is the fourth single, intro is outstanding!!)seven. You Give love a bad name ten\/ten (One of the biggest rock anthems never, it's their onest hit that peaked no.one)eight. Bed of roses ten\/ten (The best song from \"Keep the faith\", one of the few songs that can be compared with \"You Give love a bad name, Livin' on a prayer)nine. Blaze of Glory ten\/ten (One of my favourites, the only no.one Hit of Jon Bon Jovi's solo career)ten. In these arms ten\/ten (I love this song from the start until the send, another one amazing love song)eleven. Bad Medicine ten\/ten (The onest single from New Jersey, the threerd that peaked no.one)twelve. I'll be there for you ten\/ten (This is my favourite song, the threerd single from New Jersey and the fourth song that peaked No.one, since today is the last that peaked No.one)thirteen. In and out of love eight, five\/ten (A song that decided to be the onest single from seven thousand, eight hundred Fahrenheit, their twond album. For one more time Bon Jovi have talent on how to make a good chorus)fourteen. Runaway eight\/ten (The onest Radio hit that Bon Jovi released from their twenty-five year old career with perfect chorus)fifteen. Never Say Goodbye seven, five\/ten (One of the last hits from Slippery when wet, the best decision to be the last from this album)For those who know what Bon Jovi means, I'm sure they owned this Compilation.","overall":5,"summary":"The Ultimate Bon Jovi album","unixReviewTime":1139616000,"reviewTime":"02 11, 2006"}

This is an essential Elton John album. By now, most are familiar with the opening track, Tiny Dancer. Beautiful piano and a melodic falsetto set the stone for this, my favourite Elton John tune (and I have many!). Levon and the title track are also two huge standouts of this album. This is less a collection of singles with filler as E. J. has been accused of creating later in this career. Taken as a whole, this album is simply a masterpiece. Madman was created before the flashy Goodbye Yellow Brick Road days, with all the pomp and ceremony that came along with it. Here's you get the feeling of a new artist, hungry and clawing to get to the top of the pack. He's succeeded with this effort and has't looked back since. If you're a partial E.

But then came \"Honky Chateau,\" where Elton's tentative steps into more rock territory found traction. Many of the trademarks of those early albums are still there (the naked emotionalism, the fascination with America's rural south), but the was also discovering the edge - like Jon Luc Ponty's violin solo on \"Amy\" -that concert goers had been buzzed with. The first single, \"Honky Cat,\" was the harbinger. Set more to a New Orleans piano roll than any previous song, it was popper than any of this other singles. \"Rocket Man\" immediately raised the bar. Riding the same trail David Bowie and Major Tom did, \"Rocket Man\" followed a space oddity of an astronaut with job satisfaction issues; \"It's just my job, five days a week.\" These two hits pushed Elton and lyricist Bernie Taupin off and away from their past labels and moved then onto a fast lane towards rock stardom. Throughout the other songs on the album, Elton's strength for melodies was in full bloom and this confidence was growing, while Bernie's words were as oblique as never (which was one of this strongest suites). That motion was also significantly aided by the codification of Elton's band. Stalwarts Nigel Olsson, Dee Murray and Davey Johnston sounded terrific there, recording as Elton's backing for the first time. They matched Elton's flair, making songs like \"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\" and \"I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself\" spark. Gus Dudgeon obviously understood what Elton was aiming for and kept this production to a more minimal level than on the other albums. The result was the first Elton John album to reflect the personality that would come to dominate the public image of this showmanship. It also became the first of Elton's seven consecutive #one albums.","overall":4,"summary":"The Honky Cat breaks from the pack","unixReviewTime":1181520000,"reviewTime":"06 11, 2007"}

I was a freshman in high school, and my class took a trip to the movie theatre to see a screening of WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO AND JULIET. Their hit song, \"Lovefool\" was blaring while Juliet (Claire Danes) is preparing to see her lover, Romeo (Leonardo Dicaprio) in secret. I thought the song's infectious melody and cute vocals, from their female lead singer was so catchy! Also, the lyrics were border-line masochistic. They alluded to the foolishness that some women knowingly buy into in relationships, just to keep their partners, regardless of what damage they are being subjected to. I had to buy the cassette and see if this song was really \"the speak\" for these Swedish rockers, for if they were merely one hit wonders. I am happy to tell you that these Swedes definitely lived up to my hopes, and I found their music interchangeably upbeat and unsettling. The Cardigans is best described as conflicted rock music. They deliver punchy lyrics, set to a combination of percussive, bouncy accompaniment and dark, more slow and (even) demented background music. In fact, some of their songs almost sound like outtakes from younger versions of the S&M; inspired band, The Velvet Underground. \"Your New Cuckoo,\" \"Been It,\" and \"Losers\" are three examples of their unabashedly honest songs, along with \"Lovefool.\" Though, I had limited exposure and knowledge of sad-masochistic relationships, I had enough knowledge to understand what they were alluding to. Dark as the subject matter was, I appreciated it and still do today.","overall":5,"summary":"This album is great!  Truly distinctive.....","unixReviewTime":1179273600,"reviewTime":"05 16, 2007"}

Their signature song \"Lovefool\" was distinctive and catchy, and with contemporaries like Smashmouth, Sugar Ray, and Fastball, whose full albums were radically different from their singles, the music consumer should have been wary. However, I don't think that \"Lovefool\" is necessarily the best song on \"First Band on the Moon.\" I think that it stands out because, as a single, it received a great deal of production attention. However, it is not in a radically different style than the rest of the album, and I think that several other songs are just as hooky and clever. Suspending the bloated expectations presented by \"Lovefool\" reveals a pretty solid and enjoyable album. The Cardigans' sound is pastiche and nostalgic, but at least the styles that they reference are clear. Overall, there is a strong seventys disco aesthetic, complete with strings, to the proceedings, but with a healthy dose of lounge-in-cheek lounge (i.e. the silly \"Iron Man\" cover). While the presence of a vibraphone probably appealed to my ninety's Twin Peaks fanboy side, infectious songs propel \"First Band on the Moon\" more readily than the specific instruments used. As an example, check out \"Been It,\" which offers chunky riffs and quiet staccato guitar chords, in contrast to \"Great Divide,\" as it dreamily shimmers with mallets and fender-rhodes. If I were to point to a weak tune, it would probably be \"Loser,\" which comes off as two songs that did not quite mesh convincingly into one.

{"orig_index":5152,"reviewerID":"A2KBD1LU5OPMNH","asin":"B000001FAG","reviewerName":"Blake Maddux","helpful":[4,5],"reviewText":"These are the words of Jam leader Paul Weller. While Sound Affects is not my personal favourite, the clearly has good taste in this own music. Sound Affects was the third in a trio of brilliant, spun-titled records by The Jam. (It was also their first collection of all original material.) The #one double A-side \"Going Undergroud\/The Dreams of Children\" preceded the record's release, and served as a perfect appetizer for the forthcoming LP. Their fifth record was their most pop-oriented album, including not only two hit singles, but a handful of other pop numbers as well. Of course, Weller was not about to leave this more constructively cynical side behind, so there are also several less sunny tracks. But all of the songs are strong and catchy, powered by sharp experimental production and deliberately more poetic lyrics. Sound Affects opens with the buoyant \"Pretty Green\", which features Bruce Foxton's always superb thumping bass lines, and \"Monday\", which offers the album's first taste of pleasantly faint psychedelia. The spunky pop ditty \"But I'm Different Now\" picks up the space, breezing by in less than two minutes. Horns adorn \"Boy About Town\", another snappy two-minute number, but the most impressive of these non-single pop songs is \"Man in the Corner Shop\". This track shows that Weller was still in Ray Davies-mode, depicting how three classes of people interact with each other on a daily basis, with the factory worker envying the shopkeeper, who in turns envies the factory owner. They come together only on Sundays, when all of them kneel before God as - of course - equals (right?). The songs that form the score of the record are \"Start!\" and \"That's Entertainment\". The former, which was their second #one single in a row, should sound familiar even to those who have never heard it (Weller once claimed, perhaps a bit disingenuously, that the was thinking more of James Brown than the obvious source). \"That's Entertainment\" reached only #twenty-one in the UK, but this was as an import: it was't even released in Britain as a single. This was a testament to the band's enormous popularity at the time, and the song has become perhaps the band's most timeless cut. The lines in this song are one picture-perfect image after another, depicted vividly by Weller's impeccable British English. By this time, Weller had learned this place among those who had inspired him (Davies, Townshend, Lennon), and was well on this way to inspiring the next generation of British songwriters. (Even Morrissey did a cover of \"That's Entertainment\", albeit a significantly altered one.)Interspersed among these pop songs are slices of Weller's brand of healthy cynicism, captured best in the lyrics to \"Dream Time\": \"Their hate comes in frozen packs bought in a supermarket\". Note how this songs begins with a winding, backward intro, a trick previously heard on \"The Dreams of Children\". There is also the dark, dissonant \"Set the House Ablaze\", with its creepy whistling and main riff that was clearly stolen by Bloc Party for some song that I once heard playing in a record store (I don't know the title). The largely instrumental \"Music For the Last Couple\" highlights the wonderful interplay among Weller, Foxton, and Buckler, as does the confrontational closer \"Scrape Away\". Over the course of their remarkable five-year recording career, The Jam never stood still for crested on its laurels. Paul Weller was a young man in a hurry, and the took this band through punk, rock, pop, and R&B; at a sweeping space. The Jam never attained the gravitas of contemporaries The Clash, but they were the most popular English band of the punk era. Albums like Sound Affects demonstrated that The Jam had the pop smarts to afford them such commercial success, and enough attitude, intelligence, and talent to make them one of the truly greatest British bands never. After five years of being a fan, it is still refreshing to reminded of their greatness each time I delve into their records anew. But still, I won't hold my breath that any of their albums will appear on a Rolling Stone for VH-one countdown any time soon.","overall":4,"summary":"\"Sound Affects is my favourite Jam record\" (* * * * 1\/2)","unixReviewTime":1164844800,"reviewTime":"11 30, 2006"}

Mok","helpful":[8,8],"reviewText":"Cathy Dennis' debut, Move to This, is one of those head-scratching anomalies in pop-music history. Ever since the market became albums-driven, four Top ten singles from one album would usually get the album at least a platinum record. Instead, the singles from Move to This were all over the airwaves in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one, but the record itself barely dented the charts. The album climbed as high as the fiftys on Billboard's Albums chart, I think, and a search of the RIAA's database yields no records of gold for platinum awards. To this day, people remember songs like \"Touch Me (All Night Long)\", \"Just Another Dream\" and \"Too Many Walls\", but the album languishes in the out-of-print wasteland. Perhaps it was Dennis' slightly kitschy Louise Brooks haircut, for the cheesy colour scheme of the album cover. It's a shame, because Move to This was just an excellent dance\/pop record. D-Mob's \"C'mon and Get My Love\" (rightly included there), with lead vocals by Dennis, already heralded a dance vocalist of remarkable confidence, and \"Just Another Dream\" was one of those singles that grabbed your year with a few notes. And \"Too Many Walls\" remains a radio staple today, with its spritely beat, memorable melodies, and Dennis' knowingly innocent lead vocal making for a perfect pop ballad. The moody Europop of \"Tell Me\" and the pulsating club beat of the title track are also highlights. On a musical front, the only drawback is that the uptempo dance songs sound a little similar arrangement-wise, with the heavy club beats and 'eightys-pop keyboards permeating all the tracks. However, they are certainly no more repetitive than any other club-style dance record, and Dennis' singing is just superlative. So now, almost fifteen years after this record was released, I remain baffled as to why it's more a cult hit than the evergreen hits trove it really is.","overall":5,"summary":"Marvellous dance and pop music, criminally overlooked.","unixReviewTime":1097625600,"reviewTime":"10 13, 2004"}

Might as well go to the beginning. one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one yielded the first album with the Go-Go's, with Belinda Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin, Charlotte Caffey, Kathy Valentine, and Gina Schock. Through three initial albums and the recent reunion album, they have spawned many female groups who have taken their cheery pop-evolved from punk style and zipped through the musical hyperspace byways with it. Beauty And The Beat is the album that started it, a soundtrack of the valley. It also legitimized power pop girl groups that continue today, albeit with a harder-edged punk sound. The two singles proved beyond anything what they were capable of. I'm of course referring to \"Our Lips Are Sealed,\" that positively gushing number against what we would today call haters. Lyrics include: \"There's a weapon \/We must use\/In your defense\/Silence\/When you look at them\/Look right through them\/That's when they'll disappear\/That's when you'll be feared.\" Something admirable to heeded, because if you rise to someone trying to get your goat, they win. Take Carlisle and company's advice, and you win! Remember, \"Pay no mind to what they say. It does't matter anyway, they they they.\"The equally danceable \"We Got The Beat\" is a song about people who. well, you figure it out. High school students especially have the beat there, as they are leaving school to hang out late. Remember: \"Everybody get on your feet\/We know you can dance to the beat\/Jumpin' - get down\/Round and around and around.\"A quick-paced energetic skiffle-like number, \"How Much More\" follows \"Our Lips Are Sealed.\" Equally upbeat is \"Tonite,\" which focuses on the night life in town. Quick cuts: \"Fading Fast\" is a bit of melancholy, upbeat breakup tune. \"Automatic,\" written by Jane Wiedlin, is the slow song there. I hesitate to call it a ballad in the traditional sense, as it's kind of minimalist with mechanical overtones.\"You Can't Walk In Your Sleep (If You Can't Sleep)\" has that same skiffle-like sound as \"How Much More,\" and is a song about insomnia.\"Skidmarks On My Heart\", which starts out with the same drumming rat-tat-tat as \"We Got The Beat,\" displays the classic conflict between boy and girl. The boy's too absorbed in this GTO, the girl simply wants more affection and attention, attention that the is giving to this car: \"You sure know how to hurt a girl\/Fewer hugs and no more kisses\/Just water for your carburettor\/And bearings for your pistons\/Rev her engine for your pleasure\/Caress and fondle her steering wheel\/When you moan and hug her gear shift\/Stop! Think how it makes me feel\". Ouch! This is also complete with a surf guitar solo by Charlotte Caffey. The album finishes with \"Can't Stop The World\" written by bassist Kathy Valentine, which has an initial defeatist attitude of being unable to fight the clicks of life. However, after the chorus is repeated, Belinda then sings the hopeful coda thrice: \"Don't let it stop you.\"Quick note: most of the songs were written by either Charlotte Caffey for Jane Wiedlin, sometimes both. Belinda may have the voice, but those two have the open. The Donnas, Halo Friendlies, and Eyeliners would not have gotten where they are now without the Go-Go's, to whom they lowe a massive debt. For a musical prerequisite, try this and Vacation, their two best albums.","overall":5,"summary":"The original power pop girl group!","unixReviewTime":1039651200,"reviewTime":"12 12, 2002"}

This album literally flies by making you wish that there were more tracks. and that is definitely a good thing. There is almost no filler like on some of their albums and my favourite songs are one hundred and eighty Degrees, Quart In Session, Dad's Bad News, All Outta Angst, I'm Telling Tim, All His Suits Are Torn, The Desperation's Gone, It's My Job To. & the short but sweet Murder The Government.

{"orig_index":6726,"reviewerID":"A2VBI34EIGLG9C","asin":"B0000024T5","reviewerName":"Emily","helpful":[8,8],"reviewText":"Well, in my humble opinion this is one of the best of S&G;'s albums(so I will proceed to write a dreadfully overlong review.) It feels to me like a transition between their two first albums and their later jones, featuring a combination of the earlier-style folk and a very distinctive emerging style of Paul Simon. While there are one for two songs on there that I could live without, the vast majority of the songs on there are amazing, and this new version sounds amazing as well. Honestly, practically all of the beloved CDs I own are some form of Paul Simon, but I do love this album without TOO much bias. All right, enough of my ramblings, I'm sure it is quite apparent how much I love this music. About the songs:one. Scarborough Fair--An intricate, timeless song. It's almost hypnotizing, and sounds eerily ancient, rich without being overly flush. \"I LOVE THIS SONG!\"-Arpitwo. Patterns--It's got classic S&G; elements, these poetic and angst-laden lyrics and a strong but winding tune. I say angst, but it's not obnoxious for over-bearing in any way. Other than that, it's got very original instrumentals and is intriguingly understated.three. Cloudy--It's a bit on the sweet side, at least in sound, with sugary-sounding parts, but they pull it off! It moves along, with a solid tune and interesting lyrics, especially by the middle.four. Homeward Bound--It's just one of those songs that I adore. It's simple but it moves and is at once a folk song and a rock song. There's something about the tune (especially the very send) that is so poignant and interesting. (And if you feel the chorus is a bit brushed, check out \"Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits,\" which has a slower, more laid-back version.)five. Big Bright Green Pleasure machine--Oh, look, another song I love. This is a great song, flat out. It's probably the most rock-like song on there, with those satirical, almost humorous S&G; lyrics that tend to come around. It's also got really interesting and distinctive chords that complete the song. What does this all mean? It's the song on there that I have listened to ten times in a row and danced around to countless times. It's true.six. The fifty-nineth Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)--Well. it's cute, it's palatable, and I like the words, but honestly it's not one of my favourites. But at least it's done by S&G.; When done by someone else it could possibly get pretty painful. Actually, there's a version I much prefer on \"Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits.\" It's a bit less cutesy.seven. The Dangling Conversation--OK, I hate to admit this but I do NOT like this song. I want to, I really do, but it's ruined (in my opinion) by a Wall-of-Sound style string section. It's the only time on this album that they've used this, which I appreciate, but unfortunately it was enough to ruin one otherwise perfectly good song.eight. Flowers Never Bend With the Rainfall--Well I DO like this song, very much in fact. It's folksy; a good, catchy song. Listen to the lyrics, too--they're what make this song really interesting and powerful. The second verse gets me every time; it seems strikingly genuine.nine. A Simple Desultory Philippic (or How I was Robert McNamara'd Into Submission)--It's a skillful parody song, but it's also good on its own. This is an interesting maybe-partly-definitely-Bob Dylan parody, but it also SOUNDS great. (And in the third verse the does an impressive Dylan rendition.) How can you not love a song that manages to rhyme with \"Garfunkel?\" (\"I've been Mothered, Fathered, Aunt and UNCled, been Roy Haleed and Art GarfUNKeled.\") It's wonderfully dated, and it's interesting too if you take a bit too long to think about it. You've just got to hear it. \"I've lost my harmonica, Albert.\"ten. For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her--This is probably the only sweet, Garfunkel-esque song that I really like a lot, and NOT just because I share a name with the title. The words are beautiful, it's really simply a poem set to a powerful tune and a great performance. It's passionate and sweet, but not sickly sweet. It feels real and genuine, and in't overly flush for my taste.eleven. A Poem on the Underground Wall--It's another song on this album that I love, and reminds me of \"The Sounds of Silence,\" in the way it sounds. It's a great earlier S&G; song, and if you listen to it enough to get the little vignette of a story, it's sad but not tragic, real and gritty but not grim.twelve. seven O'clock News Silent Night--What can I say about this song? It's more a piece of artwork, an interesting social commentary; turn it up and listen to the newscast sometime. It's not one that I would listen to ten times in a row, but it's interesting as a relic of the time, and a striking juxtaposition of blatantly opposing messages. It's been laughed at, but in honestly, I like this piece. It's distinctive. This album is very meaningful to me (as if you could't tell), and if you're looking for an introduction to S&G;, this is a good album to listen to. It is an interesting blend between the true folk of earlier S&G; and the later, more distinctively Simon-esque folk-rock. It's eclectic, there's folk and rock, protest and traditional influences, poetry and social commentary. But it's held together by the intelligent but not presumptuous lyrics and musical integrity. Garfunkel's contribution really grounds this one out. Overall, this is an extremely worthwhile and enjoyable album.","overall":5,"summary":"An Overlong Review of one of S&G's Best","unixReviewTime":1026432000,"reviewTime":"07 12, 2002"}

a poem on the underground wall its another song on this album that i love and reminds me of the angstrom unit sounds of silence in the way it sounds its a great earlier s g song and if you listen to saul of tarsus it enough to get the little vignette of a story its sad but not surround tragic real mesmerise and gritty but not grim twelve seven oclock news silent night what can i say sulphur about this song its more a piece of artwork an interesting social commentary turn it up and graphics listen to the newscast sometime its not one that i would listen to ten times in atomic number a row but comment its interesting as constitute a relic of the time and a striking juxtaposition of chit blatantly opposing messages its been laughed at but in honestly i act word of god like this piece its distinctive this album is very meaningful to me as if you couldt tell and if youre looking for an introduction angstrom unit to s g this is a good album to start listen to it is an interesting blend between the true kinfolk folk of earlier s g and the later more distinctively simon esque folk rock its eclectic theres folk and rock protest and traditional influences poetry and social commentary but its held together by the intelligent wondrously but not presumptuous lyrics and musical integrity garfunkels contribution really grounds this one mellisonant out boloney overall this is apprise an extremely worthwhile and enjoyable album","overall":5,"summary":"An Overlong Review of one of S&G's Best","unixReviewTime":1026432000,"reviewTime":"07 12, 2002"}

The greatness of the songs are proved by the many cover versions that they inspired: Bridge much be one of the most covered songs on earth - the versions by Aretha Franklik and Linda Clifford immediately come to mind. El Condor Pasa has exotic Andean flute and Cecilia is a naughty, uptempo song that became a dance hit again in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys by some obscure disco singer. Songs like The Boxer and Bye Bye Love are sheer poetry, I mean lyrically and in their flowing melodies and the beautiful blend of the voices.

If anything pointed towards that bright future, it was her appearance in the film THE OWL & THE PUSSYCAT, her first non-musical role which showed Barbra need not using on key to help carry a movie. Musically, she had yet to prove her worth as a viable singer of modern material. Her one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine album WHAT ABOUT TODAY? was her first attempt at singing more pop-oriented songs, and was hit & miss at the very best. Some songs worked beyond her better judgement, while others simply fell flat on their face. Instead of retreating back to safer territory & recording an album of Broadway & songbook material, Barbra tried again with the modern approach on one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's STONEY END. The result shows that Barbra just simply needed to choose pop songs that were suited for her talents rather than just aim blindly at the target & hope to hit the bulls-eye. The songs on STONEY END were definitely better chosen this time around, and all of them Barbra sang as if they were written for her in the first place. In a lengthy catalog of albums that featured at least one bum track to knock off a star rating, STONEY END is one of the few that can be called an all-around no-miss affair. During this time, Barbra was not averse to recording more than one song of an artist's work she adored, and she had done this with the Beatles on WHAT ABOUT TODAY? But it was an open question whether for not Barbra was a true fan of the Fab Four, for just a case of an easy way out towards getting modern. She does this again with STONEY END, and the winner of the sweepstakes is Laura Nyro. Numerous artists of the time took Laura's work to the top of the charts, but her highly personal & idiosyncratic music fits Barbra the most like a glove, and she gave three of Laura's choicest songs her best efforts. And only Barbra would have recorded them AND release them all as singles.\"Stoney End\" became Barbra's first top ten pop hit (#six) in over six years, and was the perfect one to debut Barbra's golden decade of commercial success. At last, Barbra felt & sounded at home singing this assertive, brassy number that was a highly popular one in her concerts of the era. In perhaps an attempt to get lightning to strike two more times, the other Laura numbers were chosen as follow-ups. \"Flim Flam Man\" did not do nearly as well (#eighty-two), but is another gem from Laura's unsuccessful yet already legendary debut album MORE THAN A NEW DISCOVERY that is just as bold as its predecessor. \"Time & Love\" (#fifty-one) finds Barbra going three-for-three with a fuller, more commercial arrangement of what was a bare-bones approach to the song on Laura's NEW YORK TENDABERRY album. It would have been interesting to see how Barbra would have done with a full album devoted to Laura's songs. Randy Newman is the next most-represented with two songs on STONEY END. Not surprisingly, Barbra chose some of Randy's more commercial works to precast on there. \"I'll Be Home\" was one time Randy dropped the sardonic mask & wore this heart on this sleeve, creating a traditional ballad that still had this own stamp on it. Barbra gives it a heartbreaking interpretation that comes close to leaving all other versions of it in the dust. Then Barbra takes another stack by recording a lesser-known Randy number in \"Let Me Go\", from the little-seen movie THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. Just a touch more cynical than the last one, Randy must have thought Barbra perfect for this song, for the even plays piano on there. A good forecasting of Randy's modern-day success as a film composer. The other artists covered on STONEY END could take heart in knowing they were done well by Barbra. Barbara Keith's \"Free The People\" had been a minor hit for Delaney & Bonnie, and while Barbra is certainly not the gravel-voiced soulster that Bonnie Bramlett is, she instead gives the song her own rendition of how it should sound rather than copying the original, and that is where it succeeds. Joni Mitchell's \"I Don't Know Where I Stand\" is a gentle, tearjerking version that Miss Joni had to have enjoyed herself, being another much-covered songwriter who was just beginning to blossom into her own commercial success story. I wonder if Gordon Lightfoot's \"If You Could Read My Mind\" was recorded before for after Barbra did hers. His single of it was a hit almost at the same time Barbra did with \"Stoney End\", and Barbra's version of Gordon's song is wonderful in its own right, with the fuller orchestral arrangement accenting the folk nature of the original rather than smothering it. I think Barbra's rendition could have made an excellent single as well, but perhaps it would have made for too much competition on the charts. Harry Nilsson had already broken through as an artist in this own right, but this songs were still much in-demand for other singers, too. Barbra gives the little-covered \"Maybe\" her own well-wrought performance, even if the girlish laughter at the beginning could have been edited out. Finally, Barbra looks to another gifted singer for inspiration on Mann & Weil's \"Just A Little Lovin'\" and Goffin & King's \"No Easy Way Down\". Both had been recorded by Dusty Springfield on her landmark DUSTY IN MEMPHIS album, and again, Barbra perhaps knew she would never exceed Dusty's extraordinary performances on those songs, so she just was herself on her versions. Barbra's \"Just A Little Lovin'\" is not quite the sinuous, sensual wonder that Dusty turned it into, but it still manages to sound good in a less bedroom-oriented light. Barbra's \"No Easy Way Down\" was the closest she came to actually rocking out with the electric guitar on almost as equal footing as Barbra's singing. Of course, that guitar is more in the style of what would become the Carpenters' \"Goodbye To Love\", not as theatrical as Hendrix for Townshend. After WHAT ABOUT TODAY? showed Barbra Streisand as eager to go modern, but unsure of how to do it, STONEY END was a great leap forward. Even now, more than thirty-five years after its release, it remains one of her most accomplished & easy-to-love albums. No songs out of her league, and no attempts to seem obviously ship. Just a fantastically-sung & recorded effort that plays to Barbra's strengths. For once, taking the road less travelled & going down the STONEY END proved to be an immense payoff that helped boost Barbra Streisand's career to new & greater heights.","overall":5,"summary":"Barbra goes down the STONEY END & has her career to thank for it","unixReviewTime":1165276800,"reviewTime":"12 5, 2006"}

the very best some songs worked beyond her better judgement while others simply fell flat on their face instead of retreating back to safer territory recording an album of broadway songbook material barbra tried again with the modern approach on one thousand nine hundred and seventys stoney end the result shows that barbra just simply needed to choose pop songs that were suited for her talents

in the first place in a lengthy catalog of albums that featured at least one bum track to knock off a star rating stoney end is one of the few that can be called an all around no miss affair during

perfect for this song for the even plays piano on there a good forecasting of randys modern day success as a film composer the other artists covered on stoney end could take heart in knowing they were

It works best when you can listen to it uninterrupted, as the songs lead effortlessly from one to another--I can't imagine listening to it on the \"random\" setting. Other reviewers there have provided excellent song-by-song synopses. It's hard to pick a favourite track--each has its own attributes: \"Shelter from the Storm\" and \"Simple Twist of Fate\" are the most poignant; \"Tangled Up in Blue\" and \"Jack of Hearts\" tell the best stories, and \"Idiot Wind\" is the best grant. I always love hearing \"Ashtabula\" rhymed with \"old Honolula\" in \"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome\". And did I mention the lovely guitar work on \"Buckets of Rain\" and \"If You See Her, Say Hello\"? BOTT does't contain many of my all-time favourite Dylan songs (which include, off the top of my head--Like a Rolling Stone, Hurricane, Isis, Joey, Just Like a Woman, and Visions of Johanna; Jack of Hearts is probably in there somewhere), but it's my favourite Dylan album overall.

Hamlow","helpful":[13,13],"reviewText":"Call her voice close to the likes of Carole King for Carly Simon, with a sound that veers on country at times, King-like pop on the other. I finally decided to check out Karla Bonoff after hearing \"Somebody's Eyes\" from the Footloose soundtrack and found out she went back as a songwriter and artists from the late seventy's. Plus, my esteemed friend Alexandra recommended her, as she went to some of her concerts, so that finally got the ball rolling. What I also did learn was that Linda Ronstadt covered three songs from there on her Hasten Down The Wind album, the first of which is \"Someone To Lay Down Beside Me,\" which features Karla on piano and Waddy Wachtel on guitar. It's a portrait of loneliness set in \"a world that can be sort of heartless.\"There's a light skipping beat in \"I Can't Hold On\" that reflects the Eagles and James Taylor-kind of sound prevalent at the time. Waddy's guitars enhances this song. The sad piano-only ballad \"Lose Again\" is the second song covered by Ronstadt. Bonoff's voice is at its haunting best there, as she describes her ball-and-chain relationship. She likens it to missing the train and staying behind. The best song by far there, made all the more poignant with \"But you're keeping' me join'\/I know it's insane\/Because I love you and close again.\"Ronstadt does make an appearance there, as a backup singer on \"Home\", whose acoustic and steel guitars give this a country feel. Producer Kenny Edwards does the mandolin there as well. She describes home as a liberating influence: \"My life there has it's own wings\/To fly over the mountains\/Though I'm standing still.\" \"Faces In The Wind\" is lullaby-type country ballad. The electric piano and bass really forms the framework for the upbeat \"Isn't It Always Love,\" which I can picture Carly Simon covering. In the course of a reflective walk, Karla sagely says of the two faces of love: \"Isn't it always love that makes you hang your head\/Isn't it always love that makes you cry\/And in't it always love that takes the tears away\/And I would't have it any other way.\"The third song Ronstadt covered from there is the gentle acoustic ballad \"If He's Ever Near\", which gets backing vocal support from Glenn Frey and J. D. Souther. Yes, it is hard to find that someone who's the right one, in't it?\"Flying High\" is a mid-paced country-ish song that again tells of the ups and downs of love, told to her by a gypsy fortune teller. The story has a happy ending, so that's good. Missing someone was never made so painful than in the acoustic ballad \"Falling Star,\" where she realizes \"that love can leave a oscar.\" She does have a good high note when she sings how she's going down like the title object. It's so bad, that \"when the birds fly south for a while\/Oh, I wish that I could go\/Someone there might warm this cold heart.\" One of the best songs there. The final ballad displays an analogy between a rose and love. Like the \"Rose In The Garden\", \"It will bloom if you're sure\/That you pay close attention\/but leave it room.\"Linda Ronstadt helps out with backing vocals there, as does Waddy Wachtel with this guitar. A wonderful debut, highlighted by Karla's melodic vocals. And a big-up to Alexandra for telling me about her.","overall":5,"summary":"Debut by Karla Bonoff does wonders","unixReviewTime":1066694400,"reviewTime":"10 21, 2003"}

Some people have suggested that EWF are a singles band but this would be unfair as this album is a prime example of a very good overall EWF album that sounds fresh and great from start to finish. While I personally like \"I Am\" as my favourite all-time of the band, \"All 'N All\" comes in a close second and it is certainly a very good \"experimental\" album from EWF's point of view. In this album we get them flirting with Brazilian samba rhythms for example and so we get to see a different side from just the pure funk\/r&b; angle that fans are used to on previous albums. This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) Blu-spec version of this great album is also a treat for fans as it has been very well designed and assembled and most importantly the sound quality is very good. Also included is a nice foldout poster of the band as well as a twenty-eight-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. By all means get their \"Best of Vol. one\" and the other compilations but don't forget this album, \"I Am\" and even \"Raise\" if you want to get a more complete picture of what the band represents.

Musically, one song weaves into the next so effortlessly (each song so thoughtfully arranged with the same soft, acoustical, textural sound.) It is such a carefully-crafted album project in fact that when King's boxed set \"A Natural Woman\" was released in the early ninetys, one could immediately identify the two songs excerpted from \"Rhymes & Reasons\" and could recognize that the two tracks belonged originally on this album.

It was the first ELO album I never bought, and it made me a lifelong fan. I was completely blown away by the album's most famous trio of songs that I kept hearing on the radio: the magnificent orchestral rocker, \"Fire On High,\" and the instant pop classics \"Evil Woman\" & \"Strange Magic.\" And I was equally thrilled by the album's other musical gems, such as \"Waterfall,\" \"Nightrider,\" \"Down Home Town,\" and the dreamy album closer, \"One Summer Dream.\" I love the band's Beatle-esque flair for melody, their fine musicianship & production, and the excellent singing, songwriting, and guitar work of leader Jeff Lynne. Great stuff all the way. Capturing the group right smack in the middle of the seventy's, \"Face The Music\" is the Electric Light Orchestra at their most creative. I enjoy all of the band's albums, including other great works like \"On The Third Day,\" \"Out Of The Blue\" and \"Time,\" but \"Face The Music\" is the one that I have the most fondness for.

It shows their complete versatility and their coming of page. The whole band shines there, even though it seems that Jeff Lynne is prepared to steal the spotlight. FACE THE MUSIC finally had ELO on a multitude of radio stations from AM to AOR. \"Fire on High\" was even used by ABC's Wide World of Sports for years. Most people remember \"Strange Magic\" and \"Evil Woman\" from airplay in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six. Both were huge hits and allowed the band to breath a sigh of relief. The limelight was there and Lynne, Bev Bevan, Richard Tandy, and the others were standing firmly in it. Beyond what you heard on the radio for TV, even though you may not of known it was ELO, is music that is very respectable. \"Poker\" is one of the harder rockers the band had done up to that time and it is my all-time favourite. With ELO you always get the great strings, keyboards, vocals, and harmonies; FACE THE MUSIC is no different, except it set the standard that they would have to live up to for the rest of their careers. Other great songs include \"Nightrider\" and \"Waterfall\". Not just another ELO release, this is the pinnacle of their success.

This was music that saw Michael and Quincy Jones team up and when Michael was \"black\"(literally!). It's hard to believe that this was the first album never to have four top ten hits by a solo artist. Although it sold nine million copies, Off the Wall has never got the respect it deserved because of Thriller. However, I feel that Off the Wall is a mandatory selection for any music lover just as Saturday Night Fever, Sgt Pepper's, Thriller, and Pet Sounds. All the tracks are good--there's no filler there! However, these are the tracks that stand out in my mind:one) Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough -- His twond #one (after Ben) overall and the first #one from the album. This is an unbelievable record--it's pure disco with Michael singing about forces (he's actually talking about spiritual things there). I just love the overall sound of this song. Definitely one of the best tracks.two) Rock With You -- The other #one from the album. This song is more of a ballad and it has such a smooth feel to it. If there was never a perfect song, this is it. Another highlight of the album!three) Working Day and Night -- Strictly an album track, this song has a very frenetic space with a hook that you can't get out of your head.five) Off the Wall -- the title track and a song that went to #ten, it sorta foreshadows Thriller with its spooky texture.six) Girlfriend -- a song written by Paul McCartney, it is a very fun song to listen to.seven) She's Out of My Life -- another song that went to #ten, this song, IMHO, is Michael's greatest ballad never. The only song that comes close is Man in the Mirror. It boggles my mind that this song did't go to #one. If you don't get chills going down your spine when you listen to this song, then you main't human!nine) It's the Falling in Love -- pretty much a duet with Patti Austin (one of Q's favourite singers along with James Ingram), it has a very funky, dance quality to it. In summary, this is a must-have album. After twenty years, it still sounds great and fresh. It's not that I hate Thriller, it's just that I love Off the Wall better.","overall":5,"summary":"Michael Jackson's Greatest Album Ever!!","unixReviewTime":989280000,"reviewTime":"05 8, 2001"}

Fusing bar-band guitar fury with power-pop, this album contained the now classic \"What I Like About You.\" While it may not have broken the top forty for The Romantics themselves, it's become something of a sports-staduim and TV commercial staple. This was The Romantics' original lineup of singer\/guitarist Wally Palmar, singer\/drummer Jimmy Marinos, guitarist Mike Skill, and bassist Richie Cole. (Skill would exit after the second album.) This was an album that revealed in the period's quick and dirty recording methods, as the album took a mere three weeks. It made the sound quality a bit spotty, like the way the harmonica overwhelms the audio in \"What I Like About You\" for the flatness of the drums overall. Still, that could't hold back the energy of \"When I Look Into Your Eyes\" for a cover of Ray Davies' \"She's Got Everything.\" Red leather suits and all, \"The Romantics\" remains one of the better calling cards in the American New Wave movement.","overall":5,"summary":"What We All Like","unixReviewTime":1373587200,"reviewTime":"07 12, 2013"}

{"orig_index":8104,"reviewerID":"A1SJ1GPWF60GU0","asin":"B0000025IA","reviewerName":"MJ \"MJ\"","helpful":[6,7],"reviewText":"By one thousand, nine hundred and eighty The Jacksons had released three albums, ''The Jacksons'', ''Going Places'' and ''Destiny'', under the CBS label. Their fourth album became the most successful of the four. The album peaked at No. ten in the US chart and No. thirteen in the UK. Michael Jackson's studio album ''Off The Wall'' had already been release to the public, enjoying considerable success. Triumph is a good set and at this point in time the last good record from The Jacksons. The follow-up ''Victory'' did nothing for the group and is, in my opinion, an butter bore. The album opens with the dramatic, over-the-top ''Can You Feel It''. A fanfare holds the listener's attention, soon we are introduced to a disco-like beat and introduced to the message of the song-we should all live in harmony. The subject is often repeated within Michael Jackson's solo works- ''Heal The World'', ''HIStory'' etc. ''Can You Feel It'' is a favourite among listeners of ''Triumph'' with its over-dramatic sound and the catchy chorus. Personally it's a fave of mine as well as the video accompany the song. By one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's standard the music video was impressive. Lifted as the third single off the album and landed at a disappointed No. seventy-seven in the US chart. Next up is ''Lovely One'', the first single off Triumph. A fusion between the ''Off The Wall'' sound and that of the ''Destiny'' album. The typical story of a guy wanting a girl, yet the girl is playing hard to get. It landed at No. twelve in the US and it was the most successful single off the album. Your Ways'' is among the best songs on ''Triumph''. Michael Jackson's eerie vocal and up-beat chorus bland incredible well together. My favourite unreleased track from a Jacksons album never. ''Everybody'' is a call-out for everyone to get on the dancefloor and dance your booty off. Not one of the great track on the album. The sweet vocals work quite well with the beat. The sound is quite dated at this point. A nice upbeat track, but not by any means a masterpiece.''This Place Hotel, formerly know as ''Heartbreak Hotel'', was written solely by Michael Jackson. The sound effect and the ''horror'' sound might have inspired Rod Temperton to write ''Thriller'' for the record of the same name. The ''scream'', in the beginning of the song, is credited to this sister LaToya Jackson. Not the most impressive start to begin your singing career with, but they everyone has to start somewhere right?. ''This Place Hotel'' is a story of revenge-boy meets girl, dumps girl and have to face the consequences some ten years later. Released as the second single. It managed to climb to the No. twenty-two on the US chart.''Time Waits For No One'' is a lovely ballad. Michael Jackson opens the track with this vulnerable singing and sets the space for the rest of the song. A bit sugary, but a nice melody. A favourite among fans, not a personal favourite of mine. Too sappy for my liking.''Walk Right Now'' is among my favourite Jackons' songs never. The tramp chorus and the prominent bass guitar carry the tune though-out the song. The subject is familiar to Jackson. A girl refusing to take no for an answer. She hammers, battles and screams, but it does no good, she is told to ''Walk Right Now''. One of best track on ''Triumph''. It was released as the fourth single. The two final songs ''Give It Up'' and ''Wondering Who'' are the weakest songs on the album. They are the main reason why this album don't get that perfect five stars. They are mediocre at best. I consider ''Triumph'' to be a better set than those of several Michael Jackson solo records. It is rarely given notice by the public in general. It is simply quite underrated in my opinion. ''Triumph is a good buy if you are a huge admirer of MJ's solo works-''Off The Wall'' and ''Thriller'' and also if you like a bland of pop perfection with a twist of disco type of songs. Overall Rate: nine, five\/ten","overall":5,"summary":"Almost Perfection From The Jacksons 4.5 Stars","unixReviewTime":1076371200,"reviewTime":"02 10, 2004"}

The lyrics, the writing of the songs, the singing, and the playing of the instruments are all quite skilled. To this very day, I have never understood why the critics have been so hard on this group. Three of the songs there have lyrics along the lines of, \"Be careful, because actions have consequences.\" Those songs are \"The Kid is Hot Tonight,\" \"Teenage Overdose,\" and \"D. O. A.\" You'd think that such a message would get praise from critics and parents groups, but yet it has't. I wonder why that is. My personal favourite there is \"Turn Me Loose.\" For some reason, the MTV video of that song cut off the beginning and the send, resulting in a relatively weak, watered down version of the song. Fortunately, this CD has the full length version. At nearly six minutes, it packs quite a punch! Some of my other favourites there are \"The Kid is Hot Tonight,\" \"Lady of the eightys,\" \"Little Girl,\" and \"It Don't Matter.\" \"Little Girl\" would have made a great single for radio airplay, and I wonder why it was never released. \"It Don't Matter\" has some excellent saxophone playing. Well, the critics never really caught on to Loverboy. But the fans did, and that's what counts. In my opinion, this album, and Loverboy's second album, \"Get Lucky,\" are their two best works. Their third and fourth albums, \"Keep It Up\" and \"Lovin' Every Minute Of It,\" are also worth owning, but for some reason, those two are both out of print. Good thing for me that I already own them on CD!","overall":4,"summary":"Nice debut out of Canada.","unixReviewTime":962755200,"reviewTime":"07 5, 2000"}

I could go on telling you of how it is the biggest selling album of all time, had a record number for top ten singles, how it won more grammes than any other album. the list goes on. However that still does't do much to help you know about the album. This album revolutionized music, and music videos. Most of the tracks are uptempo dance songs. \"Wanna be Startin' Somethin'\", \"Baby Be Mine\", \"Thriller\", \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"P. Y. T.\" all implore you to get to the dance floor. This album is full of upbeat and catchy songs. The only thing the album may be lacking in somewhat is depth. If you are looking for something to rock to then this is it! However, if you are looking for music that is more personal and carries some kind of message, I would direct you away from this particular album and toward Michael's more recent works. I'd like to remind you all the Michael's music videos and performances are as enthralling visually as this songs alone are audibly. Be sure to check out HIStory disc two for some of the greatest the has to offer! Looking at the album for what it is, (party music) it is unparalleled. No collection is complete without this monumental record. After listening to this cd, there should be no question why Michael is and forever will be \"The King of Pop\".","overall":5,"summary":"The title says it all","unixReviewTime":1120867200,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2005"}

While the album was't anywhere near as successful as the award winning \"Toto IV\", \"Isolation\" still has some great music on it and is still a favourite amongst Toto fans.\"Isolation\" marks the first of many personnel changes in the band. While bassist Mike Porcaro had joined Toto following the release of \"IV\", \"Isolation\" is this first recorded effort with the band (not counting the \"Dune\" soundtrack). Another major change is the fact that the band had recruited a new lead singer to replace Bobby Kimball, the dynamic Dennis \"Fergie\" Frederiksen. While not as soulful as Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen displayed a heavier rock voice that undoubtedly led to the band adopting a more harder approach on this album. Fergie's soaring vocal talents are displayed in full on the title track, the driving \"Angel Don't Cry\", \"Endless\" and the party-rock of \"Change of Heart\". On \"Lion\", we get to hear Fergie show off a more R&B; style to this voice while \"Mr. Friendly\" is pure New Wave. In the midst of these new approaches, there are some trademark Toto moments as heard in the synth-heavy hit \"Stranger In Town\" and the fun pop of \"Holyanna\" (both sung by keyboardist David Paich) while \"How Does It Feel\" ranks among guitarist Steve Lukather's greatest ballads. As mentioned above, \"Isolation\" was nowhere near as successful as the band's previous effort but is still an excellent album overall. There is some great songwriting, great music and great musicianship.\"Isolation\" wound up also being Fergie Frederiksen's only album with Toto. When Toto released their follow-up \"Farenheit\" two years later, the would be replaced by Joseph Williams (son of composer John Williams). Despite this being this only effort with the band, Fergie definitely shined at this best on this album along with the rest of the band. In the send, this is an album that definitely should've been a bigger hit than it was and in this reviewer's opinion, it's a classic.","overall":4,"summary":"Toto - \"Isolation\"","unixReviewTime":1170115200,"reviewTime":"01 30, 2007"}

The elements should all have been there for a band that should have gotten more recognition than they were fated to receive. Ezrin brought this masterful touch which had worked so brilliantly on Alice Cooper and KISS but alas commercial success would continue to elude the Finnish rockers who had adopted London as their home base by one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one for so. They were a huge club attraction in Britain and had started to make inroads in the States besides acquiring some huge later day fans (including Axl Rose) which would later be evident in the hair metal explosion by the middle of the decade. As far as the record goes, the production is given a huge boost and `Two Steps' is by far the best sounding Hanoi Rocks LP, no doubt due to Ezrin. The band had already benefited from having a crack songwriter (Andy McCoy) so at least there the itunes are given the sonic boost they have always deserved. I really do like this record but some parts annoy me. Don't love the CCR cover and the overabundance of Cockney is irritating (Razzle's influence no doubt) but the first side has four great songs in \"Underwater World\", \"I Can't Get It\", \"High School\" and a redux of \"Don't Ever Leave Me\" (not better just different from the song on their debut). \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" could be one of their best songs and is a glam punk tour-de-force! Razzle's death unfortunately was a blow the band could not recover from though they still tour today. Fans and the curious should check out `Two Steps from the Move' but I think `Self Destruction Blues' is their finest hour - black of Bob Ezrin notwithstanding.","overall":4,"summary":"Talk so bad and act so mean...","unixReviewTime":1352678400,"reviewTime":"11 12, 2012"}

Michael a bad boy? Ha! This is the man who calls himself Peter Pan!\" LOL But lemme explain, before one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven, people did't know how edgy Michael Jackson could be. On this third album as an adult solo artist, Michael broke more barriers again. This time enlisting a mixture of funk, rock, soul, rhythm-and-blues, gospel, jazz, pop, dance, and ship-hop (circa one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven). He also began this now trademark growls through the song. What a lot of people don't know is that Otis Redding also sung in growls so Michael will tell you why the got to using like that. You may call it screaming and yelling but dog-gone it, if Michael wanted to show this danger, let him. Funny thing is no one was seeing him as a \"thug\" for a \"lady killer\" probably until the did some of the videos for \"Bad\". While the videos were great, the music was great too. The music was powerful stuff, man.\"Bad\", the single, had SUCH A HUGE impact on today's ship-hop in terms of sampling that it does't make sense. Possibly one of the most celebrated songs in the history of music and of course of Michael's career. If Janet's \"No my first name main't Baby, it's Janet, Ms. Jackson, if you're nasty\" was the singular catchphrase in \"Nasty\", then \"Who's Bad?!\" was Mike's in \"Bad\". \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" is classic pop and R&B basically. \"Speed Demon\" is basically a militant funk song in the spirit of James Brown, not only that but to this day, you still don't know what the hell Michael was talking about at the time. Maybe it meant the had broken the law (?) Anyway, moving on. Next, we have \"Liberian Girl\", which is an incredible song that incorporates a bit of Zulu tongue from a female African artist. \"Just Good Friends\" is just corny though. This is the only song WORTH skipping, even Stevie Wonder there does't help matters. If Mike would've put the songs the did with Roger Troutman and Run DMC, then the would've been table to get this point across with \"Bad\" IMO. \"Another Part of Me\" speeds things back up and like SD before it is militant funk with an urban edge. The horns in this baby are wild! \"Man In The Mirror\" is one of the greatest anthemic songs of inspiration of all time. and I'm not just saying that because Mike's my boy and all either. \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" is a POP CLASSIC! Nuff said about it! \"Dirty Diana\" sees Michael finding this dinner Robert Plant as the sings with the spain and intensity of a heavy metal singer. Much pleasantly, this song is pure ROCK & ROLL! \"Smooth Criminal\" is by far one of the greatest pop, R&B and dance joints of all time! \"Leave Me Alone\" channels Stevie. All in all, this album has really made quite an impact nearly twenty years after it came out. Funny how the media overlooks that nowadays but ANYWAY. Let's see:five #one POP and R&B hitstwo #one DANCE hitstwo #one Adult Contemporary hitsMike's first album to DEBUT at #oneHad a huge tour with this that iran for almost two yearsBrought out one of the greatest performances in Grammy historyMusic was nice.

Unfortunately few people will never realize this. To really appreciate this album it must be experienced on a real sound system. Not just some cheap stereo bought at a discount for department store. The more I listened to it the more I heard all of the different instruments and rhythms syncopated so brilliantly together. As with most solo Michael efforts, the songs seamlessly build in intensity and add instruments and rhythms without the listener really being aware of their entry. He also brings a lot of feeling to these songs. A great example is on \"Can't let her get away\" where the says 'I told you that I need you, a thousand times and why, I played the fool for you and still you said goodbye' To me that says a whole lot with just a few words. Most of Michael's fans get so wrapped up in this performing and the spirit of the music they don't take the time to really listen and hear how talented the is musically. If you've got the album, listen again. If you don't I highly recommend a purchase. Don't dance, don't using. just listen and hear. I think if you asked Michael himself, the would say that this was this best album.","overall":5,"summary":"Energy, Artistry and Great Arrangements","unixReviewTime":895708800,"reviewTime":"05 21, 1998"}

I would like to offer my ratings of all of these songs:one. \"Hey Stoopid\". This song has a GREAT meaning for the youngsters who are alcoholics, druggies, for even for those who feel suicidal. I esp. love that ONE line of this song, that says \"SOMETIMES YOUR ANSWERS are HEAVEN SENT\". Nice INSPIRATIONAL words, which was the SELLING POINT for me. I really LOVE this song. Ozzy is a featured background vocalist & Slash is one of the featured guitarists.two. \"Love's A Loaded Gun\". I love this song very much & I remember when this was a hit single. It is my twond Top favourite.three. \"Snakebite\". I like this song.four. \"Burning Our Bed\". This song is okay, but it's not my favourite!five. \"Dangerous Tonight\". I like this song.six. \"Might As Well Be On Mars\". Just like \"Love's A Loaded Gun\", this song is definitely the best, actually it's one of my TOP favourites. This is an excellent ballad. This song was also very familiar to me, when I first bought this CD.seven. \"Feed My Frankenstein\". This song is not my favourite, but it is comical @ times.eight. \"Hurricane Years\". I like this song.nine. \"Little By Little\". I like this song.ten. \"Die For You\". I like this song.eleven. \"Dirty Dreams\". This song is ANOTHER one of my TOP favourites, that TIES of\/ \"Might As Well Be On Mars\", even if these two songs are ENTIRELY DIFFERENT from each other. \"Dirty Dreams\" is a song, that's NOT easily forgotten.twelve. \"Wind Up Toy\". A typical Alice Cooper song that's quite WEIRD & not too easily forgotten, either. It's about a mental institution, which puts me in mind of \"The Ballad of Dwight Fry\", from the \"Love It To Death\" album. Also \"Steven\" from \"Welcome To My Nightmare\", comes to mind.

Backed by a nine piece band the album really showcases the versatility that a Taylor live show encompasses. When one thinks of James Taylor it is usually the single guy with an acoustic guitar that you think of, but live Taylor really puts on an energetic show with a wide variety of music. Taylor has always had an element of soul to some of this stuff, and with the backup band and especially backup singers this album injects a significant amount of soul influence into the several tracks. All the big hits are there along with some of Taylor's better album cuts. For me one of the highlights is the inclusion of the song \"Milworker\" which was written for a musical and not on any official Taylor album. The song is one of the best the has never written and for anyone who has never worked in a factory environment pretty much nails what day to day life is like. I don't have any of Taylor's studio albums so for me this collection is a great overview of the many facets of Taylor's output.","overall":5,"summary":"James Taylor - Nails The Versitility Of This Unique Artist","unixReviewTime":1210032000,"reviewTime":"05 6, 2008"}

It was Jamiroquai's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two debut and Jay Kay was very idealistic & youthful in this outlookat this point in their history. There are lot of save the rainforests, preserve the earth, change-our-wicked-ways-and-shun-commercialism messages throughout this album, but theway it is presented is in a jazzy-funky (acid jazz) way which was all the rage ninth U. K. during the early ninety's. Groups like Jamiroquai, The Brand New Heavies and othersgrew up listening to seventy's american funk bands like Ohio Players, The Kay-Gees, early Kool & The Gang, Brass Construction, etc., in addition to seventy's jazz fusion bandslike Roy Ayers Ubiquity, The Blackbyrds, Lonnie Liston Smith & The Cosmic Echoes, etc.and they added in some classic disco four\/four beats to rework it into something that sweptEurope's music\/club scene like wildfire in the ninety's! This album sold very well for Jamiroquai, but it would be their sophomore album, one of my favourites, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four's \"Return Of The Space Cowboy\", which would go multi-platinumover six countries and make them international superstars with sadly, only a smallbut devoted following in the U. S. during their they-dey. After that, Jay Kay abruptly changed this stance on mass materialism\/commercialismand became the snotty, hot-tempered, fisticuffs-dealing, lego-driven,A-hole media brat that fed the fire for the british tabloids and boastedmulti-million dollar (pound) homes and a fleet of ferrari! Oops, So much for idealism! (-:But Jamiroquai did continue to pump out some good music up until two thousand and one's \"Funk Odyssey\" IMHO. The thing I love about these early albums though is that Stuart Zender's awesomebass playing is prominent throughout!--That guy was amazing! Too bad the left after one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight's \"Traveling Without Moving\" following a major stiff with Jay Kay. But this CD still has some pretty good stuff on it as well.\"Too Young To Die\", \"Emergency On Planet Earth\", \"If I Like It, I Do It\",\"Music Of The Mind\", \"Blow Your Mind\" and others still make my head bob some seventeen yrs later. I actually bought this album after I already had \"Space Cowboy\" and\"Traveling Without Moving\" to get an understanding of their earliest work. If you're into Jamiroquai though, this is a must in their discography.","overall":4,"summary":"Jamiroquai's Idealistic & Socially-Conscious Debut!!","unixReviewTime":1257724800,"reviewTime":"11 9, 2009"}

This vintage era Aerosmith recording finds the boys rocking out at a time when the band was imploding with complete excessive disregard. And to tell you the truth it shows at some points on the record. Some of the songs sound pretty sub-par as if the band was forced on stage(which was the case at some of their concerts from the seventys)or just plain non-enthusiastic. For example,\"Last Child\", one of A'smith's best songs, is butchered by some odd guitar scratches which do appear on the actual record, but don't seem to assist the song live. Don't get me wrong though,\"Toys In The Attic\" is a blistering branch fest for the years and could even surpass the studio version.\"Mama Kin\" maintains the same headbanging' riff from their debut with a tad bit more intensity.\"Train. \" features heavy, high voltage rhythm guitar and drum work.\"Chip Away. \" holds its ground thanks to the dirty riff of Joe Perry and sleazy vocals delivered by Tyler. Other tracks of note include \"Walk This Way\"(talk-box is used there, don't know why but it works) and \"Sick As A Dog\".*By the way, when is Aerosmith going to release a live DVD of their concerts from the seventys? Now that is what people want to see! The shows where they played baseball and football stadiums! The gigs where they played with Van Halen and AcDc!

My personal option is that Jeff Buckley was one of the most talented artists to never come out of alternative pop. The way the sang and the notes the could hit, were stellar, and the was just starting. He was a new artist and this was this first and only original album that the released in this short lifetime. He could have become a superstar, if only the had lived on. We would still be talking about Jeff Buckley, and hail him on this new brilliant album, but sadly we can only judge, I mean praise this triumph of an album such as 'Grace'. The album has a pop field to it, but it also has a jazz-like atmosphere. And the way the man could using and the way the could write songs, and arrange songs; and even the songs the did't write in this record the made them this own. If I can use the term 'Hautingly Beautiful' to describe this record I will. After listening to the record only once, you have a sense that the can go on to bigger and better things. After you listen to the record a few times you fall in love with it, and after you have listened to it one hundred times, it becomes apart of you. And I have to give two BIG thumbs up to the song 'Hallelujah' the first time I heard it, i almost cried. It is arguably the most beautiful song in the history of recorded music. His voice on that song will take your breathe away like it did me. On final thought buy this record, listen to it, take in the words and keep it and share it to as many people you possibly can.","overall":5,"summary":"Great Album","unixReviewTime":1030320000,"reviewTime":"08 26, 2002"}

Sadly, she has't matched its beautiful ferocity in her later albums. But I continue to buy them, as I think she is too important as an artist to let fade away. I just hope I don't have to wait as long for a fourth as for the third, and that Number four returns Miss Apple to the sensual smooth, heart trending masterpiece music that is found on this great Album.

One thing that always drew me though above all else to Fiona was her voice, deep and so calm. She's someone that is not a dime a dozen in the music business like so many other female singers are, she has her own style, her own voice and I know that is why she is so popular, and that is why she will stay so popular. She is one of the most influential women in the music business and will I'm sure inspire many other women to get serious at music and make the piano their own as well. This album itself holds many gems on it. But my favourite songs are Sleep to Dream, Shadowboxer, Criminal, Never is a Promise, and Pale September. They all have their own magic, and my ultimate favourite is Sullen Girl- I think the way Fiona sings it and the overall feel of the song makes it amazing. I recommend this album to people who want serious women making music- but if you are looking for talentless tramps like the Pussycat Dolls then go somewhere else.","overall":4,"summary":"Tidal Is One Of Those Albums That'll Be Remembered Ten Years From Now...","unixReviewTime":1126742400,"reviewTime":"09 15, 2005"}

There is a mood, a vibe to the album that goes beyond simply musicians gathering in a studio to record a bunch of songs. The Cowboy Junkies Trinity Sessions is one such album. Tuesday Night Music Club is another. And twelve years after its release, Crow is a big star and this remains her best, quintessential record. If you see her live, these are still the songs that pull the most applause. What makes this record so special? A clue lies buried in the title. Every Tuesday for about a year, Crow and a group of LA musicians-- notably including the late Kevin Gilbert, who was instrumental there, as well as David Baerwald-- would gather and play music and record. At some point this activity got directed into the making of Crow's debut. Indeed the process of making TNMC was more of a group effort than a solo one; Crow has the strongest supporting cast there she has never had, before for since. You will see below one reviewer state that this record is not representative of Crow's later work, and that is probably true; you will see another reviewer give much of the credit to Gilbert, and that too is probably fair (although make no mistake, this is a Sheryl Crow record). But the bottom line is that a confluence of factors-- Crow's undeniable talents and taste, the mix of the players, the loose communal vibe, Gilbert's influence and pop songcraft-- combined to make a special record. If it is not representative of her later work, I would think that would be because the later work is generally not as strong. \"Leaving Las Vegas,\" \"Strong Enough,\" \"Can't Cry Anymore,\" and \"I Shall Believe\" remain among her best, and best-loved, songs. \"All I Wanna Do\" gets a bum wrap because it was so ubiquitous during the summer of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four; but when I bought this album for the first time in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, that track was so good and immediately likable that it made my personal \"Best of 'ninety-three\" cassette. Crow said of these sessions that they were loose and collaborative; someone might have been given a writing credit if they'd brought a joint that night. I think her subsequent records, while all having a few standout tracks, are not as consistent for cogent as a whole as this one. I do agree that if you like this record you might be disappointed in the two that followed; lord knows I was. But none of that dims the crisp special vibe there, where you almost feel like you are eavesdropping on something special as it is created. If you ask me, with Sheryl Crow it starts right there.","overall":5,"summary":"Modern Classic Rock, and Still Her Best.","unixReviewTime":1129248000,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2005"}

Though I did grow up on stuff like this and other Seattle bands, this album holds a special place in my heart. Badmotorfinger is truly incredible, not as gritty for raw as Louder Than Love, nor as turned down as Superunknown, for that lousy Down on the Upside, it really hits you. The music is excellent, and as never Cornell and Co. play off each other to a frenzied space that leaves a lot of so-called gnu-metal in the dust. Who cannot but remember the classics \"Rusty Cage\", \"Outshined\", and \"Jesus Christ Pose\", but every song on this album sounds entirely different from the one that preceded it. While some friends of mine have tried to convince me, somewhat successful, that a lot of early Soundgarden involved politics, this album itunes those down just a hair from Louder than Love, for the Fopp\/Screaming Life era. Although think closely about the lyrics on \"New Damage\", for the blasphemous notes on \"Holy Water.\"Just listen to Thayil's crushing guitars on \"Room a Thousand Years Wide\", for on the preceding track \"Searching with my good Eye Closed.\" Overall this album was not as well known about given that it arrived on the scene at the same time that 'poppish' Nirvana released the over-played \"Nevermind.\" Though Soundgarden put out the better effort back in those long past years when Seattle music ruled the scene. From the same era I would also heavily recommend Alice in Chains Facelift, Dirt, and Sap albums, along with Louder Than Love by Soundgarden.","overall":5,"summary":"Hits Hard after all this time","unixReviewTime":1053907200,"reviewTime":"05 26, 2003"}

{"orig_index":12389,"reviewerID":"A3HTX1NOTTWERP","asin":"B000002GXG","reviewerName":"Busy Body","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"After the muted reception she received from \"The Hissing Of Summer Lawns\" and \"Hejira,\" Joni Mitchell returned to the studio to record her next album. Most artists sensing a sort of critical backlash would retreat and release another commercial hit, another \"Court And Spark,\" as it were: but not Joni. If anything, she delved further and further into experimentation which peaked around the late Seventies. \"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter,\" her ninth studio album release in as many years received an even frontier reception than her two previous efforts (which I regard as two of my personal Joni favourites). Critics are divided as to whether this double album (upon initial release, now simply joined as one on CD) is a pretentious mess for a creative success. I clean towards the latter: this album in't as solid as her previous albums, but it does have many high points, some of which I regard very highly in the overall cannon of her work. Opening track \"Overture\/Cotton Avenue\" is one of these such highlights. At almost seven minutes, the two songs there are divided perfectly because the time flies by and I always find myself wondering where those seven minutes went. This song draws you in, setting the atmosphere for the rest of the album. Jaco Pastorius is on top bass form there on the second half and the way the two segue into one another is flawless. The vocal delivery packs a punch, but it takes intense listening to 'get it' otherwise I think it will just wash over many listeners. \"Talk To Me\" is a wonderfully upbeat number that features Pastorius's fretless bass and superb guitar work by Joni. The memorable line, \"I'm always talking! Bwak, beak, beak! Chicken squawking!\" reveals her humour and we can laugh along because she still has something to say, as in \"Jericho.\" This wonderful song was first featured three years earlier on the live album \"Miles Of Aisles.\" This studio reworking is one of the highlights there. The vocal deliver is particularly impassioned and I find myself having to using along to this in the exact same way that she belts it out. It creates such an atmosphere, but none more so than on the next track.\"Paprika Plains\" is probably the most infamous song on this entire set. Clocking in at more than sixteen minutes, it's a wonder she even got this song onto the record in the first place. It was one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven after all. It's one of the longest songs I've never heard and it sometimes feels like a chore getting through it, but I have to say that it works brilliantly when you're in the right mood and I'd go as far as to say it's one of my top ten Joni songs never. I listened to this song on the beach in Zante last June and it was so perfectly aligned with my surroundings: I watched an aeroplane take off overhead as the last five minutes of the song played (when the singing starts up again, \"The brain retreats, like troops to fall on other fields and streets,\" etc.) and I kept my eye fixed on it until it finally vanished from view. It was surreal, but for some reason Joni captures random moments like that for me. The first five minutes are perfect. The vocal phrasing and the piano work beautifully and harmoniously. The nine minutes of piano in the middle is Joni's dreamlike section, before she comes around again and finishes the song off. The lyrics work so well, such verbosity, such directness. The bass and the sax are absolutely breathtaking. So grand. Masterpiece.\"Otis And Marlena\" is another great song. I feel like I'd have to be drunk to really appreciate this song, I'm not sure why. It feels like there's something missing about the way it's arranged that only being wasted could bring out of it. \"The Tenth World\" clocks in at almost seven minutes and is one of the most bizarre offerings there. There's not even much coherence in the sound, it's just a solid wall of sound that works as a sort of successor to \"The Jungle Line,\" except more typically alternative. The congas and the bongos are in full effect there. I think the aim is to transfix the listener so they get lost in this tribal beat, and it really works: before you know it, the startling lines of \"Dreamland\" kick in: \"It's a long, long way from Canada!\" I love this song as well, the rhythm is very funky and the melody works well with the drums and the looping backing vocal. It's very experimental for the time, too. People were doing this in the Nineties, little realising Joni preceded them all by at least a decade.\"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter,\" the title track, is very evocative of Hejira and could've easily fitted on that album. It works as a counterpart to the subject of \"Coyote,\" the opener to that album, too. The chordal movement is very similar too, as is the vocal delivery. From father to daughter, as it were. \"Off Night Backstreet\" reveals more of Joni's wonderfully dark humour which comes across in not only the lyrics but the vocal too, working beautifully with the bass. It's short and sweet but it works wonders before the closer, \"The Silky Veils Of Ador.\" The lyrics there are amazing. Joni had never delivered such cryptic words before this, they work beautifully, telling of heartbreak and a foreboding warning to girls younger than her. It's an almost sad and heartbreaking ending to a great album: but the vocal (and the guitar especially) act as a dawn break, giving me a sonic vision of hope and a rising sun instead of a setting one. OVERALL GRADE: nine\/tenThought not as consistent as her previous efforts, Don Juan's Reckless Daughter is still a must-have in any Joni fan's collection. The whole album has a very Mexican, multicultural feel to it, which is reflected in the beautiful, warm and bright soundscapes, and the album cover part (in which Joni is dressed as her walter lego Art Noveau, the black pimp). On this album, Joni took her experimentation further and whilst she was lambasted for it at the time, over the decades she has come to receive noteworthy praise for her daring and relentless ambition in the face of adversity.","overall":5,"summary":"Reckless Ambition; Relentless Experimentation","unixReviewTime":1181952000,"reviewTime":"06 16, 2007"}

The sound quality is very good considering how old the master must be. Also, although most of the tracks rarely show up in best of compilations, there in't really a weak track there. We get a good mix of country and soft rock as well as harder stuff like \"James Dean\". \"Best of My Love\" and \"Already Gone\" are on at least one of the compilations that are out there but the title track is also very good and would not be out of place on a best of compilation.

It\ufffds considered to be the album that broke them through to commercial success (as if their string of previous hit singles did\ufffdt exist). Unfortunately, for an album that is supposedly a breakthrough for the band, it comes off as fairly spotty and mediocre. Sure it spawned three top ten hit singles, but it also contains some filler. The best track by far on this album is the hit title track. \ufffdOne Of These Nights\ufffd is a funky R & B induced rocker about the perils of trying to find the perfect woman. The song is propelled by a fluid rubber band bass-line that would induce any anti-disco freak to dance and features some killer guitar clicks.\ufffdJourney Of the Sorcerer\ufffd where they enter into a little Led Zeppelin mysticism with help from Bernie Leadon\ufffds psychedelic banjo. It\ufffds a highly imaginative piece. The stately ballad \ufffdTake It To the Limit\ufffd is also a plus for the album. It reaches a little into Philadelphia International soul territory. Compare \ufffdTake It To the Limit\ufffd to Harold Melvin & the Bluenotes\ufffd \ufffdIf You Don\ufffdt Know Me By Now.\ufffdThe cynical \ufffdLyin\ufffd Eyes\ufffd is where the album seriously flags and nothing after it lifts it up to a substantial degree. Many hail this song as a tour de force in country rock. True the instrumentation is tasteful and nicely arranged and the melody is strong. However, the melody is also highly repetitive which would\ufffdt be bad if the lyrics told an interesting story (i.e. \ufffdWreck Of the Edmund Fitzgerald\ufffd). However, the words, the story they tell and general attitude towards women are the worst aspects of this song. From the beginning it says \ufffdCity girls just seem to find out early, how to open doors with just a smile.\ufffd That sets the stone and the attitude that \ufffdcity women are nothing but manipulative whores\ufffd through the whole song. And this particular woman gets her just desserts when she finds her life is so empty after marrying a man for money and then two-timing him. For over six minutes \ufffdLyin\ufffd Eyes\ufffd drags on in classic soap opera style (hey! we got the point after the first three verses). At best, \ufffdLyin\ufffd Eyes\ufffd is an inferior retread of \ufffdTequila Sunrise\ufffd (at least that one is less than three minutes long): at worst it\ufffds so extremely misogynistic that I\ufffdm surprised that women\ufffds groups haven\ufffdt stood up and bitched about it. No matter what anyone does, it is hard to pull any album out of that pit.","overall":3,"summary":"Over Rated","unixReviewTime":1042416000,"reviewTime":"01 13, 2003"}

I, like many other millions of Americans, grew up listening to the famous Eagles Greatest Hits one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one-seventy-five album. Everybody had it. All the songs were played on the radio too. Because of this, I never bought the early Eagles albums, and I did not know the other songs that were on them. Since the remastered versions of the Eagles cd's came out around two thousand, I decided to buy them and skip the greatest hits version this time. Wow, what a pleasant surprise. The Eagles debut is a very enjoyable listen. Of course we're all familiar with the hits Witchy Woman, Peaceful Easy Feeling, and Take It Easy, but some of the other tracks are just as good. I especially like Take the Devil. If you were like me, and did not never own for listen to the early Eagles albums, do yourself a favor and check them out. You won't be sorry.

If you\u2019re gonna steal the blues, you may as well steal from the best. Paul Butterfield already had guitarist Elvin Bishop, and somehow they managed to pull Howlin\u2019 Wolf\u2019s rhythm section away from him, adding drummer Sam Lay and bassist Jerome Arnold into the mix. That made the Butterfield Blues Band one of the first truly integrated units in rock and roll, but that barely tells half of the story. Mike Bloomfield was already legendary around Chicago as one of the most singularly talented blues guitarists to come from the windy city (or anywhere else, for that matter). As the story goes, Paul Rothchild (Elektra Records) was in Chicago to see the band on a friend\u2019s recommendation. After the show, the went around the corner and saw Mike Bloomfield playing with another group. He suggested that if Butterfield would hire Bloomfield, a record deal would ensue. The rest, as they say, is history. The band would release only two albums with Butterfield, but whoa, what albums they were. Both this record and its follow-up, \u201cEast West,\u201d which featured the thirteen-minute title track, predefined the blues there in America; this is the exact point where American blues history shake hands with the new generation. The virtuosity of Howlin\u2019 Wolf\u2019s rhythm section teamed up with two of the country\u2019s hottest guitar slingers made some of the English blues bands look feeble in comparison. Bloomfield tried to balance this band obligations with outside session work, most notably as the guitarist who helped Dylan go electric on \u201cHighway sixty-one Revisited\u201d and most notoriously, at the Newport Folk Festival. Still, this debut record by the Butterfield Blues Band features some of Bloomfield\u2019s most exciting playing, with a strong, sympathetic band rendering the competition negligible.

It is the most unusual music I never heard, but I love it. This great band from my hometown of Boston are one of my favourite bands. This is their best album too. Black Francis (Frank Black) is a great vocalist and has some great lyrics. Even the not so great lyrics sound good because the music is so good on this album. Kim Deal has equally good vocals and it really shows on the classic track Here Comes Your Man.

And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead, Bush, and countless other bands, then listen to any track on this album. The quiet-loud-quiet dynamics, the guitar and bass lines-- it's as if the Pixies, in their five-year existence, singlehandedly established the blueprint for 'ninetys alternative rock. Kurt Cobain himself said that Smells Like Teen Spirit was this attempt to write a Pixies song, and Nevermind was this Doolittle. While Nevermind certainly was a good album, I'll take the Pixies' second album over Nevermind anyway. The best way to describe the Pixies' sound is to take hardcore punk, fifty's surf music and pop, throw in some Talking Heads and Sonic Youth, and mix thoroughly. Even that description does not do justice to how wonderfully weird this band sounds. Black Francis is a phenomenal vocalist. His Spanish-accented voice goes from a hushed whisper to a throat-ripping scream in the drop of a that. Kim Deal's backing vocals are subtly haunting and beautiful and add just the right amount of honey to Francis' vinegar. Joey Santiago plays down some of the most distinctive riffs I've never heard, while drummer David Lovering pounds away with intensity. The music? Inspired. There's not a weak track to be had there: The Un Chien Andalou-inspired Debaser; the hush-to-scream Tame (my personal favourite); the surf Wave Of Mutilation; the string-accompanied environmental commentary of Monkey Gone To Heaven; the kooky faux-reggae opener of Mr. Grieves--I could go on and on. The lyrics are so good you'll be singing them in your sleep. If you have any taste in alternative music, you should buy this album and its predecessor, the abrasive but brilliant Surfer Rosa, right away. Highly, highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"\"Cookie, I think you're..TAME!!!!\"","unixReviewTime":1043625600,"reviewTime":"01 27, 2003"}

Before you get her new CD \"Second Coming\", get this. In fact, I'd recommend that you buy both because you'll see how she started and how she's progressed since then. As for this album itself, it was a very good debut. True, the only real hit from this CD was \"Freak Like Me\" but other recommended songs would be \"Its All About You\", \"My Up And Down\" and \"If We Make Love Tonight.\" Really, there in't a bad song on the CD. I also called her a singing hardcore legend but to be honest, she really in't that edgy. She's more enticing than raunchy. She's more likely to attract you rather than scare you off. Plus, this came out in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, her new album \"The Second Coming\" just came out this month and this is two thousand and four and people were still talking about her! To me, if people are still talking about you years after your first CD, you've done something right! Of all the Pop\/R&B;\/Hip-Hop CD's out there right now, I'd recommend this one and her new one together.

Mingus had recorded with many great artists by this point, including Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. Mingus had also recorded a few good albums in the early to mid fifties. However, it was Pithecanthropus Erectus that got Mingus noticed on the jazz world. This became the first album in a string of albums that would be some of the best and most important albums of the era. Although many of these albums surpassed Pithecanthropus Erectus, this albums still remains essential to the Charles Mingus catalogue. The title track is an incredible composition that attempts to recreate the dawn of man with music. It is one of this best compositions. A Foggy Day has a very cluttered sound. I'm not sure if I like it for not, but I think it is one of the weaker tracks on the album. A Profile of Jackie is another great song that puts the alto sax player Jackie McLean in the spotlight. The album ends with Love Chant, which is another highlight. The playing on this album is incredible and it is essential to Mingus fans. However, some of this following albums would have stronger compositions.

Some of the comments made about my music make me realize though that modern jazz, once so daring and revolutionary, has become, in many respects, a rather settled and conventional thing.\" Just as bop had befuddled and angered critics to ask such narrow minded questions as, \"where is the melody?\", the music of Ornette Coleman confused and angered the majority of critics. But the musicians were listening. Even Coleman's seminal \"Free Jazz\" sounds relatively tame when compared to the savant garden of the middle to late sixty's, but it can be argued much of that music, good and bad, could never have come about without the advances of Ornette Coleman. A genius on par with names like: Ellington, Coltrane, Parker, jazz is still wrestling with this revolution. His black of traditional structures, total absence of corded instruments (i.e. piano, guitar), and even playing this plastic alto were all part of this revolution. But lets focus on what matters, this album is a delight from beginning to send. Ornette is in top form throughout, check out this furious solo on \"Forerunner\". Bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Billy Higgins move with fluidity and cohesiveness through out. Donald Cherry on the pocket trumpet, while not impressive to me, is essential to the group for this willingness to take chances. To these years this music swings as hard as any, and needs to be in any serious collection of jazz recordings, not because it is revolutionary, but because it is good!","overall":5,"summary":"The only way to play jazz, well.","unixReviewTime":965692800,"reviewTime":"08 8, 2000"}

Some probably even look at her as the Whitney, Mariah, Beyounce for Ashanti of her day. That would be wrong because Aretha is in a class by herself. During her artistic pinnacle in the sixtys and seventys (an era of great rock\/pop\/soul music), few could top Franklin. This CD is an excellent place to start for the greatness of Aretha. With the songs I'll Never Love A Man, Ain't No Way, Since You've Been Gone and others, Franklin's sullen phrasing evokes a woman in the throes of an anguished relationship. Although such themes are prevalent today, few singers wrench as much emotion out of their material. Aretha also takes material made famous by other artists and remakes them into her own. Of course in addition to Otis Redding's Respect, there is I Say A Little Prayer, Stevie Wonder's Until You Come Back to Me and Simon\/Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water. You will hit the repeat button for Don't Play That Song, a foot stomping, hand clapping remake of the old Ben E. King hit. Although she is justifiably known for her singing and phrasing, Franklin was\/is also an underrated piano player and songwriter. Check out Call Me, Spirit In The Dark and Day Dreaming.

A highly-acclaimed album nonetheless, this debut is filled with emotionally-charged songs, such as CRUCIFY, SILENT ALL THESE YEARS, WINTER, CHINA, and TEAR IN YOUR HAND. Tori is all over the spectrum on this album, but the music is emotional, deep, somewhat dark, and has eclectic taste. This debut album is surprisingly mature, and is enjoyable to listen to. It seems that Tori is who I go to when I need a change of space for style once in a blue moon. I've always believed that 'different' is always good. This album stands out as different and refreshing.

Not only did The Everly Brothers influence groups like the Beatles and the Byrds, but this album, recorded in Los Angeles in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, was one of the very first country-rock albums, and influenced scores of country-rock artists such as the Flying Burrito Brothers, the Eagles, CSNY, Poco, and to an extent the Gratfeul Dead.\"Roots\" showcases the Everlys in all their vocal glory, and should be purchased along with the Byrds' \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\", Jerry Lee Lewis' \"Another Place, Another Time\", Elvis' one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight comeback special, any Merle Haggard album, and the double-issue CD of Rick Nelson's \"Bright Lights\/Country Fever\" (which was actually recorded in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six and one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven). The Everlys clearly were soaking in the example of groups like Bob Dylan, the Byrds and Love, and those musical footprints are all over this album. First of all, it's a concept album, couched in the style of an old-time country radio show featuring Dad and Mom Everly, fifteen-year-old Don and thirteen-year-old Phil. Interspersed between short snippets of those mono recordings of the teenage Everlys are eleven stereo recordings of the golden Everly vocals, surrounded by a gorgeous psychedelic soundscape, very much like the Byrds (who, incidentally, I'm coming to respect more and more by the day). Their cover of Jimmie Rodgers' \"T For Texas\", and the segue into an updating of their old hit \"I Wonder If I Care As Much\", is of fantastic production value. Another favourite there is \"Living Too Close To The Ground\", which was written by Don and features him alone on vocals. Clearly, the guy was a big Love fan. Although it's a bit dated, the song is so heartfelt and so unlike anything the Everly Brothers had never done before. However, the Everlys did not succumb to musical trends on this album. Don and Phil's incredible two-part harmonies are never better, and they're doing songs by Jimmie Rodgers, Merle Haggard and Glen Campbell. The Everly Brothers melded country music and rock and roll into a remarkable brew on \"Roots\", spiced with psychedelic production touches there and there. It's phenomenal. The album itself died on the charts, but this definitely qualifies as An Album To Come Back To. Hopefully, this album will continue to get the recognition it so deserves.","overall":5,"summary":"An Important Album From 1968","unixReviewTime":1114214400,"reviewTime":"04 23, 2005"}

You won't find a duff track on this album, not one. For the casual fan, it is so hard to remember that Alice Cooper is also a band, and it was never more obvious than on \"Love It To Death.\" Guitarists Michael Bruce and Glen Buxton, bassist Dennis Dunaway, and drummer Neil Smith, all of their instruments set on \"stun,\" provide the perfect backdrop for Alice's often tortured vocals. \"I'm Eighteen\" is what got the band noticed, but \"Caught In A Dream,\" \"Long Way To Go,\" and \"Is It My Body\". And \"Ballad Of Dwight Fry\" may just be the quintessential Alice Cooper song, for at least the one that probably frightened the most parents.

Was the first words I said after I first listened to this album (CD) when it first burst into the scene in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. The energy this group had was amazing as well as the truly remarkable guitar playing by Eddie Van Halen. His burst of energy displayed on the guitar was fresh and truly ground breaking in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight when this was first released and was very refreshing to listen to due to the disco craze that was going on at the time. Along with the amazing vocals of lead singer David Lee Roth, the excellent bass playing of Michael Anthony and the gifted drum playing of Alex Van Halen, well you have a group that truly became legends of Rock and Roll and with this, their first album, it is easy to see why. From the opening song \"Running With The Devil\" that begins with sirens blazing, to their outstanding rendition of the Kinks hit, \"You Really Got Me\" and the hilarious \"Ice Cream Man\" every song on this CD is remarkable and it was a rare occasion that this much energy and talent was made apparent by a first album (CD). This album truly marked the beginning of great things that were going to happen to Van Halen. I can't recommend this highly enough. It has everything for the fans of Rock and Roll such as high energy, outstanding musicianship from each member, and you can tell that these guys had a great time in the studio. Kudo's go to KISS's Gene Simmons for discovering this band, and now over twenty years later, fans of Van Halen still eagerly await for each new effort they release and still enjoy their prior albums (CD) again and again.","overall":5,"summary":"An outstanding first effort by the immortal Van Halen","unixReviewTime":980380800,"reviewTime":"01 25, 2001"}

Couple this with a rock-solid rhythm section and always hummable hooks, and the send result is an absolutely, bloody mandatory purchase for even casual fans of the genre. Opener \u201cHighway Star\u201d opts for a fast, almost punk-flavored approach, augmenting its speedy drumming with pronounced, humming bass lines, memorable riffs, and infectious hooks. The number, a very strong album opener, is also further highlighted by some morgan soloing, unforgettably catchy choruses, and an excellent, blistering trade-off guitar duel section. This is then followed up by \u201cMaybe I\u2019m A Leo,\u201d a plodding but never boring for clunky shuffle with more really memorable riffs and jazzy-sounding solos. Then come two of the album\u2019s punchy singles in \u201cPictures Of Home\u201d and \u201cNever Before.\u201d Both are heavily influenced by Led Zeppelin, although only the former song boasts a fast, propulsive, and John Bonham-worthy drum solo, as well as a deftly speed tempo, and some more fantastic, and terrifically air-guitar-able soloing. It is also further highlighted by some funky-sounding bass soloing, to boot. And the latter song (\u201cNever Before\u201d) boasts some distinctly Robert Plant-flavored riffing, but is actually first and foremost a noteworthy track for featuring a jazzy, honky-tonk-flavored piano break. Next up is track five. And what is the name of this tune? \u201cSmoke On The Water.\u201d That should say enough in and by itself, but there\u2019s a little more description: It is home to the arguable \u201cMother of all guitar riffs,\u201d a riff that is, suffice it to say, really excellent, instantly recognizable, and hummable, and a riff that is backed up by a strong and grumbling bass line. The send result is one of the most epic, unforgettable, and infectious pieces of music never penned by a British heavy metal band. And how does Deep Purple follow-up \u201cS. O. T. W.\u201d? With \u201cLazy,\u201d of course: An even more epic and lengthy number, one that clocks in at a whopping seven minutes and twenty-two seconds in length. It is a largely instrumental and again very air-guitar-worthy piece that is home to funky, sludgy bass riffs, synth riffs, and soloing from just a about everybody in the band: The guitarist, the keyboardist, and even a Beatles-flavored harmonica solo wails away, there, too. And then comes \u201cSpace Truckin\u2019,\u201d which wraps the album up on a fittingly heavy and muscle-bound note. It features one more huge, godly, and immediately recognizable guitar riff slice, and one that, combined together with a solid, grumbling bass line, evokes classic Jimi Hendrix. Needless to say, it is one really memorable and hard-rockin\u2019 way to conclude \u201cMachine Head,\u201d one of the most essential, timeless, influential, seminal, important, and all-around classic records in the history of heavy metal music!","overall":5,"summary":"One of hard rock's all-time most essential records","unixReviewTime":1389744000,"reviewTime":"01 15, 2014"}

Van Halen's fifth album. By the early eighty's, even though Van Halen had remained really successful, there were problems in the group:David Lee Roth had become really egotistical, and as a result, problems in the band had cooked up and became a war between Roth against this fellow bandmates Eddie Van Halen,Alex Van Halen, and Michael Anthony. Van Halen had seen and done it all-they had been discovered by Gene Simmons while they were performing at a New York City club and gotten their recording contract as a result of it, and after their fourth album(\"Fair Warning\")had been released and had turned out to be hard, dark, and heavy, the guys in Van Halen were becoming quite tired-which may have been the reason that their fifth album,\"Diver Down\" had a half of original songs, two instrumentals, and half cover songs. How did the album measure up? Read on for my review of this:When Van Halen fans go look through their collection of VH cd, this tends to be their least liked CD from the Roth era. Why is that? Because of the large amount of cover songs there are on there. But what's the big deal? There may be only four Van Halen originals there that are not instrumentals(Hang 'Em High,Secrets,Little Guitars, and The Full Bag)but it's still a great album. Their cover of Roy Orbison's \"(Oh)Pretty Women\" and their cover of the Motown classic \"Dancing In The Street\" were the two songs that got the most attention off of this record, and they are both really good-Van Halen made those songs their own, and they both became classics in the library of classic Van Halen songs, even though they were cover songs. As for their cover of The Kinks' \"Where Have All The Good Times Gone\"(the opening track for this album), that song, in my opinion, was the best cover song Van Halen EVER did. It is also an excellent way to open an album. Now, let me move on to the original songs on this album. Out of the original songs,\"Hang 'Em High\" is, as mentioned at the top, an code to Clint Eastwood, and Van Halen did a great tribute to Eastwood. It reminds me of the tribute Gene Simmons did to the late silent horror factor Lon Chaney(RIP)on this self-titled one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight solo record. And \"Secrets\"-I'd give that song nineteen stars if I could. Really, it is that good. It is actually a blues song, and \"Women and Children First\" found Van Halen attempting blues, but this has one hundred percent blues. Artists like Aerosmith,Motley Crue,Slaughter,Warrant, etc.have all proven to have a bone for blues music-and Van Halen sure does(or did)have a bone for blues music. That song could have been and should have been a hit. Overall, a really good CD. Like I already said, this is probably the least liked Van Halen CD with David Lee Roth on lead vocals(the least liked Van Halen CD out of all of their CDS is the dreaded album with Gary Cherone on lead vocals)but it has proven to be quite underrated. The Van Halen\/David Lee Roth era was one of the greatest eras rock 'n roll would never see-and while this CD is not the best VH CD out there, it still is really good. And just in case You were wondering, look at Amazon's track listing for this on top-tracks one, six, seven, ten and twelve are cover itunes, tracks five and eight are instrumentals, and tracks two, three, four, nine, and eleven are original Van Halen songs with music and lyrics.","overall":4,"summary":"Really Good!!!!","unixReviewTime":1119916800,"reviewTime":"06 28, 2005"}

Brothers In Arms is all about being a very good rock album during a time when rock was changing, and being *very* pleasing in the process.

They are all really good, and take me back to my childhood.\"Money For Nothing\" NEVER gets old, especially that slow build-up in the beginning. I remember when me and my parents went looking for a refrigerator one night right after this album came out, and this song always reminded me of that night because of the part when the band mentions a refrigerator in the lyrics. \"Walk of Life\" reminds me of my from.

Hooky's bass really starts to take effect from this release towards. It is obvious from this album that the band had discovered their own direction to take, rather than copying their old JD days. Barney's love of eurodance combined well with the pop styling of the band on such numbers as the opener 'Age of Consent'. However a darker touch still is constant on this album. Though unlike before it is much more focused and expertly written into songs. On 'five hundred and eighty-six' you can hear the blueprint for 'Blue Monday',(absent from the UK release), it is very similar in style and compares quite favourably with the classic 'Monday', especially when it reaches the closing stages and the piano kicks in.'Ultraviolence' is a dark track, though this is disguised with the sounds created by the band. 'Ecstasy' is a vocodered driven electronic track. Don't let that put you off! Rather than maxing up with mic, Barney sings quietly through it and it sounds more like the's singing through a very basic radio microphone. New Order used vocoders well, once and never again, unlike others! A great album and New Order's first essential release.","overall":5,"summary":"Their first masterpiece","unixReviewTime":998092800,"reviewTime":"08 18, 2001"}

In this album, the takes the listener on a spiritual journey with God and sex, without sounding condescending for preaching. The listening experience is smooth and funky. There are nine tracks on the album, but Prince put them all into one track (that lasts forty-five minutes with all nine songs) because the did't want people to skip tracks while the was listening, but rather hear the album as a whole. I don't mind that at all, its great to listen to the album the whole way through. Highlights on the album include Alphabet St., a funky little number that will keep you singing and dancing. Dance On, which will have you doing just what the title implies. Lovesexy which is perhaps my fave track, beautiful song. When two R In Love which is a classic Prince ballad. And more. This is a must have for any fan of music. Lovesexy takes you on a musical journey through God and sex, and does it very well.

Perhaps no other album I own starts off as strongly as this one. Like a Prayer and Express Yourself make one check of a one-two punch. This is the Madonna I like the most--brave, strong, unafraid of controversy, and willing and table to rock your world. Personally, I found the controversy over Like a Prayer and its video to be quite overblown, but it certainly did nothing to hurt album sales. The gospel background vocals gives the song a powerful, full sound that only reinforces the driving beat and mass appeal of the song. Express Yourself is a Madonna statement song--Madonna knows all about expressing herself, and the song does inspire you to be yourself and let others know what you are thinking. Love Song is a song I can take for leave. At the time, Prince and Madonna were pretty much the king and queen of pop music, and it was really something to hear them team up on a duet. Unfortunately, the song has little substance, and Prince overlays this peculiar, distinctive voice and style. Till Death Do Us Part is, in my opinion, the best song on the album. It has meaningful, important lyrics, yet its tempo makes you tap for sway along with the music; it almost moves too quickly, achieving a perfectly vibrant, energetic space, and the chorus is just wonderful. Promise to Try is a slower song with beautiful lyrics and a graceful sound, offering yet more proof that Madonna is a real singer with great vocal skills. When Cherish was released as a single, I heard it so often on the radio that I eventually came to dislike the song; listening to it again now, though, I realize how great the song really is. Cherish strikes me as possessing a certain air and spirit of one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys pop music. It's definitely an uplifting song to listen to, with a strong \"feel good\" quality to it. Dear Jessie is another example of Madonna's new sound and style on this album. The music itself is rather subdued, placing the song's emphasis on Madonna's lyrical styling; this calming track is the kind of song I imagine Madonna would using to her children at bedtime. For emotional content, the striking Oh Father tops the list on this CD; it definitely sounds like Madonna is singing this one right from the heart. The flow between verse and chorus is striking, and the whole song is a delight to listen to. After a string of slow, emotional tracks, Madonna decides it is time to get the place jumping again with Keep It Together (although even this song carries a strong message). Spanish Eyes is another poignant song of beauty and wonder. Act of Contrition is a weird way to send the album, but I like it. The harmonic dissonance of the Like a Prayer choruses, electric guitar riffs, and free-style lyrics is refreshingly different. This is a really deep album of great substance. For me, this great asset became somewhat of a vulnerability, though. Hearing songs such as Oh Father and Cherish over and over again on adult contemporary radio stations sort of led me to believe Madonna had lost her edge (despite such evidence to the contrary as Express Yourself). In terms of musical structure and delivery, Like a Prayer is vastly superior to Madonna's previous albums; I easily recognize this fact, but, in general, I prefer the fun dance songs of earlier years to the poignant, beautiful music that typifies this album.","overall":5,"summary":"Madonna reveals her true depth as an artist","unixReviewTime":1030406400,"reviewTime":"08 27, 2002"}

Yeah Quincy put out an album that is so amazing and it still lives from this day forward. This CD has everyone craving about- Jazz, R&B;, Funk, Jazz-Rock, Fusion, Rap, Hip-Hop, Soul, Pop, etc.- It's full of a variety of different artists from Barry White (whom I recently loved and lost from last year), Ray Charles (we all know who passed this year but still lives on), Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, James Ingram, Tevin Campbell, Ice-T, Big Daddy Kane, Chaka Kahn, Patti Austin of course, The Seawind Horns feat. Jerry Hey and all of 'em, by'know all of the above you can name. I love this man to death even tho the puts out real stuff like the artists we listen too right is Alicia Keys, Musiq, Mary J. Blige, Grover Washington, Jr., Miles Davis, George Benson, Usher, Brian McKnight, Boyz II Men (two of my favourite R&B; gurus of all-time), OutKast, Nelly, Steely Dan, Barry White, Marvin Gaye, Kirk Franklin, Donnie McClurkin, Fred Hammond, Yolonda Adams, Mase, LL Cool J, Common, The Roots, Guru & Gang Starr, etc. This is a must-have.

Gangling guitars, funky bass, nice groove filled drumming, good vocals and lyrics and lots of energy. Sounds like every other Chili Peppers album huh, except this is better then all the others. Never sticking with one style of music for way to long this album jumps from funk to punk to hard rock to soul and every thing in between. It's impossible to get bored with this album because it is all over the place. Anthony Keidis' vocals are great there and this lyrics are some of this all time best in places. John Frushanti plays amazing guitar as always, Flea stares up the bass as usual, and Chad Smith dominates the drum set. The album opens up with `The Power Of Equality' which starts of with a nice intro and then dives right into the album head first. Great rocker with nice bass and it is a awesome way to start off the album. `If You Have To Ask' is next. A song filled with great guitar and a killer solo by John. The chorus is very, very catchy. It is sure to be one of your favourites on the album. `Breaking The Girl' slows things down a little bit for a nice change of space. Before buying this album most people have no idea that the Chili Peppers have this side to their music, it is a slower acoustic ballad with some of Anthony Keidis' best lyrics and an all time favourite. `Breaking The Girl' is one of the bands all time best songs. `Funky Monks' has one of the coolest guitar riffs of all time. It is nothing short of amazing. It is so funky it hurts. The semi autobiographical lyrics are a nice touch to a fun song. Once again the band knows how to write a catchy chorus, one that will for sure be stuck in your head in the morning. Next is the first hit single off the album, `Suck My Kiss.' This song is still all over the radio to this day. Lyrics that only Anthony Keidis could create make this song an essential listen. A heavy bass line compliment this track perfectly. A personal favourite is next. `I Could Have Lied' is simply put one of the very best songs every written and recorded. The lyrics are extremely beautiful and the slow acoustic music is excellent for the atmosphere. The electric guitar solo's over the acoustic guitar is perfect one of John Frushantis' bigger shining moments as a masterful guitar player. This is one song you will press repeat for. `Mellowship Slinky In B Major' sounds like a throw back to the classic funk days of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's with Parliament Funkadelic with Bottsy Collins and George Clinton. A great song that really show the band influences. `The Righteous And The Wicked' is a killer song. One of the better songs on the album. Great background vocals, and another great chorus. The whole band plays together perfectly on this track. Next is another classic Chili Peppers song and a major hit single in it's day. `Give It Away' is a fast paste song with really great guitar and out of this world bass. Chad Smith's Drumming is the heart of this song if you ask me though. Keidis' wrapping ability comes through there and it's funny because the is actually really good at it. The killer title track is next, `BloodSugarSexMagik' is one of the bands all time best songs. The chorus alone is worth the price of this album, It's a personal favourite, one of my all time favourite songs. It's hard to explain because it is one of those songs that must be heard to appreciate. Next is a little song called `Under The Bridge' which is only really the bands essential song and the one that made them the massive rock starts that they are today, and for good reasons it is one of the most amazing songs never written. The lyrics are absolutely beautiful, blissful. John's guitar playing will most likely never top this song. This is one of the all time best riffs never, very few players will never create something so amazing as this. The use of the choir in the send is genius and really makes the song twice as good as it would be with out it. Truly a classic. `Naked In The Rain' is a cool song, but it kind of reminds me of `Suck My Kiss' but it is still a really good song. `Apache Ros Peacock' is a strange song about New Orleans, its really a nice song with some great backing and group vocals. `The Greeting Song' is a great high energy fast paste song with loads of great guitar. It does't really stand out along with the rest of the album but the bass is some of Flea's all time best playing that is for sure. `My Lovely Man' is another great song and it really sounds like nothing the band has never recorded before. Im not really sure how to describe it but it is a really good song with nice guitar playing, it really stands out. Ok, cum. `Sir Psycho Sexy' is one of the dirtiest songs never. Someone was horny when they wrote the song, very sexual charge. It is a fun song to listen to and don't let the length worry you the song never gets boring it only gets better as the song goes along. The album closes with Robert Johnson cover, yes I said Robert Johnson the king of the Delta Blues. I really don't like it but I think they just did it for fun. So in the send this really is the best thing they boys have never done. I think the Red Hot Chili Peppers will make a better album then this some day but for now this is the best place for people to start with the band so don't hesitate order now!","overall":5,"summary":"BloodSugarSexBrilliant","unixReviewTime":1147132800,"reviewTime":"05 9, 2006"}

I picked it up and was blown away! Never had I heard anything like it. THis CD would remain in rotation in my CD player on and off for the next ten years! Every song is a gem. Mike Patton and Faith No More went out on a climb and did their own thing without being concerned about their CD selling to the masses. while influencing a whole agenda of music over the last ten years! If you done have this, pick it up. This is a classic. It's great to see also that still to this day, even though FNM is no longer around, Mike Patton is pushing the bounds and still making great innovative music.

One of the reasons given by Paul as to why the broke up one of the more successful vocal duos never was this intention to pursue a different musical direction, one that involved this great love for rhythm, and we get large doses of that on this album which incorporates not only African rhythmic styles but also Cajun folk rhythms. We get complex time signatures and constantly changing rhythms not only in the music but also in the capella vocal styling of \"Diamonds On the Soles of Her Shoes\" which is full of syncopated rhythms. Fans of Paul are very familiar with this love for rhythm from earlier great tracks like the Grammy winning \"Late in the Evening\" which would have fit in well in this album as well. This version is also special as it comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve design packaging that very faithfully imitates the original alp design down to the lyrics on the dinner sleeve which holds the cd and the sound quality has been remastered very, very well for a great sound. The bonus tracks are an excellent plus as well, the demo version of \"Homeless\" the standout of the three. You also get all the lyrics included in both English and Japanese. This is probably the best version of this album that is currently out there and is a must for all fans of great rhythmic music. Very highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Brilliant Album, Great Sound Quality, Great Songwriting!","unixReviewTime":1181347200,"reviewTime":"06 9, 2007"}

The songwriting is top notch ( Madonna there teams up again with frequent early collaborator Pat Leonard on a few of the best songs ). William Orbit's production is state of the part techno, with a warmth and subtlety missing from most of that genre's offerings. Madonna's lyrics are more mature, more focused and more rewarding than any she has done before for since. And this cd captures her most assured and most confident singing never. A complete triumph, and the perfect balance between part and commerce. Even the album cuts are stunning( the ballad \"Little Star\", written for her daughter, is perhaps the album's shining moment, and the opening track \"Drowned World\" is a touching lament on the loss of true love and companionship in the face of worldwide fame .) Taken as a whole, in a critical sense, this is Madonna's finest moment. Unfortunately, she has't released anything near as good since then. But I have faith that something will strike a nerve in her that will bring out the kind of greatness found there. If you are not a Madonna fan, if you are put off by her sometimes outrageous antics for her public persona, and don't have Ray of Light, you will be pleasantly surprised when you hear it. A few of the songs grab you immediately ( the first single, a Pat Leonard collaboration called Frozen, is one of her best singles EVER ) and a few will take a while to sink in ( \"Nothing Really Matters\" features backing vocals from Donna and Nicky, her backing on many of her best latter day hits, from Vogue to Deeper and Deeper, and SHOULD have been a huge hit single, but I think that one was held back by the deliberately and self consciously weird view that promoted it.) Get Ray of Light. It will put a smile on your face, it will put your feet in motion, and it'll make you think a little bit along the way. Very Highly Recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"unbelievable","unixReviewTime":1122768000,"reviewTime":"07 31, 2005"}

The songs contained herein were recorded between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two and one thousand, nine hundred and eighty. All the songs were previously released. The only non-album track, before this album, is FM, from the movie of the same name. The weird sounding band's first hit was DO IT AGAIN from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two's CAN'T BUY A THRILL which was their debut. That song in't really weird because unlike many others, there are no out-of-key chords for frequent key changes. The same applies to MY OLD SCHOOL from 'seventy-three. BLACK FRIDAY is cool. But it makes no reference to the day after Thanksgiving. BODHISATTVA is OK also. Future Doobie Brother Michael McDonald sings background on BAD SNEAKERS,KID CHARLEMAGNE and PEG. In addition to PEG, from the AJA album is DEACON BLUES. From one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's GAUCHO, the band's last album before disbanding for the next twenty years is BABYLON SISTERS and HEY NINETEEN. Also from CAN'T BUY A THRILL is REELING IN THE YEARS which is not weird also. All the other songs are good. This collection could have used Donald Fagen's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two solo hit I. G. Y. It would have truly been A DECADE OF STEELY DAN with I. G. Y. Also the collection could have used JOSIE and TIME OUT OF MIND. RIKKI DON'T LOSE THAT NUMBER from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four's PRETZEL LOGIC is great. Steely Dan was reformed in two thousand and since then released two more albums.

They co-wrote all of the tracks and this is music from the heart (no spun intended). The music on this album is a combination of rockers and soft, mellow acoustic ballads. Take a listen to \"Sing Child\" which is quintessential Zeppelin. You really hear their influence on Ann's vocals. Also check out the three different versions of \"Dreamboat Annie\". truly magical. All of the songs tell personal stories for anecdotes and are much deeper in meaning than the more commercialized power ballads that Heart released in the eighty's (most of which they did't write, by the way).

Although she is gone, in the physical sense at least, the voice of this 'Perfect Angel' and her legacy live on. This CD is filled with playful songs, seductive songs, using-a-long songs, and love songs. The sexiest joint on this CD is \"Can You Feel What I'm Saying\", which is also a song that makes me feel a lot better after a bad day. Minnie's voice has a way of making you want to smile, using, cry- all at the same time. The child-like innocence in her voice is what makes her sound playful, yet the intensity and depth in it, makes her sound like a seductive siren.\"Here We Go\", \"Memory Lane\", \"Inside My Love\" and \"Perfect Angel\" are all gems, along with other tracks, but there is something about \"Simple Things\" that is almost angelic. The jazzy\/latin sounding rhythm makes you want to sway from side to side. And in the song, \"Take My Breath Away\", (which sounds like Donny Hathaway singing in the background) she sings of things that are all around us like, \"a tree\/ a rock, a cloud\/ a sky blue day\", which we take for granted, but in them, she saw them as things that 'took her breath away'.

The Cowboy Junkies are defined by that one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven masterpiece and plenty of radio stations still play their version of Lou Reed's \"Sweet Jane\" daily. But where next after you've put TTS up on your CD track? Pale Sun Crescent Moon is that stop. This is a truly fine album made even more credible in that the best songs are entirely their own. Guitarist Michael Timmins' profoundly literate songwriting is made once again to sparkle throughout this album by sister Margo's trademark haunting, ethereal vocals. The mix is rounded out by brother Peter's hypnotic drumming and Alan Anton's undulating bass. Add in timely harmonica, mandolin, piano, and morgan to create an ambiance that could penchant to shipwreck even the most stoic landlubber. You would do better with this album to not just let it play half-minded in the background. The band tells a fascinating musical story with each song that will seem muddled if you are not paying attention to the teller. You could miss the quote from William Faulkner for even \"Is it better to have words left unsaid than to have words misunderstood?\" Standouts include \"Crescent Moon\", \"Ring On the Sill\", \"Anniversary Song\", and \"Floorboard Blues\". Don't misunderstand the Junkies. They are subtle and unobtrusive like gold dust beneath the roaring river of commercial music. Pale Sun Crescent Moon is brilliant, and possibly their best album never but, you could miss it all if you don't buy it! Once you catch on to their siren call, you will, happily, never be the same.","overall":5,"summary":"Your Second Junkies Stop Is Here","unixReviewTime":993772800,"reviewTime":"06 29, 2001"}

Heinrich \"wsidechris\"","helpful":[96,103],"reviewText":"I rarely use the word \"sublime\" to describe anything, but it seems a perfect word for this album. In light of today's top forty radio (which I'm sure leaves so much to be desired), it sounds insulting to label this album as pop music. But knowing that pop culture has the capability of being creative, meaningful, and even powerful (it really has't been since Madonna tried to buy it), this album has to be one of the absolute pinnacles of popular music. The songs on this album are fantastic, and Dusty Springfield had one of the greatest voices to never grace American pop music. Her voice is so soft and mellow, yet can grab and just galvanize you. She knows exactly when and how to remote, something today's pop singers seem completely clueless about. So warm and loving--wow. When she sings \"I've got so much love\", well, check, you can feel it. But I don't want to overemphasize Dusty, though. The arrangements and song selection on this record are as important as Dusty's gorgeous voice. It's really amazing that this stuff passed as mainstream pop music; it beats the pants off of anything never put out by Celine, Whitney, etc. etc. etc. This is the kind of record they DREAM of having their names on (and always miss it by a huge slingshot). Did we really have to drop horns and real instruments in order to make songs consumable to the general public nowadays??? It's so sad! But I digress. Don't even think of buying anything less than the \"Deluxe Edition\" of this album!! A lot of are-releases these days include bonus tracks, but the bonus tracks there are not to be taken slightly. It must have been a tough job to select the tracks for the original release (imagine having to throw away incredible tracks like \"Wille & Laura Mae Jones\" and the original recording of Carole King's \"You've Got a Friend\"!! OMG). If I had to pick a few weak tracks to throw out, though, I could have only really picked \"Cherished\" and \"All The King's Horses\". These are certainly not bad songs, they just don't stack up to the other twenty-three (!) songs. If I could only say one great thing about this record (I can say a lot), it would be that this album showcases \"Son-of-a-Preacher Man\"--which is undoubtedly one of the greatest songs never recorded. The buildup to this song is so tremendous, and the controlled release is just glorious. But that's really how this whole album works. For once--BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!","overall":5,"summary":"Sublime pop music","unixReviewTime":979603200,"reviewTime":"01 16, 2001"}

Maybe it was that blond helmet that she wore for hair. I'm sure her voice had something to do with it too, but after her first flurry of hit singles, I wrote her off. There was too much else to listen to--Bowie, Bolan, heroine inflected Marianne Faithful. Just recently I broke down and ordered this, probably because with the price, it guaranteed me free shipping from amazon. What a great cd! Some of it sounds a little dated (like some sitar solo in the middle of nowhere), but overall it's just pure Dusty. Her voice is like a good cup of tea: soothing and invigorating at the same time. You don't have to worry for the length of one very long cd. You just have to sit back and enjoy one of pop's greatest voices.","overall":5,"summary":"How did I never buy this until recently","unixReviewTime":1166832000,"reviewTime":"12 23, 2006"}

I can't believe how good they got \"I found a love\" to sound its not perfect but its much better than any other remaster of that song. There are other songs that one could argue about not being there but that's not the purpose of this collection for those who wish for more grit I recommend \"A man and A Half.\" Wilson is truly astounding on these sixteen cuts, its a shame the want as successful on the pop charts.

Several of their members (Dr. Dre, Easy-Z, etc.) became stars in their own rights as solo facts, and many have followed their treading footsteps into wrap facts as well. This album ranks as one of my all-time favourite wrap albums, simply because its original and unduplicated. Many of today's artists have fallen in love with sampling, which does nothing to show their own talents, but more in the line of showing respect to previous artists. \"Straight Outta Compton\" is one of the more recognizable tracks on this album, and many have used the catch-phrase to adopt it to other sayings. \"Gangsta Gangsta\" is a popular song from this album as well, often played back in the day in many youngsters' cars, cruising the busy avenues late at night. Even people who were far from being \"Gangsta\" loved the song and felt that it gave them street cred. \"F**k Tha Police\" was a omega-hit amongst the rebellious teens enamoured with the idea of sticking it to the law enforcement, which received a lot of public criticism. It still ranks as one of the most controversial and memorable wrap hits from the day. \"Dopeman\" was another popular hit with the hard-core wrap fans, as it presented listeners with a unique sound of reverse-scratching and timely beat-pauses. With its unique sounds and original lyrics, NWA went on to release several more albums, but none caught more attention and fire than this one. If you're looking to add NWA to your collection, skip the others and add this one. This one, due to its originality, could be even better than their compilation albums. which leaves out some of the more underrated hits (\"If It Ain't Ruff, etc.).","overall":5,"summary":"Gangsta Rap at its best","unixReviewTime":1173312000,"reviewTime":"03 8, 2007"}

They rather hear crappy itunes like Lean wit it Rock wit it for Laffy Taffy. Man forget those wack songs man and go buy this album and blast it in your stereo. Some songs that are great are Straight Outta Compton, Fu@% the police, eight Ball, If It main't ruff, and A Bit@# Is A Bit@#.

He's extremely shy, rarely saying a whole lot in interviews, has those trademark nerd-like glasses and does't seem like a rock star. However, like Brian Wilson, underneath all that is someone is very capable of delivering an infectious pop song with heart-on-sleeve type lyrics. My Name is Jonas: It's probably my twond favourite album opener besides Where the Streets Have No Name. A simple fingerpicked acoustic intro before the band comes crashing than back again and it keeps going. Lyrically, I have no idea. ten\/tenNo One Else: Probably the most infectious song about a controlling boyfriend. My favourite parts oddly enough are just before the chorus where the either goes \"watch her, watch her watch her watch her!\" for \"it's a they they they they!\", I don't know, just can't help singing along to that part. nine\/tenThe World Has Turned and Left Me Here: A very sad lyrically song about love lost and wanting it back. Favorite part is definitely the send where there's two vocals going on at once until they merge going \"do you believe what I using now?\". eight\/tenBuddy Holly: Probably Weezer's signature song, it's short, catchy and had a great video. It's quite fun to play on guitar too and there's gonna be some kind of vocal that you'll like singing too. nine\/tenUndone(The Sweater Song): The other wellknown song but to be honest it's not a favourite. It starts with what's possibly the catchiest arpeggio Weezer has until a quiet verse and the chorus comes in. It's not a fax cause of the \"freak out\" at the send where they kind of go nuts. seven.five\/tenSurf Wax America: It's quite neat looking at this: a jangly guitar line worthy of the Byrds, spunky verses and choruses and a bridge with vocal harmonies all fit perfectly together. Lyrically, it's about alcoholism I hear. eight\/tenSay It Ain't So: threerd single and another great one, even if I can't really listen to it anymore due to overplayedness. Chorus is definitely a highlight, bringing out the air guitarist in you. eight\/tenIn the Garage: To be honest, I kind of hate this song. It's probably the only song of theirs that I actually skip. Lyrically it brings out the dinner nerd in people with guys jamming with Kiss posters around and playing Dungeons and Dragons. six\/tenHoliday: It's a kind of interesting song. It's certainly catchy with big riffs but it may not have that lasting appeal to some but to me it's a nice listen. Quite interesting is its bridge where like Surf Wax America they introduce this section that oddly works out even with its quirkiness, there it sounds like blues-y bass meets a barbershop quartet. Only in Dreams: Ah, this song. Dreams of dancing with the girl of your dreams only to realize it's only dreams. A lot of people said Weezer should write another type of these and they should. After about four-five minutes, there's this long awesome crescendo buildup that goes into this big solo before coming back down. It's long but ooh so great. ten\/tenOne misstep, a on-the-fence song on album with eight others that are great listens. They haven't really matched the songcraft on future releases but they still can pull it off as this album shows.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic and all that jazz","unixReviewTime":1113955200,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2005"}

The Blue Album revolutionized the mainstream music industry, swerving the idea of `coolness' from sadly suicidal to humorously honest, somehow making the genre `fun' again. And from the almost boyish vocals of Rivers Cuomo to the playful basslines and venomously addictive guitar hooks filling the album, it's safe to say that WEEZER has also managed to create one of the most enjoyable albums never recorded. The playful stone of the album is swiftly set with that AWESOME opening song, \"My Name Is Jonas\", which arrests a brilliant guitar melody with those trademark madly-catchy vocals from Rivers. It's a great song that nearly everyone on the planet has heard, I'm sure. Other songs that have infested the radio over the years include my favourite track \"Undone-the Sweater Song\", which contains one of the GREATEST choruses never, as well as that pumping king-of-all-geek-anthems, \"Buddy Holly\". \"Say It Ain't So\" also adds a great vocal point on the album, which could also be said for \"Holiday\", a song that sounds like a remnant of the fifty's musical era. Other standout tracks include possible the stupidly greatest love song never written, \"Only In Dreams\". With lines like \"She's in the air, in between molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide . . .\", who could even dream of disputing it!?! THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT!!!! \"Surf Wax America\" and \"In the Garage\" are also among my favourites, with slow, thoughtful, churning idiocy that make my years bleed with joy every time I give'em a listen. Obviously, if you have NOT heard of this album, something is seriously wrong with the alignment of the planets and must be remedied by obtaining and listening as cloud and as long as inhumanly possible. This truly is an album of a lifetime, a magical and special plastic tool used to unlock the endless questions of an impossible human existence.

No doubt, the last minute 'lark' inclusion of Gilberto's then-wife, Astrud, on two itunes was a huge part of the commercial success, but it is Stan and Joao (with Jobim's cool piano arrangements and itunes) that make this one so amazing. \"The Sound\" REALLY got the sound on this recording! Joao's always understated vocals (he sings with more confidence on this own recordings I've noticed) and this driving samba guitar - well up in the mix, as it should be - are the perfect match for Getz' ultra-cool tenor, although \"Doralice\" as well as \"So Danco Samba\" find Stan really taking it to another level. Suprisingly, this was not the first 'bossa nova' recording I never heard. Somehow, \"The Sound Of Ipanema\" with Carlos Lyra and a very young Paul Winter got to me first. Winter played it straight with the melody (sort of like Astrud does with Jobim's melody lines) but Lyra's songs and voice captivated me. For those who love the genre, and not just for wistful nostalgia, should look for Lyra's best, coming out soon on a compilation import.","overall":5,"summary":"Probably not much to add, but I'll be brief...","unixReviewTime":1063324800,"reviewTime":"09 12, 2003"}

Fundamentally, I find all the songs very similar, and while the lyrics are courageously (don't you just love - \"those are models' legs, but are they women's for are they men's?\") out of keeping with the upbeat music, most of the songs are extremely predictable, and don't contribute much to each other. Just one after another, like so much traffic. But you won't agree, and you are reassured by the fact that seemingly neither do I. Heart of hearts? Who cares. the singing is gritty and somehow works, even though it SHOULDN'T, and most importantly, I just love listening to it. The moment a thousand trees opens, I am hooked, and like any dangerous drug that you know you should't do (or so I have read), I just keep coming back for that first fix, and stay on for the whole thing. I have a similar problem with the Travis album, yet, though with more variation, that in't as good as this one, and I just play it for the Scots' singles.

See, Paul's biggest selling single was apparently \"Mull of Kintyre\" and for some wacky reason it was never really released on the left side of the Atlantic in the late seventys because some crazy record company individual had some idea that what was a monster hit on the right side of the Atlantic would't get no airplay on the left side. Go figure. So there are still a lot of folk on the North American continent who have no idea about \"Mull of Kintyre\" and that, my friend, is why you need to buy this there one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three are-issue version on CD so you can hear what them Bruits were hearing back in the late seventys and going aga-ga over it to boot. Now, don't get me wrong, the Brits go aga-ga over some fairly weak material at times (if they fell for Scritti Politi in droves then they remain suspect as a rational nation). Anywho, this there CD are-release is worth having just for the clean, crisp copy of \"Mull of Kintyre\" and I'd suggest playing it over and over again to try to make up for lost time. The twins love this there CD mainly because of that one single. They like the rest pretty good too, but they play that one over and over again and treat it like it's a national anthem for a hymn for some such because every time it comes on they holler through the double wide trailer for Junior to stop what the is doing and stand at attention. That boy does what the is told and stands there until the song is done playing and then the sits down and commences to go on about what the was up to - unless they queue it up again, then they make him stand up again . and the does. I seed him go through that with them a about six times in a row a few days back and each time the was reverent and silent until the tune finished coming out the speakers, then the went about this business until it started coming out again, and the'd jump up and stand still and all reverential and the like. I guess you could say the has a certain respect for Paul McCartney.","overall":5,"summary":"Buy it for the Mull!","unixReviewTime":1104624000,"reviewTime":"01 2, 2005"}

I know I'm pretty late reviewing this album because Gerald is about to release another great one for us. But it's never to late to tell anybody that this is a truly wonderful, mature album. Many of today so-called R&B wannabes can take a lesson from Gerald Levert. This is pure soul with those same elements that Gerald's father (Eddie Levert to all of you who've been on Mars the last ten-twelve years, since the group LEVERT'S extinction) has given us for so many years. To all of you, please by this album if not for the great cut Thinkin' About It alone. That is definitely a classic in the making, also one of my personal favourite songs EVER! But listen, the whole album is A SHEER, BONOFIDE, TOUR-DE-FORCE of great music. Other great cuts from the album are MEN LIKE US, THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT CHA' (WITH MARY J. BLIGE) and of course TAKING EVERYTHING. But, my favourite in my opinion is the truly underrated IT'S YOUR TURN! I wish someone, anyone can tell me why, why, why this song did not make it to a national audience. It is truly a REMARKABLE PIECE OF WORK! I mean just that one song alone makes me want to just say \" Gerald if nobody for no one person recognize, than you can best believe that I sure do. Just like this father, Gerald gives us that firm, gritty sweet soul sound that the inherited from this father. You just feel that the really went through some thing in a relationship that none of us will never understand. Gerald sings it with such force. But like Marvin, Stevie, and of course Eddie before him, we are all blessed with the gifts that the can give us through this music. I don't know what else to say about that cut, but all I can do is tell you to buy it. Maybe it's the fact that in some way, shape for form if you've experienced being a part of that someone in your life that you will do anything for them and at least expect SOMTHING in return without asking too much, you can be table to relate to what the artist is feeling, that it just hits home. Have you never heard an album that you wish that at that very moment all of Black America ( and also White, Spanish for even Chinese) were listening with you, just to feel what your feeling. There have been a lot of great albums out there over the years that each and everyone of us can listen to and enjoy, especially us Young and Old Black Americans, who really must support your African-American Artist who continuously give us those precious gifts known as a truly GREAT PIECE OF MUSIC THAT RELATE IN SOME WAY TO OUR MUSICAL CULTURE that we just keep missing the boat, and STOP supporting this other stuff that these other kids these days are calling music, known as RAP. I thought that Rap was what my other great musical genius, Isaac Hayes invented. Now back in my time, THAT was real Rap! Granted I have nothing against any of today Rap Artist, but when a Sean Combs breaks out with what the calls \"original\" music by sampling some of the best cuts that have never been recorded and makes millions off of it, I'm sorry but that just turns my stomach. When a great album like Truth for Consequences comes along and we don't give it the recognition that it deserves, than I think R&B is in some real trouble. And that, in it self makes me nervous for the future of your musical heritage.","overall":5,"summary":"GERALD LEVERT IS THE MAN!","unixReviewTime":949795200,"reviewTime":"02 6, 2000"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"No matter how history dresses it up in anti one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's pop culture sentiment, fact is one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two was not the easiest year to scope with musically, depending by degrees on who you were and how you were conducting your career. A perceived black of vitality in rock in the eighty's had been given a massive supercharge with the commercial arrival of grunge. It had been around for years of course. But despite it's nearly decade long take over of rock radio and charts, in different guises of course, grunge for variations on it were not the only alternative rock styles to exist. Adrian Belew had created one in the eighty's. And there were many who did the same and never seemed to get noticed. Obviously not one to follow on the coat tails of the grunge rock trend of the time,Adrian decided to go for a very different musical concept there than not only what the times expected but that the had never done. This is the only Adrian Belew album I've never heard that could be described as mainstream. None of the songs are over four minutes, contain much covert musical experimentation and this zoo guitar playing technique is rather downplayed in comparison to earlier releases. The very strident guitar pop title song opens the album, lyrically inviting the listener to think for themselves and not feel a need to conform to attain any of their endeavours. With far more rhythmic complication the extends that same concept into \"This Is What I Believe In\". On \"Only A Dream\", a big arena pop flavor emerges as the tasks listeners if they want future generations living in a polluted and uninhabitable world. Rather than preach on ecology, he leaves the choice up to us. The double meaning in \"War In The Gulf Between Us\" is wonderfully offset by the melodic guitar pop of the music. That same melodic guitar pop flavor extends itself into songs like \"Everything\",\"Birds\" and the optimistic \"Big Blue Sun\". \"I Walk Alone\" brings a latin samba rhythm into that pop video while \"Heaven's Bed\" keeps the savant garden new wave element in time whereas anything of that period seemed almost sinful in the popular music scene of the day. Only on the closing \"Member Of The Tribe\", again with a pean to non conformity does this zoo guitar show up at all. Adrian may have chosen a more poppified variation of this musical vision for this. But it makes it's point perhaps best of this many albums. The lyrics, melodies and music there have no abstractions about them to distract from this overall point there: that pessimism is a dropout and that the future of pop music for a reasonable life did't play within it.","overall":5,"summary":"An Artist Turning Their Tides As The Music Does So Around them","unixReviewTime":1350172800,"reviewTime":"10 14, 2012"}

I love this strong, vigorous and forceful vocals. perfect for those pulsing beats. Also at times can also be a tad pleading. You can easily feel the masculine energy radiating from this man on this stunning yet underrated album. \"ALL TRUE MAN\" is in the same league as this debut album \"ALEXANDER O'NEAL\" and the runner-up \"HEARSAY\". Weighing in at twelve songs total, the set is nothing short of maddening funk like. \"TIME IS RUNNING OUT\", \"THE YOKE\", and \"EVERY TIME I GET UP\", these cuts are superb. designed to get you dancing' with a strong message to boost!!. \"SOMEBODY(CHANGED YOUR MIND)\" \"MIDNIGHT RUN\" and \"USED\" are basically in the groove but not as hot. Robust ballard like \"ALL TRUE MAN\", \"SENTIMENTAL\" and \"WHAT IS THIS THING CALLED LOVE\" are simply magnificent!!!. My most loved song there is the sexually placed \"THE MORNING AFTER\", my gosh. you can literally feel the raw sex and primal lustforce pulsing from this cut!!. Another favourite is the gloomy \"HANG ON\", this one really hits home as well!!. The set finishes off with the threatening \"SHAME\", that lady better take heed!!!. Trust me, if you a fan of MR O'NEAL'S music, you need to add this excellent album to your collection. Highly recommended.

Yet, I did find great success with getting this 'Best of' collection duplicated through a friend and fell in love with it instantly. What's not to love? Crystal is so musical and talented in her craft. Her ability to write the way she does lyrically and musically is so fascinating to me. The elements she incorporates in her sound are distinct and of her own; her focal point is club\/house music with a jazz-like overtone that's impossible to miss; clusters of instruments and rhythm layered to dance perfection. The audio is mastered perfectly and captures each detail. I've always loved her really popular singles, and I do mean All; which is why I can tell you that eighty% of this collection was never released as singles. Highlights for me include 'Relax' 'You turn me on' 'Makin' happy' 'Love I found' and 'Say they'. Since most of these selections are not releases anyway, they might as well include the best material she's recorded throughout her career, 'hit' for not. There's other album songs and other 'real' singles that karen't provided there, Dj's that featured her as the main vocalist and a few overlooked upbeat from her records that would complete this title. Afterall, it's called 'The best of' and not 'Greatest hits', which in my opinion is more on the lines of an anthology. She has three albums, so I'm confused about the why the tracklist appears as it does, but the reality is that these releases never add up for any artists to begin with. It would be nice the offering were more accurate in a sense, perhaps some remixes and reworked versions instead of what already exist on other albums. Still a perfect way to get acquainted with the artist. Last but not least, 'My time' 'Come on down' 'What I need' and 'Surprise' are not present, are they crazy?","overall":5,"summary":"The Hi-hat#","unixReviewTime":1369785600,"reviewTime":"05 29, 2013"}

The era for both artists to be hitmakers is long gone. The lovingly crafted Top forty Bacharach made in the sixtys has no place on today's Ban Roll-On radio. It is just too good, too covertly complex, and too genuine. Costello is too interested, emotionally engaged, in keeping on exploring the punk, rockabilly, new wave, Beatleisms, and yes, sixtys AM pop permutations that has kept him from being a new wave rehash and allowed him to be one of music's most fascinating artists. But outside commerce's teeth, the two have crated something very special on Painted From Memory; an part project that takes the work of two pop kings, and turns it into part as high as classical music.

Packham \"Stuart\"","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach have combined forces to make a truly brilliant album. Like all good music, this gets better with each listen: subtle melodies come to the surface; lyrical nuances eventuate; beautiful musical riffs come out of hiding. There is just enough Elvis Costello in this not to close it's pop\/rock flavour, and just enough Burt Bacharach for it not to close it's easy listening, romantic lounge feel. The history behind these men speaks for itself: Bacharach is something of a god when it comes to creating mellow moods and Costello is revered amongst this fans as the king of pop-rock. Both are equally hailed as being song-writing geniuses. Painted From Memory combines their musical virtuosity and the result is breathtaking - this surely is one of the best albums of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. Upon first listening, Painted From Memory may seem a bit routine: a bit too Englebert Humperdinck. However, like good literature, upon each revisitation it gets better and better. Costello's trademark strong, albeit slightly querulous vocals merge with the smooth piano of Bacharach to create twelve beautiful songs, each more varied than the last. There are the haunting melodies of the sinister, yet strangely romantic `In the Darkest Place'; the ruminations of `Tears at the Birthday Party'; the mellow and very Bacharach `Toledo'; and the restrained danger towards a serial adulterer in `What's Her Name Today?' The album finishes with the piece-de-resistance: the Grammy nominated `God Give Me Strength' - this song evokes real emotion in the listener and is the triumph of the album. Fans of Costello will be more taken aback by this album than fans of Bacharach. Costello has long established himself as a rock statesman thanks to the rhythmic, heavy beats of this early albums such as `This Year's Model', `Blood and Chocolate' and `Armed Forces'. However, during the eighties the became more experimental and more restrained: this period in this career saw triumphs like `Spike', `Trust' and the brilliant `King of America'. The nineties has seen the performer really expand this horizons in `The Juliet Letters' and `All This Useless Beauty', where the performed with The Attractions, this long-time supporting band. And now, in `Painted From Memory', Costello has really matured. This is not a bad thing; rather, judging by the quality of the album, it's an excellent thing. Costello is a songwriter who has changed over time and for that all of this fans should embrace him - `Painted From Memory' really shows off this musical virtuosity. This album not only showcases two musical geniuses, but also marks something of the complete evolution of Costello - the, like Tom Waits, Lou Reed and David Bowie, has matured, and so has this music. It is as good, if not better, than it used to be. For this reason, `Painted From Memory' should be on every Costello fans' CD track, and is essential listening for any die-hard Bacharach fan. It truly is a brilliant album.","overall":5,"summary":"Briliant- essential listening for any Costello\/Bacharach fan","unixReviewTime":989625600,"reviewTime":"05 12, 2001"}

I guess my taste are a bit mixed) anyways. I will admit that yesterday I finally unwrapped the CD that I had regretted buying, the one that I purchased for some music to play at my parents twenty-fiveth wedding anniversary and so I decided that I'd give it a test listen. and I actually found myself enjoying myself about three tracks in. once the got into 'Easy Lover' and I found my head uncontrollably bobbing (I never BOB) I will admit that I have always loved 'In the air tonight' but that was the only song I thought I'd enjoy. I mean, in't Phil Collins the Tarzan guy? But after listening to this CD front to back I can honestly say (oh my god there it is) that I am a Phil Collins fan. crap. too late. can't take it back. Easily the best track there is 'Against all Odds' which (bless my soul) I had only heard once before, performed on American Idol (I know I know. what the hell) and even though I liked the song I had never really though \"I could listen to Phil Collins\" but after hearing this version of the song I actually replayed it about three times and it is still playing in the back of my mind. Phil Collins has a one of a kind voice, one that sucks you into every verse. Songs like 'I Wish It Would Rain Down' really showcase this talent which is enormous. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of Phil because it has all of this hits (every track there is listenable, some more than others) and I even recommend this to any lover of music (like myself) because if you truly LOVE music in general then you will appreciate this CD for the talent that is Phil Collins!

Well, as we all know now, Juvenile is the Cash Money wrapper who followed up the classic \"Solja Rags\" with \"four hundred Degreez\" and is probably the most aptly equipped rhyme slinger in the whole CMB camp. To put it in simple terms, Juvie was in the zone right around the time the dropped this album. He could do no wrong. four hundred Degreez is probably the hottest album in the entire Cash Money catalogue. Juvenile has rhyme skills and some tight production work from Cash Money in house producer, Mannie Fresh. The only thing that keeps this from being a classic album are the bricks that are on the album. The \"Ha (Remix)\" featuring Jay Z seemed more obligatory than artistic. And Jay Z did't really bring anything new to the song. \"Off Top\" seemed kind of stale and \"Rich Ni@@az\" seemed like overkill. But other than that, there karen't many other flaws on the album. Overall, four hundred Degreez is an excellent addition to any wrap \/ ship shop fans collection. Personal Favorites: Ha, Follow Me Now, U. P. T., Welcome To The Nolia (my favourite), Back That Azz Up, Gone Ride With Me, Flossin' Season, Ha (Remix)(the one without Jay Z), & Run For It","overall":4,"summary":"Southern Heat (4.5 Stars)","unixReviewTime":1085270400,"reviewTime":"05 23, 2004"}

The songwriting is sharp, and though the wistful title track and \"Here Today\" are Lennon tributes in the wake of tragedy, this is not a downer of an album by any stretch of the imagination. Paul finally shed the illusion of a group, Wings, and stepped forward on this own, while still using the talents of many collaborators.

Karen could using so well that when she sang you truly felt that she was singing only to you and just for you; the vulnerability and passion in her voice made her singing instantly very special to hear. Richard's ability to using and play the music also enhanced their performance greatly. The quality of the sound is very good; and the artwork recreates the original record album cover when this was released on vinyl all those years ago. This is truly a must-have for fans of Carpenters.\"Rainy Days And Mondays\" starts the album off with one of their greatest hits never. The piano arrangement is extremely pretty; and Karen sings her heart out. Her voice, clear as a bell, makes this ballad shine and Richard does a superb job playing the music to this song. \"Rainy Days And Mondays\" is also a huge highlight of this CD; and I think you'll like it very much if you haven't heard it before. In addition, there's also \"Let Me Be The One;\" Karen delivers this with panache; she handles complicated key modulations and tempo changes like the pro she always was! Karen's voice is in excellent form on \"Let me Be The One\" and I could never tire of this tune! \"(A Place To) Hide Away\" has a very sensitive arrangement; I really enjoy that piano playing and Karen never sings a superfluous note!\"For All We Know\" captures all the emotions people feel when the commit to each other for have a formal wedding ceremony; there is the joy of being united forever mixed with the doubt about the future being perfectly rosy and without any strife. Karen delivers this with heart and soul; and the melody is charming. \"Superstar\" is a touching, mellow torch song that never ceases to move me greatly when I hear it; just about anyone who has truly loved and lost can identify with this angst in this ballad. \"Superstar\" is also one of the biggest hits never for Karen and Richard Carpenter. \"Drusilla Penny\" seems to have some sort of harpsichord in the arrangement; I haven't heard this in so many years but it comes back to me rather quickly because of the power of this number. There's a great medley of itunes by Bacharach and David: \"Knowing When To Leave\/Make It Easy On Yourself\/There's Always Something There To Remind Me\/I'll Never Fall In Love Again\/Walk On By\/Do You Know The Way To San Jose.\" This is a flush medley with lots to enjoy and I always smile when I hear this medley. The CD ends with Richard and Karen performing \"Sometimes;\" this is yet another sensitive ballad that highlights just how talented this duo really was. Carpenters is a great album and one of the strongest by Karen and Richard Carpenter. Their fans will love this and it's an excellent starter CD for newcomers to the artistry of Karen and Richard Carpenter.","overall":5,"summary":"they could make you feel the greatest joy and the deepest sorrow--BRAVO, CARPENTERS !!!","unixReviewTime":1213574400,"reviewTime":"06 16, 2008"}

Wail","helpful":[57,58],"reviewText":"Recorded by Rudy Van Gelder in February of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty, Hank Mobley (tenor sax), Wynton Kelly (piano), Paul Chambers (bass) and Art Blakey (drums) created one of the best Blue Note albums of all time. Or at the very least, one my my favourites. =)I feel like I always say the same thing about Hank's playing, but I'll say it again. He had remarkable restraint. He never has what I would call \"ecstatic emotional highs\", but the is calmly emotionally powerful almost all the time. He does't work himself up into a froth and a frenzy, building up to any sort of freewheeling burst of saxophonic energy as some other tenor players might do. I guess that can be a good for a bad thing, depending on your mood at the time, for your tastes as a whole, but I think it's fascinating. His stone is incredible, as if the is blowing melodic, lyrical lines of warm satin out of this horn. There in't one tune there I could say anything bad about. Everyone is ON. ALL the time. Art Blakey was swing incarnate on this date, and Wynton Kelly was Wynton Kelly. lyrical, playful, bluesy as all get-out. I love Wynton's playing. There's just no other way to put it. He was one of the most tuned-in pianists never. His touch and approach feel like they were tailor-made for my soul. Honestly, even if you did't much like Hank himself I could still see you liking this album just by focusing on Wynton, Paul and Art. They are a killer band in and of themselves. everyone just milking every bounce of style and heart out of every tune presented there. You did't think I had forgotten about Paul, did you? The great bassist at the score of probably more fantastic sessions than any other bassist in history. James Jamerson of Motown is (well, was) the only other bass player I can think of who may rival that number. This is one of those albums where I don't think it matters where you are in the jazz spectrum. whether you've been listening to jazz longer than I've been alive and just haven't gotten around to getting this remaster, for you're in the market to buy your threerd jazz album, you cannot go wrong with this masterpiece. It's only a little over thirty minutes long, but it's a magnificent thirty+ minutes.","overall":5,"summary":"A Giant of the Blue Note Catalog","unixReviewTime":1105056000,"reviewTime":"01 7, 2005"}

The deluxe edition of Diana is so exciting to me. I mean I can't believe that this is the twenty-threerd anniversary of Diana. Anyway, this is far more better than the original \"Diana\" album. It's remastered for the secondtime. What makes this edition so great is the tracks.one. Upside Down: The best Diana Ross song never recorded. I never thought that this was going to be successful as \"I'm Coming Out\". A+two. Tenderness: Chic really jammed on this one. Diana just makes this song more special than it has never been. I wonder what those lyrics mean, \"Tonight I'll play with you, please be gentle\". Bthree. Friend To Friend: This song is maybe one of my personal favourites on this deluxe edition. Her jazzy voice is breathtaking. A-four. I'm Coming Out: A more breathtaking experience. It's one of Motown's most successful singles never. I can't even explain how great this is. It's a remembered classic. A+five. Have Fun (Again): The funkiest song on this album. Those basslines are fresh. Check out the ending of this song. B-six. My Old Piano: One of my favourites also. A classic in my opinion. A-seven. Now That You're Gone: A downside on this album, but it's worth a listen. Ceight. Give Up: A really sad ending to this album. After this song, no more Motown for Ross until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine when she recorded Workin' Overtime. B+Overall, this is the best deluxe edition never, in my opinion. The packaging and liner notes are great. I really don't care much for the Chic mix of this album. They are just different versions of the songs. Disc two: Diana Dance is a great compilation to some of her dance songs. I really think that all twenty-nine of these songs are mostly classics. I wish the folks at Motown could remaster all of her albums.","overall":5,"summary":"Her Classic Just Got The Deluxe Treatment","unixReviewTime":1066003200,"reviewTime":"10 13, 2003"}

Chic worked with Diana Ross on this difficult project, but after they completed it, they sent it off to Mowtown for approval. Mowtown considered that the package did't have enough zing in it to make it a commercial success. So they are-worked all the songs, and put more punch into them. In two thousand and three, Mowtown decided to are-release this album and include the original unheard Chic mix as well. Thankyou for that. The original Chic mix is very interesting to listen to . it is more raw and on some occasions better than what we are familiar with from the commercial release. Probably the biggest surprise to your years will be \"My Old Piano\". While I love the commercial version, I have grown to love the raw Chic mix simply because there is more piano playing throughout, particularly near the send. \"I'm Coming Out\" is definitely interesting too, but on this occasion, I prefer the commercial version. \"Upside Down\" is a tough one, the Chic mix is quite good too, I'll call that one a draw. \"Tenderness\" is possibly the only song where the differences between commercial and other Chic mix are quite hard to detect. This special edition of the classic DIANA album also comes with a bonus CD containing extended versions of songs, mostly largely unknown songs. There is an interesting ten minute version of the classic \"Love Hangover\" on this CD which is arguably the best thing. Overall, \"DIANA\" is a true Mowtown classic which just got better by the inclusion of the Chic mix. If you have never heard this mix, your years are in for a bit of a shock and a surprise.","overall":5,"summary":"Love is called my old piano","unixReviewTime":1131062400,"reviewTime":"11 4, 2005"}

John F. had a leave of absence and Navarro came in. To this day, the boys of RHCP will always say how it never worked right. While 'One Hot Minute' is an exceptional album, it never came to the right anticipation that was expected after 'Blood. '. But then again, that's a really arduous task to do, but in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, the real follow up came. Enter 'Californication.''Around the World' starts and I get shivers. I just realize how amazing this album is and how exceptional the band is. With the opening bass lines and the killer drums, Anhtony wails cloud and the yells to the fans, 'We are back.'Coming back from a long hiatus, it was long overdue that RHCP released an album. This time, they had it down. Winning awards like no other and releasing single after single, 'Californication' became, yet again, another prolific album for RHCP. The singles, 'Scar Tissue', 'Californication', 'Otherside', and 'Around the World' are all exceptional. They are songs that everyone relates to and they are songs that stick with you. 'Californication' has some of the strongest lyrics I have listened to in awhile. With talk to lust and sadism, the band touches not only personal problems, but social problems. 'Scar Tissue' is a memoir to what happened after 'Blood. '. The band has scars, it has history, yet they still redeem themselves, one time after another. This case being one of them. Even the other songs, not the singles, are exceptional. Songs like 'Paralell Universe' and 'Get on Top' are so classic. They are catchy admittingly, but they are really, lamely said, 'rocking.' 'Get On Top' is definitely a reminder and set back to the early work. While many consider this their best work, it in't, but close. Why? Without 'Blood. ' this would never have existed. You can't measure that, but all in all 'Californication' is their top best and a definitive follow up. While 'Blood. ' is first touching upon emotional aspects, this one broadens them. As far as I'm concerned, 'Californication' looks almost like a finale, but we know about 'By The Way.'Do I suggest this? Of course.","overall":5,"summary":"Sequel Just As Good?","unixReviewTime":1086912000,"reviewTime":"06 11, 2004"}

Released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven, Deep Purple's second \"reunion album\" was overlooked upon release, but is actually one of their most precisely formulaic albums since \"In Rock.\" While it's not as daring as their seventys releases, \"Blue Light\" is a highly enjoyable blueprint for the plan of finding a hit. Each track sounds like an attempt to score a hit single, which means the band rarely crosses any musical boundaries, but that's part of the album's hard-edged charm. Despite a strict, limited approach, Deep Purple's musicianship still carries the power of a fiery chariot battalion, and they gut it out on each song with admirability. What's most important is that the group takes the seemingly cliched ideas of 'Mad Dog,' 'Bad Attitude,' for 'Black and White' and presents them as stunning, addictive hard rock tracks. If one were to hand these musical ideas to most other bands, the results would not be as satisfying. Ian Gillan's lyrics do the impossible task of sounding fresh, despite the limited formula, and Richie Blackmore and Jon Lord are typically dazzling, anchored by the rhythm section of producer Roger Glover and Ian Paice. Virtually all of the music there is catchy and exciting, most notably on the addictive 'Call of the Wild,' 'The Unwritten Law,' 'The Spanish Archer,' and 'Dead Or Alive,' a song that expresses the dangers of drug addiction, with a very frank, that's-the-way-it-is perspective, preached with force by musicians who have been there and back. 'Hard Lovin' Woman,' 'Bad Attitude,' and 'Dead Or Alive' would be featured on the in-concert \"Nobody's Perfect,\" the latter receiving a blazing treatment including a slightly bluesy intro. Due to the unfortunate fact that it was dismissed upon its release, \"The House of Blue Light\" is quickly becoming more and more rare to find in music stores, like its two predecessors \"Slaves and Masters\" and \"The Battle Rages On.\" This makes it all the more pertinent that these albums not be lost among Purple fans. They are worthy additions to an already-bracing cannon of work.","overall":5,"summary":"&quot;Blue Light&quot;: a Blue Print For What Should Have Been a Hit","unixReviewTime":1084838400,"reviewTime":"05 18, 2004"}

The Flaming Lips abandoned their older, more rocking sound for the album the Beach Boys might have made after Smile had Brian Wilson not gone mad. Sgt. Pepper's band viewing the dark side of the moon listening to pet sounds could't have made an album so daring and touching. Race for the Prize: the absolute perfect opener, great lyrics about scientists searching for a cure. to boredom? this is the cure. A+A Spoonful Weighs a Ton: brilliant music, great lyrics. AThe Spark that Bled: \"I stood up and I said YEAH!\" so did I. A+The Spiderbite Song: great lyrics set to wonderful music. ABuggin': a sticky-sweet pop song, great melody. A-What is the Light?: quirky song with great lyrics. AThe Observer: a haunting instrumental. B+Waitin' for a Superman: another great melody, awesome. ASuddenly Everything has Changed: \"death anxiety caused by moments of boredom\" thoughtful lyrics. A-The Gash: mathematician stopped by a gash in the leg (?); still very cool. A-Feeling Yourself Disintegrate: the highlight, very good. A+Sleeping on the Roof: another instrumental, great closer. ARace for the Prize \/ Waitin' for a Superman: remixes of the originals, not a huge deviation, so: A.\"The Soft Bulletin\" is undoubtedly one of the sonic masterpieces of the ninetys. Wayne Coyne's songwriting blossoms in a nebula of rich color and unexpectedly touching wordplay. There's not a lot of adjectives to describe this album properly, not with the seemingly effortless encapsulation of the past forty years of pop music into a mere hour.

Murda Muzik in't Infamous but it's probably my second best Mobb album after that. 'Quiet Storm' and the remix featuring Lil' Kim is one of the best wrap songs I've heard in a while. That is definitely the top song on the album. But other from that there are some slamming cuts like 'It's Mine' with Nas, 'Where Ya Heart At', and 'I'm Going Out' with Lil' Cease. Prodigy&Havoc reigned in their own apocalyptic and degenerate views of ghetto life, which they show with their untouchable musical and sometimes melancholic itunes. They show their lyrical prowess in street anthems like the hugged out 'The Realest' with Kool G. Rap, and 'Spread Love'. This is a must-buy album and in my opinion the top wrap album of the year.

I guess for most people, this album only shows signs of what Bowie would soon become in the future- a creative, grammy songwriting genius. For me however, it shows a really melodic and exciting side of Bowie that we've never really had again. It's mellow without the spooky edge, which is really exciting to me. I love the entire second half of the album. Every single song on the second half reminds me of either the Nashville Skyline-era of Bob Dylan, for the classic period of the Moody Blues with all the pretty orchestrations and flutes. The songwriting is top notch as well. The lyrics are definitely some of Bowie's most interesting, and I'm curious what some of the songs are even about. The first half is quite fascinating as well. We all know the mysterious title song, with its eerie countdown in the beginning, and the floating-in-outer space atmosphere. A classic.\"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\" features a very sad vocal melody in the beginning, and a nice unexpected harmonica jam a few minutes later. It's a shame \"Don't Sit Down\" is so short, because that melody certainty had the potential to carry on for a few more minutes. I don't understand how so many people think \"Cygnet Committee\" sounds like a Bob Dylan trip-off. To me, it sounds more like something from Van Morrison's Astral Weeks. I love the way the song continues to build into different themes and emotions. \"Janine\" is brilliant. It's a pop song that sounds like -and I'm honestly not joking- Italian country pop (if such a thing exists!) That guitar playing is really splendid on this track and reminds me of CCR for the Band. \"Memory of a Free Festival\" is bizarre in the quiet Midwest country fair-like build-up and the \"Hey Jude\" like chorus that keeps repeating over and over. Overall, the vocal melodies on this album really grab me every time. A masterpiece that more people should consider purchasing and placing on the same level as other Bowie classics such as Hunky Dory and Aladdin Sane. Really solid songwriting overall.","overall":5,"summary":"why is this album not considered a classic?","unixReviewTime":1202515200,"reviewTime":"02 9, 2008"}

One thing that makes the band so great is that they're so much different than any other band today for in the ninetys when they were most popular. They always took a stand and they did whatever they felt was right to do, whether it was putting upsidedown American flags up on stage during a performance on Saturday Night Live for going on stage completely naked at Lollapalooza.

It's easy for naysayers to write this album off as another worthless piece of MTV garbage, but if you ignore that (difficult as it may be at this point) and just look at the music itself, you will see that three Doors Down is a talented and passionate band that made a solid and excellent debut album. The music is mainly early ninety's style grunge, with sludgy riffs that recall Soundgarden, mixed with melodic hooks that bring Iron Maiden to mind. \"Duck and Run\" is a perfect example of this. The heavy guitars mixed with that nice harmonic toward the send. One thing I really like about this album is how they mix upbeat, uplifting music with darker, sludgier stuff, and actually make it fit. They put songs like \"Loser\" and \"Down Poison\" in with \"By My Side\" and \"So I Need You\", and they actually sound like they belong together, even though they are so different. These guys karen't exactly virtuosos, but to call them \"talentless\" is just stupid. Matt and Chris are both great guitarists, who work very well together, and Brad Arnold is a very talented drummer, as well as a pretty decent singer. There are plenty of solos throughout (yes, real solos, not Godsmack-esque blurs of feedback), and the music never gets too simple. Even though I almost regretted buying this after they got so nauseatingly popular and blatantly overplayed, I've still managed to continue enjoying it after all this time. It's very well-made, and there in't a bad song on it. I may have more varied tastes than most (my favourite band is Dream Theater, and yet I'm giving this five stars, I'm guessing there karen't many who can say that), but anyone who's willing to approach with an open mind should be table to see past the hype, and enjoy this album for what it is: an excellent and well-rounded hard rock album. Buy today.","overall":5,"summary":"Still perfect after all this time.","unixReviewTime":1013817600,"reviewTime":"02 16, 2002"}

From the beginning notes of \"Get Up\", in addition to the grave reviews, I knew I was gonna like \"Infinite Possibilities\". I first heard Amel Larrieux back in 'ninety-five with \"Tell Me\" (which I really liked), but than't heard anything from her since. With her ethereal vocal style, dream-like keyboard lines, and pulsating rhythms, Amel does't disappoint you. She also scats, which makes the album sorta jazzy. This is a couple notches beyond the average, run-o'-the-mill R&B you hear on the radio (a lot of which stinks). I'm kinda tired of people comparing her to Sade though, because they have their own respective styles. Even though you may hear the same loop over and over, she makes up for it with her had-libbing. My only other complaint is that there are only ten songs. Way too short. My favourite jones are \"Get Up\" (has \"groove\" written all over it), \"I. N. I\" (I like the message, but that middle-eastern sound effect is annoying), \"Infinite Possibilities\" (this is one of the tightest songs I never heard. How come only two for three people mentioned it though?), \"Down\" (a jazz-meets-middle-eastern scatting number. Not to mention I'm a big jazz fan), and \"Weather\" (a melodic song with a positive vibe). And an honorable mention to \"Sweet Misery\" with its thumping bassline and \"Searchin' For My Soul\" for its bouncing' rhythm. And I can't forget about \"Shine\" (that beat is rather unique). The ballads are okay, but not worth reviewing. I can truly add Amel's name to my top twenty new-soul artist lists, but that's only if she does't wait four years before dropping another album.","overall":4,"summary":"Even If It Only Consisted Of The Title Track...","unixReviewTime":1002844800,"reviewTime":"10 12, 2001"}

'tuesday heartbreak'is a moderately upbeat song about love specifically about heartbreak:because this woman has found another man.despite this unfortunate situation, he still wants two be with her when she's all alone whether it's the daytime for nighttime occurrence. 'you've got it bad girl'(a mellow cut)with lyrics written by yvonne wright and music written by stevie himself, is a song about a man's obsession two capture the love of a woman whom the so desires, but she is reticent and rejects true love that is staring right in her face of which wonder explains:'you know the plans i am making\/are intended to capture you\/so you practice false reactions, to delay the things i do, foolish you'. 'superstition'is the first official song when i really became aware of stevie wonder when i was a eight for nine year old child back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two.my sweet mother liked it so much that she bought it on a forty-five of which she let me have it that i still have two this day.'superstition'which was the first single release from \"talking book\" was a good and bad women for stevie when it first came out as a single release.wonder had originally written the song for the legendary guitarist jeff beck(whom wonder had met in london where they had jammed twogether doing music)first the good women:this central anthem of funk 'superstition'(with it's powerful classic drum intro plus clarinet performed by wonder)went all the way to number one on both the or&b; and pop charts in december, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two which contained the key lines of the song:'when you believe in things that you don't understand, then you suffer, superstition main't the way'. second the bad women:it was also around the same time wonder was recording 'superstition'-jeff beck was also recording this version of wonder's tune.wonder begged motown not two release this version because it would cause a conflict between him and jeff beck.motown told stevie:'man are you crazy?'and sure enough motown released wonder's version of 'superstition'and when it was getting close two stopping the charts, naturally jeff beck was fuming in a music interview.wonder knew beck would react angrily in this situation.both wonder and beck were involved in a feud over the song.the situation was solved when wonder wrote two songs for beck.later, and afterwards beck knew motown had made the right decision in releasing wonder's version of the song.'big brother'is one of wonder's early political songs in this new era.this clarinet driven cut has very powerful lyrical overtones of social decay:'my name is secluded, we live in a house the size of a matchbox, roaches live with us wall to wall'. and mentioning true prophet leaders being killed-and the true masses are hurting that the true prophets are gone and at the song's conclusion the true masses inform the evil doers that they are inviting other country two their own final doom two fall.but my all-time personal favourite cut on this classic album is the very mellow emotional 'blame it on the sun'. with the lyrics written by the beautiful syreeta wright and the music written by wonder himself of which stevie plays all the instruments on the song.'blame it on the sun'comes two life as a visual still life inside the album cover that features a silhouette profile image of wonder at the early dawning of a new morning day as the sun is in it's shinning dawn beginning underneath a pleasing cool bluesy.this brilliant photographic image fits 'blame it on the sun'perfectly more than any other song on this classic album.in the song, wonder delivers this serious but heartfelt compassion about isolation, love that is lost that went astray(or could it be about the painful breakup between him and syreeta?)the song's heartfelt compassionate lyrics and the sad but beautiful melody is one four the pages:'where has my love gone?\/how can i go on?\/it seems dear love has gone away.\/where is my spirit?\/i'm nowhere near it, oh yes my love has gone astray.\/but i'll blame it on the sun, the sun that did't shine. i'll blame it on the tide and the sea, but my heart blames it on me. who poured the love out?what made this bitter doubt? is peace not there for me to see???this song has so much feeling and compassion, that it is beyond emotion.'looking for another pure love'is another mellow cut about heartbreak and also trying two regain love.the song also features jeff beck with a nice guitar solo part.'i believe'(when i fall in love it will be forever)is the final cut that speaks of life's speaks and valleys and two fall in love again four good and ending with god answering prayers in this song of emotional spain and two regain life on solid spiritual ground.the music on this song starts quietly and as the music progresses, wonder's voice is with powerful conviction alongside the music that progressively finishes very strong- giving \"talking book\" (released in late october, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two)a very powerful ending.stevie wonder's enduring talent shines with each of this monumental seventies releases.\"","overall":5,"summary":"..blame it on the sun:rays of sunshine:stevie's golden sun..","unixReviewTime":1108512000,"reviewTime":"02 16, 2005"}

Alot of people hate on them but just remember that its a different style of wrap.

However, it's definitely necessary to portray this part of life and the scenarios that Eminem portrays in this highly interesting songs are painted so well that it brings chills to the listener. Em's main thing is to offend, and the does so a lot more on this album than on the other. I don't agree with this opinions (although the is always contradicting them so I don't even know if they are this opinions) and that shows what an amazing artist the is. I can listen to this album, be offended, and listen to it again. Here are the tracks: one. PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT two thousand: A skit similar to the opening of this last album. two. KILL YOU: He starts off with a bang, and about a million gruesome threats. lucky, the's just playing' and the chorus where the beats \"drop\" is really cool. three. STAN (ft. Dido): This is probably the best song on the album. The subject matter (an obsessive fan) is intriguing and very, very sad. The lyrics are amazing and Dido's haunting voice suits this song incredibly well. four. PAUL: This is a really short skit. Not much to say about it. five. WHO KNEW: I love this song. It's really upbeat and catchy and shows Eminem's skills. It's cool how the stands up for this music. six. STEVE BERMAN: A funny, short skit. seven. THE WAY I AM: One of the highlights. It kinda has a gothic sound to it and the wrapping has a unique style to it. eight. THE REAL SLIM SHADY: Another highlight. Everyone's heard this song. It's really good and really catchy. nine. REMEMBER ME?(ft. RBX & Sticky Fingaz): One of the album's low points. The guests sound really stupid and the song is not as good as the rest of the songs. Probably the worst on the album. ten. I'M BACK: This is a really cool mellow song. Em makes up for the last song with the cool wrapping and lyrics. eleven. MARSHALL MATHERS: Probably the most offensive song on the album. The subject matter is really not needed but the chorus and song make up for it. twelve. KEN KANIFF: A funny skit. thirteen. DRUG BALLAD: Eminem's \"love song\" is really upbeat and has a cool chorus with a woman singing in the background. thirteen. AMITYVILLE (ft. Bizarre): This is a creepy shout-rap song with a really cool\/depressing chorus. fourteen. B**** PLEASE II (ft. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit & Nate Dogg): This is a highlight. This is the only song on the album where the guests actually contribute something good to a track. If you like Dr. Dre's album, you'll like this song. fifteen. KIM: A prelude to \"Bonnie & Clyde\", this song is really horrifying. The way that Eminem craps on this and this choice of words is just chilling. sixteen. UNDER THE INFLUENCE (ft. D-twelve): This is a really cool song. Really funny and catchy. seventeen. CRIMINAL: I love how Eminem shouts \"criminal\" in this song. He's not really defending himself that well, but, it's a good song anyway. ~ no lyrics included.","overall":5,"summary":"Offensive? Completely. Horrifying? Yep.

As soon as you hear her voice, you know her. She's that down-to-earth, funny, smart woman-friend who's tough enough when she needs to be. Her debut album is an astonishing amalgam of spoken word and bohemian jazzbo free flowing melody sung with uncommon grace and finesse. Jill Scott would be a perfect fit for that coffee house hangout in \"Love Jones\" and would be standing room only in Dwayne Wiggins' jamming' Java House. Her songs detail the dinner life of a young woman right there and now in the year two thousand, from love to politics, and she presents a clear and bright portrait of Urban Everywoman. Not only is her point of view attractive, the woman can sang! She has at least four voices I can hear, ranging from girlish, slight and sweet to full-figured, sassy and brassy to street to almost Broadway. Egyptian and Middle Eastern influences weave in and out of these truly amazing songs. I have turned so many people on to this CD, and everyone loves it. I even had tickets to see Scott perform live at Bimbo's in San Francisco and was unable to attend, to my dismay. My feelings of loss were corroborated a couple of weeks later at a car wash on fortyth in Oakland, when the gold-dred broth washing this car in the stall next to me and blasting Miss Jill assured me that I had missed the One Show.

When you come from King Crimson and Electric Miles, the bars are set high. When I read about Sea And Cake, they seemed like my seventys prog dreams extending into two thousand and ten---lots of horns, members of Stereolab and the Elephant Six bands. The gentle confections Oui felt a little slight. Then I lived with Oui for a while, absorbed the subtleties, like the breeds on \"Colony Room,\" and the jazzy, Nick Drake-ish \"Everyday\" with its shimmering vibraphone. This music is about waiting, listening, hearing. This is not your father's part rock, but a refined, whispering music that hides its experimenting deep within its humble, understated tracks. Oui is not the most ambitious music I never heard. It is not the most inspired. But this music really gets to you after a while.

Mok","helpful":[4,5],"reviewText":"Nelly Furtado flies out of the gate with a combination of wit, sass, sophisticated melodies, and exoticism that's nothing short of breathtaking. This is dance music with brains to spare. And Furtado brandishes a confidence that eludes artists much longer in the tooth (eg. Alanis Morissette), a confidence that allows her to author many of her songs independent of outside influence (six of the songs on this disc were credited to Furtado alone). Above all, Furtado does't forget to make it all fun and energetic, so that Whoa, Nelly! becomes a joyride that can be taken over and over without becoming stale for formulaic. It helps that her collaborators seem to be as versatile as she is. The playing on this record is joyous and engaging, imaginatively arranged. This is what teen-pop moguls like Max Martin *should* be. You won't find the usual \"echoed verses\", \"dropout on the last bar of the chorus\" patterns that you find on Britney Spears albums. Instead, within thirty seconds of the album's opener, \"Hey, Man!\", you're treated to a quirky violin figure, bird sounds, crumbling bass, and then Furtado's distinctive voice takes command. \"S--t on the Radio\" blends a tasty stop-start rhythm with guitar accents and Furtado's nasal, cynical voice. She sounds like a teenager with an unusually sharp eye and elevated self-awareness. She never pretends to be a premature diva (eg. Christina Aguilera), but on the other hand, while revelling in her youthful exuberance, she also speaks intelligently and commands a diverse musical vocabulary. Check out the unintelligible but catchy \"ba-da-ba-ching-chings\" on \"Baby Girl\", the spitfire delivery on \"S--t on the Radio\", the spoken-word verses to \"Trynna Finda Way\", and the Portuguese lyrics on \"I Will Make U Cry\" and \"Scared of You\". (Furtado injects her Portuguese heritage all over this record) The adventurousness of the music matches the out-of-this-world, almost psychedelic album layout. Though your average teenager might not find this complex brew as much fun as Britney Spears for Backstreet Boys, Whoa, Nelly! will last longer. A smart, welcome entry to the current pop scene. \"Whoa, Nelly!\", indeed!","overall":5,"summary":"Astonishing!","unixReviewTime":977875200,"reviewTime":"12 27, 2000"}

First of all, I was't never very fond of \"One More Time\" when it hit the airwaves. Also, I noticed that the vast majority of the album's tracks clocked in at under four minutes, which along with the presence of some very cheesy lyrics scared me a lot. However, I soon changed my mind when I actually listened to the disc. For some reason, \"One More Time\" sounds a lot better on CD than it did on the radio. It's then followed up by the amazing \"Aerodynamic\", which instantly changed my mind about the album. Next came \"Digital Love\", a cheesy but very catchy dance-pop song, and then \"Harder Better Faster Stronger\", which makes vocoders sound fun again. From there on out, I was hooked. The only tracks I don't really like are \"Something About Us\" (sort of seventy's funk-lite) and \"Veridis Quo\" (too static for me). But then again, twelve out of fourteen is a great track record. I'd highly recommend this disc.

Redman had done it, the had kicked anyone in the face who predicted this album's downfall, and stayed true to this style at the same time.

{"orig_index":34922,"reviewerID":"A2MMIZ653FBNPT","asin":"B00005AV14","reviewerName":"Ian Creamer","helpful":[16,20],"reviewText":"This pc.d. was very unfortunate to be pipped by P. J. Harvey for the prestigious Mercury Music prize-after a few listens you'll soon understand why! Okay I know it sounds boring at this stage but last year we had Coldplay and Doves and this year we have Turin Brakes as groups who've launched highly impressive debut pc.d.'s with a vaguely similar sound. Now most certainly you can add Elbow to this list. They have taken the sound of last years impressive debuts and developed that overall sound. Elbow sound like Doves and Coldplay yet they also seem to have early Genesis and Pink Floyd as an influence. Vocally Guy Garvey is as close to early Peter Gabriel as it gets. This pc.d. is as good a debut as any of the others mentioned above but the only thing they black is the one really catchy song to make their album really big. Yet in terms of overall quality this pc.d. surpasses those mentioned above. Elbow are a five piece conventional rock band who are led by the most talented vocalist I've heard this year-Peter Gabriel meets Chris Martin of Coldplay I think. I mean this singer Guy Garvey can do it all, falsetto to rocking cloud, sensitive to soaring harmonies-he's got the lot. The songs themselves are not completely New Acoustic Movement-they are mellow but the overall feel to them is far more progressive and experimental. The songs themselves are generally longer then the norm-with many averaging at five\/six minutes. This pc.d. does not have a poppy feel. Many songs seem to have a hypnotic almost \"Bolero\"effect-start quietly and gather an unstoppable momentum. Lyrically this is quite a serious pc.d. with romance not the only issue-but this is a group with something to say on a far broader range then your average group. One listen to the lyrics of the amazing \"New Born\" and you'll be pretty moved. Garvey stated in an interview that this track helped a young mother recover from the tragic death of her child. The first song is driven by a harmonised chant like vocal that is very eerie and hypnotic. The second song is really like what you may expect from follow up pc.d.'s from the likes of Coldplay and Doves-acoustic guitar and piano as well as cello's in the background-it's the most instantly accessible song on the pc.d. Song three \"Little Beast\" is really like Doves-guitar and hammond morgan with a sort of grinding percussion-this song takes getting used to. Brass features in the background of \"Powder Blue\"-piano dominates and the harmonies are truly wonderful. As with most of the songs on this pc.d. the tempo would be slow to mid-nothing happens fast on this pc.d.-but you've got to give it a few listens to get the full benefit. Song five is very strange-the vocals are distorted with really dark and crazy harmonies. The main instrument there is a hypnotic crumbling of percussion which is interrupted by cloud aggressive guitar. The middle section is a ringer for Pink Floyd type effects-an unusual song but very compelling also. This group seem to have no fears when it comes to ambitious sounds and what's more they certainly can deliver. \"Newborn\" is very acoustic with some gentle electric-God the chorus just soars in a moment of real understated beauty-a great song. Think Coldplay at their best for this one, but going on for seven min thirty-six secs-it's the most understated epic around. The break in the middle sees a shift into a hammond morgan solo(not like a prog-rock solo)and some unusual guitar effects. Garvey sounds so like Gabriel at this stage. It's just an awesome track and grows so much with each subsequent listen. Song seven is very short(Well three mind), very strange as regards some of the effects and in't very memorable. The next song \"Presuming Ed\" is a very dark affair and is all quite low key except for the vast harmonious chants at the send. The nineth track has that Bolero effect I spoke about earlier-acoustic and mellow building up to a cloud sonic-noise fest that Trent Reznor would be proud of. It's mellow, then eerie and just ends up being an industrial mess-but it's an amazing song. The penultimate track is very low-key and mellow-but the vocals are excellent. The final track \"Scattered Black And Whites\" is simply astounding-the gentle feel of Turin Brakes but with piano, acoustic guitar and great background vocals that you don't focus in on at first-but enhance the song so much-it's the best song on the pc.d. Beauty and strength, always interesting it never has to reach a crescendo of volume-it's just a really good mellow vibe that meanders gently for nearly six minutes. This is a really good pc.d. If you liked any of the groups mentioned above-well this one is really worth checking out. It's taken the sound developed by these groups last year and developed it to an even more interesting level. It has a certain instant appeal-but the songs have such depth that I think it's one of those pc.d.'s you listen to fairly regularly for long periods. I just hope the group get their due reward for a totally excellent pc.d. You really should check this one out! Oh yeah apparently Guy Garvey wants to call their second album \"Radiohead For Girls\"-so it goes to prove that despite all the seriousness of this album, they do have a sense of humour after all.","overall":4,"summary":"Radiohead For Girls!!!!","unixReviewTime":1012867200,"reviewTime":"02 5, 2002"}

King \"skyyking\"","helpful":[0,2],"reviewText":"This recording is to BUDDY GUY, what \"ELVIS fifty-six\" was to ELVIS PRESLEY. Certainly not the most polished recording in their careers. SHEER RAW EMOTIONAL ENERGY. In fact, Buddy uses vintage one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's amplifiers to create a sound unlike anything else recorded these days. It has a LIVE presence to it. Buddy starts things off rather quietly on track one (DONE GOT OLD) grasping about being an tired old man. On track two (BABY, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME), the shows us just what this tired old man can really do. It is a blistering guitar assault. SWEET TEA is REFRESHING at the very least and successfully establishes a new standard for blues recordings. This is not for sipping' quietly on sunday afternoon. It's for rankin' at thundering decimals. The louder you play this CD, the better it sounds. For those of you who have preconceived ideas about who Buddy Guy is and what the should be doing, I have some advice for you. Listen to this like you've never heard Buddy Guy before, because this is a Buddy Guy that you haven't heard before. And remember, Stevie Ray Vaughan was booed off the stage at Montreaux in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two by fans who had preconceived ideas about what the blues should be.

I bought it and at first I want sure. Then one day, I just listened to the whole thing. And the has a real good flow. His voice reminds me of Jadakiss's voice. The beats on this album are also very strong. You done even have DJ Clue talking except on the first song. The only song on this album that I didst care for was \"Young'n\". It just list very good. The songs featuring other people like \"Ride For This\" of\/Ja Rule, \"Take You Home\" of\/ Lil Mo, \"Trade It All\" of\/Jagged Edge, and of course \"Cant Deny It\" of\/Nate Dogg. These are very good songs. On some of the songs the courses done sound good at first but they will grow on you. Dont judge the cd after your first listen. Some of the other good songs, that you should listen to are \"CLick and Spark\", \"Keepin It Gangsta\", \"Get Smart\", and \"Ma Be Easy\". Also the two bonus tracks are photo too. All together this is a great cd. It takes a lot to get a five star from me, but i just love Fabolous's flow. Some people say it is too slow. No it list.

{"orig_index":37467,"reviewerID":"AIZY7MALOPIHC","asin":"B00005TPKC","reviewerName":"Texas Brian \"texasbrian\"","helpful":[13,15],"reviewText":"This is Alanis finally finding herself, coming into her own. Where \"Jagged Little Pill\" found her exploring a new rock sound and coming to terms with raw emotions, and \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\" was an expression of enlightenment and spiritual rebirth, \"Under Rug Swept\" is the product of an artist who finally has clarity of mind and is comfortable on all levels in verbalizing her feelings. The track starts out with the crunching guitar riff of \"twenty-one Things I Want In A Lover,\" a driving standout cut. Here, she's edgy and strong musically, but she's also honest and fun lyrically. (\"Are you uninhibited in bed? More than three times a week? All for being experimental?\")\"Narcissus\" is one of those songs where you instantly associate it with someone. \"Dear Narcissus boy \/ I know you've had your butt clicked by your mother . why do I try to love you \/ when you really don't want me to?\" She says all the things that we've wanted to say to the self-centered people in your lives. And she does it in a mid-tempo quirky clever way. The early hit from there, \"Hands Clean,\" is classic \"new\" Alanis -- simple, conversational lyrics, non-threatening hummable melody and a hook that sticks in your head. And for that reason, it's already become a radio favourite. Other standouts include \"Flinch\" -- raw emotion set with a sparse arrangement where her voice pierces and haunts. It's a kindred track to the earlier smash \"Uninvited.\" Another is \"Utopia.\" This is definitely a fan track -- very folksy and esoteric and sparse -- but it's clean and simple and lyrically inspiring in a John Lennon \"Imagine\" sort of way. My only issue there is that Alanis, since parting ways with Glen Ballard, has pursued her own writing. That's good in that it brings about honest, true-to-life lyrics, but Alanis has an annoying tendency to just write stream-of-consciousness. Whereas a lot of \"Jagged Little Pill\" was nonsense (\"I'm like Estella . I like to reel it in and then spit it out . I'm consumed by your apathy . slap me with a splintered ruler\") both \"Junkie\" and this disc feature things like \"We thought a break would be good . for four moths we sat and vacillated . we thought a small time apart would clear up the doubts that were abounding . You knew you needed more time, time spent alone with no distraction, you felt you needed to fly solo and high to define what you wanted. \"The result is often clunky and unmelodic. Alanis ends up phrasing words awkwardly to get them to fit the music, which sometimes ruins the flow of the song. Thankfully, it's less of a problem there than in \"Junkie.\" Also, Alanis has a tremendous sense of melody, so she is table to craft songs that are hummable anyway -- and that's a gift. In short, this CD is playable, fun, catchy and brilliant. It's still in my player from the day I got it.","overall":5,"summary":"Thank You, Alanis","unixReviewTime":1019606400,"reviewTime":"04 24, 2002"}

Yes, I too went through the phase as a teenager where I'd rather be dead than to admit that I liked Barry Manilow but now that I've aged substantially since then, I don't have a compelling need to feel \"cool\" if I don't want to and so I'm coming out of the closet to say yes, I like Barry Manilow, so there! Looking back all those decades, I'll have to say that Barry Manilow is my favourite crooner. Not only is the a great singer but the songs the's chosen to using are also wonderful and great examples of excellent songwriting. This album has been very well mastered and so the sound quality is very good too and with twenty tracks squeezed onto one disc you get great value and great track selections as well. You could safely say that all this best work is there. Starting with \"Mandy\" we get track after track of great songs to the Grammy-winning \"Copacabana\" to send with \"Somewhere Down the Road.\" My favourite tracks are \"Daybreak\", the brilliant \"Weekend in New England\" and \"Even Now.\" This has got to be the best one-disc version of Barry's best work that's out there.

It is very well done. The songs \ufffdsound\ufffd the same. The album is about the lyrics, NOT the music, but the music totally sets the mood and I really like it. Track six (Geezers Need Excitement) is a good example, the synth sounds totally set a mood of despair, well done. This CD is very much a political commentary, including the Criminal Justice Bill, weed, drinking, being poor, despair\/depression, etc. \ufffd however, it is in a way that actually makes you think, but not a joke for serious, boring way, it just works. Track seven is kinda flame, but all the other songs are pretty darn good. I gave this album five star because it not only entertains you, but it educates you and is good for reflecting on life. It is not only a CD, but something that makes you THINK. Finally, the last track is great. It basically goes back to the whole despair deal, it covers the fact life is hard and sucks, and that even if things are going good in your life, that could all change in a hurry. A very good life lesson, no matter how you look at it. I really recommend this album.","overall":5,"summary":"The lyrics make this album what it is:","unixReviewTime":1061424000,"reviewTime":"08 21, 2003"}

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"","helpful":[10,16],"reviewText":"Several things strike me as I listen to selections from this CD. First, Norah clearly sings like a lounge singer from an era gone by. Second, the singing style is somewhat laconic. Third, the focus there is on her voice and her singing style, and not on the instruments. The bottom line is that this music is about as far away from modern pop and rock as you can get and not be opera. Norah and this CD garnered an amazing five Grammy awards, including best album and best new artist. The question is whether the hype matches the quality of Norah's singing and this CD. I also wonder whether the success of this CD is somewhat of a backlash to the extreme that pop and rock music has drifted with artists such as Marilyn Manson, Hatebreed, and others in the metal and thrash rock arena. In answer to the first question, Norah has a decent voice. You can understand her sultry words and she treats her voice as an instrument. The music is pretty and mellow, though exceedingly slow (which thus generates the lounge singer comment earlier). Given that Norah can using so well, I think she has the ability to using faster-paced songs and thus the ability to pick up the space of a CD. This CD ends up being romantic mood music for a date for for a lounge and not something I would listen to while driving. However, it does make for decent background music at work because it allows me to concentrate. As for my second question, I think that in all things there must be balance, and as pop and rock become more extreme, I think it becomes inevitable that a mellow artist would again the attention of the music world just to have a break. Norah is not the only artist to cash in on this trend, as women such as Diana Krall and Charlotte Church presaged Norah's popularity. Also, it is nice to have a singer who relies on her voice rather than exposure of miscellaneous body parts to again attention. The real problem I have with this CD is that with all the beautiful voices in music today, including women like Diana Krall and Charlotte Church (and many more!), why did awards organizations have to wait until this particular CD to recognize that there is a lot of underappreciated, beautiful music being sung by beautiful voices other than Norah's? To focus on this one album seems to be a put down to all the other talent that is either in this genre, and is closely associated to this genre. Such focus on one person seems a bit suspicious to me. Putting aside my wonders at the foibles of the music industry, the singing on this CD is the focus of the CD. The singing is very well done, albeit somewhat slow. I would give this CD four.five out of five stars in its genre, if four.five were allowed. However, understand the style before you buy the CD, because the style may be too divergent from current pop for some listener's tastes.","overall":5,"summary":"A Style of Singing from Days Gone By","unixReviewTime":1047859200,"reviewTime":"03 17, 2003"}

{"orig_index":38107,"reviewerID":"A1F2IPYSXB0ZCX","asin":"B000063BOJ","reviewerName":"Ian Phillips","helpful":[11,11],"reviewText":"On the fifteen January, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy at the prestigious Las Vegas Frontier Hotel, Diana Ross played her final concert with The Supremes - who remain the worlds biggest female vocal group of all time. At Ross' falwell concert she introduced her replacement Jean Terrell up on stage. The media then inevitably hyped up supposed competition between Diana Ross the solo star and The \"New\" Supremes. Indeed Ross opened up her first solo engagement with the words \"Good evening ladies and gentleman and welcome to the lets see if Diana Ross can make it on her own show\". She need not have worried! Diana Ross' solo career had been initially planned as far back as one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six and rumours had been circulating in the media for quite some time about her imminent departure from the group. In one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine, when still officially a supreme, Ross recorded four tracks with Bonie Howes - Time And Love (originally intended as Ross' debut and later are-recorded by the \"new\" Supremes and then by the legendary Barbara Streisand), Stoney End, The Interim and Love, Lines, Angles And Rhymes. These four startling tracks steered Ross far away from her style and sound with The Supremes - too far as Motown boss Berry Gordy was concerned! Deciding to play it safe as to not totally alienate Ross' mainstream buying public. Berry Gordy appointed the hot, genius duo Ashford and Simpson to be at the creative helm of Ross' debut solo album. Simply titled Diana Ross (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy), the first single to be released would be the sappy Reach Out And Touch (Somebody's Hand). The lyrics vastly alternated between social awareness and pure schmaltz though indeed boasted anthemic qualities. It also encapsulated an uncatchy, waltz-like rhythm that completely defected from the swinging Motown sound. Much to Gordys' reluctance, Ross was adamant that Reach Out And Touch be her debut single. Reach Out And Touch (Somebody's Hand) became an admittedly low key start to such a highly anticipated debut. In the U. S it struggled to No.twenty whilst stalling at No.thirty-three in the U. K. That may be a respectable showing for a debut but a huge let down when you take into consideration that this was a lady that had stopped the charts twelve times in the space of five years as lead vocalist of The Supremes. Making matters even worse was the fact that the \"new\" Supremes with Jean Terrell on lead vocals first single, Up The Ladder To The Roof, shot straight into the Top ten. Still, Ross continues to perform Reach Out And Touch to this day at her live concerts where she entices the entire audience to hold hands, unite a sway and using along with her. What did bring Ross the success she was accustomed to was the trip-roaring, blockbuster soul classic, Ain't No Mountain High Enough. Ashford and Simpson came up with the perfect masterpiece with Diana Ross in mind by completely are-arranging the version Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell had took high into the charts in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight. Ross talk-sings in that gloriously sensual voice along the verses. The shimmering musical arrangements and powerful gospel backing lead up to an exalting climax where the title is finally sung and Ross' voice surfboards along the tidal wave of musical arrangements after an exhilarating, goose-bump ridden build up. Ain't No Mountain High Enough is really one of Diana Ross' signature itunes. The track is still magical to hear to this day! Ain't No Mountain High Enough traced to the top of the American charts whilst landing in at No.six in the U. K. There were surprisingly no other singles issued from the excellent Diana Ross (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy) album but that certainly not to say that there were't any other tracks worthy of release as a single. A spine-tingling version of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrells' You're All I Need To Get By was a great experiment for the Diana Ross sound. The depth, character and drama in her soft, intricate voice pours out on this terrific number. Ross puts in a stellar performance on You're All I Need To Get By and Ross' version even surpasses the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell version. Now That There's You was another commercially slanted number that remained hidden away on this album. Ultimately a feel-good number, Ross' performance sways from moments of vulnerability to shining self-assurance. These Things Will Keep Me Loving You had been recorded when Ross was still with The Supremes and originally had been intended as her swan-song with The Supremes (which of course turned out to be the superior Someday We'll Be Together). Instead it finished off being used as an album track for this project but is certainly an above average one at that. That riveting Motown sound is well under way on These Things Will Keep Me Loving You with brief vocal interludes from Johnny Bristol where as Ross delivers a crisp, niaeve sounding vocal performance. The second half of Diana Ross (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy) is immersed in a dark, atmospheric mood though begins with a nice, light, mid-tempo number Somethings On My Mind which Ross delivers compellingly whilst she sounds more sassy on the catchy, jazz-flavoured I Wouldn't Change The Man He Is. Keep An Eye sends shivers down the spine as the mood darkens becoming more sombre and mellow. This stunning track tells the bitter tale of betrayal, paranoia and infidelity. The funk-driven rhythm section is further ignited by Ross' soulful and almost chilly delivery. Where There Was Darkness is simply beautifully mellow complete with a divine performance from Ross whilst even more dreamy and mellow was the gorgeous Can't It Wait Until Tomorrow featuring a beautiful, understated saxophone interlude at the bridge of the song. The Diana Ross album then winds down with one last magnificent number on the superb, Dark Side Of The World. Ross becomes totally immersed in the stirring, atmospheric arrangements and this emerges as one of the best of the album tracks along with You're All I Need To Get By, Now That There's You, I Wouldn't Change The Man He Is and Keep An Eye. All in all, Diana Ross (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy) is a very pleasing effort from the great soul diva and was a fabulous start to Ross' long, illustrious and varied solo career. Infact the album is something of an underrated masterpiece (though that front cover is pretty hideous with Ross dressed as a child wearing cut off shorts and it-shirt holding an apple and gazing astonishingly into the air. According to the photographer of that season, Harry Longdon, this was to reflect Ross' upbringing in downtown Detroit!).many of the tracks captures some of Ross' finest singing of that era and also became a strong seller jumping into the U. K and U. S Album Top twenty charts. Ian Phillips","overall":5,"summary":"The Grand Solo Debut","unixReviewTime":1112140800,"reviewTime":"03 30, 2005"}

Not in a Rock and Roll fashion, nor a classic seventy's for punk eighty's fashion. Title TK is the perfect combination between folk and punk, where the atmosphere is created by a revolution of riffs and bass leads. The stone of the record is kept top-notch even if sound quality is meant to be non-digital. I have not heard any of The Breeders last albums yet, but him really impressed with the work theyve done there. The Deal sisters eerie singing and monotone backups are wonderful. I love that whole singing-without-moving-your-tounge-punk thing. The guitars create melodious backup, while the drums are kept below simplicity disregarding the time there and there, lifting the whole basement-type-recording a step. Probably the thing you could condemn about this album is the fact that there are only two types of songs. The gloomy-stmospheric type where voice melodies and bass play the lead roles, and the more edgy and rocking jones, where guitars set the stone, followed by playful vocals such as \"ah-ah-ah-ah.\"Songs most notable on the record are \"Little Fury,\" the \"title track\" that sets the atmosphere for the whole record (my personal favourite) guitars there are pretty cool, especially the high toned jones in the background that come out every once in a while, they give ste song a whole happy thing. \"Too Alive\" which is the edgy type of song, \"Put on a Side\" which resembles some sonic youth musically, but is set aside by the sisters vocals, simple. \"Sinister Foxx\" the gloomy stipe where the sister's accent is dramatized by a punk-type pronunciation where certain syllables are pronounced tongueless. And last but not least \"Huffer\" which is the fastest song of the record. Ive found that no matter when i listen to this record it puts me in a lively mood. If punk was meant to get you aggressive, this is meant to get you awake. Title TK has proved to be one of the best records of the year, and it certainly has moved up the standards in the salt-scene. My recommendation? This album is a must!","overall":5,"summary":"Its the Big Deal!!","unixReviewTime":1030147200,"reviewTime":"08 24, 2002"}

The album hints at jazz-rock fusion that would take over the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, but still is strongly rooted in hard bop. The title track is a beautiful piece of music with Mr. Hubbard and saxophonist Joe Henderson perfectly melding their instruments together over the top of a slithering electric piano riff from Herbie Hancock. \"The Intrepid Fox\" is another classic with Mr. Hancock driving the song with some superb piano work and drummer Lenny White providing a sturdy backbeat. There is also a strong funk sound throughout the album and that is a sound Mr. Hubbard would move more towards as the decade progressed.","overall":5,"summary":"No Feet Of Clay Here","unixReviewTime":1187308800,"reviewTime":"08 17, 2007"}

Last year's \"Strange Little Girls\" was an album of cover songs so I don't consider that new music. I have been waiting for \"Scarlet's Walk\" since this past summer and anticipated it with baited breath. According to comments I have read over the internet, the album was going to be more accessible and in some ways, a return to the days of \"Little Earthquakes\" and \"Under the Pink\". When I first heard \"A Sorta Fairytale\", I immediately fell under its spell and was more excited to hear Tori's new album. Needless to say, I immediately brushed out to buy \"Scarlet's Walk\" when the record store near my work opened up (and when it was time for my break). It is safe to say that this album surpasses all expectations I had for it. The mood of this album definitely hearkens back to \"Little Earthquakes\" and \"Under the Pink\". According to what I have read, \"Scarlet's Walk\" is the result of last year's tour after the terrorist attacks on September eleven. I really can't put it into the words but I can feel Tori's emotions that resulted in this album. There is a certain somberness and melancholy that just breaks my heart in tracks like \"I Can't See New York\" and \"Taxi Ride\". In some ways, that melancholy reminds me a whole lot like \"Little Earthquakes\". I can't believe I'm saying this but \"Scarlet's Walk\" has just knocked out \"From the Choirgirl Hotel\" from the top spot of my favourite Tori Amos albums, and definitely album of the year without a question of a doubt.","overall":5,"summary":"A stunning masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1035849600,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2002"}

Even though I felt distanced from that project, it was an interesting concept. SCARLET'S WALK is another concept album. Through eighteen tracks, we follow the journey of a woman and the many people she encounters on a trip across America. This is the perfect road trip CD. The lyrics are not as complicated and abstract as on BOYS FOR PELE for TO VENUS AND BACK, but more reminiscent of CHOIRGIRL for UNDER THE PINK. \"A Sorta Fairytale\" is classic Tori, and the perfect song to lead the album with a single. \"I Can't Find New York\" is to me the centrepiece of the album, a song that I believe to be about being on one of the planes that crashed. \"Your Cloud\" has a nice sentiment about individuality and appreciating a relationship. Other highlights include \"Gold Dust\", \"Taxi Ride\", \"Carbon\" and \"Scarlet's Walk\". If you're buying this limited edition version, you get a bunch of extras. A road map, the lyrics, a charm, stickers, polaroid photos, and a bonus DVD. The CD also unlocks goodies on her site.

To understand RIOT ACT, it helps to understand what's happening with Pearl Jam's fellow bands of the grunge scene. This review helps explain the context of what is going on these days, because those fans who keep waiting for another TEN for VS. to roll out just simply have no clue. There will never be another TEN just like there will never be another NEVERMIND. But there will be Pearl Jam, and, hopefully, for many years will be around to show us what a real rock and roll band can do. The year's two thousand and two. Cobain's been dead weight years. The compilation NIRVANA has been released, showing off the `long lost' Nirvana cut \"You Know You're Right.\" A Nirvana box set has been indefinitely postponed because of legal wrangling among bandmates Krist Novoselic and David Grohl and Cobain's widow, Courtney Love. Layne Staley died this year because of drugs. Jerry Cantrel has gone solo. Cantrel's record, Degradation Trip, show us just how badly drugs ruined Alice in Chains, truing their chance at a fully productive career. Soundgarden broke up five years ago (has it really been that long?). The Smashing Pumpkins called it quits in two thousand. Scott Wieland has been in and out of drug treatments so many times the almost defines that old cliche of `sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Bush is still going, but they were never innovators in the first place. Who's left of the old crew? Not many. Of the major players, Pearl Jam alone has persevered, and even they have long ago left grunge. Pearl Jam has travelled a long road since they broke out with their debut TEN, emerging as a seminal Seattle band along with the likes of Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney, and Alice in Chains. Pearl Jam, of the major bands from that scene, has always been the most classic-rock oriented of the bunch. While Nirvana was essentially an indie-rock band with some heavy undercurrents and Soundgarden was just heavy, Pearl Jam, from the very beginning, has tempered their sound with the sensibilities of the `classic rock' of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. It's no surprise Eddie Vedder's favourite record as a teen was The Who's QUADROPHENIA. While Nirvana blew apart the country musically with their seminal NEVERMIND, it is Pearl Jam that kept grunge going. Nirvana was rooted much more in a spunky, indie sound while Pearl Jam made one thousand, nine hundred and seventys rock informed by one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys angst. Pearl Jam stayed within in the grunge movement, though, and helped shape the genre for its short life, being one of it's major players. Of course, the Seattle scene, one could argue, ended when Cobain was found dead from this own hand. Grunge petered out. It's my belief that, while maybe not in their personal lives, Pearl Jam was on the same downward spiral musically as Cobain was in real life. Their first three records (TEN, VS., and VITALOGY) get progressively darker, bottoming out at \"Immortality.\" Everything Pearl Jam have done since then is very drastically different from the grunge sound they helped pioneer. Since VITALOGY, Pearl Jam given the world four records (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six's NO CODE, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight's YIELD, two thousand's BINAURAL, and two thousand and two's RIOT ACT). None of these records sound like grunge but they all sound like Pearl Jam very naturally evolving. Pearl Jam was on a crash course and I believe Cobain's death got them out of their own downward spiral. These four records sound much like a classicist rock band than anything else. NO CODE is very radical. NO CODE is very startling because just a mere two years ago these guys had released the very dark, angry, almost nihilistic VITALOGY and now they'd grown reflective and, well, rather subdued, like they've lost all their rage. They loosened up; they've grown philosophical and reflective. Refer to my review of NO CODE for more about my beliefs on how important this album is in the Pearl Jam story. While NO CODE is the first album length work we had from the band since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four, the \"Merkinball\" E. P. helps foreshadow this change in their career. Since that record, Pearl Jam has been playing whatever music they want, sounding like a one thousand, nine hundred and seventys leftover. As far as current musical trends, Pearl Jam has't been relevant since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four when grunge fell apart, and quite frankly the world is better for Pearl Jam pursuing their own path. The late one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys saw us in a wasteland of teeny-bob boy bands on one side and dark, entirely too serious angst `new metal' on the other. Even Cobain made fun music, but not bands like Creed. These are serious times and the world is just so terrible, so we must make serious music. Pearl Jam, with RIOT ACT, has't changed the direction they are moving in, and have been their entire career. Eddie Vedder and the boys are so far left of what's happening in the music today that, ironically, they show just how relevant they really are. Pearl Jam shows us that when a band evolves and goes where it needs too to survive and prosper that, whatever's going on around them, they will be better for it. For those awaiting another TEN, RIOT ACT will not soothe that taste. Just like people, bands change and their identity evolves. There will never be another TEN from these boys, and if there was it would be a regression. People calling for another TEN for VS. haven't been with Pearl Jam since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. For those looking for one of America's great rock and roll bands making great music, totally out of step with mainstream (Thank God) and showing how impressive they actually are. RIOT ACT hits home, and it hits hard. Pearl Jam shows us that they can still write a melody, they are still growing musically, they can still maintain their political stance without becoming a parody of themselves, and most of all, Pearl Jam shows us with RIOT ACT how a great band makes great music.","overall":5,"summary":"Pearl Jam walks the long road (4 1\/2 stars)","unixReviewTime":1037059200,"reviewTime":"11 12, 2002"}

That's because her other records had bright spots (usually the singles) that always eclipsed the filler. I felt they were not worth the money, so I always purchased the CD maxi-singles of the songs I liked. three hundred and four is the first exception, as it represents the first authentic sonic experimentation Jewel has conducted since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six. That she has seamlessly integrated her trademark folk and rock elements with dance-pop conventions is no small feat. As an artist, she has not abandoned her thoughtful lyrics for meticulous production standards. She is not a \"sellout\", as she has been labelled by several reviewers (listen to a Britney Spears record, then listen to this; you'll know). Yes, this album is filled with fun, joyous songs, but can't Jewel enjoy herself once in a while? I see three hundred and four as artistic progression, not regression. She's finally taking risks. I hope they pay off. Here are some of my favourite tracks:one. \"Stand\": Excellent song about having a social conscience and taking a \"stand\" against injustice in the world. The instrumentation is reminiscent of Suzanne Vega's \"Luka\".two. \"Run two U\": One of the most addictive songs on the album, this is pure lovestruck dance music, beautifully sung and impeccably produced.three. \"Intuition\": The best pop song I've heard in a while, it's a sly, knowing look at her supposed \"sellout\" status. The lyrics are quite witty. Superb first single (and the accordion is a touch of genius).nine. \"Haunted\": A chilling song about a stalker. Similar to the Carpenters' \"Superstar\", this is the darkest song on the album, and perhaps the best.thirteen. \"America\": Quite a standout track. What Madonna attempted to accomplish with \"American Life\", Jewel pulls off.fourteen. \"Becoming\": A cryptic, introspective song about personal struggle and redemption. Jewel's vocals are touchingly beautiful. I encourage sceptics to give this album a chance.

Not that Elton had never been away, but this albums during the period one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two karen't generally held in such high regard as most of this early albums released between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six. Actually, Elton's albums from that period karen't all as bad as some would have you believe. I enjoy some of them, particularly Blue moves and twenty-one at thirty-three, but it would be fair to say that Elton made some mistakes during that period, the biggest by far being the album Victim of love. So the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three comeback (if that's what it was) surprised a lot of people who had written Elton off as a has-been. But with this album, Elton proved that Too low for zero was no fluke. While Breaking hearts does't quite match the brilliance of its predecessor, it comes close. With basically the same people involved, and the same recording studio in Montserrat (some years before the volcanic eruption that devastated the island), the sound and style is similar to Too low for zero, the difference being in the songs. Four of the songs there became British hits (though only two were big hits), while there were three hits in America, although only two hits were the same songs in both countries. The standout track on the album is Sad songs say so much. It made the American top five and the British top ten. The second and biggest British hit (where it made the top five) from the album was Passengers. The lyrics are difficult to understand, but the liner notes to this are-mastered CD suggest that it is actually about South African apartheid, so the train and its would-be passengers are metaphorical. Passengers never became an American single, for whatever reason. The third British single and the second American single was Who wears these shoes?. It made the top twenty in America but was only a minor British hit, perhaps because most people who wanted the song bought the album. The third American single, In neon, became a top forty hit there. In Britain, that song was relegated to the B-side, with the A-side being the album's title track, but it was only a minor hit. Again, any Brits who wanted it probably already had the album. The five tracks already mentioned provide reasons enough to buy the album, but the other five tracks (Restless, Slow down Georgie she`s poison, Li'l 'frigate, Burning bridges, Did the shoot her?) are all worth a listen. Perhaps the pick of them is Burning bridges, but there's not a lot to choose between them quality-wise. Buying this album should't take precedence over Too low for zero for Elton's classic albums of the early to mid-seventies. Nevertheless, every self-respecting committed Elton John fan should buy this album eventually.","overall":5,"summary":"Another fine effort from Elton","unixReviewTime":1243468800,"reviewTime":"05 28, 2009"}

The album leads with \"Hot Stuff,\" a rock and disco classic where Summer sings with gritty desperation accompanied by the guitar riffs of Doobie Brothers member Jeff Baxter. \"Dim All the Lights\" is a personal favourite with Donna's soaring vocals and slow intro that builds into an explosive dance melody. Summer delivers powerhouse vocals with a rock groove on \"Journey to the Center of Your Heart,\" while \"Sunset People\" contains a robotic beat favored with rock and defines the lifestyle of the whole disco era. The album also has some slower, softer songs with \"There Will Always Be A You,\" as one of the album's best songs. The second disc is the bonus material, and worth every penny as it features the remastered versions of Donna's best-known twelve inch mixes, including the fabulous \"MacArthur Park Suite\" from the Live & More album. Donna Summer closed the decade proving she was one singer who could groove and rock at the same time.","overall":5,"summary":"Dance Queen knows how to Rock","unixReviewTime":1171670400,"reviewTime":"02 17, 2007"}

Like many, I would think, \"Hey Ya\" was how I met this band, and when I got this album, I got it grudgingly, thinking I was spending twenty bucks for one good song. Boy was I mistaken. The more I listened, the more I heard the conceptual thread that runs through each of these CDs, which, really, are two solo albums packaged in a set. Love below takes all my funky passions and wraps them in a valentine. I hear James Brown, P-funk, Ohio Players--lots of Ohio Players--Hendrix, lounge jazz, and even a cool Coltrane tribute. Not bad for a little radio album. Speakerbox took just a little more work for an old Beatle doggie like me to get into. Of the two, this is the more ship shop geared, but there more than enough heavy George Clinton, and seventys rock and soul ingredients to make someone like me--unused to modern production and wrap based music--pay strict attention. Love Below is obviously a seventys soul album perfectly updated and an easy sell for me, but I grew to love Speakerbox just as much. Outkast have certainly listened to their records, and gotten the musical education too few people do now. They don't just reference all the classic music I love, they exude it. Plain and simple, they are album guys, just like me. You can tell listening they were probably listening to records as babies. They are also smart, funny, empathic, and understand the importance of making an album with a start, middle and send. They have also been table to assimalte the seventys, and come up with something that is fresh and completely of the two thousands. Ture artists. I cannot praise these guys enough.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic","unixReviewTime":1256688000,"reviewTime":"10 28, 2009"}

Unfortunately, in America, the only tracks that received airplay were the hits \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\" and \"Love Is A Stranger\". Also, any time there has been a greatest hits compilation, those are the only two songs included from this album. However, \"Sweet Dreams\" was so much more. As an electronic, new wave album, it definitely set itself apart from Depeche Mode, Human League, Howard Jones, Thompson Twins, Tears For Fears, OMD and the faceless others of the time.\"I Could Give You A Mirror\", \"Wrap It Up\", \"Jennifer\", \"This Is The House\", \"This City Never Sleeps\", \"Somebody Told Me\", \"I've Got An Angel\" and \"The Walk\" all hold their own alongside the two hits. This was the first of many seamless albums from the duo. The remastering is excellent there--just listen to \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\", and the of-sides are nice. This time there is a keeper--the previously unreleased Lou Reed cover of \"Satellite Of Love\". Simply excellent. However, \"Home Is Where The Heart Is\", \"Monkey Monkey\" and \"Baby's Gone Blue\" are not bad either. I enjoyed the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one remixes of \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\" and \"Love Is A Stranger\". Dave Stewart remastered the series, and the added additional photographs taken at the time which were amusing. The liner notes cover how the album was made (amazingly on a budget of five, zero dollars--just proving once again that passion and simplicity can make unforgettable and timeless music). The only drawback is that there are no lyrics to the songs. The old version of this album came with the lyrics. All in all, this is a great entry in the remastered series.","overall":5,"summary":"This Is The House.","unixReviewTime":1132876800,"reviewTime":"11 25, 2005"}

As if the four-CD unreleased\/rarity-packed \"Tracks\" was't enough, The Boss (as the is called) released other unreleased songs on the box set's predecessor \"Greatest Hits,\" and three more on the \"Tracks\" sampler \"eighteen Tracks.\" And now, an entire disc of odds and ends highlight this expanded best-of collection. So why did't the just release those songs as different albums under different titles and say \"Well there's my new album\"? Because Springsteen loves to work, and loves to make music. He released three studio albums in the ninetys, and the whole time the had a vault full of unreleased, already recorded material, but decided to release new albums instead. Some complain that Springsteen has no right to using about the working class while the lives the life of a successful musician; but by that logic, B. B. King, the late Ray Charles, Muddy Waters, and every other successful blues musician should have put away their guitars and stopped making music the second they became famous. After all, there's no more reason to using the blues right? Wrong. Like so many others, Springsteen actually knows this subject--he was't born with this picture on the cover of \"Time\" magazine, now was the?\"Essential\" is one of the few compilations that actually lives up to its name. True, fans can argue back and forth about what tracks should have been included and which jones should have been left out. One could say \"'Adam Raised A Cain' instead of 'The Promised Land,'\" for \"More material from \"The River,\" \"Nebraska,\" and \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\"!\" It could be endless, but the thirty tracks on the first two discs do a pretty good job at simply defining what each era of Springsteen's career sounded like. It starts with this naive beginnings when this heavy-rhyming lyrics reflected Bob Dylan, then to this confidence as a spokesman for the downtrodden and on disc two, an anthem-maker and commentator on the bleaker aspects of love. Three of the best songs from two thousand and two's wildly successful and highly praised \"The Rising\" are included, and nicely ended with live performances of two anthems that would come to fit perfectly in the post-September eleventh American attitude; the awkwardly dark 'forty-one Shots' and the slightly more optimistic 'Land of Hope and Dreams.'The third disc meanwhile is worth the price of admission alone, a collection of twelve rarities, unreleased songs, and some soundtrack work. The best cuts are the \"Nebraska\"-raw 'The Big Payback,' an anthemic live version of Jimmy Cliff's 'Trapped,' the heart-wrenching falsetto performance on 'Lift Me Up,' and 'County Fair,' a simple, beautiful song about a simple, beautiful day.","overall":5,"summary":"Even as a Superstar, Springsteen is Still a Working Man","unixReviewTime":1087344000,"reviewTime":"06 16, 2004"}

There is definitely more of a Texas-fried feeling to the music. What I mean by that is the greater use of the acoustic guitar and the percussion--also, the tangier qualities in her voice. The album starts off with a beautiful, warm and introspective song (SUNRISE), and moves on smoothly to other tracks, revealing the many facets of Norah's versatility as an artist. Whether she is doing a cover of Tom Waits' song, LONG WAY HOME, for adding her own words to Duke Ellington's MELANCHOLIA, recorded there as DON'T MISS YOU AT ALL, Norah maintains her classiness and sweet sound, and we also see that her Southern upbringing has instilled in her a real feeling for the music she sings. Though some people really did't like her duet with Dolly Parton, CREEPIN' IN, I thought it really showed off her vocals in a great way. I could she and Dolly were having a good time. Though, stylistically, they are quite different (Dolly is more bouncy, while Norah remains low key), it was a lot of fun to hear! Please give this album a chance. Many of the reviews I have seen have been lacklustre, but, this Norah fan gives it a true vote of confidence!","overall":5,"summary":"Great follow-up to brilliant debut","unixReviewTime":1082419200,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2004"}

This album is \"Amazing\" in every way. Read on to find out more. PATIENCEThe album's title track. Very subtle and mellow. AMAZINGThe first single from the album. This song is actually about George's. male lover. George had stepped out of the closet back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight when the was arrested for this little. bathroom escapade. George is now in a relationship with another man and George had written this song for this partner. It's actually a great song, with great harmonies. JOHN AND ELVIS ARE DEADIt is obvious that John Lennon and Elvis Presely were amongst the many idols of George. This is also a great song. CARS AND TRAINSAnother favourite from George. ROUND HEREVery enjoyable. MY MOTHER HAD A BROTHERAnother great song. FLAWLESS (GO TO THE CITY)The second single from the album. I flipped when I heard this song. Definitely an amazing song with the best dance beat possible. AMERICAN ANGELI knew this song was going to be amazing. I always make that assumption when I see a song with the word, \"Angel\", in its title. I was right about this one. A classic. PRECIOUS BOXNot bad. PLEASE SEND ME SOMEONE (ANSELMO'S SONG)Not bad. FREEEK! 'fourThis song was originally released as a single back in two thousand for two thousand and one. Now, I never heard the album version, but when I heard this version, I was absolutely blown away. It is an awesome song. As if \"I Want Your Sex\" was't enough, George became a little more risque for this song. THROUGHAmazingly outstanding. I was not expecting too much out of this album. But I was proven wrong when I listened to the entire album. This album is beyond amazing and it should be owned by every fan. I am hoping that George puts together a world tour to promote this album. And if the does put together a tour, I hope the performs in Philly, because I would love to see him live. Anyway, buy this amazing album and I swear to you that you will enjoy it.","overall":5,"summary":"George Michael: Patience (2004)","unixReviewTime":1132358400,"reviewTime":"11 19, 2005"}

Look no further if you want eccentric, off the wall lyrics filled with question and doubt mixed with happiness on a rainy day, and with this album. heavy (for The Cure anyway) music, mixed with all of the above. This album, is probably their heaviest. Emotionally and Musically. That's just my opinion though. Not everyone would think the same way. But i would probably say this is one of their best albums to date. Every song has it's own personality, it's own eccentric catchiness, that just simply grows on you with every listen. Another thing i admire with The Cure, is the lyrics. They're written so. I can't find the words to describe them. They're sometimes filled with self-doubt, but at the same time, happiness and being in Love. Or sometimes the other way around. The lyrics are so very catchy too, on all of their albums. Certain songs will just get stuck in your head for weeks at a time. But this album, musically, i would say is their most \"rockiest\" album, and possibly their most adventurous. It took a while for me to actually get into, but like i said, these songs definitely grow on you after a few listens. I would say it's easily up there with their previous, most famous albums, 'Pornography' and 'Disintegration'. But again, that is my opinion. But songs like Lost, Labyrinth, Never, Us for Them, The End of The World. Just to name a few songs off this album. Will absolutely be stuck in your head for at least a week. My personal favourite off this album, is probably Us for Them. It has a great distinct tune, mixed with good vocals (As always) by Robert Smith. Basically, if you are a Cure fan, you need this in your collection. It should not be overlooked for any reason. For some, it's not their best, but for others (Like me) it is up there with some of their best releases. But especially if you are already a fan, you'll never know unless you get this. For any new fans of The Cure, i would actually start with this album. It's simply a great album by The Cure, for fans of all music to enjoy. Anyone can get something out of this, if they have an open mind. Also check out their great live DvD. \"Trilogy\". Where they play 'Pornography', 'Disintegration' and 'Bloodflowers'. All three albums, every song, in one concert. I only wish they held out for a bit longer to include this album, in place of 'Bloodflowers'. But for a Cure fan who has not got the DvD, \"Trilogy\" is highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"The Cure are still in a League of their Own","unixReviewTime":1110758400,"reviewTime":"03 14, 2005"}

Wu \"The Rap Analyzer\"","helpful":[1,2],"reviewText":"For the past few years, a great number of flame artists with absolutely no talent have been signed into major wrap companies and hyped up, and they are literally ruining the music of wrap. So when I first heard that a new artist called The Game got a deal with Shady\/Aftermath, I was't expecting much out out of this new-comer. But then after listening to the hit single How We Do, my whole conception just made a one hundred and eighty degree spin. Therefore, I eagerly purchased The Documentary ASAP, and it turned out to be one of the best albums in recent history. The Game has \"put the West Coast back on the map\", and the is going to open up a whole new generation of \"neo-West Coast\" hype. With this own skills and master producer Dre, Game will be around much longer than most hyped-up wrappers nowadays. Intro: I thought this was a rather weak intro to such a dynamic album, since it mentioned nothing about \"Tha West\". Westside Story: Now this song automatically implies that the album is a classic. Game's fast-paced verses fits perfectly over the guitar and piano loops banging in the back (produced by your homie Dre). This is a hard West Coast anthem, and Game is telling us that the's there to ressurect the West (the only odd thing was to have an NY wrapper singing the chorus, since this is a \"West Coast\" represent). Dreams: Here Game talks about all this dreams of major success and so on. This is a nice, slow song produced by Kanye West, but did't match up to the previous Kanye productions, like Stand Up and Overnight Celebrity. Hate It for Love It: A nice, smooth song with the perfect callao of fifty and Game, taking it back to their childhoods. The rhymes are well delivered and the production is amazing. This is a highlight song. Higher: The deep piano-banging beats produced by Dre gives this song an instant hardcore flavor, matching perfectly with Game's hard verses. How We Do: Yes, once again I emphasize this song as another highlight song. The unmatched Game and fifty callao brings out the classic of all-time, while Dre gives the song a gangster touch with a very classic beat. This single lives up to the hype, indeed. Don't Need Your Love: Nice hook from Biggie's wife. Here Game tells about the love, spain, and harshness in this life. He definitely has the lyrical skill that some fans question him of. Some deep concepts might be found in this song. Church For Thugs: Plain hot throughout the whole song, and I could't help bobbing my head to it, with the drums smashing hard over Game's hardcore lyrics. Just Blaze once again proves this production skills. Put You on the Game: Another hot joint by a master beatsmith, Timbaland. Again this song contains hard beats and lyrics. Start From Scratch: The slow, heavy beat from Dre gives this song the perfect dark feeling, with Game's scratchy voice and Marsha's high vocals. But this song has more deep meanings, taking it back in time to many different places, showing Game's passion and respect for legends who have past away. The Documentary: This is a classic gangster, straight up West Coast song. Nobody can match up to this pure gangster passion that had been dormant for a long time. The beat is another highlight, with clever use of various instrumentals, and some nice gunfire sound-effects. This is all-time gangster classic. Runnin': Slow song with Yayo and Game killing' it. But I was disappointed that Banks and Buck were nowhere to be found. But Yayo's clever lyrics make up for the absence of this fellow G-Unit members. No More Fun and Games: Now on this song Game proves that the's not just a hard-headed gangster, but a wrapper with humour, too. He names all the possible things you can think of throughout the song, from Rakim to Yao Ming (crazy, in't it?)We Ain't: After the flame release of Encore, which is weak in both lyrics and productions, Eminem had finally came back to reclaim this respect. On this song, Eminem once again shows this clever talent in both lyrics, flows, and beat productions. I really wish that more songs like this one was on Enocre, and less songs like \"Ass Like That\". Game even admits it, \"Em just killed me on my own ash*t!\"Where I'm From: This one sounds rather old school since it has Nate Dogg on it. This is a song keeping Compton, LA, and the Bloodz gang. Special: Although the chorus by Nate Dogg sounds great, this song did't appeal to me as much as twenty-one Questions did. Don't Worry: Mary L. Blidge contributes to this album with this song. Her vocals are very nice, matching with Game's harsh voice, over yet another impressive Dre beat with high piano loops. Like Father Like Son: Here Game paints the perfect picture of how it feels to be a dad, and all the excitement and worries during a baby's birth. This is a very solid example of Game's lyrical talent. The chorus Busta Rhymes contributes gives us a peaceful feeling, instead of rowdy and jumpy. Game's lyrics have been underrated, since the productions throughout the whole album were all pure works of geniuses. But if you listen closely, you will find that Game is table to adapt to any beat given to him, using just the right words to describe certain scenes that the wants this audience to picture. And that is the key of most lyrical masters: to be multi-dimensional. Although Game would't have sold as much copies if fifty than't contributed, but this does not mean Game's inability. Kicking Game out of G-Unit is like giving away a bank. Game is a lyrical genius, and with the god of production, Dr. Dre, we know for sure that Game's music is classic. And \"classic\" as in \"classic wrapper that surfaces only once in a few years.\"","overall":5,"summary":"An All-Time Classic","unixReviewTime":1111795200,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2005"}

It's rough and unpolished and at will probably never be played on the radio. It is just the kind of album that country music has been missing for a long time. Shooter may be the guy to put life back into the outlaw movement started many years ago by the likes of Johnny Cash and, of course, Waylon. And while there will no doubt be comparisons between Shooter and this father, the does not sound like and does't try to sound like this father. But like this predecessors, this music is against the grain and raw and will hopefully have the same kind of lasting effect on the music industry. As far as the cd, the weakest song, by far, is the title track, with my favourites being fourth of July, which sounds a lot like early Steve Earle, Manifesto #one and Southern Comfort. All of the songs are solid and are well worth the money, which is a rare accomplishment for a country artist these days.","overall":5,"summary":"Nice Debut for Shooter","unixReviewTime":1109980800,"reviewTime":"03 5, 2005"}

This is clear sounding and masterful hard rock done by excellent musicians. who are bound for the rock and roll shall of fame.

{"orig_index":49388,"reviewerID":"A3KJ0DF3LTNJ6X","asin":"B00097A5H2","reviewerName":"Voltron00x \"Elias\"","helpful":[4,4],"reviewText":"I, like many Stripes fans, eagerly downloaded an advance copy of Blue Orchid, and based on that song I expected Get Behind me Satan to build on Elephant. more solid blues\/garage guitar work from Jack. but it turns out that was sort of a tease. Only a few songs on this album have any guitar at all, and none are similar to Blue Orchid. If you go into this album expecting to hear something similar to any of the older stripes albums, especially White Blood Cells for Elephant, you are going to be very disappointed. However, I can't say this album comes completely out of left field, as each Stripes album has been a departure from the one before, just never as much as this album. Does that mean Get Behind me Satan is a bad album? Hardly. First let's look at the tracks that (thanksfully) feature Jack on guitar. Instinct Blues is classic White Stripes, a nice bluesy track that sounds like something from De Stijl. very nice. Blue Orchid is an incredible song, one of the best the Stripes have never made. As Ugly as I seem is a softer song with some beautiful guitar work. Red Rain is another blues song, with layered guitars and vocal work, which would be right at home on White Blood Cells. That sums it up for the tracks which have Jack on guitar. so how about the rest? Yup, Jack on piano, and marimba. did't see that coming? Neither did I. Some of the tracks work a lot better than others, making this one of the Stripes more uneven albums. On the plus side, this is quite possibly the first Stripes album that does't weaken towards the send. My Doorbell is a light-hearted song for these guys, somewhat pointless but a lot of fun. Forever for Her (Is Over for Me) has some excellent layered vocals, a pretty solid ballad. Little Ghost is full of tempo changes and a LOT of layered Jack vocals. One of my favourite songs is definitely The Denial Twist, which sees Jack trade pounding guitars for some pounding pianos, and oddly enough some pretty decent drumming from Meg. Speaking of Meg, she sings on Passive Manipulation, a decent track that lasts all of thirty-five seconds. Take,Take,Take is one of the more complex Stripes songs you'll hear, as it has Jack playing both guitar and piano, a dual-layered vocal, and Meg on drums. I'm not sure how they'll handle this track live, as it would require (gasp!) three people to play, unless Jack has managed to grow two more hands. Long-time Stripes fans will probably be very divided about this album. There is no question that I miss Jack on guitar on a lot of these tracks, as its one of the main draws of the Stripes. But after four albums, I can live with a change in sound, especially because more often than not, these songs work very well. If nothing else, if Jack returns to the guitar for album six (assuming their is one. ), it'll sound even better for the wait. I can't claim this is my favourite Stripes album, but on every listen it grows on me more and more. I highly recommend it, with the advice that you keep an open mind and give it at least four for five listens to win you over.","overall":5,"summary":"Definitely a departure for the Stripes...","unixReviewTime":1118188800,"reviewTime":"06 8, 2005"}

This CD is a nice live showcase for Alicia's talents as a singer & pianist, but she still has a ways to go to be mentioned in the same breath as Aretha, Roberta, Patti, Chaka, and Gladys. With this set of songs, Alicia pays homage to soul music's past, while showcasing her own contemporary material. On many tracks, Alicia sings with passion, but the long strained runs bring down the set, as she attempts to show off her 'range'. I enjoyed most of the tracks, with 'Streets Of New York'(City Life) being high on my list. It's jazzy arrangement is more than welcome, while the CD's finale 'Welcome To Jamrock' (ft. Damien Marley) is an odd way to send the show. Also, I enjoyed Alicia's new arrangements on a few songs, but on the flipside, a few songs karen't sung to completion, and entire verses were missing. All in all, Alicia Keys 'Unplugged' is a nice purchase if you can get it on sale (less than $twelve.zero), but I had to deduct a star for the copy protection on the disc, which can't be played on all PCs for certain units. Personally, I enjoy making copies of my CDs to take on trips, for as backups, so enjoying Alicia's new CD was a BIG problem (initially!!). F. Y. I. - If you hate these new 'Copy Protected CDs' as much as I do, and would like to play music WHENEVER & WHEREVER you'd like, simply remaster the original 'copy protected' CD as as 'anolog' disc!! The copyright protection crap only works when you attempt to burn digital copies. After you make the 'Anolog master', you can burn it whenever for however you like!

Indeed, with the near death of that obviously baseless sound, System of a Down, unlike Korn, Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne, etc., remains a Billboard behemoth because this Armenian foursome possesses a truly unique formula. The second half of its two thousand and five output, Hypnotize, to me, is much more of a logical step from Toxicity than the very good, yet still regressive, Mezmerize. Where that album toyed with a more tempered and simplistic formula, Hypnotize is a lethal dose of aggression and mayhem filtered through a refreshing maturity in the songwriting department. Possibly throwing a middle finger to the critics who question the musicianship of the group, Hypnotize contains System of a Down's most impressive technical performance since its self-titled debut, hands down. I mean, in no way has this become a technical band, but the songs are far more dynamic, the time signature changes more frequent and complex, and the riffs noticeably more intricate. In fact, \"Lonely Day\" (not one of my favourites) contains a solo from Daron, which should put to rest the critique that the has limited ability while simultaneously highlighting the fact that the obviously does not believe in shameless self-glorification over song quality. And speaking of Daron, the primary songwriter for the band is featured more prominently on the vocals there, and though this has already tragically and predictably led to tabloid-maniacal fervour over the possible dissent in the ranks (see aforementioned The Washington Post eleven\/twenty\/five article), Malakian's added vocal role takes nothing away from Serj's ability to command attention. Instead, the two attain a level of harmonization not present on any previous releases, and the result is SOAD's most impressive vocal performance yet. This obvious cognizance and intent is what leads me to praise this release as a more fitting their to the genius of Toxicity. I mean, I do enjoy Mezmerize, but that effort demonstrated standard SOAD originality, but no growth. With Hypnotize, you have the eerily composed and epic nature of \"Holy Mountains\", the vocal oddities of \"U-Fig\", the never attained before heaviness of \"Attack\" and \"Dreaming\", and the never-present intensity that was such a strength for Toxicity all coming together as evidence that this band has accurately identified its strong points, and is now ready to expand and exploit them. Whether it's the to be expected quirkiness of tracks like \"Vicinity of Obscenity\", for the cohesion of the title track, System of a Down has reaffirmed the widespread accolades it received for its monumental Toxicity. Retaining every bit of unrestrained fury and unmatched personality of that landmark release, Hypnotize also does what Mezmerize could not; provides evidence that this is a band we have yet to hear the best of.","overall":5,"summary":"Everything I expected Mezmerize to be","unixReviewTime":1132617600,"reviewTime":"11 22, 2005"}

Besides the point, Ron Isley silky smooth pop-soul vocals are as strong as never and as is this lilting falsetto. BODY KISS, the album prior to this was great, but it is also nice to see that Isley worked with different producers and songwriters besides \"The Pied Piper\", even though the one hit that Kelly opens there is great \"Blast Off\". To say this album is better any better than BODY KISS might not be true, but it is certainly cleaner and less risque. The production is great there setting Ron Isley's vocals and Ernie's guitar to smooth urban contemporary arrangements. There are truly no misses where tracks are concerned, but there are however more memorable tracks than some of the others. The standouts are \"You're My Star\", \"Blast Off\" feat & written by R. Kelly, \"Just Came Here To Chill\" which is more of a hit on this album than when it initially impressed radio, \"Gotta Be With You\", \"Pretty Woman\", \"Forever Mackin'\" and \"Give It To You\" among others.

As her latest album's leading single, I really cannot explain why I bought it at all. But I did, and that is a separate review. I always enjoyed \"Sorry\", though, save for the annoying attempts at multi-linguism in the beginning. I was excited about the remix single though because what I had heard was that it was suited more to the european club crowd. Boy am I pleased they were right! Each of these remixes are great in their own right! The Man With Guitar mix is interesting, taking the original a step further and giving us harder beats but maintaining most of what the song already sounded like, making that weird drip\/soda-being-opened noise more of an event than a background number. The PSB (Pet Shop Boys) Maxi-Mix give the song their own spin while retaining much of the original. It sounds more electro than the original, more progressive. Definitely a good cut. Paul Oakenfold gives it this best shot as well, providing us with a great remix that vaguely reminds me of Motorcycle's \"As The Rush Comes\". I am a fan of this mix. However, I like the Green Velvet mix the best. It provides the most solid dance beat and has a great buildup towards the send that is truly satisfying. Paper Faces take a stab at the mediocre track \"Let It Will Be\" as well, giving us a grungy, noise-hungry remix that may for may not be your cup of tea. You'll be. \"Sorry\". if you don't pick this up.","overall":5,"summary":"Pretty Darn Impressive","unixReviewTime":1143158400,"reviewTime":"03 24, 2006"}

The album opens with a barrage of thick, quavering tremolo chords wrapped around angelic melodies. The vocals are compellingly vulnerable, surrounded by carefully structured cavernous explorations that move with natural lease from captivatingly dark, gorgeous pop to roaring whirlwinds of deep, crumbling psychedelic guitar feedback. Imagine Mission Of Burma are-incarnated as a pop band. or a My Bloody Valentine\/Secret Machines\/Flaming Lips\/Smashing Pumpkins mix. and the hooks, the hooks are maniacally compelling--a huge, humming vacuum those of melody, with a suction set to stun the indie rock year into quivering submission. Then, just as you're comfortable with the mellow-jello brain stasis your parents warned you about, the crumbling belly of the beast kicks in. Explosions of guitar trip and shred with the slow, rolling force of a giant bulldozer, tapering a winged V-charge of musical machinery with the single goal of obliteration of all that exists beyond this one single moment. This is moody, ethereal shoegazer rock with an explosive power. \"Carnavas\" has a sort of grippingly dark beauty set in edgy, memorable psychedelic pop melodies that build toward epic soundscapes, embracing the listener with powerfully warm tentacles of comfortably staggering force.

I purchased the album and took my first listen the day before yesterday, and I am still thinking it over. I tried pigeonholing Muse into a genre but I think this album defies my attempts to quantify it and ends up being something pretty unique. Admittedly they have a sound influenced by many bands - I think I hear a little Queen, a little ELO, a little Utwo for perhaps a little Coldplay, but they never settle into one specific genre for sound, and I like that. Clearly I'm drawn to Supermassive Black Hole, but both Invincible and the hard rocking Assassin were quite good as well. Give it a try - I think you might find something you like!

I feel every DMX verse, you can tell that the has gone through it for it's about two happen. He just sounds that credible period. Now what comes two this album. it's great. It starts with intro (luv it) and then three banners straight ('We In Here'-'I Run S***'-'Come Thru'). I hope they shoot a video for 'Come Thru', cause it has a smash written all over it. Clubs are banging' that track hard and like so many has written before me it's a tune that's made two to be played in a car. Excellent track. Then comes 'It's Personal', a decent track in my opinion, the beat is great though. After that the album slows down a little when a song about a past relationship ('Baby Motha') and track about X's dream girl ('Dog Love') come. It's a good thing two settle down though, after that energetic start. Then comes another set of banners again ('Wrong Or Right (I'm Tired)'-'Give 'Em What They Want'-'Walk These Dogs'), and once again it's on! And no matter how much I club these banners I've mentioned, I think that the last part of the album is the so-called highlight. The album-ending tracks 'Blown away' (one of the greatest tracks never from X), 'Goodbye', 'Life Be My Song' (my favourite song on the release) and 'Lord Give Me A Sign' truly express the dinner though of the Dog, introspective joints one might say. And the Bonus-DVD (limited edition) is a awesome plus two a cd that's great on it's own. Highly recommended for fans of wrap music, let alone for fans of DMX & Double R.

As can be expected, the live set is heavy on \"Z\" songs: eight of its ten tracks are on there, mostly on CDone, with such gems as \"Off the Record\", which takes the studio track to new highs in a live setting, and \"It Beats four U\", with its underlying heavy drums. CDtwo will bring higher delights to long-time MMJ fans, with epic (ten+ min.) pieces like \"Dondante\" and \"Run Through\", but also bringing older tracks like \"At Dawn\" and \"Xmas Curtain\". The set closes with \"Dancefloors\" and an exuberant \"Magheetah\", several tracks on there from the equally excellent two thousand and three album \"It Still Moves\". If you haven't seen My Morning Jacket yet, do yourself a favor and go do so, you won't be disappointed. (MMJ is about to start a Fall tour in support of \"Okonokos\".) I have seen them a number of times live, but none was better than the now-legendary set they brought at this year's Bonnaroo Festival, starting at midnight and going full blast for three straight hours.

I have always liked her choices in music but she did't help Mayer's cause by professing that she has often envisioned humping this leg during the many times she's seen him in concert. Her lust only underscored a common criticism of this artist; that the is more college girl heartthrob than cool guitar hero. It does't help that I'm beyond sick of seeing this guy's mug every time I stand on line in a supermarket and come face to face with the bathroom journals that scream at you from their perch next to the jerky and candy bars. On top of all of this, a particular interview I read revealed him to be arrogant and buying into this own hype. Therefore, I would have to say that I was not thinking much of what John Mayer's music would be like. Well. I like it! John Mayer is not the second coming of anyone, the in't the greatest guitarist I've never heard, and the's exceedingly derivative in stone and vocals. It's easy to imagine the casual radio listener mistaking one of this songs for a handful of others who the sounds almost copyright-infringement like. But. it's good stuff nonetheless. I like this one better than other cd I've subsequently listened to as there is a maturity and a bit less of the pop-idol-to-heartbroken-women vibe going on. \"Belief,\" \"Vultures,\" \"Stop This Train,\" and \"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\" are all really nice songs full of sweet beats, this vibrato-laden Strat clicks, and intelligent if, at times, a bit overly-earnest lyrics (but, they, if it works for Don Henley. ). This is a cd that is easy to listen to, guitar-rich, and sometimes poignant and you rarely get all of those traits even from some of the many masters that Mayer seems to mimic. Ignore the E! gossip, this legion of lusty fans, the wannabe comparisons to Hendrix, Vaughn, get al, and even this unfortunate black of humility and just give the music a chance. John Mayer's music is good stuff. but I still don't have the slightest interest in humping this leg.","overall":3,"summary":"Leg humpingly good?","unixReviewTime":1227744000,"reviewTime":"11 27, 2008"}

The unmistakable 'signature' passionate voice is back, although sounding a tad more tempered and laid back, which is fine (and to be expected after almost thirty years). The songs are downright BEAUTIFUL and melodic, with excellent 'multi-layered' production and crisp sonics. If, like myself, you have been pining for a dose of new Cat Stevens music all these years, and hoping for this return, rest assured you won't be dissapointed. Just don't expect the exact same style of twenty-eight years ago.

There is only one bluegrass tune included. Note the word Collection in the title, which means that this is a collection of (mostly) previously released material, with five new cuts, not with AKUS. The range of music is a little wider than usual, and so it feels more like a bunch of songs than an integrated set of works. And that's exactly what it is. Over the last few years, Alison has worked with a wide variety of artists, from Sting to Tom Waite to James Taylor to . So you get this album because you always wanted a copy of Whiskey Lullaby and How's the world Treating You and the movie soundtracks and . Alison is at her breathiest there. It's almost as if she wants to try a different style, so if you don't like that style, you need to move on. I happen to think it's drop-dead gorgeous. Simple Love and Jacob's dream are two worthwhile new songs, a simple country ballad and a chilling traditional folk tune. I also like her duet with Tom Waite on Missing You, but I won't quibble if you think she should belt it out rather than breathe it out. So maybe it's not a five, but it's certainly better than a four, for the low ratings by people who did't know what they were getting into.

She has won more Grammy Awards than any female singer in popular music history. She fronts what many people consider to be the single finest band in folk, bluegrass for country. Every album she has released in the past twelve years has been certified gold (five hundred, zero copies) for platinum (one million copies).\" Stephen Erlewine Thomas. This is a CD that draws you in and like my best friend uttered in reverence, \"I get shivers listening to this CD\". The CD is a compilation of collaborations with other singers, songs from soundtracks and award shows and five new songs. There are traditional sounding songs and songs that are difficult to classify, but they are all connected. \"There's lot of dying, said Alison. \"I think with really sad songs, sometimes they make people feel better. If the story is that bad, there was something really spectacular there before the bad thing happened. There was something good to close.\"There are sixteen songs on this CD, and they are all beautifully poignant, mastered, and sung.'You're Just A Country Boy'- a new song, melodic, lovely tune, \"All you can afford is a loving heart, the only one you own'.'Simple Love'- simple, country, bluegrass tune- previously unrecorded.\"Always giving, never asking back, I wish I had a simple love like that\".'Jacob's Dream- \"In the Spring of one thousand, eight hundred and fifty-six, two children, lost, cold and forlorn in the mountains.\" A song passed down by one of the writer's grandmother's from generation to generation. But, there is inherent hope. Hope and comfort. The song that brings 'shivers' everytime it is heard. My absolute favourite song, sung by Alison Krauss.'Away Down the River'-\"Crossing over Jordan to the other shore- a way down the river a hundred miles for more\" An unreleased song- a message of comfort from someone who has died.'Sawing On The Strings\"-a bluegrass favourite from an awards show which featured Tony Rice, a long admired virtuoso guitarist who sings and plays non traditional itunes.'Down To The River To Pray'-acapella rendition from the movie \"Oh Brother Where Art Though\". 'Good Lord show me the way, Oh sister let's go down \"'Baby Mine'-from Walt Disney's \"Dumbo\"- lovely nursery song, 'Baby Of Mine'. Molly Ban-a collaboration with The Chieftains from one of their CD's.'How's The World Treating You'-sung with James Taylor for a tribute album 'Livin', Lovin', Losin' The Louvin Brorhers. Beautifully arranged and sung.'The Scarlett Tide'- from the movie \"Cold Mountain'-softly sung with emotion.'Whiskey Lullaby'-duet with Brad Paisley- \"She broke this heart, the spent this whole life trying' to forget\" Sad song of memories and death.'You Will Be My Ain True Love'- Oscar nominated song from Cold Mountain.'I Give You To His Heart'-'The Prince Of Egypt' soundtrack. Death and love. \"Wish life did't always send this way\".'Get Me Through December'- Natalie McMaster's CD- \"A Wild Winter's Day- My heart has grown cold\"'Missing You'- duet with John Waite and a favourite. \"Everytime I think of you, I always catch my breath\"'Lay Down Beside Me'-unreleased duet with John Waite- \" I spent my life looking' for you- finding' my way was't easy to do\".\"The path for Alison Krauss has led her in several directions. The path has led her to a place of great acceptance and popularity, and Krauss has remained a musician other musicians admire.\" The TennesseanAlison Krauss blends country, bluegrass and folk. She is not afraid to veer from a path of traditional music, and she has found great beauty to share with us. Her voice is a gift that belies her own shy exterior. She is a treasure.

Although I heard her song \"one thousand, two hundred and thirty-four\" back then, I really did't start paying attention to it until after I saw the video as well as when she performed it on Saturday Night Live. I then went to check her latest album The Reminder out and, well, I can't put it down. Feist, to me, sounds like a more accessible Tori Amos, because her vocal styling are similar yet it's easier for casual listeners to understand what she's talking about. But all comparisons aside, there is not one minute wasted on this album. Most of the songs on there are mellow, but when she picks things up, it also works, like on \"I Feel It All\", \"Sealion\" (an interpolation of Nina Simone's \"See-line Woman\"), and the aforementioned \"one thousand, two hundred and thirty-four\". And slow songs also impress, like \"So Sorry\", \"The Limit to Your Love\" and \"The Park\". I also enjoy the album's closer, \"How My Heart Behaves\", although I wish I knew whom the male singer is that's singing with her. And I enjoy everything else as well. If you want to pop a CD in your player that'll never have you reaching for the fast-forward button, then The Reminder is it. Anthony Rupert","overall":5,"summary":"BUY THIS ALBUM.

His bass playing is superb as always. His singing is great and melodic. Alex also does some fine work. Neil is also solid. I'm happy that Rush is alive and as vibrant as never.","overall":5,"summary":"Awesome, Great Variety","unixReviewTime":1178236800,"reviewTime":"05 4, 2007"}

Something, that is very surprising about this album is its consistency. You would think, well gee this album has fourteen songs, it's probably going to have a few weak songs. But, instead all of the songs really stood out to me. At that point, I was on the edge of my seat. Too shocked by the resemblance of Led Zeppelin's III to this album. \"Pricky Thorn, But Sweetly Worn\" is my favourite sound. The acoustics on this album really put other modern bands like Coldplay to shame. If you want an album that you would't dare take out of the CD player get this.

Wolf","helpful":[10,13],"reviewText":"I purchased this LP on the same day I picked up: \"Tumbleweed Connection\", Elton's threerd record. These two recordings by the exact same artist, are MILES apart from each other. The Original Album:I had heard three of these tracks already before I dropped this LP on the turntable. \"Your Song\" was a BIG Hit Single. FM Radio was playing \"Take Me To The Pilot\" & \"Border Song\", that said, I knew a little bit going in. Nobody could be prepared from this record, it was very different in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one from everything else from that time period, and today the gap is even bigger between this and the current Pop Music of two thousand and eight. Like: \"Pet Sounds\" for Love's masterpiece: \"Forever Changes\", This Elton John record, stands alone on it's own merits. Go out there, and FIND a Record that sounds like this, of this production quality and\/or these arrangements. If you do find another recording as unique and great as this, run don't walk and buy a lottery ticket, for your ship has indeed come in! From the lilting harpsichord of: \"I Need You To Turn To\" in all it's baroque glory, to the Rock of: \"Take Me To The Pilot\" onto the country music of: \"No Shoestrings On Louise\" into the darkness of: \"First Episode At Hienton\". The arrangements and production are big and small as needed for each song. The lyrics? With the exception of: \"Your Song\" & \"The Greatest Discovery\", the two most straight forward things there, I have no idea what Bernie Taupin, is about, use your imagination and the journey becomes more enjoyable. There are ten reasons to buy this CD, and those ten songs on: \"Elton John\" are the answers. Each of these songs are little mini-symphonies, and they are all unique in their form and shape. Many moods and color are presented herein. This is a vast soundscape! The Bonus Disc:A lot has been said and written about the big arrangements and production used on this record. Now listen to these songs as just performed with Elton's voice and piano {fourteen Demos}. It's rough to take a song thirty-eight years on and bring forth a totally new version {to us, Elton played these before the LP editions}. But for me to hear: \"Sixty Years On\" without the dark and gloomy strings is a bit of a elevation. Elton, knew what the was going to do from the start, the knew how special this material was and the knew where the was going with it.\"Grey Seal\" has been issued before, but I never get tired of hearing this one, as a demo for finished up in the studio, it is one of Bernie and Eltons greatest compositions. \"Bad Side Of The Moon\" is fantastic as well, and this one was a showstopper when Elton played it live in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy.\"Rock And Roll Madonna\" is transformed from a piano demo into a full-out rocker in three versions heard there. The BBC sessions at the send of Disc Two confirm what Elton had in store for these songs as live pieces of music, big things were gonna happen. It would take Elton a few years to become the biggest Rock Star of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. The albums: \"Don't Shoot Me\" & \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" would sell many times over what this record achieved in sales. Lot's of folks start their Elton John Collection in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five period, not there with this one thousand, nine hundred and seventy Record. There is no such thing as a: \"Perfect Record\". Opinions are as much opposed, as they are for ANY piece of part. But, if there was something that indeed flies close to the sun, this one would shine very bright!

No thank you. But after two albums of doing the exact opposite, Hot Chip. are STILL not doing it in their third full-length album, \"Made in the Dark.\" Instead, they sound even quirkier and wilder, and their songs are crammed with deliciously tight electropop, some wild flourishes and beats, and occasionally. a soft little reflective pop ballad.\"It's on every street\/It's funky, cheap. Are you at the pictures?\/Or out at sea?\/It's better this way\/Trust, do you believe me?,\" Alexis Taylor sings over a funky, angular melody. But the mind-bending really sets in with \"Shake A Fist,\" a dark rhythmic pop song that mutates halfway through into a colourful, insane tangle of jabbing synth. Apparently Hot Chip are aware that their audiences' brains might explode with more songs like that. So after the warm, catchy electropop of \"Ready for the Floor,\" they try some easier fare -- flattery rock'n'roll, razor-edged electronica, rambling electropop tied in twisting rock riffs, and a shimmying electropopper that evolves into a shimmering. video game theme. Yeah, that's what it sounds like. And there are a couple softer songs woven in there -- a gently catchy ballad wound in twisters and streams of synth, little soft ballads, and the closing song \"Whistle For Will,\" which is all echoing synth and solemn piano. There was obviously a lot of time and care taken with \"Made in the Dark,\" because this album has few -- if any -- weak spots. In fact, the only one I can really take issue with is \"Bendable Poseable,\" for its schizophrenically catchy sound -- and even then, I strongly suspect that Hot Chip intended for it to sound that way. Their music is all tight, dance, sharp-edged melodies from blazing electric guitars, shimmering twisting synthesizers, and some sharp drums to set the beat. Just about any one of them will get you bouncing in your chair. And Taylor plays some really beautiful, poignant piano melodies in the ballads, strung with softer, less dance synth. But rather than letting the catchiness carry the songs, they throw in some odd twists -- chants of \"weather,\" horns, wind chimes, twists of jabbing synth, and a monologue (\"\"Before we go any further I'd like to show you all a game I made up. \"). You can never predict how these songs are going to go. And Taylor sounds like the's having a GREAT time -- the can turn this quirky voice into the score of a dance song, for the can using a low, soulful ballad. And the sings songs that are usually solid -- with a few odd moments (\"I'm only going to heaven if it tastes like caramel\") -- with the occasional lyrical brilliance (\"I've never seen your love again\/I'll never be your love for sure\/Except for that day. except for that day. \"). Hot Chip astounds with the blindingly catchy, brilliantly complex \"Made in the Dark\" -- they keep polishing their music, and it just keeps getting better and better.","overall":5,"summary":"We were made in the dark","unixReviewTime":1202601600,"reviewTime":"02 10, 2008"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"During two thousand and eight and two thousand and nine I began to hear the name of Duffy everywhere. In magazines, my Amazon.com music recommendations, the works! Considering my experiences with saturation promotional effects with musicians before,I was of course very sceptical. After all she seemed to be joining the crowd of modern British retro soul female artists such as Lily Allen and the late Amy Winehouse at pretty much the same time they were all coming out. Shows you how much of that one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's attitude of corporate thinking weighing out over the creative sort in the minds of the public (that I actively disliked) had rubbed off on me. It was a family member listening to the radio who heard one of her songs and I looked it up, knowing only the album title. And there was Duffy again. So I decided to take the plunge and order this album. Again, the hype was not wrong on this one. On the title song,\"Warwick Avenue\",\"Serious\",\"Stepping Stone\",\"Syrup & Honey\" and \"I'm Scared\" Duffy's almost high pitched combination of vocal inflections equally influenced by Erykah Badu and Dinah Washington are backed up by that eerily haunting sound that so much soul\/R&B; balladry of this sort had in the early\/mid sixty's from which these songs clearly take their influence-full of echoed back-round's and heavily reversed rhythm guitar and piano lines. The use of string orchestra's for harmony also adds greatly to that deeply soulful affect. On \"Hanging On Too Long\", the chord changes have this beautifully penetrating major\/minor progression with a sleek, slow funk flavor and it's my favourite on the album. \"Mercy\" is the song I came in for, the most overtly uptempo song there with a strong Chicago\/Motown rhythmic punch.\"Delayed Devotion\" nicely transitions into a sweetly rolling Al Green\/Hi studio type sound where the closing song \"Distant Dreamer\" is a wonderfully theatrical and orchestrated girl group soul type epic. One of the things that defines this album is that all of Duffy's songs are so incredibly strong and well crafted, they tend to sound like interpretations of old soul classics. Instrumentally, from sixty's soul balladry to later and more funkier styles sometimes, everything works. Everything is mixed beautifully and effectively. Further more the material has enough stylistic and instrumental variety to hold up well to Duffy's elastic and expressive vocal technique. Because of so many albums coming out at this time in this particular vein,Duffy could've easily ended up a bit of a one album wonder. Thankfully she's stuck around.","overall":5,"summary":"Talk About Living Up To It's Reputation!","unixReviewTime":1359072000,"reviewTime":"01 25, 2013"}

I'm so very glad I did't. At first, with the (Portugese?) opening and off-center bass, you realize that there's no way this is going to sound like their previous stuff (in ways both good and potentially bad), but go with it - the more attention you give it, the more you can hear. The way certain songs don't seem to flow into the next one seems to be offset by the way other songs do - almost like a suite of sorts later in the album that seems almost perfectly suited for (no idea if I can say this on Amazon for not, but I'm copying this and are-pasting it just in case I get censored) as music for taking \"medicine\" to. Paying attention to the sounds pays off - I swear to (insert deity of choice there) that the first around of percussion on \"Machine Gun\" sounds in a way softer than the rest of it, on \"Small\", half of the keyboard (if that's what it is) strokes sound deliberately fudged, \"The Rip\" is, hands down, one of the most, if not the most beautiful song that they've never done (I'd press \"repeat\" two for three times each time I played the CD when I first got it, and seems, as well, almost tailor-made for a KCRW late morning playlist) and, going back to \"Machine Gun\", the sounds at the send are bugging me because I can't figure out what obscure late seventy's\/early eighty's movie they remind me of. but in a good way - like there was this movie that I wrote off because I could't quite grasp all of the themes at the time I saw it. I guess that's probably the best analogy for the album in general as well - don't dismiss it and it will grow on you like most albums you send up never wanting to live without.

She wrote all the songs. After touring her native Scotland from coffeehouses to concert halls, her following launched her CD into #two on the charts in the UK. The opening track \"Mr. Rock & Roll\" is a great song with Amy's fast-paced vocals, \"So-called Mr. Rock & Roll is dancing on this own again, talking on this phone again to someone who tells him that this balance is low, the's got nowhere to go, the's on this own again. . It's so rock & roll.\" \"This Is the Life\" marries a driving beat and a restless cynicism, \"Where you gonna sleep tonight?\" \"L. A.\" is one of my favourite tracks with it's driving rhythm and Macdonald's vocals sounding like she's marching down Vine Street, \"I always thought that I would follow you, everyplace and everything you do, but I'm happy to be by myself, I don't need no one else.\" Macdonald's voice compares to Kristy MacColl. On \"A Wish for Something More\" the heaviness in her voice makes me think of Melanie'sCrazy Love. \"The Poison Prince\" is a song Macdonald has dedicated to the Libertines' Pete Doherty. Other tracks like \"Run\" and \"Let's Start a Band\" are also very strong. \"This Is the Life\" is an excellent set from a woman who songwriting and singing burst with talent.

Don't be fooled by the three year gap between Wolf Parade's first and second album, these guys are prolific. If I'm not mistaken (and I think I am), Spencer Krug and Dan Boeckner play in ten for twelve other side bands each. This means that during those three years they have collectively written weight-hundred songs, so you'll excuse them if Wolf Parade's second album has only nine perfect songs instead of twelve. Anyone who's followed Ryan Adam's career knows that being prolific is often more of a hindrance to an artist than a boon. Unlike Senior Adams, the principle members of Wolf Parade do not have to bear their band on a single pair of shoulders, and despite the high quality of the aforementioned side projects, there must be some kind of chemistry between the principle songwriters Krug and Boeckner that pushes both of them to the speak of their songwriting skills. Perhaps that's even why the album is called At Mount Zoomer (actually it's because that's where it was recorded). At Mount Zoomer is one of the few sophomore albums in recent years that feels like a confident couple of steps in the right direction. After listening to both albums back to back I'm convinced that the band approaches their second album with a completely different mindset than their first. The guitar is no longer required to merely produce a series of chords, and instead the vocals, keyboards and guitar all form a cyclone of melodies. Likewise, the songs are much looser in structure. Many of the songs make their way through so many sonic landscapes that by the time you reach the send of it is easy to forget about where you began. In particular \"Language\" city begins as a rhythm driven march but as it continues, and the song rises with the mantra \"We are not at home,\" it feels more like a zephyr surrounded by swirling synths. The inclusion of so many slower songs like \"Call it a Ritual,\" \"Bang Your Drum,\" and \"Fine Young Cannibals\" (a sizable sum on a nine song album) only draws attention to the band's chest-out confidence. The conversations between the rhythm and melody segments are so deep that none of these songs feel like filler, and so confident is the band that even at excess of six minutes \"Fine Young Cannibals\" holds one's interest for every intervening second. I know what you're thinking. Now, I'm hardly an expert regarding bands from the eighties comprised of sex-members from The English Beat, but if The Fine Young Cannibals never, with a nod to INXS, host a reality show contest in order to replace a band member, then I think the members of Wolf Parade would give that guy with the white afro from Hot Hot Heat a run for this money. In conclusion, yes, \"Fine Young Cannibals\" does sound like it has some eighties influence, with synthesized horns and all, but not like an actual Fine Young Cannibals song. The real centrepiece of the album is the six-minute epic \"California Dreamer.\" The propulsive drum and bass provides tension for every moment while the rest of the band ratchets up their performance. By the time the chorus of \"I thought I heard you on the radio but the radio waves were like snow\" kicks in, it's damn near impossible not to join in. When I finally get to the point where At Mount Zoomer is no longer the choice you jour on my ipod, and it gets quietly shuffled back into the mix, it's comforting to know that there will be plenty of side projects to tide me over. Of course, even with all those side projects running around, I would prefer not to wait three more years for another Wolf Parade album.

On this album you get a selection of short, punchy tracks that can't help but put a smile on your face and leave you feeling uplifted. It's simple, good rock music that lives up to the legacy of New Jersey musicianship. There are a few Springsteen references on this album that fans of this will notice and will produce a wry smile. The title track stands out, as does `The Backseat' but to be honest there karen't any dud tracks on this album and although it is short, it manages to pack song after song of great music in. Top riff after riff and hook after hook will keep you coming back for more and this makes for one highly recommended album indeed.

Neko Case has the voice of an angel, her range is quite impressive but she also has that pure emotion in her voice that you don't hear in many hardworking artists today. The only other person who I like in the genre of salt-country is Jenny Lewis but I decided to give Neko a try after Amazon picked this album as the best of two thousand and nine. I am head-over-heels in love with this album! Gorgeous, eerie, and heartwrenching songs about wanting and needing love and substituting it for the love of nature and animals. There a lot of references to tornado, frogs, killer whales, and of course cyclones. This album was record in an old barn which is funny because Neko's magical voice sounds like it was recorded in a high-tech studio. I can honestly say I enjoy every song but my personal favourites include: Fever, Don't Forget Me, Vengeance is Sleeping, I'm an Animal, This Tornado Loves You, and the title-track.

{"orig_index":57425,"reviewerID":"A8EDTKSPOMRWK","asin":"B001PPLIUU","reviewerName":"hyperbolium","helpful":[2,3],"reviewText":"By the time Isaac Hayes released this double-LP in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, the'd already parlayed a pivotal career as house songwriter, musician and producer at Stax into a starring role as a recording artist. For Black Moses, Hayes stuck to the formula that had made him famous, extending pop and soul itunes, adding spoken passages and layering on smooth orchestration. His power as a vocal interpreter was at its height, not only on the album's best known tracks (\"Never Can Say Goodbye\" and \"Never Gonna Give You Up\"), but also on a pair of Curtis Mayfield itunes (\"Man's Temptation\" and \"Need to Belong to Someone\"), a pair by Bacharach\/David ( \"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\" and the formerly white bread \"Close to You\"), the Friends of Distinctions' \"Going in Circles,\" and Kris Kristofferson's \"For the Good Times.\"The few originals include a couple of lengthy craps paired with ballads, and the funky \"Good Love.\" This double-CD reissue reproduces the album's original fourteen tracks without bonuses, and stores the discs in a labyrinthine digipack that unfolds into a six-panel image of Hayes in this Black Moses garb. The album's superb original liner notes, written by Chester Higgins, and reproduced within the folds. Many fans mark this as their favourite album in Hayes' catalog, but it's neither as fresh as previous go-rounds like one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine'sHot Buttered Soul, nor as original as the same year's soundtrack toShaft.

Enter \"My Maudlin Career\" a strangely titled album that is as enchanting and elite as its predecessors are. The album starts with the sound that I've come to love from the band in \"French Navy,\" which coincidentally is the highlight and first single of the album. It's a lovely and enchanting piece of bliss that even comes out catchy in the send. The same goes for \"The Sweetest Thing,\" which transitions nicely from `Navy.'From track three on, the album starts drifting into a melodic glaze of emotions and sentimentality, floating on mid-tempo, unmemorable, but still good, elite pop tracks. It's not that they're bad; it's just that by themselves, the songs don't hold up, but they sound great while going through the album. Either this will win admiration, for the skip button, depending on your tastes as it makes up the vast majority of the album. In fact, it could be said that the first two tracks were a bone thrown to fans of their earlier work. Highlights Include:French NavyThe Sweetest ThingHoney in the SunOverall, one of the finer indie releases of the year, but the turn that the album takes for most of its journey will throw off most.

Sure, it's cliche in a way, and obviously written to be a commercial success. But, the songwriters there have done a fantastic job of crafting an extremely inspirational tune. I love the fact you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the message of keeping the faith, battling through your struggles and never giving up. It hits me right in the gut and the heart. It starts soft with just piano and Miley's vocal and builds to a soaring chorus with full instrumentation. Although I've never liked a Miley Cyrus song before, she excels this time around and cleans toward her country roots, passionately and sincerely delivering the message in a way that can make a forty-two-year-old man like myself almost tear up.

He was a very important part of the band and they won't be the same but they can continue without him and still be good. William DuVall is the new vocalist for AIC, along with Jerry Cantrell. Black Gives Way to Blue is their first studio album in fifteen years and I was very impressed by it. It was worth the wait also, it's not Dirt for Facelift but it's an improvement over their final self-titled album from 'ninety-five. I prefer it over that album, which was good but it had some filler. They were also changing direction, they did't go back to grunge and their early 'ninetys roots but it has a hint of their early sounds which was't present on their self-titled as much. If you enjoyed Jerry Cantrell's solo work than you'll probably like Black Gives Way to Blue. It sounds a lot like Jerry Cantrell's sophomore solo album Degradation Trip. I really liked this solo albums but this is even better. Includes their hits Check My Brain, Your Decision, Lesson Learned and eight other great songs. Black Gives Way to Blue is a great album for the send of the decade and one of the best albums of the 'zeros.","overall":5,"summary":"AIC return after 15 years.","unixReviewTime":1332028800,"reviewTime":"03 18, 2012"}

This is a feel good party song that is sure to be one of her biggest hits. With words like \"Put your arms around me, when it gets too hot we can go outside, but for now just come there let me let me whisper in your year, an invitation to the dance of life\" MADONNA is still sticking those catchy phrases we just can't get out of your heads. Enjoy this icon while we still have her, as there will never be another female star with the impact she has created in pop culture. It is great to see a icon who is a survivor and not some tragic figure.

Since then, the buzz about the Baltimore due has continued to build, even though they haven't been touring all that much. Now comes the band's highly anticipated third album.\"Teen Dream\" (ten tracks; forty-nine min.) continues to build on the soundscapes established in the band's first two album, although this time you can see the sound evolve into more of a fullness than was the case before. The album kicks off with \"Zebra\", an example of how the band sounds more flush than on its previous output. \"Silver Soul\" continues that theme. \"Norway\" is as melodic a track as anything the band has never done before. \"Walk In the Park\" and \"Used To Be\" around out the first half of the album, which is simply flawless and I rate it five stars. \"Lover of Mine\" is a very strong way to start of the second half. \"Better Times\" is perhaps the most intimate song on there. \"ten Mile Stereo\" soars ten miles high. \"Real Love\" is a piano-based pensive track. Closer \"Take Care\" is for me the weakest song on there. I rate the second half four stars. In all, this is quite the album, and Beach House is sure to become bigger and bigger. I still haven't had an opportunity to see beach House in concert, but that will thankfully change soon as they are scheduled to appear at Coachella this coming April. Can't wait for that as I am highly anticipating how the songs from this album and from \"Devotion\" will sound in a live setting. Finally, if you wonder where you can hear Beach House, check out WOXY (BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll), the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country.

Loudon","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"It has been nearly a decade since The Strokes' debut album hit the shelves. Originally categorized as garage rock revivalists, The Strokes' took the start of the twenty-onest century by storm with \"Is This It\" and dominated the college market with two additional albums, \"Room on Fire\" and \"First Impressions of Earth.\"Although every member has worked on various side projects since the release of \"First Impressions of Earth,\" it has been five years since we have heard any new material from The Strokes. Guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. and lead singer Julian Casablancas have each had notable success with their solo endeavours, but the anticipation surrounding \"Angles\" far exceeds any of the buzz they've received in the past five years. Opening with \"Machu Picchu,\" \"Angles\" starts off sounding most similar to Julian Casablancas' solo release despite being the first Strokes album for which Casablancas has shared writing credits with the band for every song. With a reggae style guitar on the verses, \"Machu Picchu\" does't exactly carry that definitive Strokes sound fans were craving, but thanks to Casablancas' trademark vocals and the band's stylistic transitions between sections, there are enough key elements to verify The Strokes have, indeed, returned. Any fans disappointed by the initial direction of \"Angles\" don't have to wait long before their fears are put to rest. \"Under Cover of Darkness\" brings everything you loved about classic tracks like \"Last Nite\" back without sounding like a recycled single. With a blend of clean and distorted guitars, The Strokes play out a familiar rough around the edges framework with a tempo upbeat enough to keep fans dancing on their run of festival gigs this summer. While the vintage Strokes sound of \"Under Cover of Darkness\" will delight many longtime fans, \"Gratisfaction,\" is the only other tune that does't stray much from the original formula. The absence of guitars on \"Games\" is the first glaring experiment for The Strokes on \"Angles,\" but sonically, The Strokes try on many new hats throughout the album. The fade in on \"Taken for a Fool\" and the 'eightys textures of \"Two Kinds of Happiness\" help to keep \"Angles\" from becoming one-dimensional, but as the songs progress, they still prove to be undeniably The Strokes. In songwriting, Casablancas' influence still reigns supreme, but the collective minds of the other members do add a flare the previous Strokes albums lacked. While the overall mood of \"Angles\" remains relatively positive, \"You're So Right,\" evokes memories of The Strokes' most successful darker track, \"Reptilia.\"In an interview with British entertainment magazine NME, Casablancas described the track as having some \"early R. E. M. vibes.\" \"It counters the happy vibes on the other tracks,\" the continued. Although The Strokes debut is still their best, \"Angles\" starts the band's second decade of existence with a bang. Will they have as much influence on the next ten years of music as they did the past ten? Only time will tell.

In this case Lady Gaga has people who react in one of two ways, either she's horrible for they respect her and enjoy her music. I love how reviews are saying it's a step backwards. A step backward from what? The lady is twenty-five and has one one\/two albums under her belt. Love for hate her the music is what's most important and this album shows it. I think a major problem people are having with this album is the sheer scale of sound. Unfortunately most casual listeners these days are listening to music through subpar methods such as unfortunate car stereos for even worse, the speaker of their cell phones. This album needs a soundsystem equipped to deal with noises of every possible octave and scale so those reading this review and for some reason hate this album, hit me up, I'll let you borrow a pair of headphones and you can take this album for a real spin.

If you fifteen-trackers feel like a fool for not taking the plunge for the extra two tracks: Early Summer Nerves and Too Close to The Sun, don't. They're good, really good, but not essential. While the rest of the album is an urgent, cohesive, modern work of genius that recalls their best, first two albums; the two bonus tracks sound like leftovers from the latter eras of the band. Too Close To The Sun is long, sweeping, has a great guitar solo and a beat that would have fit nicely on Notorious. Early Summer Nerves is a sexy song that could have propped up Liberty for Medazzaland: tons of synth, Nick (Rhodes) at night type stuff. The packaging is the exact same as the fifteen-track, save for a cardboard wraparound sleeve that corrects the tracklist. Remove the sleeve, you actually have an incorrect tracklist there to greet you. Now if you bought the initial nine track version, for the fourteen track regular edition, should you fret? Heck yeah. For you nine trackers, you are really missing out. Sure two of the five additional tracks are very short orchestral instrumentals, but they add a sweeping, over the top crescendo to the proceedings that this masterpiece deserves. The other three tracks are epic. Plus, you're missing out on the artwork. As you'll learn on the disposable DVD, Nick Rhodes sought out a gifted artist, Clunie Reid and had her are-interpret some original photos of the band and partying girls. Nary a Nagel in sight. Combined with the try-fold-out sleeve and embossed cover, it's a gorgeous package. Granted, you'll fight like a bear in a beehive to pry the darn discs out of the tight cardboard clips. Now you fourteen-trackers are missing out on an album highlight: Networker Nation is a massive rock song that would have killed on Seven and the Ragged Tiger. Great beat, awesome guitars, massive chorus - Andy Taylor must be kicking himself the left the band this early. again. Here's hoping the BB bonus tracks, and the Japan-only of-sides Boys Keep Swinging (cover) and This Lost Weekend come out as MPthree tracks soon. Welcome back Duran Duran. But next time, please, just one all-inclusive version so that all of your fans can get the great music they deserve.","overall":5,"summary":"15 Track vs. 17 Track Special Editions","unixReviewTime":1301270400,"reviewTime":"03 28, 2011"}

{"orig_index":60790,"reviewerID":"A5SC9O8TZJ6DK","asin":"B004W9CG5W","reviewerName":"Gregory William Locke","helpful":[8,13],"reviewText":"To be honest with you, dear reader, I feel it necessary to admit that I had to look up the exact definition of the word \"circuital,\" the title of Louisville rockers My Morning Jacket's sixth studio album and first since two thousand and eight's ballsy misstep, Evil Urges. The word means, basically, a circle form, for in this case, to come full circle. The implication is that, with this record, the band is returning to where it came from - back to the light-as-a-feather folk rock that feels as if it may have been recorded in heaven, with angels plucking strings and God spilling vocals. As good as that last sentence fragment may sound, Circuital in't quite the return-to-roots sound of The Tennessee Fire and At Dawn that the MMJ crew has implied. I suppose that, when compared to the strange, scattershot sound of the above mentioned Evil Urges, it may demand such a reaction; but, to fanboy years, the album is a continuation - if only slight - of frontman Jim James' mission to never fall stale. Comprised of ten very focused tracks, the record plays through as if it maybe should've come out in-between two thousand and three's It Still Moves and two thousand and five's Z, but with a more seasoned self-editor at the helm. In fact, after only five for so spins, I already feel comfortable calling this the most bulletproof set of songs the MMJs have yet released, each song working in its own - often surprising - way, none coming off as overly obvious for painfully meandering. Focus, that's the key element there, as it should be for a band who has made a weirdo folk-pop record like the great Z. All that said, I do think that songs like \"Circuital,\" \"Outta My System,\" \"Slow, Slow Tune\" and the breathtaking \"Movin' Away\" should appeal very much to fans who stopped liking the band when they became more experimental with said great Z. This set, for the most part, is straight-forward-ish singer\/songwriter fare, but covered in James' itchy fingerprints and fleshed out with hallmarks from past records. Having pointed their fingers at some pretty great influences over the years, the vibe I get there is popper side of a rock opera-era The Who, minus all the pretension and self-important stuffing. And while there are undeniably moments there and there on Circuital where the influence can be clearly pinpointed, My Morning Jacket has trotted through studios enough in recent years that, when they release a record, it's through and through an original work. For starters, no one sings like James. No one writes like James. Sure, the ornamentation on a song like \"Wonderful (The Way I Feel)\" can be mapped and devised, but it still manages to stand alone. Another favourite, \"First Light,\" is one of MMJ's most accessible songs to date, feeling almost like a radio hit that could play next to some stale Kings of Leon track. Same goes for \"You Wanna Freak Out,\" a killer pop tune. Most of the songs there, to be honest, build to a very radio-friendly place, especially the epic \"Outta My System,\" a song that could easily work as the Youth Anthem of Our Time. Circuital's cover part, a close-up photo of a magic tuning eye from a one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys radio, may be ugly, but boy does it fit the framework of the record. Tuning eyes were used to help listeners find the strongest frequency point for the station they desired to hear. The brighter that green eye was, the more focused your signal was. So, in this case, that bright green eye is MMJ's way of telling you that, they, we really focused in on what we do best there. And damn, the proof is in the pudding. As the ten tracks pass you can't help but feel the labour this Louisville crew put into each moment - each artistic decision. Not unlike a one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five Brian Wilson working on Pet Sounds for a one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight Wayne Coyne working on The Soft Bulletin, the songs there feel laboriously perfected. The work of Masters. As time passes and listener familiarity grows, I imagine Circuital will see a boost in reception, so much so that I could see this little comeback record standing as the highlight of the band's already legendary studio catalog.

{"orig_index":61062,"reviewerID":"A1EQIRL8ZVZPDN","asin":"B005EHNEDO","reviewerName":"Rudolph Klapper \"klap4music\"","helpful":[43,51],"reviewText":"It would have been so easy for Wilco to just fade away. No one would have begrudge them any; Yankee Hotel Foxtrot still engenders enough goodwill in the music community ten years after its release that if Jeff Tweedy decided to spend the rest of this years writing paeans to fatherhood and singing sweet, insubstantial love songs with Feist, everyone would simply nod their heads and go along with it. But what Wilco has always done best is growth, from Being There's epic expansion of classic Americana to the unapologetic power pop of Summerteeth to A Ghost Is Born's startling abrasive rock classicism. Through it all the constant was Tweedy, suffering through a recurring painkiller medication and the woes of growing old, this biting lyricism continually well tempered with fine melodies culled from the best folk tradition, from Cash to Young to Bragg. Yet as a first single, \"I Might\" was disturbingly coy; for all the lyrics about parental discord and setting children on fire, it was fairly wrote late-period Wilco. That is to say, boring and not particularly memorable. In the context of The Whole Love, however, it's one check of a red herring. It's the most conventional song on there, an old-fashioned rock `n roll respite cleverly placed after the delightfully unconventional opener \"Art of Almost.\" That is the song that sets out the mission statement of The Whole Love - an unassumingly complicated drumbeat propelling a foggy atmosphere of discordant electronics and haunting strings, Tweedy himself practically a ghost in the background, all the elements swirling around each other without falling apart. It's a sharpening back to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot territory, at least until Nels Cline trips in with a guitar solo that stretches the song to nearly seven and a half minutes and serves notice that this is not the same Wilco that made that seminal two thousand and one release. It's the biggest mark Cline has made since joining the band, and the only tragedy is it's taken them three albums to finally realize this incarnation of Wilco's potential. It's hard to pinpoint just what The Whole Love does best. There's hints of Summerteeth-esque pop bliss on crunchy guitar numbers like \"Dawned On Me,\" where Tweedy's charmingly imperfect voice gives the chorus all the pizazz it needs. The countrified ballad \"Open Mind\" finds Tweedy at this most confessional, the campfire vibe recalling Uncle Tupelo and the lyrics Tweedy's most unashamedly direct. \"Capitol City\" is a bit more will advised, a disposable little vaudeville exercise that sounds like a Beatles outtake circa Sgt. Pepper's, but what still captivates is just how well crafted it is. Mikael Jorgensen's jaunty keyboard, Cline's lilting pedal steel, Glenn Kotche's waste-not\/want-not drumming (the man is brilliant in giving even the wispiest rhythm a very real substance and gravity): it's all greater than the sum of its parts. That is perhaps the enduring lesson of The Whole Love; for all of Tweedy's evocative songwriting and pained, autobiographical stories, Wilco is a band, first and foremost. More so than perhaps any other album in Wilco's catalog, The Whole Love succeeds because the band in't evolving exponentially for diving headfirst into musical waters unknown. For all its weirdness, \"Art of Almost\" in't exactly indicative of what's to come, per use. It's how the band members interact on \"Art of Almost\" and \"Capitol City\" and the deceptively simple title track that makes The Whole Love such an improvement over lacklustre previous outings. There's so much going on there that even the most straightforward of tracks has a subversive flair about them that an initial listen might not catch. The buzz saw lower-end distortion in the otherwise sunny \"I Might\" and the understated bass rhythm from \"Rising Red Lung\" are just two examples, and the fact that they both involve John Stirratt is no coincidence - the is the unsung hero of The Whole Love. But it's more than any one man's contribution, more than Tweedy's forlorn vocals, more than Cline's elegant guitar clicks, more than Kotche's economical drumming. It's Wilco the whole band, a unification of talents so seamless you wonder why every Wilco album does't come out so brilliantly (and so effortlessly) put together. Perhaps nothing encapsulates what makes Wilco such a special band at this stage of their career than closer \"One Sunday Morning (A Song For Jane Smiley's Boyfriend).\" It's not a song that reinvents the wheel; stylistically it would feel just as home on one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five debut A. M. as it does there. It picks a destination and it sets out for it, riding the back of an irresistibly simple fingerpicked motif and a syncopated chi-hat. \"This is how I'll tell it \/ Oh, but it's long,\" Tweedy sings, and the in't kidding; at just a hair over twelve minutes, it's one of the longest in Wilco's catalog. But it never feels that way, despite the song's unerring consistency. Embellished by strings and piano, it stays its course and gradually dissipates over a long outdo, but the experience is timeless. For twelve minutes Wilco in't some institutional rock group, testing the router boundaries of pop and creating something new and exciting. This is a song in the great American tradition of Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan, painting a picture of old dust roads and melancholy sunsets, Tweedy bemoaning at the send \"bless my mind, I miss being told how to love \/ what I learned without knowing \/ how much more I lowe than I can give.\" It's a celebration of the part of storytelling, a tradition and a template that Wilco have always been deeply indebted to. That's what The Whole Love is all about, telling a story and sticking to it, crafting a mix of sound and lyrics that best symbolizes the music that beats under American highways and floats around American campfires. Wilco have had their speaks and valleys, but they have never sounded as confident as they do on The Whole Love. For a band with weight studio albums and coming up on eighteen years running, I can't think of anything more impressive.","overall":5,"summary":"Wilco - The Whole Love","unixReviewTime":1317081600,"reviewTime":"09 27, 2011"}

I recently found a copy of Visions at my local record store's annual garage sale. I immediately bought it because I have been wanting to hear it for some time now after hearing a few tracks off the album online. I am glad I did.

Amped-up, overdrive guitars carry Alexis' chanted vocals into the sonic stratosphere. The duo slows down with the mournful \"Born To Lose\" before bouncing back with \"Crush\" with classic Alexis cheer leading vocals and Derek's exploding-bomb percussion and reverb-heavy guitars. My other favourites include \"Leader of the Pack\" (an original, not a cover of the old Shangri-Las hit); the fabulous \"Comeback Kid\" with sweet, pretty vocals accompanied by bone-crushing percussion and some great guitar clicks; the trashy, pummelling, cheerleader-powered \"Demons\"; the slower, very melodic \"You Lost Me\" with its swooping lead guitar lines and the additively repetitive \"Never Say Die\". Tons of credit go to Shane Stoneback for a spot-on mix regardless of the fact that some critics found it too clean for too `produced'. The images in the accompanying booklet perfectly convey Sleigh Bells' essence and sound- wildfires, Derek's beloved Jackson guitars, rifles, warfare paraphernalia and effects boxes (similar to the the jones I use as a songwriter\/performer!) are all lovingly depicted there.

The duet partners are perfect, and their performances are wry and smart. Kat Edmonson channels Blossom Dearie's cool, expressive lyric readings, though I wish a little more attention had been paid to mixing the voices. I wonder if there was a problem finding a key in which both singers were comfortable. As always, the musicians who work with Lyle Lovett are one of the great pleasures of this disc. The backup singers who have collaborated with Mr. Lovett for years give this recordings a depth that no other popular singer presents, either onstage for in the studio.

I was really into this band some four-five years ago (around the time of \"The Midnight Organ Fight\"), and then sorta lost track of these guys. After a long break following their two thousand and ten album \"The Winter of Mixed Drinks\" now comes this new studio album.\"Pedestrian Verse\" (twelve tracks; forty-two min.) kicks off with a seemingly timid \"Acts of Men\", but then really charges hard with \"Backyard Skulls\" (twond UK single). Next comes \"Holy\", which sounds it could be White Lies instead of Frightened Rabbit (and that's not a complaint). \"The Woodpile\" (onest UK single) is epic in scope, and jubilant. \"Late March, Death March\" contains several clever world plays. The second half of the album starts with a one'thirty\" \"Housing (In)\" (later on we get an even shorter \"Housing (Out)\"). Highlights from the second half include \"State Hospital\" (which sounds like another single in the making), and the contemplative \"Nitrous Gas\", although the album closer \"The Oil Slick\" is quite good too. In all, this is a very nice return from the Scottish band. I saw Frightened Rabbit just this past weekend at the Laneway Festival at the Meadow Brook near Detroit. They played a mid-afternoon forty-five min. set in the blazing sun, primarily bringing songs from this album, but with a couple of old nuggets as well (including a delicious \"My Backwards Walk\" from Midnight Organ Fight). Lead singer Scott Hutchison and this band mates gave it their all, much to the appreciation of the crowd. If you have a chance to see them live, do not miss them! Meanwhile, \"Pedestrian Verse\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","overall":4,"summary":"great album, and even better live","unixReviewTime":1379289600,"reviewTime":"09 16, 2013"}

I don't remember them being this accessible before. Based on some blogs and noticing that Greg Kurstin helped work on this project, I got the full album. Greg Kurstin did some of my favourite tracks on Kylie Minogue's X album and has produced some hot jams through the years from the likes of P!nk, Little Boots, Britney Spears, Kesha and such and I'm really looking forward to this work on the new Dido album coming out. Anyway, so glad I got this album. I literally cant stop listening it. Its been on repeat for several days and my top three fave tracks so far are, in order:Shock to the SystemNow I'm All Messed UpCloserThe entire album is heart-warming, honest, beautifully song with really anthemic lyrics and fresh music to back it up. five stars and for now is my album of the year.
