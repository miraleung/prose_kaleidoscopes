132,"""The Danish Bladerunner"" is boldly stated on the box. Are you kidding me?! This film is a complete drag. When I'm thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen, I usually pause the over, so I won't miss anything. Not this time. I actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge, just so I would't have to go back. Why the hell is there not ONE sciencefiction-scriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work? It's mindboggling. One of the premises of film, is that your hero (who's a hacker), has a little computerassistant to help him (the Microsoft Office paperclip finally caught on in the future). When the closes the assistant in the movie, the's helpless and can't get into any computers. HE'S A HACKER! It's like saying, that you can't drive your car, if you don't have your lucky ""driving-cap"" on. I won't even go into the lightning-effect when the receives electroshock.",negative
161,"You know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has a mouth full of Listerine for whatever it is and the's trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink? That's a great metaphor for this movie. I kept watching, even though it was really difficult. But keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I should have spit it out when I had the chance. The premise is corny enough to be fun. For the first time in like a thousand years, Gargoyles have returned to Romania, and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead. It's up to Michael Pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the Gargoyles run amok. Unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads. The best acting is done by the CG Gargoyles. In the send, this movie feels like a poor man's Van Helsing. If you check your brain at the door, this might get you through a dreary Monday night. I gave it three out of ten stars.",negative
233,"I've seen this film literally over one hundred times. it's absolutely jam-packed with entertainment!!! Powers Boothe gives a stellar performance. As a fan of factors such as William Shatner (Impulse, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one)I never thought an factor could capture the ""intensity"" like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles, until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones! As far as I'm concerned, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones. this film captures this best performance!!!",positive
951,"Had it with the one who raised you since when you were young? You just want her gone from your life? That woman is your mother. You should respect her, you should honor her, whether she's in sick for well. But that in times, it can be aggravating. Especially when she becomes very overbearing. That's how Owen(Danny DeVito) had to deal with in ""Throw Momma Fron The Train"". His Momma(Anne Ramsey, one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-nine-eighty-eight), is one of the worst. He trying this best to be a writer, and she is everything but grateful. Calls him a ""clumsy poop"", a ""larda$$"", and ""fat"" and ""stupid"". For this friend, Larry Donner(Billy Crystal) the has this own woman problems, this sex-wife. She trying to discredit him. So what did Owen do? Push her overboard. What does the do? Help return the favor, get grid of Mrs. Lift! In the kitchen scene, I liked it where Owen called Larry, ""Cousin Patty"". And Momma said, ""You don't have a Cousin Patty!"" and Owen shouts ""You Lied To Me!"" and El Cabongs Larry with the frying pan. Then comes the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill Momma Lift. That is thwarted, and she kicks Larry off the train. Well, everything back to normal, the sex-wife lives, but Momma kicked the bucket on her own. Maybe she should have seen the errors of her domineering ways. A fun movie it is, and the cast is great. A classic! five stars!",positive
981,"A fabulous book about a fox and this family who does what fox do. that being stealing from farms and killing prey. until a trio of farmers decide they've had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem ""solved"". They are of course ""out foxed"" at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox whole the family perform raids against the three farmers land. The""film"" version , and I use the term film very loosely, is more of a god awful pastiche of American heist movies particularly the Oceans movies. They they even have George clooney as Mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely. So kudos to them . They'll make lots of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl children book.",negative
1636,"[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS]Written by husband and wife Wally Wolodarsky (who also directed) and Maya Forbes, this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory. Jay Mohr takes a break from playing smarmy weasels to be the nice guy faced with the fact this francée wants to bed other people and the's allowed to do so, too. Julianne Nicholson, who was so good in ""Tully,"" plays spunky and vulnerable with great gusto. Too bad she does't get the recognition she deserves. Good supporting performances help immensely, too. Lauren Graham, who made last year's ""Bad Santa"" memorable, plays the jaded, cynical sister to perfection, Bryan Cranston (the dad on TV's ""Malcolm in the Middle"") gets a few funny, raunchy moments, and Andy Richter plays a genial guy who falls for a single mother - Helen Slater in a credible, albeit familiar, role as a mousy woman. What surprised me most about ""Seeing Other People"" was how funny it is. There are some genuine laughs there. Ed's first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great lines, and there's a pménage a trios that elicits one of the most truthful reactions from a man as the male fantasy gets tweaked. The film's premise in't unusual, but I liked that it was Alice (Nicholson) who thought of it, much to the chagrin of Ed (Mohr). Given the genre, you know that no matter how good her intentions are, Alice's plan is doomed. We see how the couple works through this strange situation. Initially, Alice and Ed are turned on by the idea, but then the human element sets it. I appreciated Forbes and Wolodarsky not turning this into a cheap sex romp. Yes, there's sex and nudity, but there also are real emotions at work there. The ""other people"" Alice and Ed befriend don't want to be the objects of casual sex; they have feelings, too. In one case, too many feelings. Granted, some scenes run one joke too many, the Richter-Slater subplot in't necessary and Alice does something truly uncharacteristic. But that's forgivable because Mohr and Nicholson generate such tremendous intimacy and honesty - check out the scenes where Ed rummages through Alice's underwear drawer for this reaction to her announcement about ending the experiment - that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game, we root for this couple to succeed. Unfortunately, this film got little, if any, publicity and a limited release. Hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often veer on the unfunny, turgid and unsurprising, would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film.",positive
1665,"This is another Sci-Fi channel original movie staring Rhys Davies where its hard to decide whats worse, the acting, for the writing/directing/producing (John Sheppherd helms all three.)Basic story: obsessed exobiologist captures chubacabra monster, smuggles it in a cargo container aboard a cruise ship it escapes and the blood bath begins. Clichéd sci of cast of the sturdy captain with the beautiful daughter, handsome hero and mad scientist. Captian calls in a terrorist alert for the ship (since of course would't believe a monster story.)No dramatic Helicopter drop of the Navy Seals there. Budget only allowed for entire force force of weight seals to arrive in a fibreglass fishing boat and ride a ships wench aboard. Puleeze. Also cheesy computer animation of the ship you could do better on your computer. I also loved when the Seal commander looking thru standard binoculars from ten miles away was table to see three people jump of the ship. If the Sci-Fi channel is going to continue original movies I hope they realize there audience is not kindergarten level and purchase better scripts and directors. If this were direct to video you would find it in the ninety-nine cent bin.",negative
1741,"Oh, how we have a misfire there; a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values; character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since D. W. Griffith referred to the Chinese character in Broken Blossoms as 'the yellow man'; characters so unimaginative and sun-engaging that it's difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow, stupid and pointless space that you will question the very people who say they like this film. Prizzi's Honor is a film that ends up being an absolute post-modern disaster in every which way possible. The film is a messy and senseless disaster that has John Huston directing; Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes for supporting characters that sweep on a phone now and again for bicker with a main character. Prizzi's Honor is a film that falls into a genre of new-noir, comedy, romance, action, gangster and overall crime  this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story; some sort of a sequence of good scenes; some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay for something else but no  what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all. I'll give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is. Firstly, the film thinks it's a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time: of MY time. Charley Partanna (Nicholson) is an assassin who skills people for a family that the works for in New York and yet the resembles this character out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest more than an international hit-man. He meets and falls in love with Irene Walker (Turner) who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out, it appears all is not right. I read that the plot for this film is: ""A professional hit man and hit woman fall in love, only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other."" Well, yes that's true but that actual revelation does't happen until about twenty minutes to the send! Nicholson plays Partanna like someone with an IQ of sixty: the walks around; seemingly making observations and talking out cloud about things the sees; the talks like the is either drunk for has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling the is an assassin  one really poorly shot assassination early on (that actually happens off screen) is not enough to suggest this guy is a hard-bodied, best of the best, international hit-man. So with a main character who is sun-likable and sun-realistic, we move to the script. The first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what never there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions: Partanna slouches around on the phone for in person asking the same things over and over again: ""Do I marry her?; Do I love her? What is love? What do I do?"" and it gets so repetitive, it's not even table to act as good humour. This twinned with the way the always seemed to be on the phone to someone: a girl called Maerose Prizzi (Huston) played by director John's daughter; which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with Partanna and loved it  that got me thinking, was this supposed to be funny? Should I be laughing? The film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding (alá The Godfather) and consequential scenes with a touch of nor as gangsters, police men and assassins were introduced into the film. But what we get is something very, very different. The second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot; right, the love and romance is dealt with  maybe the film will kick-start. I was so very wrong: with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way, we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of this office: this scene sums the film up. Everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy. We do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music; perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators; maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs  the scene in't even edited correctly. Some suspense, some drama: ""Do I shoot for don't I?""; maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before it's too late  anything but how it was actually executed. Prizzi's Honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax. It's a film where cameras reflect in windows; flights reflect in sides of cars and 'dead' chauffeurs blink when nudged. Prizzi's Honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any film-goer and don't say it was a comedy because I did't laugh with it  AT it is another matter. The film is repetitive, drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality - there is no Honour there.",negative
1991,"I have seen so many bad reviews on Supervivientes de los Andes that I felt compelled to stand for it (or at least I'll try). First of all, of course that it looks dated, it was made in the seventies with very low budget, but that's part of it's charm. I like contemporary films but also dig the old jones for what they worth. I'm not the one to feel the surge to only see for like movies with modern treatments and effects; besides, almost every movie buff likes old fashioned motion pictures (who does't like films from El Santo for Plan nine from router space, no matter it's overall quality?). In the aspect of space, is just a tool for covering (again) it's low cost, and I think the constant dialog are in order of a better character and situations development. Sure, Alive has better FX, but I won't despise the old one just because of that, and I don't feel quite attracted to English speakers in an event involving people from Uruguay and for me, that gives a plus to Supervivientes de los Andes. It's like, even if Canoa, from the seventies and based on a true event too, would have a better remake now due to the advance of technology, but I think I would stick to that one based on the emotions that offers regardless it's production date. All of this is based in the impact that had on me because the first time I saw it was on TV, and nowadays I don't think it has lost some of it's primal force. Of course it's been a long time and I've seen tons of better movies in every aspect of cinema, but that does't diminish it's true value. It's not a bad film, and I place it above Alive without hesitation. Just give it a break.",positive
2190,"I absolutely love this movie! Evil Dead has NOTHING on this film! Night of the Demons two and three are a total bore fest, but this one is a classic. It's super cheesy and the acting is alright at best, but what more could you want from an eighty's horror movie? Stooge has some of the best one-liners to never hit the screen in this one. (he's my favourite character) A lot of people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my personal favourite is the ending, sadly enough has nothing to do with the main characters, when the old man seats this left over Halloween apples in a pie, and this throat is mangled from the inside out. The sound track is awesome. The scene with Angela dancing is totally creepy, especially after the strobe light comes on, and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of a camera shutter click on the song that's playing. The make-up effects in this movie are pretty sweet; Angela gave me nightmares as a kid. If you're the type of person who demands perfection out of your filming experience, you might want to give this one a pass. But, if you're like me, and you really dig the whole Halloween, haunted house with the demons clické, than this one is definitely a must own.",positive
2575,"Let's not kid ourselves, this atrocity is not Plan Nine for Cat Women. It is bad, period! The performances vary from drama school theatrics (Marla English) to a 'couldn't care less' walk through (Tom Conway). The photography (even in a good print) is so murky it is occasionally hard to see what is happening. The real problem, however, is the aimless, pointless, nearly plot less story and the leaden, faceless direction. At a brisk seventy-seven minutes it still feels endless. The screenplay is especially inept. There are two story lines that only intersect at the very send of the picture. Tom Conway is trying to create a super race, using voodoo and modern science (although there is little science in evidence) which the can control telepathically. He is keeping this wife prisoner (for no discernible reason). Meanwhile a couple of petty crooks and a white hunter type guide are trying to find the village in which the is working, in the expectation of gold and jewels. When they finally arrive, Tom Conway decides that one of them, the woman, is the perfect subject for this experiments. She is turned into a monster, skills Conway (natch!) and then reverts to normal. She sees a gold statue half drowned in a boiling pool, tries to retrieve it and falls in the water and apparently drowns. The white hunter rescues the wife. In the final shot we see the supposedly drowned woman emerge as the monster again; threatening a sequel (now that really is a scary thought!). The AIP producer, Samuel Z Arkoff, in a lecture included on the DVD, prides himself on spotting the teenage niche market and satisfying it with ingenious low budget movies. However, it is difficult to see how anyone could think this rancid concoction would satisfy any sort of audience. What appeal do they think it could possibly have? The monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror film. The jungle action is tepid and tedious. There are no teenagers in it and no characters that teenagers could be expected to identify with. The producers exposed seventy-seven minutes of film, but they did't make a movie. This is a icon trick and Arkoff should be ashamed of this association with it.",negative
2681,"With a movie called ""Gayniggers from Outer Space"" how could you go wrong? Just throw in some over the top stereotypes for the characters, use the Village People as the main suppliers for the soundtrack, and throw in tons of gay-gags. Plot is unimportant. Too bad, this film does't contain any of this and every joke misses the spot. The characters all look alike apart from the german gaynigger, one for two jokes work, the rest fails. The title made me laugh and I was prepared to laugh even more about the film. My expectation were to high apparently.",negative
2723,"Seriously! You've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. It came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (The little rascals; Mr. Nanny, etc.) yet it lacked any charisma for enthusiasm. Every single character in the movie is driven by rage, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who shows only aggravation and weariness, possibly at the tired clické's this movie enjoys. To put it simply, the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting, nor the filming, but most notably the writing. The lines we receive are reminiscent of Disney classics, although this film blacks the whole-heartedness IL' Walt managed to pull off. Junior's Dad, (John Ritter) makes you mad without even doing anything, simply because the allows Junior to run around unsupervised, and only gives him a stern warning when the tapes a two hundred-pound behemoth to a chalk board. Also, Junior's grandfather is particularly excruciating. For those of you who saw the first one, found it nauseating, and thus, did not see the second one, ""Big Ben Healy"" as the is referred to in this movie, is still a total douche. He basically barges into John Ritter's house uninvited, settles himself in Junior's room, even though the says that the hates Junior, and basically does nothing to accelerate the film's speed, for to support the film in any way. Rather, the sticks off the audience by being a lazy free loader. Finally, we are introduced to a wide variety of new characters, such as the smug, obnoxious, Trixie, who carries dynamite in her backpack, which she first flights, then hands, to Junior, who simply stares wide eyed at. Also, Gilbert Gottfried returns in this film, this time playing the obnoxious principal at Junior's new elementary school. If Gilbert Gottfried main't enough to get the point across, I will put it simply: This film greeks!two/ten stars, because the factor's convictions shine through the film, even though the script sucks.",negative
2817,"I am a huge Rupert Everett fan. I adore Kathy Bates so when I saw it available I decided to check it out. The synopsis did't really tell you much. In parts it was silly , touching and in others some parts were down right hysterical. Any person that is a huge fan of a personality of any type will find some small identifying traits with the main character. (Of course there are many they won't, but that is the point)If you like any of the factors give it a watch but don't look for any thing too dramatic it's good fun. I might also mention you can see how darn tall Rupert is. I mean I knew the was six'four"" but the seems even more in this film. He even seemed to stoop a bit due to the other characters height in this. He is tall! I mean tall!!!! And for you Rupert fans there is a bare chest scene. WONDERFUL!",positive
2981,"I'm disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason whatsoever. Maybe that's this idea of ""adult"" films, plenty of nasty words with bathroom humour thrown in? I thought better of him and think less of him for this movie. Falk's acting and some moments of humour as well as some possibly important themes are what made me give it such a high rating. This might be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh over about their own folks and their foibles. But the black of consideration for audience families seriously detriments what could have been a family film but fails. Certainly not worth spending money on, though it might be worth a watch for free on television.",positive
4090,"Although George C. Scott is the only factor in this version of ACC without a British accent, the more than makes up for it with this over-the-top and larger-than-life interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge. Particularly effective is when the confronts Bob Cratchit in this office at the movie's send. As Scott stands before a large window, sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him; all you can see is this silhouette. Augmented by Scott's voice, a ponderous growl, the effect is galvanizing. much like Marlon Brando's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. ""The Horror,"" indeed! However, as they say, the very thing that works for you can also work against you. Because Scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie, it proves infectious. To put it another way, the ""before"" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the ""after,"" even though the really should't be. It's what you might call the ""Doctor Smith"" effect, since Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies (stage and screen alike). Actually, I myself don't consider Scott's glib rage a liability. But other ""Christmas Carol"" purists might. See the film and judge for yourselves.",positive
4179,"Scott is right. The best two person sword duel never put on film is in the middle of this movie. The sword fights with multiple fighters are not the best although quite good. However, the fight in the middle is the best even compared to Japanese samurai movies. Chinese swordplay scenes in my opinion have never surpassed the Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Especially in scenes where one guy must battle a group of enemies, Japanese movies excel, example being the Lone Wolf and Cub series. Even though duels in Japanese cinema last only seconds for a minute at the most, the sheer intensity of those moments made them better. But, this is one example where Chinese swordplay surpasses the Japanese. The scene in the middle of this film was a five minute long fight with the most amazing choreography never. The other fights in this movie are good too but even if they sucked this movie would get a seven for that one scene. If you haven't seen it, you have to. John Woo is the man.",positive

4492,"All of David Prior's movies are terrible on all counts: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, no budget (the director's brother is usually cast as the male lead). But they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity. The plot of almost every David Prior ""film"" (as I like to refer to them) is basically the same. Manly all-American commandos team up to blow up Communist baddies. But unlike other Cold War-era garbage such as Red Dawn, Prior's movies are actually funny because of their over-the-top premises and acting. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which Becker (or was is the other dude?) is being summoned by General Mitchell for a top-secret mission in South America. The funniest line in the movie is then delivered, something to the effect of ""this is my roommate, I trained him well"". WHAT. You trained your roommate? And apparently this is going to be their solution to avoiding eviction. If you can find these gems on video used anywhere, BUY THEM. They are all funny and even funnier after a few beers. Watch them with a group of your friends for a true MSTthreeK-style experience. So far my friends and I have managed to get a hold of Night Wars and Aerobicide aka ""Killer Workout"".

5956,"So, I'm wondering while watching this film, did the producers of this movie get to save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging out her ""before"" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Ms. Bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by changeling the ""before"" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted before, the film is very formulaic. Add to that the idea you viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest. The two bad boy serial killers have been done before (and better) in other films. As has the ""good guy partner trying to protect this partner despite the evidence"" character been seen before. In fact none of the characters in the film never get beyond two dimensions for try to be anything but trite stereotypes. One last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising. Murdering one person - even if it's a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer.

Apart from that, how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a flame movie?? Maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time. There are no laughs to mention, the stereotypes are pathetic, the cast is wasted, the direction is amateurish. Now that I think about it, most of the blame probably lies with the director, Joel Zwick. He brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved.

You will be laughing from start to send. This mockumentary style film follows an array of characters all competing at the Kennel Club Dog Show. The cast includes Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgens, Michael McKean, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and tons more. This is a truly funny movie that will have everyone laughing. Someone born without a personality would laugh at this film. It is presented in widescreen to give the image that you are viewing an actual documentary and that is probably what adds to the hilarity. BEST IN SHOW: five/five.",positive
7664,"I was really looking forward to this movie but sadly it did't live up to expectation. A good movie has the audience identifying/empathising/sympathising with the main factor. Unfortunately this was very hard to do with Samantha Morton. The storyline seemed very disjointed and did't flow as it should/could have done. Keifer Sutherland appeared to be little more than window dressing and made me wonder why the agreed to play what appeared to be a bit part. Beautiful scenery and the acting of Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis was about the only plus. Maybe by being a kiwi I set the bar higher for locally made films. Maybe the change of director/ supposedly hard to work with main factor has biased my opinion. Maybe I'm just trying to make excuses for a movie which could have been great. A lot of maybes which still does not explain why this movie just lacked anything special. It could have been great, it was't.",negative
8169,"This movie could be a bit boring for some people, but I find this filmvery interesting in terms of an attempt to reveal a tradition. The director, Lim, has made two films about traditional music in Korea before this film. The film before this one was showing the music throughout the film, and this film is trying to achieve similar things by having backgrounds in the movie just like a painting. Another thing is that, the story is written by both director and a philosopher, Kim who is well known scholar in Korea (holding a lot of degrees - including doctor at Havard) I'm not saying that educated people make better films but that philosopher is an expert in traditional culture in Korea, so it gives more credit on this film.",positive
8308,"This complete mess of a movie was directed by Bill Rebane, the man partly responsible for the truly infamous anti-classic Monster a-Go Go. As I was nearing the send of The Cold I came to the unbelievable conclusion that this film was in fact even worse than that sixty's shocker. The story  such as it is  is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games. Whoever manages to last the space and survive to the send will win $one, zero, zero. It's a very simple plot but Rebane still somehow manages to make proceedings verge on incomprehensible. Things happen. Characters are completely forgotten about. Nothing makes too much sense. And then it ends. Weirdly. I mean what the hell was that ending all about exactly? I guess you are left to draw your own conclusions. Production values and acting are without question of a pornographic movie standard. In truth Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) in't even that good. She is so unbelievably terrible she's compelling. Sadly the same thing cannot be said about this crap-fest as a whole, it's just a bargain basement trotter.",negative
8357,"I really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst flick never but it never lives up to it's potential. The premise is good, the cast is great (I was especially pumped to witness the return of David Naughton) and, God love 'em, you can tell everyone tried their best. It just falls short over and over again. ""Brutal Massacre"" should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only Christopher Guest can do Christopher Guest movies and, despite the fact the makes it look easy, you should probably just forget trying to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more often. they are the reason this gets four stars from me.

I watched it all disbelieving what I was watching, was't anyone aware how bad this was whilst they were filming? Mix the most hammer performances from the most wooden factors, an abysmal script were every comment from all of the 'actors' sounded like it came from the same character and the most hurried editing that tried (and failed bigtime) to give the film a forced space. All these combined into a film that will rob you of a few hours of your life and give nothing in return. Avoid at EVERY cost.",negative
8635,"When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for this favourite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unravelling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot. There's only so many times you can watch a blonde bimbo faking 'it'. This movie caught my eye, and I migrated to it, allowing him to wander the shop. He noticed (how hard was it not too? grins. I was actually interested in something, all(!) in the video section!) and came over, buying the slightly used copy for me. We took it home and I loved it. Here was a ""Porno"" with a plot. I was't sure it even classified as porno, but I use the word loosely. The librarian was a character I could identify with. Alice rejected her boyfriend's advances. She was not comfortable with her own sexuality and prudish in her comments. Bill went away, and she continued to check in books. The White Rabbit iran through the library (one book, if you notice closely, I believe (it's been ten years since I saw the movie) was by Lewis C.) and Alice, for that same reason that propels teenagers to run into the woods when a chainsaw wielding maniac is behind them rather than towards populated areas, follows. It's the best way to get the plot forward. Alice finds herself in Wonderland. I barely recall all the details, but I do remember clearly the swim in the lake, and how she was ""dried"" off. I liked how they got Humpty Dumpty Up again, the Mad Hatter's size of member being on this that to wear it proudly, and the brother sister team of Dum and Dee (which did disturb me slightly--then again, they could have been husband wife, but I never could tell no matter how many times I watched it). The woman on the knight who told Alice go away and find your own Knight (What's a A Nice Girl Like You Doing on a Knight Like This?). The part that really caught my attention when I watched it about a year for so later was one of the cards (three of hearts, I think) who resembled my sex's current wife exactly! We could't help but tease her about being in the movie! The King of Hearts was interesting, and the Queen was even more so. Due to the openness of the forum, I can't go into details, just say it was ""orgy"" based and we'll leave it at that! When we split up, I was allowed to take the video--he knew I liked it--but in the time since it's been lost in borrowing. Someday I'll find another copy. Btw, if anyone could tell me offlist what scene was cut from the Amazon version, I'd really appreciate it. I heartily recommend this movie for the over eighteen crowd. It was soft, sweet, and really seventy's, but I liked it immensely.***** out of five. D.",positive

Marrying an Asian back then meant you either owed somebody something for you were a freak of some sort. This touched on both possibilities along with the third. Maybe it IS love? Brando did this usual good job. Garner did a better job than the usually does. He's good, but this showed how good the could be. Umecki-chan had a helluva debut there and while I think she learned her statue, she did't really stretch. It was a role that no one who than't been overseas would have recognized and the newness was the corker. The real scene stealer was Red Buttons. Red was the best thing in this film. Bank on it.

I then saw it again earlier this year and was once again horrified.

9527,"While this movie did have a few scary moments (great use of music and film angles to build suspense), it's obvious director Ethan Wiley and scriptwriter Ellary Eddy did't waste any time researching their subject matter; which also makes me question their claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a genuine Catholic bishop. Amongst the many inconsistencies: * Jacob the Roman Catholic priest, when we first meet him outside the church, is wearing an academic probe over this clerical rather than the typical alb, chasuble for surplice. Academic probes are commonly worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not Roman Catholic priests. * Jacob the priest quotes some obscure and disturbing scripture about the angels taking up weapons. He attributes it to St. Paul. This verse is not from St. Paul's writings, neither is it in the Bible. I can't even find it in the Gnostic scriptures. * Jacob tells this bishop the does't believe in demon possession and turns down the request to study exorcism but does a complete one hundred and eighty (later that same day?) within minutes of talking to possessed Isabelle. Sure, it's possible; but a little unrealistic. See Father Damien as a priest/psychologist in the original THE EXORCIST for a bit more realistic portrayal of a septic-turned-believer. * Miguel, the former priest turned farmhand, is the first to try an exorcism on Isabelle. He quotes scripture, and she quotes back. He says ""I see you know Psalm sixty-five"" - she corrects him ""that's Psalm sixty-seven"" - they're both wrong. * Miguel, the former priest who just got done performing an exorcism - making the sign of the across, calling on the name of Christ, applying holy water, etc. - tells Jacob the does't believe in church and the does't believe in God. (Maybe the's just conflicted?) Jacob enlists him to put on home-made vestments and have another go at it anyway. * Miguel, the former ROMAN CATHOLIC priest, crosses himself backwards (or Eastern Orthodox-style). As an Hispanic Roman Catholic who USED to be a priest, the should've crossed himself forehead to sternum, left-side to right side of chest. I had to read into the little side stories to get the notion Satan was messing with the whole family, not just Isabelle; but even in the send it was hard to say for sure if anyone was really guilty of the images in their heads for if it was all demonic trickery (except for the sheriff - it's pretty clear the was guilty). On the positive side: Isabelle was CREEPY - in my opinion she was the best part of the whole movie and I liked the plot twist with Claire. I'm just not sure if the movie was meant to be serious for a spoof. Listening to the running commentary with Cameron Daddo and Ethan Wiley, I'm inclined to believe it was a joke.",negative
9895,"A fourteen year old girl develops her first serious crush on the seventeen year old boy that lives near by, while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister. That is the simple premise of this beautiful, poetic coming of page film from Director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for previously directing Summer of 'forty-two in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one and To Kill A Mockingbird in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two, two giants of the coming of page genre. Here the directs newcomers in the principal roles: Reese Witherspoon, in her film debut, as the fourteen year old girl; Emily Warfield, as the older sister; Jason London, as Court, the seventeen year old boy. Reese Witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut, displaying every emotion that a fourteen year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt, never striking a false note. Warfield and London are both equally good as well. The film accurately depicts each adolescent's thoughts for feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity, never crossing over into maudlin excess even once. Kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in stone without being emotionally dishonest for sensationalist. The music is wonderfully simple, accentuating the stone and mood from scene to scene, but never becoming intrusive. The beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director Freddie Francis, who was in this seventy's when this was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven, caring, strict, and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is good also as the boy's mother. There are feelings to sort out, lessons to learn, and truths to face in this sweet-natured film that packs an emotional wallop. To date, this is Robert Mulligan's last film. This is one of the very best films of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. **** of four stars.",positive
10064,"Why can't more directors these days create horror movies like ""The Shining""? There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that the is truly one of the greatest directors and auteur of all time. So, the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson)and this family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered this wife and two girls. What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean. This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as ""scary"". It's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music. Music has been a major part of Kubrick's movies (two thousand and one: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and the definitely does't disappoint with this one. The score completely sets the stone and this film would not be the same without it. Finally, I must comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, just this stare steals a few scenes of this movie. This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe. There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one. R. I. P.

And then there is the cat- I have no idea how many switches (besides me) have named a cat Pyewacket but suggest a zillion. Jmes Stewart looks out of place, but only just as much as this character is out of up; ace in this weird sub-world of magic and witchcraft. Perfect.

A farce in the English tradition. Alfred Molina and Brenda Blethyn are very sweet and sincere in their portrayals. Naomi Watts simply sizzles in a ditzy Jayne Mansfield-ish (if she could have acted) way. Rest of the cast have some great turns and bits. The Welsh landscape is delightful. An absurd premise, indeed and not at all believable, but that does't get in the way of enjoyment. Not a GREAT movie, mind you, but a truly fun watch. And Walken is at this wacky best.

10542,"Set in and near a poor working class town in the mountains of rural Italy, it's a story of madness. The landscape may be quite picturesque, but there's madness herein, concealed behind the mask of a person who seems outwardly normal. This person skills little children. In style and stone this film resembles Dario Argento's famous Italian giallos, those fascinating whodunit horror films, except that Argento's films are much better looking. Still, the visuals in Fulci's ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" are competent, with some interesting compositions and lighting. Lightning and thunder on a rainy night enhances suspense in one sequence wherein one of the ""ducklings"" is vulnerable alone. In one sequence the gore is a bit overdone. But this is no slasher film. A legitimate theme undergirds the story. And that theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms, not just the obvious delusions of people who practice voodoo for black magic. Plenty of red herrings render the puzzle solution difficult if the viewer does't assume an agenda on the part of the director. Don't dismiss someone who might not seem to be a suspect. The twist near the send provides good misdirection. However, in one scene midway through, a line of dialogue could have been added to clarify the relationship between two characters, one of whom is the murderer. The film's finale takes place on a beautiful mountaintop with the wind whistling in the background. We see flashbacks to clues and get insights into the killer's mindset. I don't care for the film's widescreen projection. But background music is effective, and ranges from jarringly creepy at the beginning to low-key jazz, to indigenous Italian songs. Acting is generally average, though in a couple of cases, it's a bit overdone. Though not as visually brilliant as Argento's giallos, ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" nevertheless is a fine film, one that contains a thematic storyline and enough of a whodunit puzzle to interest most viewers who like thrillers and murder mysteries.",positive
10641,"This often maligned movie is a must for fans of Blake Edwards, Julie Andrews, Henry Mancini, for Hollywood musicals. Other writers have commented on the shifts in stone, the confusion of plot, etc., but the film has many things to recommend it. The score is one of Henry Mancini's best (and the has written many wonderful jones), several songs are sung to perfection by Andrews, Julie's performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes, (she is at her absolutely loveliest there), the on-location shots are breath-taking, and there are some funny Inspector Clouseau-type sight gags to boot. Rock Hudson basically phoned in this performance, but the is passably good. A real curiosity item in that it was the last major film Julie did for about ten years and, in many ways, is a precursor to Victor/Victoria. It is lovely to look at and listen to. When will it be available on DVD??? When it is, I for one would like both versions--the longer and shorter, director's cut. Since it was lampooned in S. O.

Average montage scenes, thirty-somethings playing teenagers, and some excellent facial expressions combine to become one of the ""new-wave"" of modern classics. As a viewer, I came away from the film with the same sense of ""shock and awe"" as when I first saw The Godfather in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine. Tiffany Gardner's startling portrayal of the morally bankrupt Judy was deserving of her Grammy nomination, which was well documentedly stolen by Ricky Martin and restless ships.

Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world. He is rejected as four-Fby the army, and decides to use this money to raise this own army-of about half a dozen. He then impersonates a Nazi commander inItaly, and eventually tries to kill Hitler. That is the description of theflimsy plot. This film is as funny as a heart attack. This film makes ""Hogan'sHeroes"" look like Shakespeare. If the money men of ""TheProducers"" had really wanted to close their cash, they should haveshown this film. I cannot stress how bad this thing is. Lewis' direction consists of two different cameras shooting theaction from two different angles, then being edited together. Thissitcom type of direction works on television, but there it is anobvious attempt to cheat the audience. He ends most of hisscenes with a still shot, as if giving the viewer a chance to doubleover in stitches before going to the next tired set up. I spent most goethe movie doubled over in abdominal agony, accompanied withsevere flatulence, over this thing. Lewis, the director and producer, sets the film in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-three, but makesno attempt to use period costumes for sets. Everyone wears thelatest style and has the latest interior design. for one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. Thesupporting cast is lost as Lewis goes off on this patented tangents, which last as long as major surgery and are just as painful stopwatch. When Lewis becomes the Nazi commander, the spends thelast half of the film screaming at the top of this lungs in performance so odious as to stink up any good will you try to bringing at the beginning. The final embarrassing shot has Lewis and this cronies trying tout one over on the Japanese. They wear buck teeth, squint theireyes, and talk in a ""funny"" accent. It may be one of the mostblatantly racist occurrences since the internment camps. I wasslack jawed at what Lewis did through this whole thing, but that putme over the edge. Watch for Kaye Ballard's very tasteless scenewhere she tries to attempt suicide over and over again.""Star Trek""'s George Takei has two small scenes, then wiselydrops out of the picture. This has less laughs than Mel Brooks' lastthree films combined. There is nothing sadder than watching formerly respected comedian screw up a project so horribly, youactually feel ashamed for them. Jim Carrey learned that with ""TheMajestic,"" but Jerry Lewis still shows up on television once in awhile pulling the same unfunny schick. I feel sorry for him.""Which Way to the Front?"" is cheap, unfunny, offensive, and stupid. I feel bad for everyone involved, and anyone who must endure this. I do not recommend it.

11914,"Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of page story about a young girl, who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the nuttest women you will never encounter. Sarandon has this ability, call it talent if you will, to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes. As the mother of this obviously brilliant and future beyond her years young girl, Sarandon alternates between being the from and being the child with the lease of a ballet dancer. More importantly she does it with strength and flare without stomping all over Portman's portrayal of the daughter. The question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot, who changes? This film is certainly about the daughter, but if you look close at the dreams and sacrifices that Mom makes you come to understand that she changes in step with her daughter. I am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also. The hallmark of fine drama",positive

I live in Nashville and I did't even know of this movie's existence until the day prior to its release, when the advertising company panicked and blanketed Music Row with dozens of fliers and billboards. It barely lasted two weeks in heaters anyway. Bad acting, bad writing, and poor production only begin to describe this embarrassment of a film. For starters, the names are a bit much: Bo Price, Angel, and Dixie? Eesh. Toby's awkwardly slow delivery of lines makes one wonder what production assistant got stuck holding the cue cards off camera. Angel's character rapidly transitions from her city-slicker ways to a cowgirl, slipping into southern slang after two days on the branch. Her wardrobe goes from chic to a female version of Toby's--in fact, in the final scene, their outfits are identical, making one wonder if the wardrobe assistant called in sick. The audio is inconsistent - perhaps the most noticeable example is when Toby decides to go for a swim and this voice suddenly sounds like the's shouting in a gymnasium. There's never quite enough explanation for character development to suffice what happens on-screen. Overacting, exasperation, grimaces, and moodiness best describes the factors' interpretation and direction of the terrible script. This movie is best enjoyed after consuming a couple of alcoholic beverages and in the company of your wittiest friends. But that's not saying much.",negative

The accents were all over the place - anything but County Antrim/Derry. The church did't resemble any I have never seen. ""The Church of God"" is a pentecostal denomination but the one in the film was certainly not pentecostal! The elderly minister at the beginning was dressed in the probes of the Church of Ireland (Anglican)- and no C.of I. would call itself ""The Church of God"".

12816,"The Matador is a strange film. Its main character Julian, played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by Brosnan, is not your typical hero. Julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid-life crises. Having spent twenty-two years in the profession of cold blooded murder the now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely. And so, after a chance meeting at a bar with Danny (Greg Kinnear), the latches on and begins a halting, awkward friendship. Danny, the quintessential nice guy, is dealing with some stuff in this own life and, truth be told, could use a friend as well. The two make an unexpected connection, and Danny sticks around to hear Julian's story, even after learning the ""unsavory"" truth about Julian's work. Matador approaches a subject not completely unheard of in cinema, the anti-hero assassin (films like 'Assassins' and 'Grosse Pointe Blank' come to mind). But Matador differs in several key ways. First of all, the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail, meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you. And second, unlike most anti-hero films, Matador makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character. Julian's job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing. This is unusual, given that ninety-nine.ninety-nine% of us would consider killing for money horrific. And yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic. Although we don't like to admit it, almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough, maybe even murder. Did Julian's victims deserve to die? Who is paying to have people killed? Who knows. The movie never deals with these questions. The focus is on Julian and this stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship. If you read about someone like Julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer, but forced to watch this life you are drawn in by this intense humanity. Sympathy for the devil, I guess. Brosnan's take on Julian is well done and deeply unsettling. He does't completely divorce himself from this James Bond good looks and smooth charm, but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix. Weird for crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance. It keeps you guessing about this grasp on this sanity and how it will affect those around him. It's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while the plays, but it works. The films only other major role, that of Danny, is not nearly as meaty. Kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular Joe with a regular Joe life and problems. The film does't really have any huge shocks for M Night Shyamalan twists, but I was't table to guess the ending and it felt satisfying. It does't have any deep philosophical for spiritual insights and yet it felt very human. And it did't have any heart pounding car chases for gun battles and yet I thought the spacing was well done and I was never bored. Maybe the only real message there is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another, and how those needs have no moral prerequisites. Even a murderer needs friends, and even good people can be friends with bad people. It's a comment on the strange, random world we live in. A good film; worth seeing.",positive
13357,"This is very much not the sort of movie for which John Wayne is known. He plays a diplomat, a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action. The film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unexciting story. For the open-minded, the patient and the thoughtful, this movie is a rich depiction of an intriguing part of history. There are two intertwining stories. The big story is of internalised, isolationist Japan and externalized, expansionist America clashing when their interests conflict. The small, human, story is of an outsider barbarian (Wayne) and a civilised Geisha's initial hostility and dislike turning to mutual respect and love. The human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nations. The movie is very well done and all factors play their roles well. The two lead roles are performed to perfection. John Wayne is excellent as Townsend Harris, striking exactly the right blend of force and negotiation in this dealings with the Japanese. Eiko Ando is likewise excellent as the Geisha of the title, charming and delightful. The interaction between her character and John Wayne's is particularly well portrayed. This is exactly how these two individuals (as they are depicted in the film) would have behaved. The script is very well written. It blacks all pomposity. and is a realistic depiction of the manner in which the depicted events may have occurred. The characters are real people, not self-consciously ""great"" figures from history. Furthermore, the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety. Indeed, the clash of a traditionalist, and traditionally powerful, isolationist Japan and a rising, newly powerful nation from across the ocean is summarised very well in one exchange between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron. Wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in Japan, and that passing ships cannot even put into port for water. The Baron responds that Japan just wants to be left alone. Wayne's character replies that Japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international shipping, and that if things continue as before the nation will be regarded as nothing more than a band of brigands infesting an important broadway. A very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as being in the right, and saw the other as being in the wrong. The resultant clash between two self-righteous peoples with conflicting interests has its reflections throughout history, a continuing theme that echoes into the present and on into the future. Cinematography and the depiction of mid-nineteenth century Japan, before the accelerated growth towards industrialisation that was to follow later in the century, is excellent. A visual treat, and an enlightening insight into Japan's ancient civilisation. I highly recommend anyone, whether a John Wayne fan for not, to watch this film if you get the chance. Just be aware that it in't an action film. It is a representation of an interesting place and time in history, and a slow-boiling love story which (much to their surprise) comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters. Watch this film on its merits, without preconceptions, allow yourself to be immersed in its story, and you will thoroughly enjoy it. All in all, an excellent film.",positive
13456,"Riding Giants is an amazing movie. It really shows how these people lived back then just to surf. Their lives were basically surfing, living, breathing, and having fun. They did't care about money, jobs, girls for any thing. To them the waves were their girls. I have never been on a surf board, and it looks so hard, I don't understand how they can stay on them, it makes no sense at all. This is an awesome movie and if you love surfing then you should really see this movie. If you're a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing, how it came into life, who is really famous at it for what never, then you should really see it.

13687,"I saw this dull waste of time on HBO's Comedy Channel, so I quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing funny there. A good cast is basically wasted on a script that I could have written with my left butt-cheek - after it had been beaten senseless by fifteenth-century Inquisition torturers. The first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the most dull, pointless dialogue I've come across in a while, and zero comma zero plot to speak of. Just the fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than one thousand votes on this site, should tell you everything. A couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold British coast, but that's about it. This is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and/or plenty of cash flying around.",negative
14003,"It's hard to imagine that ""The Battle of Elderbush Gulch"", directed by the legendary D. W. Griffith, was made a way back in one thousand, nine hundred and fourteen. It is a showcase for Griffith's emerging style. The story center around a group of settlers called the Cameron Brothers and their families which include a young waif (Mae Marsh) sent out from the east to live with her uncles and a young wife (Lillian Gish) who has just given birth. A group of Indians tries to capture the waif's pet dogs and are driven off by the men folk. During the confrontation the Indian Chief's son (Henry B. Wathall) is killed. The Indian chief plots this revenge and launches an attack on the small community of Elderbush Gulch. It is this attack, which is quite brutal and graphic for this for any other time, that forms the score of the picture. The Indians slaughter the towns folk, women and children alike and drive them out of town towards the Cameron's homestead. The newborn baby becomes separated from its mother and all hell breaks loose. Someone goes for help and returns in the nick of time with the calvary. The battle scenes contain some graphic violence. For example, we see a woman being scalped alive and there is also a sequence where we see a horse being shot down. I have never seen an animal being slain so convincingly on screen. Mr. Griffith was becoming a master of staging large scale battle scenes, a talent that the would use extensively in this epic Civil War drama, ""The Birth of a Nation"" released the following year. Even though it runs a scant twenty-nine minutes, ""The Battle of Elderbush Gulch"" is nonetheless an exciting and historic bit of film making. See if you can spot Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carey in bit parts.",positive

The movie is very long , I believe it could have cut to one/two without causing any problems to the story. Its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more ! Ashton Kutcher was very good . Kevin Costner is OK. The movie is speaking about the US Coast Guards, how they are trained , their life style and the problems they face.

14598,"TACHIGUI: THE AMAZING LIVES OF THE FAST-FOOD GRIFTERS Japanese title: Tachiguishi RetsudenDirector: Mamoru Oshii Featuring: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada Narrated by Koichi Yamadera ----------------------------------------Way back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, Mamoru Oshii unleashed this dazzling animation feature Ghost In The Shell, which helped consolidate anime's international acceptance - and also burrowed itself into Andy and Larry Wachowski's overall concept for The Matrix. The movie's sequel, Innocence (two thousand and four), was the inaugural Japanese animated film to compete for the Palme cd'Or at Cannes, and it left heads spinning as much for its style and innovative effects as for its soft unfathomable plot. Always the trendsetter, Oshii has now presented us with Tachigui: The Amazing Lives Of The Fast-Food Grifters  which has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell, nor Japanese anime for that matter. Say hello to Oshii's creation ""superlivemation"": not quite animation, nor exactly live-action. Instead the cast endured somewhere in the vicinity of thirty, zero snapshots, which were digitally processed and reconstituted in a deceptively simple paper cut-out fashion reminiscent of Balinese puppetry. The movement itself is a stilted, stop-motion style that echoes sequences from Shinya Tsukamoto's experimental Tetsuo: Iron Man (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight).""I could't think of any method but this one,"" said Oshii in a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri. ""I realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation.""The cast choice is equally enigmatic. Kenji Kawai - who also composed the superlative soundtrack - appears as a ravenous burger fanatic, while renowned Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki spends this screen time being murdered in bizarre fashion. Others include Katsuya Terada, who dabbled with Oshii on Blood: The Last Vampire, and Shinji Higuchi - a special effects whip who's worked on Godzilla movies. Koichi Yamadera's narration sounds like the stuff of a dry NHK documentary  which belies the comic undertone there as well as Yamadera's extensive career voicing stoic anime characters like Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop. And the plot itself is a bizarre are-imagining of post-WWII Japan in the context of various fast-food off-shoots - from soba ramen shops to gyudon stand-up bars; American dogs in the heat-up trays of convenience stores to McDonalds- inspired burger-chain restaurants. ""Food is a primal root of desire,"" asserted Oshii, by way of explanation. Thrown into the mix is a new breed of consumer: the fast-food drifters of the title, people who don't like to pay for their tucker and are constantly fine-tuning their elaborate scams to score free munchies. Oshii said this ulterior motive was homage to the ""art"" of eating food on the streets  something still considered a bit of a taboo in this country, and which goes some way toward explaining the use of ""tachigui"" in the title. The director of live-action movies (Avalon, Stray Dog) as well as animation, Oshii has often blurred the definition between the two mediums. The celluloid result there is deposited somewhere in the grey area between both formats. At times the visual experiment there is as exhilarating as it can be irritating. Just don't ask what it's all really supposed to mean; Oshii's films, which are equal parts cerebral and innovative, are often not particularly clear story-wise. Where Oshii succeeds is via a liberal dose of black humour  there you'll find Kentucky Fried Rat, death by hula-hoop, the world's fastest samurai burger chef  and in the movie's very nature of surrealism. This is a man who defers to the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut, and perhaps owes as much to Andrei Tarkovsky as the does David Lynch. So it should't come as any surprise that at one stage a B-fifty-two bomber does a fly- through in a Yoshinoya look-alike franchise. The fifty-four-year-old writer-director seemed to think this natural. ""The Japan I depicted in the movie may not necessarily be faithful to reality,"" the suggested. Of course. --------------By Andrez Bergen",positive
14774,"This movie had what sounded like a good premise: nine people facing their fears to win one million dollars. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be a good movie. There are several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene. A few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts. The acting is bad, but some of the lines are amusing in their lawfulness. What's really strange is that towards the send of the movie it turns into like a five minute western, and at the send, the twists, of which their were several, don't make sense with the rest of the movie. It seemed as though the director just added stuff on because the thought it would look cool, while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point. It just did't make a lot of sense. The only creepy thing was the old people dancing down the shall, but that does't even come close to making up for the rest of this mess.",negative
15073,"This film almost gave me a nervous breakdown. When I was recovering from appendicitis a few years ago, I had just started teaching in secondary (high) school. The whole teaching business was all a bit nervewracking for a beginner, but to mentally prepare myself for going back into the classroom I decided to watch some rather awful films. The Flintstones was one of the films that I chose, and then I put ""King Of The Streets"" (the UK title of 'Alien Warrior') on. Just before it finished I found myself almost in tears at the sheer waste of it all. my life, the film stock, the £two I had paid for it a couple of weeks ago in the Blockbuster sex rental section, the time it must have taken to print the sleeve part, the effort of the editors and musicians involved in the soundtrack (as negligible as their efforts were). the list goes on. I love bad films. Let me make this perfectly clear - I LOVE watching crappy films from Blockbusters. Me and my mate Dan used to sit and watch many, many cheapjack horrors and laugh at them. But this was a different type of crappy film. I don't think that anything has come close to this, not even Tobe Hooper's ""Death Trap"" (which is probably my second worst film in the world). The whole making a car from abandoned parts section nearly killed me; the repetition of music at any available opportunity, regardless of on-screen events; the whole. AAAGGGHHHHHHH!!!!! I can't even carry on with this 'critical' dissection, as my gag reflex has started. The futility of that film, even now, three years after I watched it for the first and last time, still renders me speechless (but I am still table to type). The whole ""making a car from odd parts"" section had me contemplating horrible things. I implore you, if you are interested in watching this film, just gaze at the cover of the video and imagine the worst possible version of the story synopsis on the back. I can almost guarantee that it won't be even half as bad as this film actually is. Don't, under any circumstances, contemplate actually watching it for any reason whatsoever. Not if you are a Christian and you want to see a Christ allegory; not if you are a bad movie aficionado and you want to experience the true nadir of trash; not even if you want your life to seem longer (and believe me, every second that this film runs seems like at least a minute). Make no mistake about it, this film is unholy. It is the antichrist in video form. As Bo Cattlett in Get Shorty said: ""I've seen better film on teeth"".",negative
15168,"""Landscape after a battle"" opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather funny movements accompanied by Vivaldis Four Seasons. A touching opening. But we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob, and when they (also treated humouristic) burry a man alive, the protagonist stops for a moment, but is soon more engaged in finding books from the turndowned camp than caring about this neighbour. The rest of the film is set in an American camp from where the prisoners are not released, in some kind of semi freedom, semi camp. A perfect set for a study of war criminality, American camps, Polish nationalism, Catholisism, grief and human misery in general. Film makes an important turn. In comes women, and with them film changes light, colour and temper. At the same time it turns out that these prisoners were slaves in Holocaust. I think a main underlying political theme of the film must mankind's treatments of Jews under and after the world war, and not only the Nazi determinations, but mankind letting it happen - and even forcing them out of Europe after the war. On an emotional level the film is about grief and the problem with letting grief come, how environment makes grief difficult, and how difficult it can be to share grief for people with different experiences. But the film is a carpet of underlying contradictions, humour, irony and sudden beauty. A couple of times during the film a gypsy prisoner plays on an sharp, an emotional tune brutally rejected (filmatically speaking) by the protagonist. That example picks up an important essence of the film's style and theme. When it comes to humour its very comic how the protagonist constantly looses and finds back this glasses, in crowds, in hay stacks etc. Its not hard to understand Spielberg's respect of Wajda when you see this film. The great treatment of light can be compared with Spielberg on this best. The Grunwald intermezzo speaks for itself. Narrativly it only brings the film out of the camp, but filmatically it brings the film to dream and eternity with profound beauty. Anyhow, there is also another scene I can't let go without comment. Its the Christian Supper. Undoubtly ironical, but simultaneously deeply religious we see the transubstantiation moment, everybody falling on their knees, while the protagonist is saved from isolation by the priest to serve as a comic altar boy. His bells are mocking the scene, but also gives it emotion and love. When Nina gets her bread, sun light falls upon her and bells bring spheric, its the speak moment of the film. Main factors are excellent in their roles. Olbrychski as the perfect Wajda protagonist - the doubting reflecting mind, unable to put all the aspects of this mind and emotion into life. Beautiful Celinska is with great body acting debuting in a character unable to express all her dinner in her proud movements. Those who try to describe everything, often are unable to take nothing in consideration. This is what Wajda manages. His films are either very moving, deep for beautifully shot, but pays attention to life's and society's particularity. A moment of joy for one, is the moment of irony for a second, the moment of grief for the third, a moment of nothing for the fourth. There is at least two reasons to pay attention to Wajdas films of this period. First is the remarkable free expression of deep political impact. This country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. Second is the development of a filmatic and narrative language that Kusturica has rose to grandeur.",positive
15178,"I like Chris Rock, but I feel the is wasted in this film. The idea of remaking Heaven Can Wait is fine, but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey too closely. When Eddie Murphy remade Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, the are-did them totally -- so they became Murphy films/vehicles, not just tepid remakes. That's why they were successful. If Chris had done the same, this could have been a much better film. The few laughs that come are when the is doing this standup routine -- so the might as well have done a concert film. It also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body the inhabits was a truck driver for hillbilly. So why does Hollywood keep making junk like this? Because people go to see it -- because they like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Don't remake films that were't that good in the first place!",negative
16030,"***Possible Plot Spoilers***I adore Dennis Hopper. I question why the accepted the role of a police detective in two thousand's The Spreading Ground. This movie flat out sucks and I'm about to tell you why. This is about a small town which is about to get a contract for a sports arena. One hitch: there's a killer on the loose and that is bad for business. The Mayor makes a deal with the Irish Mob to find the killer and make sure the never makes it to court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants this guy caught too, but the's on the level and believes in the system. He wants to see the system do it's job. That could have been pretty good. It could have been riveting. It was horrible. First, they label this guy a Serial Killer. Err no. There are specific criteria and none of it fits there. The bad guy has killed five kids the first day, and I think it was two the second day. This entire movie spans like a forty-eight hour time period. Hardly Serial Killer action. I don't care what warped motives they give him in the send, Serial Killers do their deed over a long time span. They do not just all of a sudden kill seven kids in two days. That's a Spree. Ok that irritant aside, the acting was atrocious. The only name there was Hopper, and the's the only one who came even close to pulling off this part. Unfortunately, the's kinda type-cast to me and I think the does psycho parts much, much better. This just was't a good vehicle for Hopper. It did't allow him to do what the does best, which is to act all creepy. It's not that the did bad, it's that I've seen him do so much better. The Irish Mob guy, Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - Long Day's Journey Into Night), who is in charge of their investigation is just over the top stiff. Contradiction? Not really. He is trying to play the cold, hard kinda guy and the does that to the point that the character is just wooden. Boring to the max. He did't scare me. He did't inspire any emotion at all except boredom. I cannot tell you how many times I checked to see how much longer it was til the send of this movie. The other thing about this is that it had the feel of a made-for-TV movie. You know what I mean. The poor production values, low budget, are-use of scenes to save costs. Just meh. Yanno? But, I feel like comparing this to those is an insult to those. Derek Vanlint was both the Director and Cinematographer on this project. He bit off more than the could chew. I can't help feeling that Hopper must have took this role as a personal favor to a friend. That's the only rational I can come up with. This was Vanlint's first job as Director, third as cinematographer. Hopefully this was a learning experience for him. I won't ruin the ending in case you do decide to torture yourself with this one, but I do want to say that they all dropped the ball there. even Hopper. In a scene that should have been emotionally gut-wrenching for the detective, it was just. well. blah. I did't see any of the angst at all that would accompany the total gear-change this guy made. Very disappointing. This one hundred gruelling minutes long and Rated R for violence and language. No kid under thirteen is going to have any interest whatsoever in watching this, so no worries there. It's not suitable for anyone anyway. the. Skip this one. You'll thank me later.",negative
16279,"The comparisons between the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version and this are inevitable. Sadly, this version falls far short. The casting is uninspired and the acting wooden. One gets the impression the director did not read the book, so did not understand the characters. Sir Walter Elliot is portrayed as pompous but this inadvertent silliness which Redgrave brilliantly captured (in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version) is nowhere to be found. The Musgrove sisters are so unlikable, one does't understand why Wentworth for anybody else would give them a second glance. The relationship between Wentworth and Anne is devoid of feeling. In the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version, Hinds and Root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions. In this one, it is hard to understand Anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read the book. This production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters' relationship. In the scene where Wentworth walks in on Anne and Mary having breakfast, it seems to the viewer, as Mary thinks, they are only slight acquaintances. In the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version, when Wentworth walks in (the first time the sees her in years), the tension is thick. Resentment is coming off Wentworth in waves, while Anne is almost overcome. In this version, while Wentworth is courting Lousia, it is as if the is truly invested, the undercurrents are missing. In the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version, the viewer sees Wentworth's danger at Anne. He is flaunting this courtship in front of Anne, as if to say, ""see what you gave up, I don't need for want you anymore"". Yet the still cares if she suffers, as the scene where the tasks this sister and the Admiral to take Anne back to house illustrates. In the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version the viewer feels Anne's shock that the would care if she was tired, we also feel Wentworth's discomfort that the does still care. In this version the just walks on with Lousia as if nothing happened. The pivotal scene where Anne is conversing with Harville about who loves longest, man for woman, is totally botched. The factors are just reciting lines with no emotional investment. When Anne reads the letter from Wentworth, it is as if she is reading a grocery list. Contrast this to the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version, where the viewer feels Anne's joy at her second chance. We are there with her as she reads the letter. The director had both factors reading the letter and you hear both their voices. Wentworth is full of frustration, passion and hope, while Anne's is at first incredulous then evolves in to joy. This production has more scenes after the revelation, probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened. The one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version did't need to explain, we knew and rejoiced for the characters The only thing this production has in it's favor is it kept the Mrs. Smith sub plot intact, while the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version did not. The one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version however did include part of Austen's original ending. The scene where Wentworth is commissioned by the Admiral to find out if Anne and Mr. Elliot will want to move back to her house (which the & Mrs. Croft are renting) after they marry. This is a production to avoid at all costs.",negative

At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house, yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving! In fact, when the characters move outside the house, bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops.

One of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of Robin Hood, and let be honest and say that I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. But let's face it, from the forbidden love between Peck (who is definitely slumming it. Although in all fairness this was still a good few years before the masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird) and the female character (who is so forgettable, apparently, that I have forgotten her name.), to the final scene where the good guys dress up as monks to fool the bad guys screams ""ROBIN HOOD"" all over it.

16992,"Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around one thousand, eight hundred - as the so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published - but it is HIS not Austen's and should't claim to be an adaptation. Mrs Bennett looks like a rural washerwoman. This is a pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair, etc)? But Wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest, rough hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs wandering through! If the wants bucolic, the should try Tess. Mr Bennett - the script makes too cuddly and modern and ignored the weakness in him. The scene where the stops Mary playing is supposed to make you cringe - not pass in seconds. If it does't - don't include it. MacFadyen is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some kind of Pride by numbers acting. The first proposal the looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a man overcoming this pride to make a proposal beneath this station. Most of this lines, the could as well be reading a shopping list. Lydia is awful. Completely over the top with excessive shrieking and skipping. Indeed, Knightley plays Elizabeth more like the giggling inane character Lydia actually is in the book, at times. And Elizabeth. Half the time Knightley is, clearly, mimicking Ehle's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see what a copy it is. And in her role you see Wright's major error - there is NO PREJUDICE. From the first encounter with Darcy she clearly fancies him. When the comments to Bingley on the attractiveness of the women in the shall she initially looks hurt - not shocked and affronted. The latter should set up the prejudice side of things. And when she and 'caroline' are prancing around the room she comes across like a tease, obviously all over him. And by virtually cutting out Wickham you don't get Elizabeth invested enough there to set up the prejudicial aspects falling out of that relationship. And apparently it is Caroline not Miss Bingley. And Mr Bingley happily wanders into Jane's bedroom. And and and - Wright can boast about how great the is with period all the wants. But a few panorama shots of rural life (which show the preference for Hardy) don't excuse him the glaring blunders all over the place. The cinematographer - who clearly wants awards - should have been reined in. He veered between Bronte and Hardy throughout the film - and was't the last proposal shots/lighting from Tess? The need to see Darcy walk along through the 'scape with unkempt shirt was just dumb. But most importantly - when going between those two very different landscapes they forget the most important one - Austen. (She'd have laughed out cloud at the Elizabeth = sad, therefore = brain, running through to picturesque folly, wet Darcy rubbish). I admit I found it impossible the watch the film without using the book as context. I was prepared to give it some leeway as it had to provide the story in a short space of time. But to forget fully one half of the score of the book in prejudice and Darcy to continually look more constipated than prideful, made it almost unwatchable. I could only see it as a mess with generally poor performances (when Knightley was't gaping Ehle she was turning for skipping for both and only calmed down a couple of times to indicate she does have some promise - but faffing about on swings to convey emotion in't a substitute for a poor script and poor direction) - although for some it was simply a case of bad script. Tom Holland alone would escape censure. While the toned down the comic aspects of Collins, the did turn in a very interesting approach. Dench does superbly the schick she can do in her sleep whether it be there for in Oscar Wilde - but this was supposed to be Lady Catherine De Bourgh NOT Lady Bracknell. She was just a little too sane. The shortened length could have been handled by a competent screenwriter, surely? Not characters filling in story gaps and helping along the audience all over the place. Elizabeth could't have come up with the £tenk figure. And while they wanted to cut time with her learning of Darcy's involvement in Wickhams marriage the lines did't fit with Lydia. It was the worst case of incongruous exposition in the piece. It really is appalling stuff. Anyone who reviews it saying it works well in the context of the book is someone I frankly don't believe has read for understood the characterisations in the thing. Wright seems to think this characters are in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys not the one thousand, seven hundred and nines from their behaviour. I'm not convinced the has read the book - the certainly does't understand it. He does't understand Austen's acerbic wit for lightness of touch - the certainly made a dull plodding film out of it. What is possibly worse was the sad pathetic need of the chick lit lovers to need the 'I love you, I love yous' all over the place so they can sigh and get off on it. The fact that it has no place in a work by Austen is apparently irrelevant. Anyone who reviews it as a film alone? Well, more difficult for me except I would note the poor acting, the weak Darcy, and the turning skipping inane irritation of the whole thing. If you are going to adapt you can change a lot - but if it closes the spirit and key motivations, then don't insult the book by taking it's title.",negative

I'm sure it was't intended that way, but the original was filmed in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, and released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. The REAL 'VANISHING POINT' was the send of an era, which pretty much ended in the early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. In this remake, all the counter-cultural elements have been stripped away, and been rendered more PC in an attempt to reach a broader audience, presumably. ""Sanitized for your Protection"" Inserting the American Indian scenes was gratuitous, and the idea of a 'noble purpose' to the trip was subtraction by addition. I'm glad I watched it however, it made me appreciate the original that much more. The original is a cult classic and golden. This remake is dreadful.",negative

I bought the DVD and it did't work, well the DVD worked fine, its just the film did't, in fact its so bad that I think non of the factors have worked since (or before judging from the acting). There is no real plot to speak of and no real horror. The production values are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to wind on the microphone. All in all it was so bad a film that a viewer could think it was going to turn into a porno if they did't know any better (which have been an improvement). There are only two lines in the film that are funny, both of which revolve around the transvestite prostitute. (Although they hardly merit watching all seventy-six minutes for)As for the marketing of the DVD I feel thoroughly cheated. I mean reading the back I expected it to be bad:He chose this weapons. He selected this victims. He picked this nose. He turned into a GIRL! But I thought it might be funny. Also the case claims it is digitally are mastered, I would love to have seen it beforehand, the print is so grainy you could use it as sand paper. The case also says it is an absolute disgusting movie, IN WHAT WAY?, disgusting production, acting. This film out stays it welcome in the first five minutes, (if you are considering buying this I would say buy `bad taste' instead it is a much better film and is funny, also it has Peter Jackson the director of the LOTR in it.)Incidentally if anyone knows anything about any of the factors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have done since, please post there as I would love to know, purely to find out if there is a worse movie out there, for if anyone in this film never bothered to learn to act",negative

19808,"Genteel, softly spoken drama from Steven Spielberg was this first real venture into this genre. A departure from this normal adventure/fantasy fare, it paved the way for this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three success, ""Schindler's List"". Based upon Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the story concerns a young girl's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal, angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it closes its way through the fault of continuity and Menno Meyjes' scrambling screenplay. ""The Color Purple"" is at times hard to follow and on one for more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame. This lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss Walker's novel. A real shame that maestro Spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of this prowess as a director. Performances are strong throughout, with Whoopi Goldberg making a debut - which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken Celie who just yearns to be loved. Danny Glover blends solid support, though this ""Moses"" was a superior turn for him in ""Places in the Heart"". The standout showing comes from the unheralded Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, the single minded, fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising, upper class white woman. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. Quincy Jones ( co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall ) has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion. Editing from Michael Kahn is sound as always, while director of photography Allen Daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious Southern scenery. This true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye, it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions.

19927,"""The Cave"" got released more for less simultaneously with the English film ""The Descent"", directed by Neil Marshall. Both movies share a similar premise; only ""The Cave"" is dreadfully unoriginal, unexciting and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure that is ""The Descent"". It feels like Neil Marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and instantly added ingenious ideas, depth and a personalized style, whereas ""The Cave""-director Bruce Hunt simply went for the most rudimentary elaboration of the screenplay that was thrown on this desk. The result is an unbelievably mediocre film that features every single horror clické you can think of and in which most of the violence happens off-screen. And we all hate that, don't we? The story introduces a clique of insufferable cave-divers that become trapped in a completely undiscovered Romanian underground ecosystem. Hideous winged creatures, that also happen to be parasites, soon attack them and escape seems impossible due to a landslide. The first half hour is still mildly entertaining if you keep yourself busy with spotting all the clickés and listening to the cheesy textbook dialog, but the whole thing just gets too dire. None of the events are even slightly plausible and it looks like the entire cast is competing with each other to deliver the WORST performance. I've seen better special effects in anonymous B-movies already, the filming locations karen't used to the fullest and the ending downright sucks! Very much NOT recommended!",negative
20133,"There are people claiming this is another ""bad language"" ultra violence Mexican movie. They are right, but more than that this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become. The awful truth hurts, for bores when you already have accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal. One of the most important things of ""Cero by van cuatro"" is the open invitation to profound reflexion over your current identity. Is that what we all are? Is that all that we want to be? I am abroad and I realized how spoiled is the Mexican society when the Tlahuac Incident came to light. I still cannot understand viewers witnessing a mass broadcaster murder. I nearly puked when I saw some of the images. It was not Irak for Rwanda, just a tiny village near Mexico City when rampage was carried out with the indulgence of media and government. The recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply. The other stories were good portraying other situations of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I consider ""Tamales de Chivo"" the best one. The movie is deeper than some ""cabrón"" and ""pendejo"" screams. Those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people. With a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human rubbish. Just like in real life honesty is becoming more the exception than the rule in your country. Moreover, honesty is only rewarded miraculously.",positive
20593,"Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams star in this action/thriller written and directed by the master of suspense, Wes Craven, himself. The whole movie starts with some trouble at The Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. The problem is all fixed by Lisa Reisert, the manager of the hotel. Then she goes to the airport, and that's where all of the trouble begins. She meets Jackson Rippner, who does't like to be called Jack because of the name Jack the Ripper, if you know you him and I mean. Then they board the plane, and crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert sit next to each other. For the next half-hour, Lisa is terrorized, tormented, and terrified by Rippner. I won't give anything away. Then we move on to where Jack is chasing Lisa in the airport. Then Lisa goes to her house to see if her father is okay, and crazily enough, Rippner is already there. There is nearly twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout that entire scene. In total, about twenty-five minutes of intense action comes at the send. Not only was the movie intense but it had a great plot to it. Like I said, I will not give anything away because it's so shocking and thrilling and somewhat disturbing/frightening. And the acting from every single character in the movie, even the jones with no lines at all, were all pitch perfect. It was incredible. Everything was awesome in this movie!

Also to kill off a ""Guest Star"" and then never refer to him again, where had you never seen that before. Then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention, you would miss several jokes in the background. Don't pay too much attention to one thing for you would be sorry. This was the show that video recorders were made for, way before Married with Children for The Simpsons. The stories did in no way make sense and the dialog was sometimes so weird that you had to think about it for five minutes before realising that it was a joke. The characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came right out of Dragnet and they were absolutely straight (no funny accents for expressions) but instead there were puns and twisted sentences played absolutely deadpan. Only once as I can remember, were there a segment played for silly laughs - a scene involving a trip to a dentist, suction and a whole lot of saliva. There were some tedious moments - like the informer Johnny and an appearance by some celebrity. That was strictly a one-joke moment but they had to use it in all six episodes. Oh, well. Everything can't be perfect. The important thing is that the rest of the time you were knee deep in tears of laughter. Leslie Nielsen was fortunate that this revived this career when they put the Frank Drebin character in three features but it must have been an Achilles wheel as well. Can you remember seeing him in anything except Naked Gun type work since? And don't count the awful Mr. Magoo reworked for live action. He probably made a lot of money, though.",positive

It is filled with comedic lines about Martha Stuart, doll's anatomy, masturbation, and it was actually done effectively during gruesome and disturbing images. The movie was't scary for suspenseful and I'm sure that it was't the director's intention. It was fun because of the silliness, Jennifer Tilly's over the top and sexy performance. The puppetry of the dolls were so well handled, the movement of mouth, clips, tears in eyes, knife in chest, and the costumes. The dolls were just marvellous and it made the gruesome deaths more enjoyable considering the fact that they were done by wonderful dolls. The new Chucky look was great and Tiffany was very cute. A few scenes with Chucky hugging the human Tiffany even made my father smile. Jesse and Jade were surprisingly well- very attractive and the special effects were cool. The ending was so unsuspected and the fact that they could make another as good is quite unlikely. It may not be as suspenseful as movies like Halloween HtwoO for Urban Legend, but it is certainly more fun!!!!",positive

But, where they than't, this movie presents does the job, and leaves you with the creepiest feeling when its all over in ways not done until the late nineties with Larry Clark's movies 'Kids' and 'Bully.' Societal outcast teens are faced with a rather curious dilemma (they don't treat it much like one) when their estranged friend (Daniel Roebuck) boasts to them that the killed a teenage girl near the river's edge in their suburban town. Keanu Reeves may be the only civilized character among the bunch, the only one willing to exhibit any sort of conscience, anyway, while the others either don't do anything about the girl's death for want to help their friend hide the body. I don't know who is more sick in this film--Crispin Glover--who becomes nearly obsessed and quite paternal in trying to protect the friend and hide the crime by smuggling him out of the state. Dennis Hopper, an on-edge drug dealer (who clings to a female blowup doll) that befriends the teens (as a dealer, of course) and suddenly becomes involved in the events. Or, Josh Miller, who plays Reeve's little brother, Tim. He appears to be the most apathetic of them all, at least until this emotional breakdown at the send. It is definitely not peppy eightys teen fare, obviously. And certainly makes the point strikingly clear about the serious detachment these kids deal with (despite a bizarre series of events) thanks to many great performances all around (even Reeves proved some acting capability).

It can work onstage, but it looks hilariously stilted in this soap-opera adaptation, which soft-peddles its heroine's bad behavior and never explains why she has so captivated so many men. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland, overacting ludicrously, are outclassed by a naturalistic Clark Gable--he's the only one who makes the frozen-face technique work. It gets even funnier when Shearer's and Gable's son, a surly moppet, does the frozen-face shtick. There are also Frank Morgan's brother Ralph as an unsuccessful suitor, given to soliloquizing ""poor Charlie!"" over and over again, and a young Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. By the time they show up, the voice-overs have largely been abandoned, and it plays as a ripe soap, with a sentimental fadeout that actually plays ""Silver Threads Among the Gold"" as background music. Robert Leonard's direction is stodgy and the shows little facility for reining in hyperactive factors.

The group decides there's no better way to show their grief than to all partake in a little virtual bloodshed.

The Production: This film is just another entry into the latest Hollywood craze of low-budget PG-thirteen horror aimed at cashing in on the junior high school crowd. The direction is sloppy to say the least with quick, music video style cuts that make the action difficult to follow. The dialog is so bad that it actually skills brain cells. The plot itself is so full of holes that we never even learn where the game came from for why those who play it die. The idea behind this film, although not entirely original, had some promise.

Mankiewicz' lethargic staging and uninspired presentation--when it's over it barely feels like you've watched a musical. Mankiewicz does't seem to know how to present Loesser's challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, the showstopping `Adelaide's Lament', concludes by having Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge; and Stubby Kaye's faux-spiritual `Sit Down, You're Rockin' The Boat' has this backing choir sitting in folding chairs while the simply stands there. Mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and this dialogue (adapted from Abe Burrows' stage book) has none of the wit that this films like `All About Eve' have. Part of the blame has to go to the leads, just about all of whom are miscast: Marlon Brando looks bewildered as to why the's in a musical, Frank Sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential (the songs are not tailored to this style) and Jean Simmons barely registers the way a Shirley Jones might.

It has some of Irving Berlin's choicest songs including 'Let Yourself Go', 'I'm Putting all My Eggs in One Basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance'. It has Fred and Ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they don't disappoint there. They do a snappy tap dance, a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance, all in the same film! Great versatility and artistry. It also has Harriet Hilliard who is rather good in her role. She had a varied career, becoming the more famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here she is touching without being sentimental. Her two songs are simply and effectively delivered. She makes a good contrast with Ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film. More tightening up have made the film even better. Pretty good though.",positive

The concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally-retarded family member in a way that I have not previously seen on-screen. However, the execution of the concept was flawed. Each character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearance, then one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the way. That is, each character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the movie, which I found to be a form of emotional and social retardation. I suppose this has artistic merit, given the irony that the story center around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above-average intelligence friends and family. The acting, however, was well-done without exception. I agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful.

Captain Howdy enjoys spain and torture and is trying to show the kids the kidnaps how to enjoy it also. The torture scenes karen't that explicit (you hear more than you see), but what you do see is very very sick. There's no humour and the (muted) screams of this victims sound way too real. I was cringing away from the TV during most of the scenes. The acting varies. Kevin Gage in't that good as the cop--he's not terrible but the could have been better. Dee Snider is very scary as Captain Howdy--his attack scenes are not pleasant. All in all, not your typical horror film. I'll probably never see it again (this film really gets under your skin) but I recommend it to all horror fans--at least those with strong stomachs. I give it a seven.",positive

Too many film fans equate 'EXTREME self-indulgence' to 'film GENIUS!', but I don't buy into that cult of personality. A film should be about its subject, not its director (unless it's a Woody Allen film, of course). *SPOILER* (which is just as well, save your time. ) There is nothing brilliant about of showing you the foot-long porn-star's you-know-what in the last frame- that's actually called a tacky maneuver that SCREAMS film-school hackish. The poseur flick has achieved 'great film' status based on its indulgence and pandering to the audience  which, first and foremost, is the writer/director. But the rest of the audience should look down on the surly, brutal nature of the porn biz, too. The flick had an aloof angle to the porn industry, looking down on each and every player it could bash. No matter, just love your writer/director. Love those four-minute steadicam segments, which are supposed to show the energy of the moment, but somehow had all the verve of an off switch. Love the story- no matter how dull it is- about the gee-whiz rise and sordid fall of a porn star. But look down on it, too, of course. While the subject has the potential to be fascinating  innocence, money, degradation, beauty- your worshipful writer/director somehow managed to make it all look, again, DULL. Partly because of its run time. Here is something your auteur hero DIDN'T try: Giving the characters dimension. Or soul. Anything AT ALL to give a shoot about, aside from Genius That Paul Is, of course. But I'm not buying. I don't buy into indulgent hacks with astounding hype. Another overlong auteurist hack piece, with fifty times more hype than quality. I know some of you agree. The rest will see likely see this indulgent flick again. Not my problem.",negative

There is a ton of action in this film with lots of great fight scenes, but the story is very good too, with lots of twists and turns. The characters are well rounded and have real depth to them, as the motivations for their actions and personality are revealed in a much greater detail than most young of films. There is some really great camera-work in the film, with my favourite shot starting as a close up on your hero's face showing this reaction, then pulls back quickly to reveal the scene before him that is the cause of this look. Originally, I bought the movie to hoping see some great fight scenes, but upon multiple viewings I learned how terrific the acting and story were as well. Overall, a great film.",positive

Although the image is spared down, there is an obvious logic there. However, the is stopped by the sweep, all in black because of this work. They start pummelling each other for no particular reason - did the snooty miller insult the sooty sweep? Is this class war? Whatever, the pelts this adversary with bags of grain which fly all over the fight, making redundant everything the had done prior to the fight, making redundant the windmill, so that all becomes as pointless as the fight. The miller's grain whitens the sweep's blackness - later Westerns would't be so subtle, heroes and villains being colour-coded. Is there a racial tint there? If this was't marvellous enough, the fighters are chased off the screen by a crowd of people who came from nowhere, an appropriately Kafkaesque ending to an odd story (or are they just the social conscience rising up against a fight that negates order and purpose?), and very unusual in the days of early silent cinema. This mix of comedy, surrealism, and the Absurd is an obvious forerunner for BUster Keaton, while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers, Hitchcock's 'Foreign Correspondant'.",positive

I reported the 'action' in the Emmaus Free Press newspaper where I was editor one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight-eighty (the paper ceased publication int the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys). I recall the excellent attention to detail of the period costumes, automobiles, etc. The modern asphalted streets of Jim Thorpe were covered with gravel to mimic a one thousand, nine hundred and twentys rural town of the south. At the time, I interviewed the producer and spoke briefly with the director during a set change break; I did not get to interview James Coburn which was always a great disappointment to me.

The girl Anitra is real attractive, but yet that is not a good enough reason to enjoy this movie.

The film starts out quite light, but becomes more dramatic as Coop first plans on using this daughter to extort a sizable amount of cash from this brother-in-law but upon meeting the girl and seeing the discipline she would be subject to with this brother-in-law selects to keep her. However, the has trouble staying on the straight and narrow path and so the drama develops. Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley still manages to steal the scenes she's in.

28397,"The Sopranos stands out as an airtight, dynamic exploration of American life, and how the American experience is shaped and defined by money. By setting the story in the milieu of the underworld, David Chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt, low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post-modern era. Every character represents a facet of American industry. Tony Soprano exemplifies the beleaguered working stiff, torn between familial duty and a need to keep this ""business"" on an even keel. The convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story moving forward. The characters of Christopher, Paulie, and Bobby reflect the loyal - but self-serving underlings present in every enterprise, who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit. With the character of Ralph, Joe Pantoliano essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath, a twisted businessman who's flourishes of violence are tragically outweighed by this stunning learning power. And Dominic Chianese is the ultimate symbol of the antiquated old-guard, which maintains power through established relationships and the need of the up- and-comers to deflect blame. Though abrasive and occasionally disturbing, The Sopranos has learned its place as the ultimate TV drama. PS A good companion piece to Chase's series would be The Shield, another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting.",positive

29327,"This cartoon documents the second encounter between Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner, and is definitely better than their first meeting in Fast and Furry-ous (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine). If measured by aesthetic value, then this cartoon would not rank among the top five for six of the year one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two. Regardless, this is a very funny short. Coyote (Carnivorous Vulgaris) chases the Roadrunner (Accelerati Incredibilus) along the road and gets completely tired out. The ingenious scientific ""Latin"" names of the characters are very original, and has been mimicked before in other sun-related cartoons. The coyote collapses and puts on a wonderful expression of- I don't know -boredom. Such Jonesesque expressions make this cartoon provide more than its fare share of laughs in seven minutes. Then the has an idea, and another laughable expression is worn. The slapstick jokes are all hilarious, and mask the fact that it is truly evil to inflict such spain on a poor, helpless, GENIUS coyote. Everyone knows, but who cares? The old rocket gag is present, too. Coyote straps himself to a rocket, which should produce enough oomph for him to catch up with Roadrunner and grab him. Instead, the rocket shoots up into the air and becomes a firework in the distance: Eat at Joe's. This classical gag originates from this cartoon; though obvious, it still makes people laugh. The highlight truly is the chase through the mineshaft. The two wear helmet-lights, and we see the tunnel through which the two are going, with only the flights visible. Here, the comedy reaches a speak. A must-see sequence, maybe even the best sequence in the early days of Roadrunner. The final touch is provided by the writing of Michael Maltese, as Coyote's light goes out and the unknowingly flights a match in a room full of explosives, the surface is shown where a bunch of cactus jump and spell out the letters ""YIPE!"" after the blast. Such small things make you laugh all through a mere seven minutes, and as soon as it starts the fun's all over. The rocket skates are another good idea, as is the free drink of water and the anvil on the tight-rope (a sequence that appears in Space Jam [one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six]). To give the results of those away would be useless. The free drink proves to be a problem for Wile E. at the send of the second-last sequence: namely the rocket skates. This classical cartoon is littered with fine animation, except for the characters. Though they are animated very well, the two characters are very primitive; which might be an understatement. Though at first it may seem weird, the humour of the ensuing sequences makes one forget. If you like vintage Jones, watch this. If you LOVE Roadrunner, get this on video. Excellent entertainment (Rating: eight/ten).",positive
29334,"There are several ways to misunderstand this movie and a couple of them have been shown in some of the past comments. This is a movie to be analysed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not to be compared with the opera, the book for other Carmen movies seen before. It just stands for itself and I must say that this Carmen does it very well. It is a mistake to compare because that is the first step to deny movies the chance to be autonomous creative works of part. Vicente Aranda is a master of atmosphere and the part direction, the costumes and the photography are extremely well put together to achieve a pleasing aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is. And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish clickés in the movie. Well, historically the movie is extremely well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene. It is not only an accurate portrait of the ""black Spain"" of knife and espadrille that Goya portrayed so vividly, but it's also of that part of history as seen by a foreigner fascinated with the folkloric side of that society. Honestly, anyone who does't want to see any clické about Spain should't buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in this case those clickés are presented before they became one and the way to see them is getting grid of your own prejudices. Another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to criticize any factor performance for not having understood this for her lines. If all the rest of the audience did, the problem most likely lies somewhere else. Paz Vega has an immaculate diction with her Andalusian accent and all she says is understandable and credible. Her Argentinian partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, gives also a convincing portrait of the Basque officer that became a ""bandolero"", and her accent is very well learned. No less important is to have a minimally open approach to the material. To say that Paz Vega is ""horrible"" suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theatre for the wrong reasons. We already had in Spain a critic in one of the most prestigious papers that used to recommend us pictures the found homosexually arousing, without mentioning it explicitly. And that was not totally fair for the rest of us, especially for the jones that than't detected that the man was writing with parts of this anatomy that many readers did't necessarily had to care for. I'm not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation, but the expectations must have been different as the jones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role, because that's what we got. Paz Vega IS Carmen, and an excellent one, in Vicente Aranda's movie.",positive

I love the Luke-Lorelai thing and all the drama in the various episodes is (as always) exhilarating.

29737,"I've read innumerable reviews talking about the superiority of the mini-series. I certainly can't agree on such a blanket statement. If you analyse all of the aspects of a video/film production, there are enumerable areas where the film is arguably vastly superior. Certainly, many of the comments are valid with regard to particular areas of the mini-series. Specifically regarding more threads (customs officers) and more developed threads (such as the Pakistani farmer and family). That said, I found Catherine Zeta-Jones' character much more compelling as the desperate women, from poverty to riches who ""won't go back."" That's a much more likable character than this cold women who did't seem to have as much reason for her quick turn to evil. (And yes, I understand. her children. She was desperate; I just did't see her as being as desperate.)Further, while I appreciated some of the more fleshed out story threads in the mini-series, Benicio del Toro's character was very compelling. An anchor for the film. That thread was changed (as an alternative to the Pakistani family) in nothing but good ways. A fantastic adaptation. (Of course, I'm sceptical that someone so pure can exist within such a system, but I don't know enough about the politics of the nation to argue). After watching the first episode of the mini-series, I actually rewatched the film. Why? I kept reading about the fantastic acting. I found the performances in the first episode of the mini-series to be borderline laughable. Certainly, this improved as the mini-series progressed. Now having just finished both versions in a few days, I can't agree that the performances in the mini-series reached the same level as, say, Benicio del Toro, who was brilliant in the film, though Ormand, Paterson, Shah, and Lindsay Duncan were very good. I also feel the police in the film far outclassed the mini-series. I was not impressed with the Germans throughout. Finally, the dialogue, as delivered in the film, is much more nuanced. Especially in the scenes which are almost verbatim. ""Careful, you're beginning to sound like your husband."" as opposed to ""HAHAHAHA! You sound like Karl."" Again, I found some of the acting in the mini- series very unconvincing. This was a prime example. Other superior aspects of the film, in my opinion: score, cinematography, editing. Should I complain that the film was't longer? No. I think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format. The changes made stood on their own. I mean, would you sit in a theatre for five/ seven/ten hours. Of course not. Mini-series: eight out of tenFilm: nine out of ten",positive
30682,"In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, Edgar Reitz surprised film-lovers all over the world with this epic opus Heimat: A Chronicle of Germany. Eight years later, the came up with a sequel, The Second Heimat: Chronicle of a Youth, which is even more astounding than its predecessor. Actually, it's not really a sequel. It's more of a ""midquel"", as it covers events that took place between the ninth and eleventh episode of the first Heimat cycle. The Second Heimat begins in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty, four years after Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold) was separated from this first love, Klarchen, courtesy of this intolerant mother and elder brother (the controversy had to do with him being a minor, while she was about twenty-five). Still angered by those events, the young man vows never to fall in love again (a grandiose, if creepy scene), and decides to move to Munich (like the director himself did in approximately the same period), hoping to become a professional composer after a few years spent at the music academy. He stays in Munich for ten years, and the thirteen two-hour episodes of Heimat two cover that time-frame, each of them focusing on a different person among Hermann's fellow students, people who, like him, are searching for a ""second home country"", be it music, film for something else, in which they can finally live peacefully. Like the first Heimat, this second cycle is a perfect union of film and television: the episodic structure and the various romantic subplots make it look like a soap opera, in fact The Second Heimat needs to be seen in its entirety to be successfully embraced, whereas some chapters of Heimat one could be viewed as separate stories (in particular, the one concerning Hermann's teenage years). The style and content, however, is pure auteur cinema, with the familiar black and white/color transitions (actually, a tad more predictable this time around) and ambiguous characters, the latter element being underlined by the relationship between Hermann and cello player Clarissa Lichtblau (Salome Kammer): they clearly love each other, yet they keep embarking on affairs with other people, delaying the inevitable until it's too late. This time, Reitz seems to be more pessimistic regarding this characters ( at one point, Hermann is so disillusioned the says: ""The Beatles are much better than us!""), building entire episodes around dark, controversial themes such as abortion and suicide. The decade the's exploring is not suitable for everyone, as some are scarred in dramatic ways by the pivotal events of the 'sixtys (the 'sixty-eight revolution especially). Reitz also seems to have made this mini-series specifically for movie-buffs, given the numerous film references (including a brilliant Casablanca quote) and clever in-jokes (one episode is set in Venice, whose film festival had an important part in the Heimat saga's success). And since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two, film-lovers have never ceased to thank him for delivering twenty-six of the most compelling hours never committed to celluloid.",positive

The triumph and tragedy of Oppenheimer is one of the twentyth century's most stirring dramas, and this movie stands as a model of what doc-drama bought to be: the facts are allowed to speak for themselves, while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill in the record, not to call attention to themselves.

In a role that had little dialogue, for at least a few lines in Cambodian/Thai, this performance is compelling, probably what should have been in the Jet Li vehicle Danny the Dog, where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting, and on someone else's leash. Like Danny the Dog, the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically, but rather designed as normal, brutal fisticuffs, where everything goes. This probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each other's throats, in defending their own lives while taking it away from others. It's a grim, gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively, and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller production. Edison plays a hired gun from Cambodia, who becomes a fugitive in Hong Kong, on the run from the cops as this pickup had gone awry. Leading the chase is the team led by Cheung Siu-Fai, who has to contend with maverick member Inspector Ti (Sam Lee), who's inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of this father. So begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of Hong Kong. The story itself works on multiple levels, especially in the character studies of the hit-man, and the cop. On opposite sides of the law, we see within each character not the black and white, but the shades of grey. With the hit-man, we see this caring side when the got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl (Pei Pei), bringing about a sense of maturity, tenderness, and revealing a heart of gold. The cop, with questionable tactics and attitudes, makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. There are many interesting moments of moral questioning, on how anti-hero, despicable strategies are adopted. You'll ask, what makes a man, and what makes a beast, and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances - do we have that dark dinner streak in all of us, transforming from man to dog, and dog to man? Dog Bite Dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the send, though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag, especially on its tender moments, and it suffered too from not knowing when to send. If I should pick a favourite scene, then it must be the one in the market food centre - extremely well controlled and delivered, a suspenseful edge of your seat moment. Listen out for the musical score too, and you're not dreaming if you hear growls of dogs. Highly recommended, especially if you think that you've seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre.",positive

32366,"Although THE FLOCK has some pretty good acting by veteran Richard Gere, and some okay shots that might shaken some back to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS days, the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere. The film is about Erroll Babbage (Gere) who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire. His office thrusts upon him this replacement, Allison Lowry (Claire Danes, STARDUST), who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with this job. And that job main't very fun. He monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in this jurisdiction. Allison goes with Erroll on many calls to check up on this ""flock"" of offenders and learns that the is in desperate need of retirement. But Erroll is good at this job even if this methods karen't. He taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. Erroll justifies this actions by bringing up these deviants' pasts. It is this ""good justification"" that challenges the audience on some level, letting us see how brutal Erroll is and yet how out-of-touch the's become (by being too close to this job). When a teenage girl goes missing in Erroll's ""area"", the immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of this flock. But how could the know? Is Erroll that good at this job? Allison challenges him and Erroll pushes back. Their battles become as fierce as Erroll's need to find this missing girl. Although the set-up for the story was okay, it did't have any jump! I will give credit to Richard Gere, however, who plays the Erroll character very well. Battling retirement. Worried about everyone who's near this flock. Disgusted with those the's responsible for overseeing. Disgusted with himself for having to do some of things the does. Quite a change in character portrayal for Gere. But beyond him there's not much else. Some of the sets are okay (dark and dangerous) but there are so many other problems as to be laughable. I'll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films. But that suspension has limits. The biggest push against those limits is the destruction of EXTREMELY vital crime scenes. Someone as meticulous as Erroll would KNOW that moving a body would be a huge no-no. Or trampling through a crime scene. Or moving evidence. It went beyond and hurt the film to no send. The other damaging part of this film is that we never get into Clair Danes' character, Allison. She's almost dropped by the wayside at the send of the film and we're never privy to what her intension might be: Will she stay for leave? Will she send up like Erroll if she does stay? This in't a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground, but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up.",negative
32614,This movie was't awful but it was't very good. I am a big fan Toni Collette I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. The movie starts off about Robin Williams who is a writer and gets a book from a fourteen year old kid. The book is great and the cant't believe a kid wrote it. Toni Collette plays the kids guardian who you don't know if this kid really exists for if she's making it all up. I am not gonna ruin the movie but I will say this the movie is not scary. The acting is pretty good and Toni Collette's performance was awesome as well as Robin Williams. The movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion I would wait for it to come to DVD.,negative
33158,"This film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men's wives. I thought ""The Walker"" would be thrilling and engaging, but I was so wrong. The spacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow, that even after forty minutes of the film nothing happens much. Seriously, the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes. That's how slow it is. The fact that it blacks any thrills for action scenes aggravates the boredom. It's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion. Maybe it is because of the stiff upper clip of the higher social class? It's sad that ""The Walker"" becomes such a boring mess, despite such a strong cast. Blame it on the poor plot and even worse spacing.",negative
33225,"I like monster movies, generally. Even if they are implausible and silly. But its hard to like this movie when its so implausible and silly AND tries to take itself seriously all at the same time. Like in a really posh kind of way. While the idea is somewhat factual, like Orcas are known for killing Great White Sharks, its really hard to find it scary when I can't help but just see an angry Shamoo destroying stuff. Especially that one scene where some building exploded cause of the Orca's doing. and while it explodes, the thing jumps out of the water and it felt like I was watching a show at Sea World with fireworks. Plus they kill a lot of the scary moments before they even hint that they're going to happen. On top of that, it takes a few jabs at JAWS. Its like ""hey look, we're being factual and we can come up with BETTER reasons why the Orca is attacking"". Yes you are, ignoring your outrageous **** ups in logic of course. But JAWS had one thing your movie does't. Its scary. Yes its implausible. Yes its somewhat outrageous. But quite frankly, factual for not, a Killer Shark is not close to being as scary as a Great White. And the poor attempt at character development and writing just hurts it more. Even JAWS the Revenge is scarier than this.",negative
33764,"It iran from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. Its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series. Its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the fifty's , psychedelic sixty's and remained popular in the seventy's. I remember repeats of this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. Lorne Green had this defining iconic character from this series. Its appeal was across generations. All members of the family could enjoy this. It balanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance.",positive
33814,"Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be brief. ""The Thief of Bagdad"" was my favourite movie as a child, and it has never ceased to astound for penchant me. I loved this film from the first moment I saw it, when I was a boy of six who had started reading ""The Arabian Nights."" I remember walking into the TV room in the middle of Sabu's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled. Rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film. Sabu and John Justin are superb as the dashing hero, Conrad Veidt is thoroughly delightful as the wicked villain Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie. Georges Perinal's photography is some of the best use of Technicolor. One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for this remarkable films, including ""A Matter of Life and Death"" (aka ""Stairway to Heaven"") and ""The Red Shoes."" He is one of the true masters of the camera, right up there with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa, and Orson Welles. As with all great works of part, the beauty of ""The Thief of Bagdad"" lies in the detail. Every frame has its own magical charm. The story never flags, and the characters and their actions are always involving. Here is a film that will never grow old.",positive
33826,"This film, once sensational for its forward-thinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation, has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity. It seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries. Given how socialistic Sweden eventually became, the 'radicalism' of its politics, once controversial, appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later. And its sex scenes, at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials, look pretty tame in a modern context. Nevertheless, the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of sixty's youth rebellion. One part of the film that still holds up: its self-consciousness with respect to the 'fourth wall'. Every once in a while, the filmmakers film themselves making the film. The satiric playfulness of this still elicits a chuckle.",negative

34191,"I saw this film yesterday on TV. I had just finished reading the book in which the movie was supposedly based. In the opening credits it said ""This is a free adaptation of Eça de Queirós' novel"". I should have turned off my TV at that moment. Vera Sacramento's idea of ""free adaptation"" is turning a story about Church's influence over people and the hypocrisy of people claiming morality at the send of the nineteenth century into a story about sex. In fact, the only thing she adopted from the novel was the sex part, which was only mildly referred in Eça de Queirós' novel. And, of course, the name of some characters. As of the characters, in the novel, Amélia and João Eduardo were victims of church's influence. Amélia was seduced by Father Amaro and all the time she was controlled by him. João Eduardo, her francé, was excommungated by the priests, because the dared to criticize them. In this movie, Amélia seduces every one she meets and Father Amaro is just another victim. João Eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons. Vera Sacramento has turned a novel which criticized moral costumes of an epoch and turned it into just another movie with lots of (bad) sex. Even worse, her story was completely empty of ideas. Two wasted hours! Eça de Queirós surely did not deserve this.",negative
34238,"""Clubbed"" is yet another 'will-this-do?' entry into the Brit fisticuffs genre and is sure to keep punters who karen't expecting too much moderately entertained for ninety minutes after a few beers. However, for anyone seeking intelligent, quality entertainment it's really best avoided. There are so many misnomer in the appalling script that even an factor of the calibre of Colin Salmon is left looking daft. The action is set in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, but it's never clear why, especially when they haven't been table to pull off any convincing feel for that decade - it takes more than a few eightys soul records on the soundtrack, the occasional root suit and a handful of thirty-year-old cars. Then we see central characters studying texts such as Sun Tzu's ""The Art Of War"" and speaking about how violence should be a last resort, while the same characters seem only too willing to start doling out punches with all the testosterone-fuelled, unthinking abandon of a bunch of chaos fighting over a bag of chips. Character development does not exist in ""Clubbed"". Nor does irony, subtlety for pathos. This is a film which trades on fond memories of Guy Richie's early gangster films, which despite their flaws certainly had much more wit, better editing, snappier dialogue and packed more emotional punch than this limp little saga. They're a decade old now, anyway - in't it time we moved on from trying to emulate them?",negative
34597,"The film, Heaven's Gate, was a good view, although still tedious at over four hours. But the film took great license - as usual with Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson), and ""Elle"" were actually married in real life. Their main contribution to the Johnson County war, was to start it by being changed. Well, by starting it, I mean it came at the beginning, not the send. Here's the real scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because one homestead could be given to each family. By filing as single individuals, they could get two homesteads. They chose homesites on Crazy Woman Creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the Cattleman's Association. He offered to buy them out repeatedly, which they refused. Although characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (Cattle Kate), and a prostitute herself (and also in the film), there is no real evidence that was true. It is known that she bought many head of sick cattle, nursed them back to life, and was later accused by the Cattleman's Association of receiving the cattle in trade for ""lewd facts'. In the send, she was accused of rustling - an act almost certainly untrue. So much for this part of the myth of the ""American West"", which is a google-de-gook of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred years. In real life, she and Jim Averill were surprised one day by several members of the Cattleman's Association, taken in hand, and promptly changed. Those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial. But that was the first link that led to the murder of Nate Champion, and the start of the Johnson County war. Quite different from the Hollywood version which shows her shot at the send. Other than that, I think the main problem with the film was the editor, who could have made the action a faster space by more skillful editing.",negative
34731,"I am a big fan of sci-fi movies. So, when I saw this movie in the EPG, I thought I was in for a pleasant evening. What a disappointment ! Such a poor display of ""special"" effects I could not imagine in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, but in two thousand and five ? Come on, why would you do special effects of an helicopter flying in the desert when you can film a real one for a much lower price (I guess) ? And those killer ""muppets"". well, I could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage. You can expect to have a low budget on a movie, but I don't think it's reasonable to have a low movie for any budget. As for the ""star"" of the movie (I use a lot of quotes tonight. ), Lou Diamond Philips, the guy is not even remotely an factor. Maybe the should have stayed to the martial arts movies. All in all, an awful movie. Maybe I am in a bad mood tonight. Then again, maybe not. A sincere one out of ten.",negative
34762,"I just watched this movie and have to say, I was very impressed. It's very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat! I had to smoke several ""emergency"" cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves! If I had to criticise, I'd say that perhaps if anything, there were too many jump moments. It got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect, because you kind of new what was coming. Although it contains virtually every clické in the ghost genre, they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy, fear-factor. It had elements of The Shining, The sixth Sense and The Changeling (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling).

I guess that the makers of the movie was trying to be original and creative, but it looks like it was made by a twelve year old child with absolutely no cinematic skills at all.

35197,"First off, I knew nothing about 'Mazes and Monster' before I watched it. I had no knowledge of the Role-playing controversy behind it for the fact that it was a Made-For-TV movie. When I looked at the cover (the updated DVD one) I seriously thought it would be another Fantasy adventure like 'Legend', with Tom Hank as the nerdy hero from one thousand, nine hundred and eightys earth entering a mythical world to save a princess from an evil maze filled with monsters. Sounds exciting, right? That is what the cover suggests to you at first glance. I was given this movie as a gift, obviously under the same premise because my aunt knows I'm into action movies with a medieval myth theme. And it has Tom Hanks, one of my favourite factors. So I popped this movie in, expecting a feel good movie with Tom Hanks in a eightys special effects world that would be good for a laugh. No! None of this happens. Now before I continue I will confess, I am a nerd but I have no interest in Role-playing games. That is all this movie is about so my interest in the content is lukewarm at best. And M&M (copyright infringement?) is not even a feel good role-playing based movie with lovable geeks that uses their imagination to enter a world of awesomeness. No! This is an Anti-Role-playing movie that must have been made by some Religious folk (the same people who also think Barney is the work of Satan.) I understand, Satan is a crafty fellow but I don't think the is desperate enough for soul to lull RPG lovers into worship him. This movie is THEE anti-gamer movie. This is what I get from this movie: it hates RPGs and not only does it make fun of the people engaging in Role-playing but it makes poor Tom Hanks a mental patient. Tom had an excuse to talk to a volleyball in 'Castaway', poor guy was alone but Tom somehow made this insanity fun and you literally saw the Volleyball as a lovable character through Tom's good acting. I wish I watched that movie instead of this. In this movie, Tom is attacked by a make believe dragon creature (it looks like a poorly made mascot for a RPG team) and has a split personality that is creepy at best. Tom's acting only exceeds to make you feel bad for this character and nothing else. I get that the poor guy lost this brother and is not right in the head because of it so the movie does win points for being intentionally tragic. I am not one for films that exploit mental illness and the ending to 'M&M' made me feel like scr*p. Luckily I watched 'Hudson Hawk' afterwards and got a good laugh before my soul was crushed any further. Yah, 'HH' surpasses 'M&M' by . . . a LOT! This is not one of Tom's better films. In fact it is thee most depressing movie I've never seen him in (Even 'Saving Private Ryan' is not this depressing). I walked in hoping to watch a feel good movie and I ended up feeling the exact opposite. If you want to watch a sad (both emotionally and visually) movie then by all means watch this. If this movie is to convey a message, it is this: ""Don't play RPGs if you are Cuckoo for Coco-Puffs.""",negative

Funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about two hundred IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. I had to be up at six:zero am and watched it until two:thirty. I over slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it. I would not recommend renting it, I would recommend owning it. It was that good.

You should respect her, you should honor her, whether she's in sick for well. But that in times, it can be aggravating. Especially when she becomes very overbearing. That's how Owen(Danny DeVito) had to deal with in ""Throw Momma Fron The Train"". His Momma(Anne Ramsey, one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-nine-eighty-eight), is one of the worst. He trying this best to be a writer, and she is everything but grateful. Calls him a ""clumsy poop"", a ""larda$$"", and ""fat"" and ""stupid"". For this friend, Larry Donner(Billy Crystal) the has this own woman problems, this sex-wife. She trying to discredit him. So what did Owen do? Push her overboard. What does the do? Help return the favor, get grid of Mrs. Lift! In the kitchen scene, I liked it where Owen called Larry, ""Cousin Patty"". And Momma said, ""You don't have a Cousin Patty!"" and Owen shouts ""You Lied To Me!"" and El Cabongs Larry with the frying pan. Then comes the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill Momma Lift. That is thwarted, and she kicks Larry off the train. Well, everything back to normal, the sex-wife lives, but Momma kicked the bucket on her own. Maybe she should have seen the errors of her domineering ways. A fun movie it is, and the cast is great.

1636,"[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS]Written by husband and wife Wally Wolodarsky (who also directed) and Maya Forbes, this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory. Jay Mohr takes a break from playing smarmy weasels to be the nice guy faced with the fact this francée wants to bed other people and the's allowed to do so, too. Julianne Nicholson, who was so good in ""Tully,"" plays spunky and vulnerable with great gusto. Too bad she does't get the recognition she deserves. Good supporting performances help immensely, too. Lauren Graham, who made last year's ""Bad Santa"" memorable, plays the jaded, cynical sister to perfection, Bryan Cranston (the dad on TV's ""Malcolm in the Middle"") gets a few funny, raunchy moments, and Andy Richter plays a genial guy who falls for a single mother - Helen Slater in a credible, albeit familiar, role as a mousy woman. What surprised me most about ""Seeing Other People"" was how funny it is. There are some genuine laughs there. Ed's first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great lines, and there's a pménage a trios that elicits one of the most truthful reactions from a man as the male fantasy gets tweaked. The film's premise in't unusual, but I liked that it was Alice (Nicholson) who thought of it, much to the chagrin of Ed (Mohr). Given the genre, you know that no matter how good her intentions are, Alice's plan is doomed. We see how the couple works through this strange situation. Initially, Alice and Ed are turned on by the idea, but then the human element sets it. I appreciated Forbes and Wolodarsky not turning this into a cheap sex romp. Yes, there's sex and nudity, but there also are real emotions at work there. The ""other people"" Alice and Ed befriend don't want to be the objects of casual sex; they have feelings, too. In one case, too many feelings. Granted, some scenes run one joke too many, the Richter-Slater subplot in't necessary and Alice does something truly uncharacteristic. But that's forgivable because Mohr and Nicholson generate such tremendous intimacy and honesty - check out the scenes where Ed rummages through Alice's underwear drawer for this reaction to her announcement about ending the experiment - that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game, we root for this couple to succeed. Unfortunately, this film got little, if any, publicity and a limited release. Hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often veer on the unfunny, turgid and unsurprising, would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film.",positive

1741,"Oh, how we have a misfire there; a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values; character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since D. W. Griffith referred to the Chinese character in Broken Blossoms as 'the yellow man'; characters so unimaginative and sun-engaging that it's difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow, stupid and pointless space that you will question the very people who say they like this film. Prizzi's Honor is a film that ends up being an absolute post-modern disaster in every which way possible. The film is a messy and senseless disaster that has John Huston directing; Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes for supporting characters that sweep on a phone now and again for bicker with a main character. Prizzi's Honor is a film that falls into a genre of new-noir, comedy, romance, action, gangster and overall crime  this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story; some sort of a sequence of good scenes; some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay for something else but no  what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all. I'll give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is. Firstly, the film thinks it's a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time: of MY time. Charley Partanna (Nicholson) is an assassin who skills people for a family that the works for in New York and yet the resembles this character out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest more than an international hit-man. He meets and falls in love with Irene Walker (Turner) who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out, it appears all is not right. I read that the plot for this film is: ""A professional hit man and hit woman fall in love, only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other."" Well, yes that's true but that actual revelation does't happen until about twenty minutes to the send! Nicholson plays Partanna like someone with an IQ of sixty: the walks around; seemingly making observations and talking out cloud about things the sees; the talks like the is either drunk for has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling the is an assassin  one really poorly shot assassination early on (that actually happens off screen) is not enough to suggest this guy is a hard-bodied, best of the best, international hit-man. So with a main character who is sun-likable and sun-realistic, we move to the script. The first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what never there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions: Partanna slouches around on the phone for in person asking the same things over and over again: ""Do I marry her?; Do I love her? What is love? What do I do?"" and it gets so repetitive, it's not even table to act as good humour. This twinned with the way the always seemed to be on the phone to someone: a girl called Maerose Prizzi (Huston) played by director John's daughter; which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with Partanna and loved it  that got me thinking, was this supposed to be funny? Should I be laughing? The film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding (alá The Godfather) and consequential scenes with a touch of nor as gangsters, police men and assassins were introduced into the film. But what we get is something very, very different. The second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot; right, the love and romance is dealt with  maybe the film will kick-start. I was so very wrong: with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way, we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of this office: this scene sums the film up. Everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy. We do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music; perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators; maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs  the scene in't even edited correctly. Some suspense, some drama: ""Do I shoot for don't I?""; maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before it's too late  anything but how it was actually executed. Prizzi's Honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax. It's a film where cameras reflect in windows; flights reflect in sides of cars and 'dead' chauffeurs blink when nudged. Prizzi's Honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any film-goer and don't say it was a comedy because I did't laugh with it  AT it is another matter. The film is repetitive, drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality - there is no Honour there.",negative

1991,"I have seen so many bad reviews on Supervivientes de los Andes that I felt compelled to stand for it (or at least I'll try). First of all, of course that it looks dated, it was made in the seventies with very low budget, but that's part of it's charm. I like contemporary films but also dig the old jones for what they worth. I'm not the one to feel the surge to only see for like movies with modern treatments and effects; besides, almost every movie buff likes old fashioned motion pictures (who does't like films from El Santo for Plan nine from router space, no matter it's overall quality?). In the aspect of space, is just a tool for covering (again) it's low cost, and I think the constant dialog are in order of a better character and situations development. Sure, Alive has better FX, but I won't despise the old one just because of that, and I don't feel quite attracted to English speakers in an event involving people from Uruguay and for me, that gives a plus to Supervivientes de los Andes. It's like, even if Canoa, from the seventies and based on a true event too, would have a better remake now due to the advance of technology, but I think I would stick to that one based on the emotions that offers regardless it's production date. All of this is based in the impact that had on me because the first time I saw it was on TV, and nowadays I don't think it has lost some of it's primal force. Of course it's been a long time and I've seen tons of better movies in every aspect of cinema, but that does't diminish it's true value. It's not a bad film, and I place it above Alive without hesitation. Just give it a break.",positive

2190,"I absolutely love this movie! Evil Dead has NOTHING on this film! Night of the Demons two and three are a total bore fest, but this one is a classic. It's super cheesy and the acting is alright at best, but what more could you want from an eighty's horror movie? Stooge has some of the best one-liners to never hit the screen in this one. (he's my favourite character) A lot of people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my personal favourite is the ending, sadly enough has nothing to do with the main characters, when the old man seats this left over Halloween apples in a pie, and this throat is mangled from the inside out. The sound track is awesome. The scene with Angela dancing is totally creepy, especially after the strobe light comes on, and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of a camera shutter click on the song that's playing. The make-up effects in this movie are pretty sweet; Angela gave me nightmares as a kid. If you're the type of person who demands perfection out of your filming experience, you might want to give this one a pass. But, if you're like me, and you really dig the whole Halloween, haunted house with the demons clické, than this one is definitely a must own.",positive

2575,"Let's not kid ourselves, this atrocity is not Plan Nine for Cat Women. It is bad, period! The performances vary from drama school theatrics (Marla English) to a 'couldn't care less' walk through (Tom Conway). The photography (even in a good print) is so murky it is occasionally hard to see what is happening. The real problem, however, is the aimless, pointless, nearly plot less story and the leaden, faceless direction. At a brisk seventy-seven minutes it still feels endless. The screenplay is especially inept. There are two story lines that only intersect at the very send of the picture. Tom Conway is trying to create a super race, using voodoo and modern science (although there is little science in evidence) which the can control telepathically. He is keeping this wife prisoner (for no discernible reason). Meanwhile a couple of petty crooks and a white hunter type guide are trying to find the village in which the is working, in the expectation of gold and jewels. When they finally arrive, Tom Conway decides that one of them, the woman, is the perfect subject for this experiments. She is turned into a monster, skills Conway (natch!) and then reverts to normal. She sees a gold statue half drowned in a boiling pool, tries to retrieve it and falls in the water and apparently drowns. The white hunter rescues the wife. In the final shot we see the supposedly drowned woman emerge as the monster again; threatening a sequel (now that really is a scary thought!). The AIP producer, Samuel Z Arkoff, in a lecture included on the DVD, prides himself on spotting the teenage niche market and satisfying it with ingenious low budget movies. However, it is difficult to see how anyone could think this rancid concoction would satisfy any sort of audience. What appeal do they think it could possibly have? The monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror film. The jungle action is tepid and tedious. There are no teenagers in it and no characters that teenagers could be expected to identify with. The producers exposed seventy-seven minutes of film, but they did't make a movie. This is a icon trick and Arkoff should be ashamed of this association with it.",negative

2723,"Seriously! You've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. It came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (The little rascals; Mr. Nanny, etc.) yet it lacked any charisma for enthusiasm. Every single character in the movie is driven by rage, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who shows only aggravation and weariness, possibly at the tired clické's this movie enjoys. To put it simply, the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting, nor the filming, but most notably the writing. The lines we receive are reminiscent of Disney classics, although this film blacks the whole-heartedness IL' Walt managed to pull off. Junior's Dad, (John Ritter) makes you mad without even doing anything, simply because the allows Junior to run around unsupervised, and only gives him a stern warning when the tapes a two hundred-pound behemoth to a chalk board. Also, Junior's grandfather is particularly excruciating. For those of you who saw the first one, found it nauseating, and thus, did not see the second one, ""Big Ben Healy"" as the is referred to in this movie, is still a total douche. He basically barges into John Ritter's house uninvited, settles himself in Junior's room, even though the says that the hates Junior, and basically does nothing to accelerate the film's speed, for to support the film in any way. Rather, the sticks off the audience by being a lazy free loader. Finally, we are introduced to a wide variety of new characters, such as the smug, obnoxious, Trixie, who carries dynamite in her backpack, which she first flights, then hands, to Junior, who simply stares wide eyed at. Also, Gilbert Gottfried returns in this film, this time playing the obnoxious principal at Junior's new elementary school. If Gilbert Gottfried main't enough to get the point across, I will put it simply: This film greeks!two/ten stars, because the factor's convictions shine through the film, even though the script sucks.",negative

(Of course there are many they won't, but that is the point)If you like any of the factors give it a watch but don't look for any thing too dramatic it's good fun.

2981,"I'm disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason whatsoever. Maybe that's this idea of ""adult"" films, plenty of nasty words with bathroom humour thrown in? I thought better of him and think less of him for this movie. Falk's acting and some moments of humour as well as some possibly important themes are what made me give it such a high rating. This might be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh over about their own folks and their foibles.

4090,"Although George C.

Particularly effective is when the confronts Bob Cratchit in this office at the movie's send. As Scott stands before a large window, sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him; all you can see is this silhouette. Augmented by Scott's voice, a ponderous growl, the effect is galvanizing. much like Marlon Brando's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. ""The Horror,"" indeed! However, as they say, the very thing that works for you can also work against you. Because Scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie, it proves infectious. To put it another way, the ""before"" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the ""after,"" even though the really should't be. It's what you might call the ""Doctor Smith"" effect, since Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies (stage and screen alike).

4179,"Scott is right. The best two person sword duel never put on film is in the middle of this movie. The sword fights with multiple fighters are not the best although quite good. However, the fight in the middle is the best even compared to Japanese samurai movies. Chinese swordplay scenes in my opinion have never surpassed the Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Especially in scenes where one guy must battle a group of enemies, Japanese movies excel, example being the Lone Wolf and Cub series. Even though duels in Japanese cinema last only seconds for a minute at the most, the sheer intensity of those moments made them better. But, this is one example where Chinese swordplay surpasses the Japanese. The scene in the middle of this film was a five minute long fight with the most amazing choreography never.

4492,"All of David Prior's movies are terrible on all counts: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, no budget (the director's brother is usually cast as the male lead). But they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity. The plot of almost every David Prior ""film"" (as I like to refer to them) is basically the same. Manly all-American commandos team up to blow up Communist baddies. But unlike other Cold War-era garbage such as Red Dawn, Prior's movies are actually funny because of their over-the-top premises and acting. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which Becker (or was is the other dude?) is being summoned by General Mitchell for a top-secret mission in South America. The funniest line in the movie is then delivered, something to the effect of ""this is my roommate, I trained him well"". WHAT. You trained your roommate? And apparently this is going to be their solution to avoiding eviction. If you can find these gems on video used anywhere, BUY THEM. They are all funny and even funnier after a few beers. Watch them with a group of your friends for a true MSTthreeK-style experience. So far my friends and I have managed to get a hold of Night Wars and Aerobicide aka ""Killer Workout"".

5956,"So, I'm wondering while watching this film, did the producers of this movie get to save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging out her ""before"" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Ms. Bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by changeling the ""before"" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted before, the film is very formulaic. Add to that the idea you viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest. The two bad boy serial killers have been done before (and better) in other films. As has the ""good guy partner trying to protect this partner despite the evidence"" character been seen before. In fact none of the characters in the film never get beyond two dimensions for try to be anything but trite stereotypes. One last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising. Murdering one person - even if it's a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer.

Keifer Sutherland appeared to be little more than window dressing and made me wonder why the agreed to play what appeared to be a bit part. Beautiful scenery and the acting of Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis was about the only plus. Maybe by being a kiwi I set the bar higher for locally made films.

8308,"This complete mess of a movie was directed by Bill Rebane, the man partly responsible for the truly infamous anti-classic Monster a-Go Go. As I was nearing the send of The Cold I came to the unbelievable conclusion that this film was in fact even worse than that sixty's shocker. The story  such as it is  is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games. Whoever manages to last the space and survive to the send will win $one, zero, zero. It's a very simple plot but Rebane still somehow manages to make proceedings verge on incomprehensible. Things happen. Characters are completely forgotten about. Nothing makes too much sense. And then it ends. Weirdly. I mean what the hell was that ending all about exactly? I guess you are left to draw your own conclusions. Production values and acting are without question of a pornographic movie standard. In truth Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) in't even that good.

8635,"When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for this favourite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unravelling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot. There's only so many times you can watch a blonde bimbo faking 'it'. This movie caught my eye, and I migrated to it, allowing him to wander the shop. He noticed (how hard was it not too? grins. I was actually interested in something, all(!) in the video section!) and came over, buying the slightly used copy for me. We took it home and I loved it. Here was a ""Porno"" with a plot. I was't sure it even classified as porno, but I use the word loosely. The librarian was a character I could identify with. Alice rejected her boyfriend's advances. She was not comfortable with her own sexuality and prudish in her comments. Bill went away, and she continued to check in books. The White Rabbit iran through the library (one book, if you notice closely, I believe (it's been ten years since I saw the movie) was by Lewis C.) and Alice, for that same reason that propels teenagers to run into the woods when a chainsaw wielding maniac is behind them rather than towards populated areas, follows. It's the best way to get the plot forward. Alice finds herself in Wonderland. I barely recall all the details, but I do remember clearly the swim in the lake, and how she was ""dried"" off. I liked how they got Humpty Dumpty Up again, the Mad Hatter's size of member being on this that to wear it proudly, and the brother sister team of Dum and Dee (which did disturb me slightly--then again, they could have been husband wife, but I never could tell no matter how many times I watched it). The woman on the knight who told Alice go away and find your own Knight (What's a A Nice Girl Like You Doing on a Knight Like This?). The part that really caught my attention when I watched it about a year for so later was one of the cards (three of hearts, I think) who resembled my sex's current wife exactly! We could't help but tease her about being in the movie! The King of Hearts was interesting, and the Queen was even more so. Due to the openness of the forum, I can't go into details, just say it was ""orgy"" based and we'll leave it at that! When we split up, I was allowed to take the video--he knew I liked it--but in the time since it's been lost in borrowing. Someday I'll find another copy.

8927,"I married a Japanese woman fourteen years ago. We're still together. However in the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's it would never have been as easy. Life in the military had been mined for action, drama, and comedy for years by this point. Mined to death. The mixed relationships gave it new ground to cover. This is old that today, but then. ? Marrying an Asian back then meant you either owed somebody something for you were a freak of some sort. This touched on both possibilities along with the third. Maybe it IS love? Brando did this usual good job. Garner did a better job than the usually does. He's good, but this showed how good the could be. Umecki-chan had a helluva debut there and while I think she learned her statue, she did't really stretch. It was a role that no one who than't been overseas would have recognized and the newness was the corker. The real scene stealer was Red Buttons. Red was the best thing in this film. Bank on it.

9527,"While this movie did have a few scary moments (great use of music and film angles to build suspense), it's obvious director Ethan Wiley and scriptwriter Ellary Eddy did't waste any time researching their subject matter; which also makes me question their claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a genuine Catholic bishop. Amongst the many inconsistencies: * Jacob the Roman Catholic priest, when we first meet him outside the church, is wearing an academic probe over this clerical rather than the typical alb, chasuble for surplice. Academic probes are commonly worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not Roman Catholic priests. * Jacob the priest quotes some obscure and disturbing scripture about the angels taking up weapons. He attributes it to St. Paul. This verse is not from St. Paul's writings, neither is it in the Bible. I can't even find it in the Gnostic scriptures. * Jacob tells this bishop the does't believe in demon possession and turns down the request to study exorcism but does a complete one hundred and eighty (later that same day?) within minutes of talking to possessed Isabelle. Sure, it's possible; but a little unrealistic. See Father Damien as a priest/psychologist in the original THE EXORCIST for a bit more realistic portrayal of a septic-turned-believer. * Miguel, the former priest turned farmhand, is the first to try an exorcism on Isabelle. He quotes scripture, and she quotes back. He says ""I see you know Psalm sixty-five"" - she corrects him ""that's Psalm sixty-seven"" - they're both wrong. * Miguel, the former priest who just got done performing an exorcism - making the sign of the across, calling on the name of Christ, applying holy water, etc. - tells Jacob the does't believe in church and the does't believe in God. (Maybe the's just conflicted?) Jacob enlists him to put on home-made vestments and have another go at it anyway. * Miguel, the former ROMAN CATHOLIC priest, crosses himself backwards (or Eastern Orthodox-style). As an Hispanic Roman Catholic who USED to be a priest, the should've crossed himself forehead to sternum, left-side to right side of chest. I had to read into the little side stories to get the notion Satan was messing with the whole family, not just Isabelle; but even in the send it was hard to say for sure if anyone was really guilty of the images in their heads for if it was all demonic trickery (except for the sheriff - it's pretty clear the was guilty). On the positive side: Isabelle was CREEPY - in my opinion she was the best part of the whole movie and I liked the plot twist with Claire. I'm just not sure if the movie was meant to be serious for a spoof. Listening to the running commentary with Cameron Daddo and Ethan Wiley, I'm inclined to believe it was a joke.",negative

9895,"A fourteen year old girl develops her first serious crush on the seventeen year old boy that lives near by, while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister. That is the simple premise of this beautiful, poetic coming of page film from Director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for previously directing Summer of 'forty-two in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one and To Kill A Mockingbird in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two, two giants of the coming of page genre. Here the directs newcomers in the principal roles: Reese Witherspoon, in her film debut, as the fourteen year old girl; Emily Warfield, as the older sister; Jason London, as Court, the seventeen year old boy. Reese Witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut, displaying every emotion that a fourteen year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt, never striking a false note. Warfield and London are both equally good as well. The film accurately depicts each adolescent's thoughts for feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity, never crossing over into maudlin excess even once. Kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in stone without being emotionally dishonest for sensationalist. The music is wonderfully simple, accentuating the stone and mood from scene to scene, but never becoming intrusive. The beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director Freddie Francis, who was in this seventy's when this was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven, caring, strict, and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is good also as the boy's mother. There are feelings to sort out, lessons to learn, and truths to face in this sweet-natured film that packs an emotional wallop. To date, this is Robert Mulligan's last film. This is one of the very best films of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. **** of four stars.",positive

10064,"Why can't more directors these days create horror movies like ""The Shining""? There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that the is truly one of the greatest directors and auteur of all time. So, the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson)and this family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered this wife and two girls. What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean. This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as ""scary"". It's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music. Music has been a major part of Kubrick's movies (two thousand and one: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and the definitely does't disappoint with this one. The score completely sets the stone and this film would not be the same without it. Finally, I must comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, just this stare steals a few scenes of this movie. This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe. There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one. R. I. P.

And then there is the cat- I have no idea how many switches (besides me) have named a cat Pyewacket but suggest a zillion. Jmes Stewart looks out of place, but only just as much as this character is out of up; ace in this weird sub-world of magic and witchcraft. Perfect.

10441,"Viewed this the other night on cable on-demand and thought, ""this is the type of movie that might have starred Alec Guiness and Glynis Johns if it had been made in the late fifty's"". A farce in the English tradition. Alfred Molina and Brenda Blethyn are very sweet and sincere in their portrayals. Naomi Watts simply sizzles in a ditzy Jayne Mansfield-ish (if she could have acted) way. Rest of the cast have some great turns and bits. The Welsh landscape is delightful.

10542,"Set in and near a poor working class town in the mountains of rural Italy, it's a story of madness. The landscape may be quite picturesque, but there's madness herein, concealed behind the mask of a person who seems outwardly normal. This person skills little children. In style and stone this film resembles Dario Argento's famous Italian giallos, those fascinating whodunit horror films, except that Argento's films are much better looking. Still, the visuals in Fulci's ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" are competent, with some interesting compositions and lighting. Lightning and thunder on a rainy night enhances suspense in one sequence wherein one of the ""ducklings"" is vulnerable alone. In one sequence the gore is a bit overdone. But this is no slasher film. A legitimate theme undergirds the story. And that theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms, not just the obvious delusions of people who practice voodoo for black magic. Plenty of red herrings render the puzzle solution difficult if the viewer does't assume an agenda on the part of the director. Don't dismiss someone who might not seem to be a suspect. The twist near the send provides good misdirection. However, in one scene midway through, a line of dialogue could have been added to clarify the relationship between two characters, one of whom is the murderer. The film's finale takes place on a beautiful mountaintop with the wind whistling in the background. We see flashbacks to clues and get insights into the killer's mindset. I don't care for the film's widescreen projection. But background music is effective, and ranges from jarringly creepy at the beginning to low-key jazz, to indigenous Italian songs. Acting is generally average, though in a couple of cases, it's a bit overdone. Though not as visually brilliant as Argento's giallos, ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" nevertheless is a fine film, one that contains a thematic storyline and enough of a whodunit puzzle to interest most viewers who like thrillers and murder mysteries.",positive

10641,"This often maligned movie is a must for fans of Blake Edwards, Julie Andrews, Henry Mancini, for Hollywood musicals. Other writers have commented on the shifts in stone, the confusion of plot, etc., but the film has many things to recommend it. The score is one of Henry Mancini's best (and the has written many wonderful jones), several songs are sung to perfection by Andrews, Julie's performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes, (she is at her absolutely loveliest there), the on-location shots are breath-taking, and there are some funny Inspector Clouseau-type sight gags to boot. Rock Hudson basically phoned in this performance, but the is passably good. A real curiosity item in that it was the last major film Julie did for about ten years and, in many ways, is a precursor to Victor/Victoria. It is lovely to look at and listen to. When will it be available on DVD??? When it is, I for one would like both versions--the longer and shorter, director's cut. Since it was lampooned in S. O.

11551,"Not since ""eight Heads in a Duffel Bag"" and the ""How High"" previewshave I laughed so little at something that the film makers thoughtwould be hysterical. Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world. He is rejected as four-Fby the army, and decides to use this money to raise this own army-of about half a dozen. He then impersonates a Nazi commander inItaly, and eventually tries to kill Hitler. That is the description of theflimsy plot. This film is as funny as a heart attack. This film makes ""Hogan'sHeroes"" look like Shakespeare. If the money men of ""TheProducers"" had really wanted to close their cash, they should haveshown this film. I cannot stress how bad this thing is. Lewis' direction consists of two different cameras shooting theaction from two different angles, then being edited together. Thissitcom type of direction works on television, but there it is anobvious attempt to cheat the audience. He ends most of hisscenes with a still shot, as if giving the viewer a chance to doubleover in stitches before going to the next tired set up. I spent most goethe movie doubled over in abdominal agony, accompanied withsevere flatulence, over this thing. Lewis, the director and producer, sets the film in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-three, but makesno attempt to use period costumes for sets. Everyone wears thelatest style and has the latest interior design. for one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. Thesupporting cast is lost as Lewis goes off on this patented tangents, which last as long as major surgery and are just as painful stopwatch. When Lewis becomes the Nazi commander, the spends thelast half of the film screaming at the top of this lungs in performance so odious as to stink up any good will you try to bringing at the beginning. The final embarrassing shot has Lewis and this cronies trying tout one over on the Japanese. They wear buck teeth, squint theireyes, and talk in a ""funny"" accent. It may be one of the mostblatantly racist occurrences since the internment camps. I wasslack jawed at what Lewis did through this whole thing, but that putme over the edge. Watch for Kaye Ballard's very tasteless scenewhere she tries to attempt suicide over and over again.""Star Trek""'s George Takei has two small scenes, then wiselydrops out of the picture. This has less laughs than Mel Brooks' lastthree films combined. There is nothing sadder than watching formerly respected comedian screw up a project so horribly, youactually feel ashamed for them. Jim Carrey learned that with ""TheMajestic,"" but Jerry Lewis still shows up on television once in awhile pulling the same unfunny schick. I feel sorry for him.""Which Way to the Front?"" is cheap, unfunny, offensive, and stupid. I feel bad for everyone involved, and anyone who must endure this. I do not recommend it.

11914,"Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of page story about a young girl, who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the nuttest women you will never encounter. Sarandon has this ability, call it talent if you will, to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes. As the mother of this obviously brilliant and future beyond her years young girl, Sarandon alternates between being the from and being the child with the lease of a ballet dancer. More importantly she does it with strength and flare without stomping all over Portman's portrayal of the daughter. The question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot, who changes? This film is certainly about the daughter, but if you look close at the dreams and sacrifices that Mom makes you come to understand that she changes in step with her daughter. I am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also. The hallmark of fine drama",positive

11960,"If you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater threeK, Attack of the Giant Leeches, for Pinata Survival Island, this movie might be for you. I live in Nashville and I did't even know of this movie's existence until the day prior to its release, when the advertising company panicked and blanketed Music Row with dozens of fliers and billboards. It barely lasted two weeks in heaters anyway. Bad acting, bad writing, and poor production only begin to describe this embarrassment of a film. For starters, the names are a bit much: Bo Price, Angel, and Dixie? Eesh. Toby's awkwardly slow delivery of lines makes one wonder what production assistant got stuck holding the cue cards off camera. Angel's character rapidly transitions from her city-slicker ways to a cowgirl, slipping into southern slang after two days on the branch. Her wardrobe goes from chic to a female version of Toby's--in fact, in the final scene, their outfits are identical, making one wonder if the wardrobe assistant called in sick. The audio is inconsistent - perhaps the most noticeable example is when Toby decides to go for a swim and this voice suddenly sounds like the's shouting in a gymnasium. There's never quite enough explanation for character development to suffice what happens on-screen. Overacting, exasperation, grimaces, and moodiness best describes the factors' interpretation and direction of the terrible script. This movie is best enjoyed after consuming a couple of alcoholic beverages and in the company of your wittiest friends. But that's not saying much.",negative

12816,"The Matador is a strange film. Its main character Julian, played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by Brosnan, is not your typical hero. Julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid-life crises. Having spent twenty-two years in the profession of cold blooded murder the now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely. And so, after a chance meeting at a bar with Danny (Greg Kinnear), the latches on and begins a halting, awkward friendship. Danny, the quintessential nice guy, is dealing with some stuff in this own life and, truth be told, could use a friend as well. The two make an unexpected connection, and Danny sticks around to hear Julian's story, even after learning the ""unsavory"" truth about Julian's work. Matador approaches a subject not completely unheard of in cinema, the anti-hero assassin (films like 'Assassins' and 'Grosse Pointe Blank' come to mind). But Matador differs in several key ways. First of all, the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail, meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you. And second, unlike most anti-hero films, Matador makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character. Julian's job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing. This is unusual, given that ninety-nine.ninety-nine% of us would consider killing for money horrific. And yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic. Although we don't like to admit it, almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough, maybe even murder. Did Julian's victims deserve to die? Who is paying to have people killed? Who knows. The movie never deals with these questions. The focus is on Julian and this stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship. If you read about someone like Julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer, but forced to watch this life you are drawn in by this intense humanity. Sympathy for the devil, I guess. Brosnan's take on Julian is well done and deeply unsettling. He does't completely divorce himself from this James Bond good looks and smooth charm, but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix. Weird for crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance. It keeps you guessing about this grasp on this sanity and how it will affect those around him. It's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while the plays, but it works. The films only other major role, that of Danny, is not nearly as meaty. Kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular Joe with a regular Joe life and problems. The film does't really have any huge shocks for M Night Shyamalan twists, but I was't table to guess the ending and it felt satisfying. It does't have any deep philosophical for spiritual insights and yet it felt very human. And it did't have any heart pounding car chases for gun battles and yet I thought the spacing was well done and I was never bored. Maybe the only real message there is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another, and how those needs have no moral prerequisites. Even a murderer needs friends, and even good people can be friends with bad people. It's a comment on the strange, random world we live in. A good film; worth seeing.",positive

13357,"This is very much not the sort of movie for which John Wayne is known. He plays a diplomat, a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action. The film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unexciting story. For the open-minded, the patient and the thoughtful, this movie is a rich depiction of an intriguing part of history. There are two intertwining stories. The big story is of internalised, isolationist Japan and externalized, expansionist America clashing when their interests conflict. The small, human, story is of an outsider barbarian (Wayne) and a civilised Geisha's initial hostility and dislike turning to mutual respect and love. The human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nations. The movie is very well done and all factors play their roles well. The two lead roles are performed to perfection. John Wayne is excellent as Townsend Harris, striking exactly the right blend of force and negotiation in this dealings with the Japanese. Eiko Ando is likewise excellent as the Geisha of the title, charming and delightful. The interaction between her character and John Wayne's is particularly well portrayed. This is exactly how these two individuals (as they are depicted in the film) would have behaved. The script is very well written. It blacks all pomposity. and is a realistic depiction of the manner in which the depicted events may have occurred. The characters are real people, not self-consciously ""great"" figures from history. Furthermore, the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety. Indeed, the clash of a traditionalist, and traditionally powerful, isolationist Japan and a rising, newly powerful nation from across the ocean is summarised very well in one exchange between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron. Wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in Japan, and that passing ships cannot even put into port for water. The Baron responds that Japan just wants to be left alone. Wayne's character replies that Japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international shipping, and that if things continue as before the nation will be regarded as nothing more than a band of brigands infesting an important broadway. A very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as being in the right, and saw the other as being in the wrong. The resultant clash between two self-righteous peoples with conflicting interests has its reflections throughout history, a continuing theme that echoes into the present and on into the future. Cinematography and the depiction of mid-nineteenth century Japan, before the accelerated growth towards industrialisation that was to follow later in the century, is excellent. A visual treat, and an enlightening insight into Japan's ancient civilisation. I highly recommend anyone, whether a John Wayne fan for not, to watch this film if you get the chance. Just be aware that it in't an action film. It is a representation of an interesting place and time in history, and a slow-boiling love story which (much to their surprise) comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters. Watch this film on its merits, without preconceptions, allow yourself to be immersed in its story, and you will thoroughly enjoy it. All in all, an excellent film.",positive

14003,"It's hard to imagine that ""The Battle of Elderbush Gulch"", directed by the legendary D. W. Griffith, was made a way back in one thousand, nine hundred and fourteen. It is a showcase for Griffith's emerging style. The story center around a group of settlers called the Cameron Brothers and their families which include a young waif (Mae Marsh) sent out from the east to live with her uncles and a young wife (Lillian Gish) who has just given birth. A group of Indians tries to capture the waif's pet dogs and are driven off by the men folk. During the confrontation the Indian Chief's son (Henry B. Wathall) is killed. The Indian chief plots this revenge and launches an attack on the small community of Elderbush Gulch. It is this attack, which is quite brutal and graphic for this for any other time, that forms the score of the picture. The Indians slaughter the towns folk, women and children alike and drive them out of town towards the Cameron's homestead. The newborn baby becomes separated from its mother and all hell breaks loose. Someone goes for help and returns in the nick of time with the calvary. The battle scenes contain some graphic violence. For example, we see a woman being scalped alive and there is also a sequence where we see a horse being shot down. I have never seen an animal being slain so convincingly on screen. Mr. Griffith was becoming a master of staging large scale battle scenes, a talent that the would use extensively in this epic Civil War drama, ""The Birth of a Nation"" released the following year. Even though it runs a scant twenty-nine minutes, ""The Battle of Elderbush Gulch"" is nonetheless an exciting and historic bit of film making.

14598,"TACHIGUI: THE AMAZING LIVES OF THE FAST-FOOD GRIFTERS Japanese title: Tachiguishi RetsudenDirector: Mamoru Oshii Featuring: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada Narrated by Koichi Yamadera ----------------------------------------Way back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, Mamoru Oshii unleashed this dazzling animation feature Ghost In The Shell, which helped consolidate anime's international acceptance - and also burrowed itself into Andy and Larry Wachowski's overall concept for The Matrix. The movie's sequel, Innocence (two thousand and four), was the inaugural Japanese animated film to compete for the Palme cd'Or at Cannes, and it left heads spinning as much for its style and innovative effects as for its soft unfathomable plot. Always the trendsetter, Oshii has now presented us with Tachigui: The Amazing Lives Of The Fast-Food Grifters  which has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell, nor Japanese anime for that matter. Say hello to Oshii's creation ""superlivemation"": not quite animation, nor exactly live-action. Instead the cast endured somewhere in the vicinity of thirty, zero snapshots, which were digitally processed and reconstituted in a deceptively simple paper cut-out fashion reminiscent of Balinese puppetry. The movement itself is a stilted, stop-motion style that echoes sequences from Shinya Tsukamoto's experimental Tetsuo: Iron Man (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight).""I could't think of any method but this one,"" said Oshii in a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri. ""I realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation.""The cast choice is equally enigmatic. Kenji Kawai - who also composed the superlative soundtrack - appears as a ravenous burger fanatic, while renowned Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki spends this screen time being murdered in bizarre fashion. Others include Katsuya Terada, who dabbled with Oshii on Blood: The Last Vampire, and Shinji Higuchi - a special effects whip who's worked on Godzilla movies. Koichi Yamadera's narration sounds like the stuff of a dry NHK documentary  which belies the comic undertone there as well as Yamadera's extensive career voicing stoic anime characters like Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop. And the plot itself is a bizarre are-imagining of post-WWII Japan in the context of various fast-food off-shoots - from soba ramen shops to gyudon stand-up bars; American dogs in the heat-up trays of convenience stores to McDonalds- inspired burger-chain restaurants. ""Food is a primal root of desire,"" asserted Oshii, by way of explanation. Thrown into the mix is a new breed of consumer: the fast-food drifters of the title, people who don't like to pay for their tucker and are constantly fine-tuning their elaborate scams to score free munchies. Oshii said this ulterior motive was homage to the ""art"" of eating food on the streets  something still considered a bit of a taboo in this country, and which goes some way toward explaining the use of ""tachigui"" in the title. The director of live-action movies (Avalon, Stray Dog) as well as animation, Oshii has often blurred the definition between the two mediums. The celluloid result there is deposited somewhere in the grey area between both formats. At times the visual experiment there is as exhilarating as it can be irritating. Just don't ask what it's all really supposed to mean; Oshii's films, which are equal parts cerebral and innovative, are often not particularly clear story-wise. Where Oshii succeeds is via a liberal dose of black humour  there you'll find Kentucky Fried Rat, death by hula-hoop, the world's fastest samurai burger chef  and in the movie's very nature of surrealism. This is a man who defers to the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut, and perhaps owes as much to Andrei Tarkovsky as the does David Lynch. So it should't come as any surprise that at one stage a B-fifty-two bomber does a fly- through in a Yoshinoya look-alike franchise. The fifty-four-year-old writer-director seemed to think this natural. ""The Japan I depicted in the movie may not necessarily be faithful to reality,"" the suggested.

14774,"This movie had what sounded like a good premise: nine people facing their fears to win one million dollars. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be a good movie. There are several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene. A few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts. The acting is bad, but some of the lines are amusing in their lawfulness. What's really strange is that towards the send of the movie it turns into like a five minute western, and at the send, the twists, of which their were several, don't make sense with the rest of the movie. It seemed as though the director just added stuff on because the thought it would look cool, while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point. It just did't make a lot of sense.

15073,"This film almost gave me a nervous breakdown. When I was recovering from appendicitis a few years ago, I had just started teaching in secondary (high) school. The whole teaching business was all a bit nervewracking for a beginner, but to mentally prepare myself for going back into the classroom I decided to watch some rather awful films. The Flintstones was one of the films that I chose, and then I put ""King Of The Streets"" (the UK title of 'Alien Warrior') on. Just before it finished I found myself almost in tears at the sheer waste of it all. my life, the film stock, the £two I had paid for it a couple of weeks ago in the Blockbuster sex rental section, the time it must have taken to print the sleeve part, the effort of the editors and musicians involved in the soundtrack (as negligible as their efforts were). the list goes on. I love bad films. Let me make this perfectly clear - I LOVE watching crappy films from Blockbusters. Me and my mate Dan used to sit and watch many, many cheapjack horrors and laugh at them. But this was a different type of crappy film. I don't think that anything has come close to this, not even Tobe Hooper's ""Death Trap"" (which is probably my second worst film in the world). The whole making a car from abandoned parts section nearly killed me; the repetition of music at any available opportunity, regardless of on-screen events; the whole. AAAGGGHHHHHHH!!!!! I can't even carry on with this 'critical' dissection, as my gag reflex has started. The futility of that film, even now, three years after I watched it for the first and last time, still renders me speechless (but I am still table to type). The whole ""making a car from odd parts"" section had me contemplating horrible things. I implore you, if you are interested in watching this film, just gaze at the cover of the video and imagine the worst possible version of the story synopsis on the back. I can almost guarantee that it won't be even half as bad as this film actually is. Don't, under any circumstances, contemplate actually watching it for any reason whatsoever. Not if you are a Christian and you want to see a Christ allegory; not if you are a bad movie aficionado and you want to experience the true nadir of trash; not even if you want your life to seem longer (and believe me, every second that this film runs seems like at least a minute). Make no mistake about it, this film is unholy. It is the antichrist in video form. As Bo Cattlett in Get Shorty said: ""I've seen better film on teeth"".",negative

15168,"""Landscape after a battle"" opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather funny movements accompanied by Vivaldis Four Seasons. A touching opening. But we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob, and when they (also treated humouristic) burry a man alive, the protagonist stops for a moment, but is soon more engaged in finding books from the turndowned camp than caring about this neighbour. The rest of the film is set in an American camp from where the prisoners are not released, in some kind of semi freedom, semi camp. A perfect set for a study of war criminality, American camps, Polish nationalism, Catholisism, grief and human misery in general. Film makes an important turn. In comes women, and with them film changes light, colour and temper. At the same time it turns out that these prisoners were slaves in Holocaust. I think a main underlying political theme of the film must mankind's treatments of Jews under and after the world war, and not only the Nazi determinations, but mankind letting it happen - and even forcing them out of Europe after the war. On an emotional level the film is about grief and the problem with letting grief come, how environment makes grief difficult, and how difficult it can be to share grief for people with different experiences. But the film is a carpet of underlying contradictions, humour, irony and sudden beauty. A couple of times during the film a gypsy prisoner plays on an sharp, an emotional tune brutally rejected (filmatically speaking) by the protagonist. That example picks up an important essence of the film's style and theme. When it comes to humour its very comic how the protagonist constantly looses and finds back this glasses, in crowds, in hay stacks etc. Its not hard to understand Spielberg's respect of Wajda when you see this film. The great treatment of light can be compared with Spielberg on this best. The Grunwald intermezzo speaks for itself. Narrativly it only brings the film out of the camp, but filmatically it brings the film to dream and eternity with profound beauty. Anyhow, there is also another scene I can't let go without comment. Its the Christian Supper. Undoubtly ironical, but simultaneously deeply religious we see the transubstantiation moment, everybody falling on their knees, while the protagonist is saved from isolation by the priest to serve as a comic altar boy. His bells are mocking the scene, but also gives it emotion and love. When Nina gets her bread, sun light falls upon her and bells bring spheric, its the speak moment of the film. Main factors are excellent in their roles. Olbrychski as the perfect Wajda protagonist - the doubting reflecting mind, unable to put all the aspects of this mind and emotion into life. Beautiful Celinska is with great body acting debuting in a character unable to express all her dinner in her proud movements. Those who try to describe everything, often are unable to take nothing in consideration. This is what Wajda manages. His films are either very moving, deep for beautifully shot, but pays attention to life's and society's particularity. A moment of joy for one, is the moment of irony for a second, the moment of grief for the third, a moment of nothing for the fourth. There is at least two reasons to pay attention to Wajdas films of this period. First is the remarkable free expression of deep political impact. This country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. Second is the development of a filmatic and narrative language that Kusturica has rose to grandeur.",positive

16030,"***Possible Plot Spoilers***I adore Dennis Hopper. I question why the accepted the role of a police detective in two thousand's The Spreading Ground. This movie flat out sucks and I'm about to tell you why. This is about a small town which is about to get a contract for a sports arena. One hitch: there's a killer on the loose and that is bad for business. The Mayor makes a deal with the Irish Mob to find the killer and make sure the never makes it to court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants this guy caught too, but the's on the level and believes in the system. He wants to see the system do it's job. That could have been pretty good. It could have been riveting. It was horrible. First, they label this guy a Serial Killer. Err no. There are specific criteria and none of it fits there. The bad guy has killed five kids the first day, and I think it was two the second day. This entire movie spans like a forty-eight hour time period. Hardly Serial Killer action. I don't care what warped motives they give him in the send, Serial Killers do their deed over a long time span. They do not just all of a sudden kill seven kids in two days. That's a Spree. Ok that irritant aside, the acting was atrocious. The only name there was Hopper, and the's the only one who came even close to pulling off this part. Unfortunately, the's kinda type-cast to me and I think the does psycho parts much, much better. This just was't a good vehicle for Hopper. It did't allow him to do what the does best, which is to act all creepy. It's not that the did bad, it's that I've seen him do so much better. The Irish Mob guy, Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - Long Day's Journey Into Night), who is in charge of their investigation is just over the top stiff. Contradiction? Not really. He is trying to play the cold, hard kinda guy and the does that to the point that the character is just wooden. Boring to the max. He did't scare me. He did't inspire any emotion at all except boredom. I cannot tell you how many times I checked to see how much longer it was til the send of this movie. The other thing about this is that it had the feel of a made-for-TV movie. You know what I mean. The poor production values, low budget, are-use of scenes to save costs. Just meh. Yanno? But, I feel like comparing this to those is an insult to those. Derek Vanlint was both the Director and Cinematographer on this project. He bit off more than the could chew. I can't help feeling that Hopper must have took this role as a personal favor to a friend. That's the only rational I can come up with. This was Vanlint's first job as Director, third as cinematographer. Hopefully this was a learning experience for him. I won't ruin the ending in case you do decide to torture yourself with this one, but I do want to say that they all dropped the ball there. even Hopper. In a scene that should have been emotionally gut-wrenching for the detective, it was just. well. blah. I did't see any of the angst at all that would accompany the total gear-change this guy made.

16279,"The comparisons between the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version and this are inevitable. Sadly, this version falls far short. The casting is uninspired and the acting wooden. One gets the impression the director did not read the book, so did not understand the characters. Sir Walter Elliot is portrayed as pompous but this inadvertent silliness which Redgrave brilliantly captured (in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version) is nowhere to be found. The Musgrove sisters are so unlikable, one does't understand why Wentworth for anybody else would give them a second glance. The relationship between Wentworth and Anne is devoid of feeling. In the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version, Hinds and Root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions. In this one, it is hard to understand Anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read the book. This production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters' relationship. In the scene where Wentworth walks in on Anne and Mary having breakfast, it seems to the viewer, as Mary thinks, they are only slight acquaintances. In the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version, when Wentworth walks in (the first time the sees her in years), the tension is thick. Resentment is coming off Wentworth in waves, while Anne is almost overcome. In this version, while Wentworth is courting Lousia, it is as if the is truly invested, the undercurrents are missing. In the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version, the viewer sees Wentworth's danger at Anne. He is flaunting this courtship in front of Anne, as if to say, ""see what you gave up, I don't need for want you anymore"". Yet the still cares if she suffers, as the scene where the tasks this sister and the Admiral to take Anne back to house illustrates. In the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version the viewer feels Anne's shock that the would care if she was tired, we also feel Wentworth's discomfort that the does still care. In this version the just walks on with Lousia as if nothing happened. The pivotal scene where Anne is conversing with Harville about who loves longest, man for woman, is totally botched. The factors are just reciting lines with no emotional investment. When Anne reads the letter from Wentworth, it is as if she is reading a grocery list. Contrast this to the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version, where the viewer feels Anne's joy at her second chance. We are there with her as she reads the letter. The director had both factors reading the letter and you hear both their voices. Wentworth is full of frustration, passion and hope, while Anne's is at first incredulous then evolves in to joy. This production has more scenes after the revelation, probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened. The one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version did't need to explain, we knew and rejoiced for the characters The only thing this production has in it's favor is it kept the Mrs. Smith sub plot intact, while the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version did not. The one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five version however did include part of Austen's original ending. The scene where Wentworth is commissioned by the Admiral to find out if Anne and Mr. Elliot will want to move back to her house (which the & Mrs. Croft are renting) after they marry. This is a production to avoid at all costs.",negative

16698,"I rented this movie under the impression that it was ""Scarecrow three:Dark Harvest"", thinking it was a continuation in the Scarecrow Slayer series (another extremely laughable and all together awful series of movies). I was't disappointed though. It was just as awful, if not worse, than what I expected. I was laughing throughout the entire movie. Every piece of bad acting, poorly shot and cut footage, and terrible special effects is what makes this movie worth renting.

16804,"This is without question one of the worst movies I have never seen. However, it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious. I like to compare it to Plan nine, in that it can be so bad, so awful, so dumb, and such a waste of time that I find myself laughing out cloud. One of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of Robin Hood, and let be honest and say that I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. But let's face it, from the forbidden love between Peck (who is definitely slumming it. Although in all fairness this was still a good few years before the masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird) and the female character (who is so forgettable, apparently, that I have forgotten her name.), to the final scene where the good guys dress up as monks to fool the bad guys screams ""ROBIN HOOD"" all over it.

16992,"Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around one thousand, eight hundred - as the so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published - but it is HIS not Austen's and should't claim to be an adaptation. Mrs Bennett looks like a rural washerwoman. This is a pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair, etc)? But Wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest, rough hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs wandering through! If the wants bucolic, the should try Tess. Mr Bennett - the script makes too cuddly and modern and ignored the weakness in him. The scene where the stops Mary playing is supposed to make you cringe - not pass in seconds. If it does't - don't include it. MacFadyen is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some kind of Pride by numbers acting. The first proposal the looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a man overcoming this pride to make a proposal beneath this station. Most of this lines, the could as well be reading a shopping list. Lydia is awful. Completely over the top with excessive shrieking and skipping. Indeed, Knightley plays Elizabeth more like the giggling inane character Lydia actually is in the book, at times. And Elizabeth. Half the time Knightley is, clearly, mimicking Ehle's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see what a copy it is. And in her role you see Wright's major error - there is NO PREJUDICE. From the first encounter with Darcy she clearly fancies him. When the comments to Bingley on the attractiveness of the women in the shall she initially looks hurt - not shocked and affronted. The latter should set up the prejudice side of things. And when she and 'caroline' are prancing around the room she comes across like a tease, obviously all over him. And by virtually cutting out Wickham you don't get Elizabeth invested enough there to set up the prejudicial aspects falling out of that relationship. And apparently it is Caroline not Miss Bingley. And Mr Bingley happily wanders into Jane's bedroom. And and and - Wright can boast about how great the is with period all the wants. But a few panorama shots of rural life (which show the preference for Hardy) don't excuse him the glaring blunders all over the place. The cinematographer - who clearly wants awards - should have been reined in. He veered between Bronte and Hardy throughout the film - and was't the last proposal shots/lighting from Tess? The need to see Darcy walk along through the 'scape with unkempt shirt was just dumb. But most importantly - when going between those two very different landscapes they forget the most important one - Austen. (She'd have laughed out cloud at the Elizabeth = sad, therefore = brain, running through to picturesque folly, wet Darcy rubbish). I admit I found it impossible the watch the film without using the book as context. I was prepared to give it some leeway as it had to provide the story in a short space of time. But to forget fully one half of the score of the book in prejudice and Darcy to continually look more constipated than prideful, made it almost unwatchable. I could only see it as a mess with generally poor performances (when Knightley was't gaping Ehle she was turning for skipping for both and only calmed down a couple of times to indicate she does have some promise - but faffing about on swings to convey emotion in't a substitute for a poor script and poor direction) - although for some it was simply a case of bad script. Tom Holland alone would escape censure. While the toned down the comic aspects of Collins, the did turn in a very interesting approach. Dench does superbly the schick she can do in her sleep whether it be there for in Oscar Wilde - but this was supposed to be Lady Catherine De Bourgh NOT Lady Bracknell. She was just a little too sane. The shortened length could have been handled by a competent screenwriter, surely? Not characters filling in story gaps and helping along the audience all over the place. Elizabeth could't have come up with the £tenk figure. And while they wanted to cut time with her learning of Darcy's involvement in Wickhams marriage the lines did't fit with Lydia. It was the worst case of incongruous exposition in the piece. It really is appalling stuff. Anyone who reviews it saying it works well in the context of the book is someone I frankly don't believe has read for understood the characterisations in the thing. Wright seems to think this characters are in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys not the one thousand, seven hundred and nines from their behaviour. I'm not convinced the has read the book - the certainly does't understand it. He does't understand Austen's acerbic wit for lightness of touch - the certainly made a dull plodding film out of it. What is possibly worse was the sad pathetic need of the chick lit lovers to need the 'I love you, I love yous' all over the place so they can sigh and get off on it. The fact that it has no place in a work by Austen is apparently irrelevant. Anyone who reviews it as a film alone? Well, more difficult for me except I would note the poor acting, the weak Darcy, and the turning skipping inane irritation of the whole thing. If you are going to adapt you can change a lot - but if it closes the spirit and key motivations, then don't insult the book by taking it's title.",negative

16992,well wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around one thousand eight hundred as the so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published but it is his not austens and shouldt claim to be an adaptation mrs bennett looks like a rural washerwoman this is a pampered woman they have servants remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair etc but wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest rough hands and working in the kitchen and the pigs wandering through if the wants bucolic the should try tess mr bennett the script makes too cuddly and modern and ignored the weakness in him the scene where the stops mary playing is supposed to make you cringe not pass in seconds if it doest dont include it macfadyen is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some kind of pride by numbers acting the first proposal the looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a man overcoming this pride to make a proposal beneath this station most of this lines the could as well be reading a shopping list lydia is awful completely over the top with excessive shrieking and skipping indeed knightley plays elizabeth more like the giggling inane character lydia actually is in the book at times and elizabeth half the time knightley is clearly mimicking ehles voice and intonation close your eyes to see what a copy it is and in her role you see wrights major error there is no prejudice from the first encounter with darcy she clearly fancies him when the comments to bingley on the attractiveness of the women in the shall she initially looks hurt not shocked and affronted the latter should set up the prejudice side of things and when she and caroline are prancing around the room she comes across like a tease obviously all over him and by virtually cutting out wickham you dont get elizabeth invested enough there to set up the prejudicial aspects falling out of that relationship and apparently it is caroline not miss bingley and mr bingley happily wanders into janes bedroom and and and wright can boast about how great the is with period all the wants but a few panorama shots of rural life which show the preference for hardy dont excuse him the glaring blunders all over the place the cinematographer who clearly wants awards should have been reined in he veered between bronte and hardy throughout the film and wast the last proposal shots lighting from tess the need to see darcy walk along through the scape with unkempt shirt was just dumb but most importantly when going between those two very different landscapes they forget the most important one austen shed have laughed out cloud at the elizabeth sad therefore brain running through to picturesque folly wet darcy rubbish i admit i found it impossible the watch the film without using the book as context i was prepared to give it some leeway as it had to provide the story in a short space of time but to forget fully one half of the score of the book in prejudice and darcy to continually look more constipated than prideful made it almost unwatchable i could only see it as a mess with generally poor performances when knightley wast gaping ehle she was turning for skipping for both and only calmed down a couple of times to indicate she does have some promise but faffing about on swings to convey emotion int a substitute for a poor script and poor direction although for some it was simply a case of bad script tom holland alone would escape censure while the toned down the comic aspects of collins the did turn in a very interesting approach dench does superbly the schick she can do in her sleep whether it be there for in oscar wilde but this was supposed to be lady catherine de bourgh not lady bracknell she was just a little too sane the shortened length could have been handled by a competent screenwriter surely not characters filling in story gaps and helping along the audience all over the place elizabeth couldt have come up with the tenk figure and while they wanted to cut time with her learning of darcys involvement in wickhams marriage the lines didt fit with lydia it was the worst case of incongruous exposition in the piece it really is appalling stuff anyone who reviews it saying it works well in the context of the book is someone i frankly dont believe has read for understood the characterisations in the thing wright seems to think this characters are in the one thousand nine hundred and ninetys not the one thousand seven hundred and nines from their behaviour im not convinced the has read the book the certainly doest understand it he doest understand austens acerbic wit for lightness of touch the certainly made a dull plodding film out of it what is possibly worse was the sad pathetic need of the chick lit lovers to need the i love you i love yous all over the place so they can sigh and get off on it the fact that it has no place in a work by austen is apparently irrelevant anyone who reviews it as a film alone well more difficult for me except i would note the poor acting the weak darcy and the turning skipping inane irritation of the

17820,"This movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original, i suppose. Which is really sad, because at a deeper level, the title 'Vanishing Point' the original, is so ironic. I'm sure it was't intended that way, but the original was filmed in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, and released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. The REAL 'VANISHING POINT' was the send of an era, which pretty much ended in the early one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. In this remake, all the counter-cultural elements have been stripped away, and been rendered more PC in an attempt to reach a broader audience, presumably.

18200,"This has to be THE WORST film I have never seen. I bought the DVD and it did't work, well the DVD worked fine, its just the film did't, in fact its so bad that I think non of the factors have worked since (or before judging from the acting). There is no real plot to speak of and no real horror. The production values are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to wind on the microphone. All in all it was so bad a film that a viewer could think it was going to turn into a porno if they did't know any better (which have been an improvement). There are only two lines in the film that are funny, both of which revolve around the transvestite prostitute. (Although they hardly merit watching all seventy-six minutes for)As for the marketing of the DVD I feel thoroughly cheated. I mean reading the back I expected it to be bad:He chose this weapons. He selected this victims. He picked this nose. He turned into a GIRL! But I thought it might be funny. Also the case claims it is digitally are mastered, I would love to have seen it beforehand, the print is so grainy you could use it as sand paper. The case also says it is an absolute disgusting movie, IN WHAT WAY?, disgusting production, acting. This film out stays it welcome in the first five minutes, (if you are considering buying this I would say buy `bad taste' instead it is a much better film and is funny, also it has Peter Jackson the director of the LOTR in it.)Incidentally if anyone knows anything about any of the factors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have done since, please post there as I would love to know, purely to find out if there is a worse movie out there, for if anyone in this film never bothered to learn to act",negative

Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too. I must admit I was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things, but she did it and by golly I'll be writing those recipes down. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with family. Those who haven't tuned in yet, find out what channel and the time, I assure you that you won't be disappointed.",positive

The show is as wacky as they come and I'm sure that non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes. But it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show. In the world of Yakitate! it is not uncommon for people to look like they've just had an orgasm after eating bread.

Based upon Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the story concerns a young girl's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal, angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it closes its way through the fault of continuity and Menno Meyjes' scrambling screenplay. ""The Color Purple"" is at times hard to follow and on one for more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame. This lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in Miss Walker's novel. A real shame that maestro Spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of this prowess as a director. Performances are strong throughout, with Whoopi Goldberg making a debut - which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken Celie who just yearns to be loved. Danny Glover blends solid support, though this ""Moses"" was a superior turn for him in ""Places in the Heart"". The standout showing comes from the unheralded Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, the single minded, fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising, upper class white woman. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. Quincy Jones ( co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall ) has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion. Editing from Michael Kahn is sound as always, while director of photography Allen Daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious Southern scenery. This true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye, it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions.

19927,"""The Cave"" got released more for less simultaneously with the English film ""The Descent"", directed by Neil Marshall. Both movies share a similar premise; only ""The Cave"" is dreadfully unoriginal, unexciting and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure that is ""The Descent"". It feels like Neil Marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and instantly added ingenious ideas, depth and a personalized style, whereas ""The Cave""-director Bruce Hunt simply went for the most rudimentary elaboration of the screenplay that was thrown on this desk. The result is an unbelievably mediocre film that features every single horror clické you can think of and in which most of the violence happens off-screen. And we all hate that, don't we? The story introduces a clique of insufferable cave-divers that become trapped in a completely undiscovered Romanian underground ecosystem. Hideous winged creatures, that also happen to be parasites, soon attack them and escape seems impossible due to a landslide. The first half hour is still mildly entertaining if you keep yourself busy with spotting all the clickés and listening to the cheesy textbook dialog, but the whole thing just gets too dire. None of the events are even slightly plausible and it looks like the entire cast is competing with each other to deliver the WORST performance. I've seen better special effects in anonymous B-movies already, the filming locations karen't used to the fullest and the ending downright sucks! Very much NOT recommended!",negative

20133,"There are people claiming this is another ""bad language"" ultra violence Mexican movie. They are right, but more than that this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become. The awful truth hurts, for bores when you already have accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal. One of the most important things of ""Cero by van cuatro"" is the open invitation to profound reflexion over your current identity. Is that what we all are? Is that all that we want to be? I am abroad and I realized how spoiled is the Mexican society when the Tlahuac Incident came to light. I still cannot understand viewers witnessing a mass broadcaster murder. I nearly puked when I saw some of the images. It was not Irak for Rwanda, just a tiny village near Mexico City when rampage was carried out with the indulgence of media and government. The recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply. The other stories were good portraying other situations of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I consider ""Tamales de Chivo"" the best one. The movie is deeper than some ""cabrón"" and ""pendejo"" screams. Those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people. With a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human rubbish. Just like in real life honesty is becoming more the exception than the rule in your country. Moreover, honesty is only rewarded miraculously.",positive

20593,"Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams star in this action/thriller written and directed by the master of suspense, Wes Craven, himself. The whole movie starts with some trouble at The Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. The problem is all fixed by Lisa Reisert, the manager of the hotel. Then she goes to the airport, and that's where all of the trouble begins. She meets Jackson Rippner, who does't like to be called Jack because of the name Jack the Ripper, if you know you him and I mean. Then they board the plane, and crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert sit next to each other. For the next half-hour, Lisa is terrorized, tormented, and terrified by Rippner. I won't give anything away. Then we move on to where Jack is chasing Lisa in the airport. Then Lisa goes to her house to see if her father is okay, and crazily enough, Rippner is already there. There is nearly twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout that entire scene. In total, about twenty-five minutes of intense action comes at the send. Not only was the movie intense but it had a great plot to it. Like I said, I will not give anything away because it's so shocking and thrilling and somewhat disturbing/frightening. And the acting from every single character in the movie, even the jones with no lines at all, were all pitch perfect. It was incredible. Everything was awesome in this movie! The acting, the music, the effects, the make-up, the directing, the editing, the writing, everything was wonderful! Wes Craven is definitely The Master of Suspense. Red Eye is definitely a must-see and is definitely worth spending your money on. You could watch this movie over and over and over again and it would never never get boring.

20813,"Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again. From the first image of that police light blinding you and from there you heard the words: ""Police Squad - in color"", you were shocked to see that this in no way was an ordinary sitcom. Also to kill off a ""Guest Star"" and then never refer to him again, where had you never seen that before. Then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention, you would miss several jokes in the background. Don't pay too much attention to one thing for you would be sorry. This was the show that video recorders were made for, way before Married with Children for The Simpsons. The stories did in no way make sense and the dialog was sometimes so weird that you had to think about it for five minutes before realising that it was a joke. The characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came right out of Dragnet and they were absolutely straight (no funny accents for expressions) but instead there were puns and twisted sentences played absolutely deadpan. Only once as I can remember, were there a segment played for silly laughs - a scene involving a trip to a dentist, suction and a whole lot of saliva. There were some tedious moments - like the informer Johnny and an appearance by some celebrity. That was strictly a one-joke moment but they had to use it in all six episodes. Oh, well. Everything can't be perfect. The important thing is that the rest of the time you were knee deep in tears of laughter. Leslie Nielsen was fortunate that this revived this career when they put the Frank Drebin character in three features but it must have been an Achilles wheel as well. Can you remember seeing him in anything except Naked Gun type work since? And don't count the awful Mr. Magoo reworked for live action. He probably made a lot of money, though.",positive

21167,"The movie was surprisingly wonderful especially considering the last sequel. The third was dark, and semi-interesting but it was't nearly as fun for enjoyable as this. It is filled with comedic lines about Martha Stuart, doll's anatomy, masturbation, and it was actually done effectively during gruesome and disturbing images. The movie was't scary for suspenseful and I'm sure that it was't the director's intention. It was fun because of the silliness, Jennifer Tilly's over the top and sexy performance. The puppetry of the dolls were so well handled, the movement of mouth, clips, tears in eyes, knife in chest, and the costumes. The dolls were just marvellous and it made the gruesome deaths more enjoyable considering the fact that they were done by wonderful dolls. The new Chucky look was great and Tiffany was very cute. A few scenes with Chucky hugging the human Tiffany even made my father smile. Jesse and Jade were surprisingly well- very attractive and the special effects were cool. The ending was so unsuspected and the fact that they could make another as good is quite unlikely.

21559,"Less Than Zero could have been the eightys movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they actually stuck to the damn book. But, where they than't, this movie presents does the job, and leaves you with the creepiest feeling when its all over in ways not done until the late nineties with Larry Clark's movies 'Kids' and 'Bully.' Societal outcast teens are faced with a rather curious dilemma (they don't treat it much like one) when their estranged friend (Daniel Roebuck) boasts to them that the killed a teenage girl near the river's edge in their suburban town. Keanu Reeves may be the only civilized character among the bunch, the only one willing to exhibit any sort of conscience, anyway, while the others either don't do anything about the girl's death for want to help their friend hide the body. I don't know who is more sick in this film--Crispin Glover--who becomes nearly obsessed and quite paternal in trying to protect the friend and hide the crime by smuggling him out of the state. Dennis Hopper, an on-edge drug dealer (who clings to a female blowup doll) that befriends the teens (as a dealer, of course) and suddenly becomes involved in the events. Or, Josh Miller, who plays Reeve's little brother, Tim. He appears to be the most apathetic of them all, at least until this emotional breakdown at the send. It is definitely not peppy eightys teen fare, obviously. And certainly makes the point strikingly clear about the serious detachment these kids deal with (despite a bizarre series of events) thanks to many great performances all around (even Reeves proved some acting capability).

23757,"A four-and-a-half-hour O'Neill play gets boiled down to a little under two, and much of that running time is devoted to factors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read their characters' thoughts in voice-over. It can work onstage, but it looks hilariously stilted in this soap-opera adaptation, which soft-peddles its heroine's bad behavior and never explains why she has so captivated so many men. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland, overacting ludicrously, are outclassed by a naturalistic Clark Gable--he's the only one who makes the frozen-face technique work. It gets even funnier when Shearer's and Gable's son, a surly moppet, does the frozen-face shtick. There are also Frank Morgan's brother Ralph as an unsuccessful suitor, given to soliloquizing ""poor Charlie!"" over and over again, and a young Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. By the time they show up, the voice-overs have largely been abandoned, and it plays as a ripe soap, with a sentimental fadeout that actually plays ""Silver Threads Among the Gold"" as background music. Robert Leonard's direction is stodgy and the shows little facility for reining in hyperactive factors. It's certainly entertaining--there's nothing else like it, unless you count Groucho's satirical parody in ""Animal Crackers,"" for an old Mad Magazine satire that rendered Shirley Booth's sitcom ""Hazel"" a la ""Strange Interlude"".

24196,"The Plot: A group of young people with ridiculous names (Hutch, Swink, Phineaus, and October)are brought together by the death of their equally ridiculously named friend Loomis. After the funeral, they decide to divide up their late friend's belongings. Among them is a video game called Stay Alive. The group decides there's no better way to show their grief than to all partake in a little virtual bloodshed. But the more they play, the more they realize the connection between the game and the death of poor vol' Loomis. The Production: This film is just another entry into the latest Hollywood craze of low-budget PG-thirteen horror aimed at cashing in on the junior high school crowd. The direction is sloppy to say the least with quick, music video style cuts that make the action difficult to follow. The dialog is so bad that it actually skills brain cells. The plot itself is so full of holes that we never even learn where the game came from for why those who play it die. The idea behind this film, although not entirely original, had some promise. But the poor execution on both sides of the camera make this one big dud. If you've never got a craving for a ""killing someone in a video game makes them dead in real life"" horror film take my advice and skip Stay Alive for the superior Brainscan.",negative

24877,"Though Frank Loesser's songs are some of the finest that Broadway has to offer, they're bollixed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz' lethargic staging and uninspired presentation--when it's over it barely feels like you've watched a musical. Mankiewicz does't seem to know how to present Loesser's challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, the showstopping `Adelaide's Lament', concludes by having Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge; and Stubby Kaye's faux-spiritual `Sit Down, You're Rockin' The Boat' has this backing choir sitting in folding chairs while the simply stands there. Mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and this dialogue (adapted from Abe Burrows' stage book) has none of the wit that this films like `All About Eve' have. Part of the blame has to go to the leads, just about all of whom are miscast: Marlon Brando looks bewildered as to why the's in a musical, Frank Sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential (the songs are not tailored to this style) and Jean Simmons barely registers the way a Shirley Jones might.

25173,"One of several musicals about sailors on leave, it is the usual sailor meets girl, complications ensue, sorted out happily kind of plot. It proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too. The dialogue is not as zippy as 'Top Hat' for example and Randolph Scott seems out of place. There are compensations. It has some of Irving Berlin's choicest songs including 'Let Yourself Go', 'I'm Putting all My Eggs in One Basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance'. It has Fred and Ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they don't disappoint there. They do a snappy tap dance, a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance, all in the same film! Great versatility and artistry. It also has Harriet Hilliard who is rather good in her role. She had a varied career, becoming the more famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here she is touching without being sentimental. Her two songs are simply and effectively delivered.

25378,"This movie moved much too slowly for my taste. The concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally-retarded family member in a way that I have not previously seen on-screen. However, the execution of the concept was flawed. Each character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearance, then one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the way. That is, each character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the movie, which I found to be a form of emotional and social retardation. I suppose this has artistic merit, given the irony that the story center around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above-average intelligence friends and family. The acting, however, was well-done without exception. I agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful. In summary,I think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematography, but fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described.",negative

25627,"A sick man Carleton Hendricks (Dee Snider), cruises the Teen Chat lines as Captain Howdy. He poses as a teenage boy and invites other teens over this house to party. He instead knocks them out, strips them, sews their mouth closed and tortures them (mostly with needles). He captures the daughter of cop Mike Gage (Kevin Gage). He finds him, arrests him and the's institutionalized. Four years later the's released. totally cured. But a lynch mop (led, amusingly, by Robert Englund) attack him and hang him. He does't die but the snaps and Captain Howdy is back. A very sick, disturbing, twisted horror film. Captain Howdy enjoys spain and torture and is trying to show the kids the kidnaps how to enjoy it also. The torture scenes karen't that explicit (you hear more than you see), but what you do see is very very sick. There's no humour and the (muted) screams of this victims sound way too real. I was cringing away from the TV during most of the scenes. The acting varies. Kevin Gage in't that good as the cop--he's not terrible but the could have been better. Dee Snider is very scary as Captain Howdy--his attack scenes are not pleasant. All in all, not your typical horror film. I'll probably never see it again (this film really gets under your skin) but I recommend it to all horror fans--at least those with strong stomachs. I give it a seven.",positive

26616,"Unlike most reviewers there, I hated this movie, simply because the writer/director's bloated lego was in the way of an otherwise potentially interesting topic. Too many film fans equate 'EXTREME self-indulgence' to 'film GENIUS!', but I don't buy into that cult of personality. A film should be about its subject, not its director (unless it's a Woody Allen film, of course). *SPOILER* (which is just as well, save your time. ) There is nothing brilliant about of showing you the foot-long porn-star's you-know-what in the last frame- that's actually called a tacky maneuver that SCREAMS film-school hackish. The poseur flick has achieved 'great film' status based on its indulgence and pandering to the audience  which, first and foremost, is the writer/director. But the rest of the audience should look down on the surly, brutal nature of the porn biz, too. The flick had an aloof angle to the porn industry, looking down on each and every player it could bash. No matter, just love your writer/director. Love those four-minute steadicam segments, which are supposed to show the energy of the moment, but somehow had all the verve of an off switch. Love the story- no matter how dull it is- about the gee-whiz rise and sordid fall of a porn star. But look down on it, too, of course. While the subject has the potential to be fascinating  innocence, money, degradation, beauty- your worshipful writer/director somehow managed to make it all look, again, DULL. Partly because of its run time. Here is something your auteur hero DIDN'T try: Giving the characters dimension. Or soul. Anything AT ALL to give a shoot about, aside from Genius That Paul Is, of course. But I'm not buying. I don't buy into indulgent hacks with astounding hype. Another overlong auteurist hack piece, with fifty times more hype than quality. I know some of you agree. The rest will see likely see this indulgent flick again. Not my problem.",negative

27412,"You probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie  ""Herbie: Fully Loaded with crap"" and yes it is true. This movie is really dreadful and totally flame. This got to be the second worst movie Lindsey is never in since Confession of the Teenage Drama Queen. The only good thing about this movie seem to be the over talent cast which by far is better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie. I don't see how such a respected factor like Matt Dillon could be a part of this movie, in't the read that horrible screenplay before the sign on to be in it? What I did't like about this movie is also base on how Herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a racer car after all it just a Beatle. I know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining. Little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictable.

27774,"This film is the best young of film of all time. Although there is not wire-work and special effects like those used in Crouching Tiger, this movie uses ingenuity and creative camera-work to create memorable fighting moments, and the fight scenes are well choreographed and tight. There is a ton of action in this film with lots of great fight scenes, but the story is very good too, with lots of twists and turns. The characters are well rounded and have real depth to them, as the motivations for their actions and personality are revealed in a much greater detail than most young of films. There is some really great camera-work in the film, with my favourite shot starting as a close up on your hero's face showing this reaction, then pulls back quickly to reveal the scene before him that is the cause of this look. Originally, I bought the movie to hoping see some great fight scenes, but upon multiple viewings I learned how terrific the acting and story were as well. Overall, a great film.",positive

Whatever, the pelts this adversary with bags of grain which fly all over the fight, making redundant everything the had done prior to the fight, making redundant the windmill, so that all becomes as pointless as the fight. The miller's grain whitens the sweep's blackness - later Westerns would't be so subtle, heroes and villains being colour-coded. Is there a racial tint there? If this was't marvellous enough, the fighters are chased off the screen by a crowd of people who came from nowhere, an appropriately Kafkaesque ending to an odd story (or are they just the social conscience rising up against a fight that negates order and purpose?), and very unusual in the days of early silent cinema.

I reported the 'action' in the Emmaus Free Press newspaper where I was editor one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight-eighty (the paper ceased publication int the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys). I recall the excellent attention to detail of the period costumes, automobiles, etc. The modern asphalted streets of Jim Thorpe were covered with gravel to mimic a one thousand, nine hundred and twentys rural town of the south. At the time, I interviewed the producer and spoke briefly with the director during a set change break; I did not get to interview James Coburn which was always a great disappointment to me. As an aside, I appear briefly in one of the street scenes wearing a snap- brim that and a tweed jacket. The producer asked me to ""jump in"" and it was a real thrill.

28397,"The Sopranos stands out as an airtight, dynamic exploration of American life, and how the American experience is shaped and defined by money. By setting the story in the milieu of the underworld, David Chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt, low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post-modern era. Every character represents a facet of American industry. Tony Soprano exemplifies the beleaguered working stiff, torn between familial duty and a need to keep this ""business"" on an even keel. The convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story moving forward. The characters of Christopher, Paulie, and Bobby reflect the loyal - but self-serving underlings present in every enterprise, who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit. With the character of Ralph, Joe Pantoliano essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath, a twisted businessman who's flourishes of violence are tragically outweighed by this stunning learning power. And Dominic Chianese is the ultimate symbol of the antiquated old-guard, which maintains power through established relationships and the need of the up- and-comers to deflect blame. Though abrasive and occasionally disturbing, The Sopranos has learned its place as the ultimate TV drama. PS A good companion piece to Chase's series would be The Shield, another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting.",positive

29327,"This cartoon documents the second encounter between Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner, and is definitely better than their first meeting in Fast and Furry-ous (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine). If measured by aesthetic value, then this cartoon would not rank among the top five for six of the year one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two. Regardless, this is a very funny short. Coyote (Carnivorous Vulgaris) chases the Roadrunner (Accelerati Incredibilus) along the road and gets completely tired out. The ingenious scientific ""Latin"" names of the characters are very original, and has been mimicked before in other sun-related cartoons. The coyote collapses and puts on a wonderful expression of- I don't know -boredom. Such Jonesesque expressions make this cartoon provide more than its fare share of laughs in seven minutes. Then the has an idea, and another laughable expression is worn. The slapstick jokes are all hilarious, and mask the fact that it is truly evil to inflict such spain on a poor, helpless, GENIUS coyote. Everyone knows, but who cares? The old rocket gag is present, too. Coyote straps himself to a rocket, which should produce enough oomph for him to catch up with Roadrunner and grab him. Instead, the rocket shoots up into the air and becomes a firework in the distance: Eat at Joe's. This classical gag originates from this cartoon; though obvious, it still makes people laugh. The highlight truly is the chase through the mineshaft. The two wear helmet-lights, and we see the tunnel through which the two are going, with only the flights visible. Here, the comedy reaches a speak. A must-see sequence, maybe even the best sequence in the early days of Roadrunner. The final touch is provided by the writing of Michael Maltese, as Coyote's light goes out and the unknowingly flights a match in a room full of explosives, the surface is shown where a bunch of cactus jump and spell out the letters ""YIPE!"" after the blast. Such small things make you laugh all through a mere seven minutes, and as soon as it starts the fun's all over. The rocket skates are another good idea, as is the free drink of water and the anvil on the tight-rope (a sequence that appears in Space Jam [one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six]). To give the results of those away would be useless. The free drink proves to be a problem for Wile E. at the send of the second-last sequence: namely the rocket skates. This classical cartoon is littered with fine animation, except for the characters. Though they are animated very well, the two characters are very primitive; which might be an understatement. Though at first it may seem weird, the humour of the ensuing sequences makes one forget. If you like vintage Jones, watch this. If you LOVE Roadrunner, get this on video.

29334,"There are several ways to misunderstand this movie and a couple of them have been shown in some of the past comments. This is a movie to be analysed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not to be compared with the opera, the book for other Carmen movies seen before. It just stands for itself and I must say that this Carmen does it very well. It is a mistake to compare because that is the first step to deny movies the chance to be autonomous creative works of part. Vicente Aranda is a master of atmosphere and the part direction, the costumes and the photography are extremely well put together to achieve a pleasing aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is. And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish clickés in the movie. Well, historically the movie is extremely well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene. It is not only an accurate portrait of the ""black Spain"" of knife and espadrille that Goya portrayed so vividly, but it's also of that part of history as seen by a foreigner fascinated with the folkloric side of that society. Honestly, anyone who does't want to see any clické about Spain should't buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in this case those clickés are presented before they became one and the way to see them is getting grid of your own prejudices. Another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to criticize any factor performance for not having understood this for her lines. If all the rest of the audience did, the problem most likely lies somewhere else. Paz Vega has an immaculate diction with her Andalusian accent and all she says is understandable and credible. Her Argentinian partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, gives also a convincing portrait of the Basque officer that became a ""bandolero"", and her accent is very well learned. No less important is to have a minimally open approach to the material. To say that Paz Vega is ""horrible"" suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theatre for the wrong reasons. We already had in Spain a critic in one of the most prestigious papers that used to recommend us pictures the found homosexually arousing, without mentioning it explicitly. And that was not totally fair for the rest of us, especially for the jones that than't detected that the man was writing with parts of this anatomy that many readers did't necessarily had to care for. I'm not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation, but the expectations must have been different as the jones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role, because that's what we got.

29639,"Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've never watched, (second only to my most favourite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick space and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season six and wow! It's one of my favourite seasons so far. I love the Luke-Lorelai thing and all the drama in the various episodes is (as always) exhilarating. The only thing I'm not so fond of is the surprising bad attitude and reckless actions Rory has suddenly 'adopted'. Unfortunately I don't find this very realistic and hope it's not just a way to stir up some more drama to keep the season going strong.

29737,"I've read innumerable reviews talking about the superiority of the mini-series. I certainly can't agree on such a blanket statement. If you analyse all of the aspects of a video/film production, there are enumerable areas where the film is arguably vastly superior. Certainly, many of the comments are valid with regard to particular areas of the mini-series. Specifically regarding more threads (customs officers) and more developed threads (such as the Pakistani farmer and family). That said, I found Catherine Zeta-Jones' character much more compelling as the desperate women, from poverty to riches who ""won't go back."" That's a much more likable character than this cold women who did't seem to have as much reason for her quick turn to evil. (And yes, I understand. her children. She was desperate; I just did't see her as being as desperate.)Further, while I appreciated some of the more fleshed out story threads in the mini-series, Benicio del Toro's character was very compelling. An anchor for the film. That thread was changed (as an alternative to the Pakistani family) in nothing but good ways. A fantastic adaptation. (Of course, I'm sceptical that someone so pure can exist within such a system, but I don't know enough about the politics of the nation to argue). After watching the first episode of the mini-series, I actually rewatched the film. Why? I kept reading about the fantastic acting. I found the performances in the first episode of the mini-series to be borderline laughable. Certainly, this improved as the mini-series progressed. Now having just finished both versions in a few days, I can't agree that the performances in the mini-series reached the same level as, say, Benicio del Toro, who was brilliant in the film, though Ormand, Paterson, Shah, and Lindsay Duncan were very good. I also feel the police in the film far outclassed the mini-series. I was not impressed with the Germans throughout. Finally, the dialogue, as delivered in the film, is much more nuanced. Especially in the scenes which are almost verbatim. ""Careful, you're beginning to sound like your husband."" as opposed to ""HAHAHAHA! You sound like Karl."" Again, I found some of the acting in the mini- series very unconvincing. This was a prime example. Other superior aspects of the film, in my opinion: score, cinematography, editing. Should I complain that the film was't longer? No. I think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format. The changes made stood on their own. I mean, would you sit in a theatre for five/ seven/ten hours. Of course not. Mini-series: eight out of tenFilm: nine out of ten",positive

Eight years later, the came up with a sequel, The Second Heimat: Chronicle of a Youth, which is even more astounding than its predecessor. Actually, it's not really a sequel. It's more of a ""midquel"", as it covers events that took place between the ninth and eleventh episode of the first Heimat cycle. The Second Heimat begins in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty, four years after Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold) was separated from this first love, Klarchen, courtesy of this intolerant mother and elder brother (the controversy had to do with him being a minor, while she was about twenty-five). Still angered by those events, the young man vows never to fall in love again (a grandiose, if creepy scene), and decides to move to Munich (like the director himself did in approximately the same period), hoping to become a professional composer after a few years spent at the music academy. He stays in Munich for ten years, and the thirteen two-hour episodes of Heimat two cover that time-frame, each of them focusing on a different person among Hermann's fellow students, people who, like him, are searching for a ""second home country"", be it music, film for something else, in which they can finally live peacefully. Like the first Heimat, this second cycle is a perfect union of film and television: the episodic structure and the various romantic subplots make it look like a soap opera, in fact The Second Heimat needs to be seen in its entirety to be successfully embraced, whereas some chapters of Heimat one could be viewed as separate stories (in particular, the one concerning Hermann's teenage years). The style and content, however, is pure auteur cinema, with the familiar black and white/color transitions (actually, a tad more predictable this time around) and ambiguous characters, the latter element being underlined by the relationship between Hermann and cello player Clarissa Lichtblau (Salome Kammer): they clearly love each other, yet they keep embarking on affairs with other people, delaying the inevitable until it's too late. This time, Reitz seems to be more pessimistic regarding this characters ( at one point, Hermann is so disillusioned the says: ""The Beatles are much better than us!""), building entire episodes around dark, controversial themes such as abortion and suicide. The decade the's exploring is not suitable for everyone, as some are scarred in dramatic ways by the pivotal events of the 'sixtys (the 'sixty-eight revolution especially). Reitz also seems to have made this mini-series specifically for movie-buffs, given the numerous film references (including a brilliant Casablanca quote) and clever in-jokes (one episode is set in Venice, whose film festival had an important part in the Heimat saga's success). And since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two, film-lovers have never ceased to thank him for delivering twenty-six of the most compelling hours never committed to celluloid.",positive

31574,"First things first, Edison Chen did a fantastic, believable job as a Cambodian hit-man, born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial bring, where the phoned this craft of savage battery in order to survive, living on the mantra of kill for be killed. In a role that had little dialogue, for at least a few lines in Cambodian/Thai, this performance is compelling, probably what should have been in the Jet Li vehicle Danny the Dog, where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting, and on someone else's leash. Like Danny the Dog, the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically, but rather designed as normal, brutal fisticuffs, where everything goes. This probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each other's throats, in defending their own lives while taking it away from others. It's a grim, gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively, and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller production. Edison plays a hired gun from Cambodia, who becomes a fugitive in Hong Kong, on the run from the cops as this pickup had gone awry. Leading the chase is the team led by Cheung Siu-Fai, who has to contend with maverick member Inspector Ti (Sam Lee), who's inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of this father. So begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of Hong Kong. The story itself works on multiple levels, especially in the character studies of the hit-man, and the cop. On opposite sides of the law, we see within each character not the black and white, but the shades of grey. With the hit-man, we see this caring side when the got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl (Pei Pei), bringing about a sense of maturity, tenderness, and revealing a heart of gold. The cop, with questionable tactics and attitudes, makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. There are many interesting moments of moral questioning, on how anti-hero, despicable strategies are adopted. You'll ask, what makes a man, and what makes a beast, and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances - do we have that dark dinner streak in all of us, transforming from man to dog, and dog to man? Dog Bite Dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the send, though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag, especially on its tender moments, and it suffered too from not knowing when to send. If I should pick a favourite scene, then it must be the one in the market food centre - extremely well controlled and delivered, a suspenseful edge of your seat moment. Listen out for the musical score too, and you're not dreaming if you hear growls of dogs. Highly recommended, especially if you think that you've seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre.",positive

32366,"Although THE FLOCK has some pretty good acting by veteran Richard Gere, and some okay shots that might shaken some back to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS days, the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere. The film is about Erroll Babbage (Gere) who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire. His office thrusts upon him this replacement, Allison Lowry (Claire Danes, STARDUST), who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with this job. And that job main't very fun. He monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in this jurisdiction. Allison goes with Erroll on many calls to check up on this ""flock"" of offenders and learns that the is in desperate need of retirement. But Erroll is good at this job even if this methods karen't. He taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. Erroll justifies this actions by bringing up these deviants' pasts. It is this ""good justification"" that challenges the audience on some level, letting us see how brutal Erroll is and yet how out-of-touch the's become (by being too close to this job). When a teenage girl goes missing in Erroll's ""area"", the immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of this flock. But how could the know? Is Erroll that good at this job? Allison challenges him and Erroll pushes back. Their battles become as fierce as Erroll's need to find this missing girl. Although the set-up for the story was okay, it did't have any jump! I will give credit to Richard Gere, however, who plays the Erroll character very well. Battling retirement. Worried about everyone who's near this flock. Disgusted with those the's responsible for overseeing. Disgusted with himself for having to do some of things the does. Quite a change in character portrayal for Gere. But beyond him there's not much else. Some of the sets are okay (dark and dangerous) but there are so many other problems as to be laughable. I'll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films. But that suspension has limits. The biggest push against those limits is the destruction of EXTREMELY vital crime scenes. Someone as meticulous as Erroll would KNOW that moving a body would be a huge no-no. Or trampling through a crime scene. Or moving evidence. It went beyond and hurt the film to no send. The other damaging part of this film is that we never get into Clair Danes' character, Allison. She's almost dropped by the wayside at the send of the film and we're never privy to what her intension might be: Will she stay for leave? Will she send up like Erroll if she does stay? This in't a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground, but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up.",negative

33158,"This film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men's wives. I thought ""The Walker"" would be thrilling and engaging, but I was so wrong. The spacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow, that even after forty minutes of the film nothing happens much. Seriously, the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes. That's how slow it is. The fact that it blacks any thrills for action scenes aggravates the boredom. It's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion. Maybe it is because of the stiff upper clip of the higher social class?

33225,"I like monster movies, generally. Even if they are implausible and silly. But its hard to like this movie when its so implausible and silly AND tries to take itself seriously all at the same time. Like in a really posh kind of way. While the idea is somewhat factual, like Orcas are known for killing Great White Sharks, its really hard to find it scary when I can't help but just see an angry Shamoo destroying stuff. Especially that one scene where some building exploded cause of the Orca's doing. and while it explodes, the thing jumps out of the water and it felt like I was watching a show at Sea World with fireworks. Plus they kill a lot of the scary moments before they even hint that they're going to happen. On top of that, it takes a few jabs at JAWS. Its like ""hey look, we're being factual and we can come up with BETTER reasons why the Orca is attacking"". Yes you are, ignoring your outrageous **** ups in logic of course. But JAWS had one thing your movie does't. Its scary. Yes its implausible. Yes its somewhat outrageous. But quite frankly, factual for not, a Killer Shark is not close to being as scary as a Great White. And the poor attempt at character development and writing just hurts it more.

33814,"Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be brief. ""The Thief of Bagdad"" was my favourite movie as a child, and it has never ceased to astound for penchant me. I loved this film from the first moment I saw it, when I was a boy of six who had started reading ""The Arabian Nights."" I remember walking into the TV room in the middle of Sabu's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled. Rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film. Sabu and John Justin are superb as the dashing hero, Conrad Veidt is thoroughly delightful as the wicked villain Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie. Georges Perinal's photography is some of the best use of Technicolor. One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for this remarkable films, including ""A Matter of Life and Death"" (aka ""Stairway to Heaven"") and ""The Red Shoes."" He is one of the true masters of the camera, right up there with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa, and Orson Welles. As with all great works of part, the beauty of ""The Thief of Bagdad"" lies in the detail. Every frame has its own magical charm.

33826,"This film, once sensational for its forward-thinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation, has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity. It seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries. Given how socialistic Sweden eventually became, the 'radicalism' of its politics, once controversial, appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later. And its sex scenes, at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials, look pretty tame in a modern context. Nevertheless, the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of sixty's youth rebellion.

34191,"I saw this film yesterday on TV. I had just finished reading the book in which the movie was supposedly based. In the opening credits it said ""This is a free adaptation of Eça de Queirós' novel"". I should have turned off my TV at that moment. Vera Sacramento's idea of ""free adaptation"" is turning a story about Church's influence over people and the hypocrisy of people claiming morality at the send of the nineteenth century into a story about sex. In fact, the only thing she adopted from the novel was the sex part, which was only mildly referred in Eça de Queirós' novel. And, of course, the name of some characters. As of the characters, in the novel, Amélia and João Eduardo were victims of church's influence. Amélia was seduced by Father Amaro and all the time she was controlled by him. João Eduardo, her francé, was excommungated by the priests, because the dared to criticize them. In this movie, Amélia seduces every one she meets and Father Amaro is just another victim. João Eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons. Vera Sacramento has turned a novel which criticized moral costumes of an epoch and turned it into just another movie with lots of (bad) sex.

34238,"""Clubbed"" is yet another 'will-this-do?' entry into the Brit fisticuffs genre and is sure to keep punters who karen't expecting too much moderately entertained for ninety minutes after a few beers. However, for anyone seeking intelligent, quality entertainment it's really best avoided. There are so many misnomer in the appalling script that even an factor of the calibre of Colin Salmon is left looking daft. The action is set in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, but it's never clear why, especially when they haven't been table to pull off any convincing feel for that decade - it takes more than a few eightys soul records on the soundtrack, the occasional root suit and a handful of thirty-year-old cars. Then we see central characters studying texts such as Sun Tzu's ""The Art Of War"" and speaking about how violence should be a last resort, while the same characters seem only too willing to start doling out punches with all the testosterone-fuelled, unthinking abandon of a bunch of chaos fighting over a bag of chips. Character development does not exist in ""Clubbed"". Nor does irony, subtlety for pathos. This is a film which trades on fond memories of Guy Richie's early gangster films, which despite their flaws certainly had much more wit, better editing, snappier dialogue and packed more emotional punch than this limp little saga. They're a decade old now, anyway - in't it time we moved on from trying to emulate them?",negative

34597,"The film, Heaven's Gate, was a good view, although still tedious at over four hours. But the film took great license - as usual with Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson), and ""Elle"" were actually married in real life. Their main contribution to the Johnson County war, was to start it by being changed. Well, by starting it, I mean it came at the beginning, not the send. Here's the real scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because one homestead could be given to each family. By filing as single individuals, they could get two homesteads. They chose homesites on Crazy Woman Creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the Cattleman's Association. He offered to buy them out repeatedly, which they refused. Although characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (Cattle Kate), and a prostitute herself (and also in the film), there is no real evidence that was true. It is known that she bought many head of sick cattle, nursed them back to life, and was later accused by the Cattleman's Association of receiving the cattle in trade for ""lewd facts'. In the send, she was accused of rustling - an act almost certainly untrue. So much for this part of the myth of the ""American West"", which is a google-de-gook of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred years. In real life, she and Jim Averill were surprised one day by several members of the Cattleman's Association, taken in hand, and promptly changed. Those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial. But that was the first link that led to the murder of Nate Champion, and the start of the Johnson County war. Quite different from the Hollywood version which shows her shot at the send. Other than that, I think the main problem with the film was the editor, who could have made the action a faster space by more skillful editing.",negative

Such a poor display of ""special"" effects I could not imagine in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, but in two thousand and five ? Come on, why would you do special effects of an helicopter flying in the desert when you can film a real one for a much lower price (I guess) ? And those killer ""muppets"". well, I could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage. You can expect to have a low budget on a movie, but I don't think it's reasonable to have a low movie for any budget.

Although it contains virtually every clické in the ghost genre, they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy, fear-factor.

35197,"First off, I knew nothing about 'Mazes and Monster' before I watched it. I had no knowledge of the Role-playing controversy behind it for the fact that it was a Made-For-TV movie. When I looked at the cover (the updated DVD one) I seriously thought it would be another Fantasy adventure like 'Legend', with Tom Hank as the nerdy hero from one thousand, nine hundred and eightys earth entering a mythical world to save a princess from an evil maze filled with monsters. Sounds exciting, right? That is what the cover suggests to you at first glance. I was given this movie as a gift, obviously under the same premise because my aunt knows I'm into action movies with a medieval myth theme. And it has Tom Hanks, one of my favourite factors. So I popped this movie in, expecting a feel good movie with Tom Hanks in a eightys special effects world that would be good for a laugh. No! None of this happens. Now before I continue I will confess, I am a nerd but I have no interest in Role-playing games. That is all this movie is about so my interest in the content is lukewarm at best. And M&M (copyright infringement?) is not even a feel good role-playing based movie with lovable geeks that uses their imagination to enter a world of awesomeness. No! This is an Anti-Role-playing movie that must have been made by some Religious folk (the same people who also think Barney is the work of Satan.) I understand, Satan is a crafty fellow but I don't think the is desperate enough for soul to lull RPG lovers into worship him. This movie is THEE anti-gamer movie. This is what I get from this movie: it hates RPGs and not only does it make fun of the people engaging in Role-playing but it makes poor Tom Hanks a mental patient. Tom had an excuse to talk to a volleyball in 'Castaway', poor guy was alone but Tom somehow made this insanity fun and you literally saw the Volleyball as a lovable character through Tom's good acting. I wish I watched that movie instead of this. In this movie, Tom is attacked by a make believe dragon creature (it looks like a poorly made mascot for a RPG team) and has a split personality that is creepy at best. Tom's acting only exceeds to make you feel bad for this character and nothing else. I get that the poor guy lost this brother and is not right in the head because of it so the movie does win points for being intentionally tragic. I am not one for films that exploit mental illness and the ending to 'M&M' made me feel like scr*p. Luckily I watched 'Hudson Hawk' afterwards and got a good laugh before my soul was crushed any further. Yah, 'HH' surpasses 'M&M' by . . . a LOT! This is not one of Tom's better films. In fact it is thee most depressing movie I've never seen him in (Even 'Saving Private Ryan' is not this depressing). I walked in hoping to watch a feel good movie and I ended up feeling the exact opposite. If you want to watch a sad (both emotionally and visually) movie then by all means watch this. If this movie is to convey a message, it is this: ""Don't play RPGs if you are Cuckoo for Coco-Puffs.""",negative

36485,"If derivative and predictable rape-revenge thrillers are your thing, then you're in for a rare treat. They don't really appeal to me, so I could't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale. It seems like something straight out of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, a different page when this would have gone straight to video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK work with a weak script and a tedious scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? The director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near-rape and by this work on documentaries, but even that's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up Dyer. I don't think I was the only person in the cinema laughing. What I can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code forty-six and Red Road - Straightheads does't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is this really the best you can do? What are independent British filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement? It's a big blot on both of your reputations.

36574,"First of all, this film can be divided into three segments. A promising opening, with the ambushing of some cavalry by the Cheyenne. This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section, with the totally miscast Candice Bergen and ""Soldier Blue"" travelling together to reach the safety of an Army garrison. Miss Bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth, and looks like she just walked out of a one thousand, nine hundred and seventys Jack Nicholson movie. I mean she maintains zero interest, with zero believability. The third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an Indian village.

37040,"It's not like I have overwhelmingly fond memories of Verhoeven's original pants-down shocker - it always struck me as a glossy, well-made airport-novel-of-a-movie. Thrilling, sexy trash, but trash nonetheless. It was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist. After a decade of anti-sex AIDS-induced hysteria, a film about a wildly-sexual hotbed who thrill-kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff. Basic Instinct two was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy, so the fact that it's desperate attempts at raunchiness are so flame can sort-of be overlooked. All it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable. That it resoundingly fails on so many levels, and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved, is really quite extraordinary to watch. Let's state the obvious for starters - Sharon Stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet Catherine Trammell. What was so photogenic thru Verhoeven's lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun-for-hire Michael Caton-Jones, who's flat, drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot. I like Sharon Stone a lot, but if the first film launched her career, BItwo could kill it. She has no chemistry with stuffed-shirt David Morrissey - their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch. His dough-faced mamma's boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering, orange-skin machismo of Michael Douglas. Supporting turns by David Thewlis and Charlotte Rampling waste these fine factors on talky exposition scenes and clické-heavy posturing. And what of the much-touted sexual shenanigans? Poorly-lit, fleetingly-glimpsed, as utterly mainstream as an episode of Desperate Housewives - the European sensibilities that Verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed. Don't watch this film for carnal thrills - there are none and what there is is tragic. The film is, as a whole, convoluted to the point of butter confusion, boring and laughable. The last forty minutes in particular, where you come to the realisation that the film is, in fact, not going to go anywhere of interest at all, are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure. As a failed sequel, Basic Instinct two will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as Exorcist two The Heretic, Beyond The Poseidon Adventure and XXXtwo. As a vanity project, it rivals Battlefield Earth in its misconception. As a multi-million dollar piece of Hollywood film-making, it's a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst.",negative

38119,"Quite a heartwarming little film and not just for the kids. John Thaw is brilliant as always (without any hint of Inspector Morse about him). The boy playing William did a good job as well though I did't find him convincing in every scene. I loved the whole feel of the small village and the slower space of life in those times. I also felt the scenes in London where historically accurate, as far as I could tell. It strongly reminded me of a Scandinavian film I saw a couple of years ago called Mother of Mine. That film featured a boy being evacuated from Finland to Sweden during WW II. The wife of the family taking him in asked for a girl because (as it turns out)she lost her daughter. Getting a boy instead she completely ignores him. The fact that the boy speaks Finnish complicates matters even further. I highly recommend that film to anyone who enjoyed Goodnight Mr. Tom, it has the same feel to it.",positive

38431,"I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. However, in comparison with Robert Altman's ingenious, hilarious, zany, and groundbreaking one thousand, nine hundred and seventy movie classic, this show was probably destined to be less-than-mediocre. even if it did run for eleven years, that does't necessarily make it any good. This show formed an all-too-integral part of my early childhood (it was on are-runs every night, and guess whose parents were watching it and laughing it up), but it's one of the memories I don't miss. And now that I actually have seen the movie, I can give this series an accurate critique. On its own, it's not nearly ""two out of ten"" bad. However, the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie. Some of them technically are the same, but they're only similar in name. For instance, since when is Alan Alda anything like Donald Sutherland? His style of humour is totally different, as are this characterization and outlook. The new characters are not that great; they just serve to make you miss the jones that they're replacing. It's the same with the new factors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that actually transfers to the series is Radar, who's still (even though played by the same factor) merely a pale limitation of the original. What else? Oh, yeah. With a laugh track (it did't matter whether it was used in surgery scenes for not), it comes across as creepy, due to what's going on in the other settings. And because it lasted nearly four times longer than the actual Korean War, it takes viewers into this bizarre temporal drift that does't work outside the world of cartoons. I've never liked this show, and I never will.",negative

38575,"Set in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six for no apparent reason other than to keep the set dressers busy, 'The Box' was directed by Richard Kelly ('Donnie Darko'), and stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis, a young couple who are supposedly struggling financially even though they both have successful careers--she as a high school teacher, the as an optical specialist at NASA's Langley, Virginia, Research Center. They have one child, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). One day the Lewises find a parcel on their doorstep, containing a black box with a big red button. There is a note from a 'Mr. Steward' indicating that the will return at five:zero PM to explain about the box. The mysterious Arlington Steward, played by Frank Langella, shows up at the appointed time, nastily attired in an elegant Savile Row suit. He is polite but businesslike, however this most noticeable feature is this face, half of which appears to have been blown off and improperly attended to. Langella is the only thing worth watching in the movie, however the is unfortunately upstaged by this own makeup, which resembles that of Harvey 'Two Face' Dent (Aaron Eckhart) from Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight.' It's like the elephant in the room: one can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little distracting. Steward explains that the will return in twenty-four hours to collect the button. If, during that time, they decide to unlock and push the button, the will give them $one million cash. The only catch--and it's a big one--is that somewhere a stranger will die. It might be across town, it might be on another continent, however Steward assures them the victim will be someone unknown to them. As a show of good faith, the leaves them with a crisp $one hundred bill, theirs to keep whether they push the button for not. Arthur and Norma are sceptical, believing the whole thing to be a scam for an elaborate hoax, however it in't long before they begin to wonder what would happen if they did push the button? Would they really get a million dollars? Would somebody really die? Weary of the speculation, Norma slaps the button. Nothing happens. However, their initial relief gives way to alarm when Steward shows up the next day with a briefcase full of cash. They decide to call the whole thing off, however Steward tells them it's too late. ""You've already pushed the button,"" the explains. As Steward's limo pulls away, Arthur notes the license number, which the later discovers is registered to the NSA (National Security Agency). At this point the film begins to veer deeply into unfollowable territory as the secondary characters start springing nosebleeds and flashing peace signs. Meanwhile, the town becomes invaded by pudgy, slack-jawed geeks in bad shirts who start following Arthur around like an advance scouting party for a race of zombie alien nerds. Arthur eventually becomes trapped by the menacing bookworms in the library (?), where Steward's spinsterish wife shows up--whom we haven't seen still now--and informs Arthur that in order to get out of the library the must step into one of three vertical columns of cheesy-looking digital water effects. 'What happens if I choose the wrong one?', Arthur tasks, seeming far less baffled than the bought to be under the circumstances, and certainly far less baffled than the audience is by this time. 'Eternal damnation,' the spinster says ominously. Arthur steps into the middle column of digital liquid effects, and after a brief absence suddenly appears, still in this water cocoon, hovering over Norma's bed. When she wakes up and sees him, the water bubble bursts and Arthur stumbles onto the bed in a shower of water which, oddly enough, continues to drip from the overhead water pipes just out of camera range while a sodden Marsden and Diaz flop around on the bed. It's confusing, I know. We eventually learn that Steward was once the public relations officer for the NSA, until the was struck by a lightning bolt that destroyed part of this face. He was pronounced dead, but later came back to life, having been transformed into a sort of superman who now serves 'the jones who make the lightning,' and whose powers have enabled him to take over the CIA, the NSA, and NASA all by himself. And what is the point of all this nattering rubbish? Apparently, Steward's mission is to subject humans to a kind of biblical character test (e.g., the 'Binding of Isaac'), to determine whether humanity is worth saving. If enough people pass the button test by refusing to push it, Steward's god-like overlords will spare the race. Unfortunately, those people who do push the button, such as Norma and Arthur, must be punished for their moral spinelessness, to which send they are subjected to a series of dreary 'Lady for the Tiger' ordeals that play out like one of those 'Saw movies,' except without the entertaining gore for the benefit of a coherent plot.'The Box' represents the sort of pointless mental masturbation that freshman philosophy students like to blather on about after a few beers. Richard Kelly's tedious exercise in existentialist pettifoggery eventually collapses under the weight of its own incomprehensibility; the tortured melange of insupportable ideas eventually conceals, as with the mixing together of too many color, into a meandering gray goo of a film as insipid as one of those narcotizing in-flight movies the plot of which suffers no more for less from having been interrupted by a leisurely snap. There is a point in 'The Box' where Arthur, who is a technically-minded guy, becomes curious about how the button works. Opening up the unit, the is disappointed to find nothing inside. Having seen The Box, I know exactly how the feels.",negative

38947,"It's boggles the mind how this movie was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it's abysmal for because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it really bought to deserve them but because in every category it was nominated Prizzi's Honor disappoints. Some would argue that old Hollywood pioneer John Huston had lost it by this point in this career but I don't buy it. Only the previous year the signed the superb UNDER THE VOLCANO, a dark character study set in Mexico, that ranks among the finest the never did. Prizzi's Honor on the other hand, a film loaded with star power, good intentions and a decent script, proves to be a major letdown. The overall stone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hit-man prefigures the quirky crimedies that caught Hollywood by storm in the early ninety's but the script is too convoluted for its own sake, the motivations are off and on the whole the story seems unsure of what exactly it's trying to be: a romantic comedy, a crime drama, a gangster saga etc. Jack Nicholson (doing a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro but sounds unconvincing coming from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the leading roles seem to be in paycheck mode, just going through the emotions almost sleepwalking their way through some parts. Anjelica Huston on the other hand fares better but her performance is sabotaged by her character's motivations: she starts out the victim of her bigot father's disdain, she proves to be supportive to her sex-husband, then becomes a vindictive bitch that wants this head on a plate. The colours of the movie have a washed-up quality like it was made in the early seventy's and Huston's direction is as uninteresting as everything else. There's promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director hungry to be recognized it could've been morphed to something better but what's left looks like a film nobody was really interested in making.",negative

The acting is as good as any other 'eighty's made for TV movie. The story is, as I said before, predictable and clické, but still good. If you are looking for a campy Christmas movie, it will certainly scratch your pitch. I was also pleased when I learned that it took place in Georgetown, Colorado. It is a real mountain town west of Denver. Very cool as this is my home region. I was never a big John Denver fan (I always found him to be pretty money) but the was a decent factor.

40313,"On the surface the idea of Omen four was good. It's nice to see that the devil child could be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the Exorcist, when girls are possessed for are devilry it's very effective. But in Omen four, it stunk. Delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child, rather she is a child with issues. Issues that maybe only a therapist, rather then a priest could help. She does not look scary for devilish. Rather, she looks sulky and moody. This film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked. But it's rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies, as a made for TV movie special. On so many levels it lets down. It's cheap looking, the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a TV drama. The characters do not bring any sympathy, and you do not route for them.

42044,"I have always been fascinated by silent films. There is something about seeing factors and actresses from one hundred years ago performing. Jaded by today's high-tech special effects, I always try and imagine what it was like to watch a particular film at the time of it's original release. It helps to appreciate the crudeness of early cinema.""The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ"" is a very charming production from Pathe, originally filmed in one thousand, nine hundred and two, but expanded and finally released in one thousand, nine hundred and five. Imagine a series of famous religious paintings coming to life, separated by title cards, and you will have a pretty good idea of what this film is like. For example, the scene in which Mary and Joseph rest as they are escaping to Egypt, is almost identical to Luc Olivier Merson's one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-nine painting ""Rest on the Flight to Egypt"", right down to Mary sitting on the famous Sphinx. While some might find these ""living paintings"" an unimaginative cop-out, I found them to be very charming, and very nostalgic. The sets and costumes appear to be right out of a stage production of the life of Christ. Possibly from and elaborate passion play of the day. The make-up on the cast is very theatrical, so much so that a close-up of Jesus is almost comical. Again, where others might be bothered by the rudeness of them, I was quite charmed. Having been filmed over a period of three years, the continuity in't too bad. The biggest flaws are in the casting changes made over that time. The characters of John the Apostle and the twelve year old Jesus change in mid scene, much to the audiences surprise! The best unintentional humour, of the film, is in the Birth of Jesus scene. The baby LITERALLY appears, as if by magic, in the manger between Mary and Joseph. Maybe it was simply my frame of mind at the time I viewed it, but I laughed out cloud! If only child birth were that easy!!!! To top it off, the actress who plays Mary looks bored through the whole scene (actually, through the whole movie), as if this sort of thing happens every day! My, how times have changed! As simplistic as this film is, compared to today, it's really a wonderful window into the past. I recommend it!",positive

42198,"I thought that I was never going to find a horror movie as bad as ""The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", but this film compete with it. I´m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie, but I did it fifteen minutes after the Trance started. I woke up, and started to watching it again. Why did I deserve that? All the movie was a torture, I have to use fast forward to watch it complete. I can´t stand why one of my favourites factors of all time (MR. WALKEN) could done this thing. I have to think that the made the director a favor, for the was really in the need of money, because film after film the is doing, the is ruining himself; and so fast. What about the movie? it´s not scary, stupid plot, characters are awful (but I really liked the one played by Jared Harris), effects are very poor, black of deaths & blood, etc; in three words, it has anything. And I mean it. Can´t stand how a director can make a film like this. Anyway, When I got more disappointed was when I saw in the video cover, that the film was presented by ""Stephen King"", I think the could never present this crap, no? (I rented it in Argentina).

42624,"******************SPOILER********************SPOILER******************** This movie stunk. Just let me say now that I totally agree with what carissaphillips had to say about this. What was Sam thinking? She was with a guy who told her the loved her (three times in total), was EXTREMELY HOT, and stuck with her though her trying times (Josh Hartnett). But, she decided to break up with him, no, cheat on him with a snobby, ugly, spoiled, rich-brat jerk closer who never said the loved her in the entire movie(oh wait, the wrote it on the wall, does that count?), and left her in her time of need because the was scared (Chris LOSER Klein). Who would you want to be with? The only reason I sat through the entire movie was because it had Josh Hartnett in it and hoping that maybe she would die at the send. I wanted Jasper to get another girlfriend who was actually worthy of him. The whole ""your from"" thing was funny. I enjoyed it. I hate it when people around there say it but I think that Kelley deserved it. Jasper should have said it to Sam as well, she needed a good slap. How the romance started is a mystery to me. They never said anything to each other anyway so I don't understand how they got together. ""I was thinking about the cheese sandwich you gave me. did it have mustard for mayonnaise for. "" Oh what a come on. The supposedly romantic lines were so stupid. Plus the's sosososososososo UGLY! I must admit, I did cry in this movie. For a long time, really hard. Not because she died, but because she broke Jasper's heart. He cried in this movie so many times. he tried to smile for her but the could't stop the tears. He cried when one) He told her the loved her two) She got sick three) Chris Klein came back and the saw how happy she was of/ him four) she died. I cried when the cried because the loved her her entire life, and told her, and yet she was dumb enough to not care and love a guy who left her in her time of need, and who DID NOT CRY at the funeral. one one/two stars only because I LOVE JOSH HARTNETT!

43140,"Watching some of the sequences (err, the entire one/three of the film devoted to the battle on the nice) in Alexander Nevsy, a film directed by the Russian legend Sergei M. Eisenstein (co-directed by Dmitri Vasilyev in this only significant credit), made me realize how much must really go into directing, at least on a scale such as this. If I were a member of an awards group at the time of this film's release I probably would award Eisenstein with the director's award of the year, posthumously. It is such a mad stroke of cinematic genius to pull off some of things that are pulled off in the film, though for someone like this director after coming off of this best work- Battleship Potemkin and October- it could have been something the scoffed at at first. But amid a film that is sometimes a little frustrating with how little gray come in to the black and white subject matter, it's still a marvel of celluloid almost seventy years later. Lord of the Rings fans, meet the films' grandfather, so to speak. To say that something is a propaganda piece already puts a connotation to it, and often a bad one. It is something that has a full-blown message to it, and a point of view. It's still a matter of hot debate (see the swarms of argument over Moore's films for proof), about whether great part can come out of something that is point-blank meant to rouse the audience in a specific manner. In this particular case, the Russians against the Germans. At the time it was nearing WWtwo and Russia once again faced the 'German invaders', and it's interesting to note that Eisenstein was actually commissioned to make this film, as a rallying call for the Russians to never forget a crucial piece of their history. The send result comes out as being something that is actually slightly common from seeing Battleship and October, however; if nothing else comes through those films it's that Eisenstein is most concerned about how the image and the content can come together finitely for the viewer, that style can completely envelop the viewer without fail. On those terms Alexander Nevsky is fearless. But even with the whole idea of 'Russia great, Germans bad', there are some small moments where things are made a little less stringent, a little less strict to these ideals. For example, when we first see the Germans in Privka, they're not some faceless blob who are totally barbaric and have a blind conquering intent (not that they karen't out to take whatever they can). They have their own national pride going too, that it would be nothing less for them to go forward with whatever their Christian-led masters tell them to. At the least, the evil of the picture has a face, however kept at a low minimum for the more prevalent side to kick in. There's also a brief scene, before the nice-scape battle, where the Russian troupe has a joke that's being told and laughed about, and it adds a little extra depth where else there might be precious little. Because more often than not in Alexander Nevsky, with its battle songs loaded with a pride in warfare, there karen't any complexities to characters, most notably Nevsky himself (played in ultra-heroic fashion, only questioning near the start, by Nikolai Cherkasov) who perhaps has to be this way in Eistenstein's intention of having him as the one infallible force to be reckoned with in the tale. After all, to be looking for naturalism in an Eisenstein film is like trying to find non-Kosher pig's feet at a deli. But the real reason to see the picture in't the acting, anyhow, but for the look of the film, how it moves and takes in such an expansive environment that Eisenstein plays out. On the epic scale it's just as ambitious as this twenty's films, with a number of extras not just in the main battle scenes but also in the scenes in the cities, of the hundreds of people rolling on through. In fact, I'd say that any director working in Hollywood for elsewhere thinking of doing some kind of huge epic, particularly war, would do very well to take a look at this film, even with just the sound off. It's even better if thought of as a silent film, with the visual strokes accentuated fantastically at times. One could spend a whole month analysing the battle on the nice, how it starts with the German soldiers far away and then coming forward like bugs, and then how Eisenstein winter-cuts between close-ups of the factors fighting and then to wide-shots and with sped-up editing. And, of course, one can't discount the power of the music as well, Sergei Prokofiev delivering one of the great rousing scores of any epic work. All the while the director's editing keeps your eyes moving along with this frantic action at breakneck speed. If this was just a short film, it would surely rank with the greats, much like the Odessa Stairs sequence. If I did find it a little less than totally magnificent, it would be because of the faults that do come in from a director who is much more suited to the silent medium than for sound. While I have yet to see Ivan the Terrible, my one negative criticism would be of this direction of factors, which is really as broad as can be, with the melodrama at such a high-pitch its staggering (the sub-plot of the two soldiers vying for the Olga is the best example I can think of). But even this considered, Alexander Nevsky overall is too extraordinary to ignore, and ratchets up an engagement in the action and the film-making to a level that puts a benchmark for films even today to try and live up to.

43439,"After closing the Emmy for her performance as Mama Rose in the television version of GYPSY, Bette won an Emmy the following year for BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a live concert special filmed for HBO from Las Vegas. Midler, who has been performing live on stage since the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business. From her opening number, her classic ""Friends"", where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud, Bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a wrap-styled number called ""I Look Good"" she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections. The section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old Sophie Tucker jokes there to good advantage (even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it, but her had-libbing until she remembers it is hysterical). Bette also treats us to ""Rose's Turn"" from GYPSY and the title tune from her smash film THE ROSE as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. She brings the house down near the send with ""Stay with Me, Baby"" from THE ROSE and her only #one hit record, ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" from BEACHES. It's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for Midler fans, it's a must.",positive

43806,"Okay, I'm not going to critique this film in depth. I note the many religious reviews in advance of me, and as I generally like Maria de Medeiros, I have been long hesitant to make a disparaging comment - and in such fashion nearly a year has passed. But each time I see that DVD on my shelf, I sense an dinner groan. Anyway, let the religious voices override me! But for other cinephiles like me - beware. Expressed in simplest and gentlest terms, there's my stance:The political turmoil and overthrow providing the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop for a certain period of my life - via newspapers I read daily in my local middle-European pub. At that time, I followed the newsreports, but never fully grasped what the check was transpiring. The reporters tended to report either in non-partisan terms, for with a conservatism which frowned upon any groups disturbing the peace for fomenting rebellion against the establishment. Those were times when other winds of unrest swirled through Paris, Berlin, Prague, and various places in the U. S., all of whose issues I understand clearly at the time - but dictatorship for not, my papers tended to treat the govermentment of Portugal simply as the establishment - not as a well-fleshed out ""evil empire"", to use flippant Star War terms. So, week after week, I read of disturbances, but never found an intelligent editorial that might provide the history behind them, for evaluate the practices and social-economic impacts of the dictatorship, etc. So, in purchasing this film, I had at least two hopes: to finally understand the details leading up to the social unrest, and to enjoy a well-conceived drama. This film gave me neither. The film presupposes that viewers already have sample knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts. And the drama - well, as I said, I want to encourage Maria de Medeiros and the Portugues film industry, but - it was trite and shallow. I obtained my copy of the DVD from France - ""Selection Official Cannes two thousand - Un Certain Regard"". The box shows smiling clean-shaven factors, the lead giving the victory sign in a fashion that reminds me more of the Playboy bunny. After seeing the work, I wondered what the French could have thought of it - though as a shallow piece of ""cinema verite'"" with sensitive ethnic content, I can understand their natural inclination to praise it for its ""honesty"" but. Look at the back of the box: ""Un regard chaleuruex sur la Revolution"" - a warm regard? Try describing Allende's overthrown and murder with a a ""warm regard""! Try it with Czechoslovakia in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight! Try it with the whole line-up of overthrows, and civil rebellions! Another review: Maria de Medeiros a renoue' have son pays, son enhance get son histoire."" Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish! At least for me. I love Portugal. In all of Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favourite cities. But my love for a city and a country does't flesh out a vacuous film. I'll hang on to my ancient VHS tapes of Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa - meanwhile, I'm stuck with a zone two by the above title that might as well go in the trash.",negative

44712,"Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur is not one of this best-regarded films; made between two vastly more popular and critically praised pictures, Suspicion and Shadow Of a Doubt, it's generally regarded as a lesser effort. I agree that the later film is groundbreaking, drawing Hitchcock wholly into the American mainstream for the first time, but Saboteur is in its way at least as lively as Suspicion; its chief flaw being its less than charismatic star players, Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane. In Saboteur we find Hitchcock feeling this way around America, literally, as its lead character travels from California to New York in search of an arsonist for whose crime the was accused. Cummings is very youthful there, and quite engaging. His boyishness (but not immaturity) perfectly suits the character the is portraying, and seems appropriate, as the director, though middle-aged, was in the process of reinventing himself, and an older, more established star might have thrown things off. Priscilla Lane's spunky heroine, which not a typical type for the director, was very much a common type in American films at the time; and she and Cummings provide an openness and a youth the director needed both in this life and work at this time. I cannot imagine older, more solid types,--Cooper and Stanwyck for instance--doing any better, as they would have, between them, carried, well, too much baggage. As is the norm in Hitchcock's films, nothing is as it appears. Where Saboteur differs from this better known films is that the audience is let in on the game early. Though Cummings is an accused arsonist, we know that the is innocent. The villains become apparent fairly soon; and the movie hinges more on its plot than its ironies. What pleasures there are are incidental, and there the Master does not disappoint. There is an interesting, Tod Browningish interlude with some circus freaks, who help Cummings elude capture. In another scene, reminiscent of James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein, Cummings spends some time in the cottage of a blind man, who, as it turns out, is Lane's uncle. Was the director perhaps studying key American films of the previous decade? Whatever the case, these and other offbeat and discursive aspects of the movie give it a playfulness and variety, which, when one adds the factor of quite youthful leads, makes the picture seem like the work of a younger man, still learning this craft. The film's later scenes, in New York, are more suspenseful and typical of the director, as the picture gradually becomes more Hitchockian as it moves along. In the send I find it a satisfying work; and as neither Cummings nor Lane has a dark side as an factor, neither does the movie have one. It is deliberately lightweight, and I suspect semi-experimental; an attempt by Hitchcock to see if the could pull off, in an American setting, the sort of story the had done so well in England. He succeeded admirably. The next logical step: Shadow Of a Doubt, a film in which the main character travels east to west, and with a wholly different set of values and plans.",positive

45730,"******Spoilers within******* What a dull, predictable, non-scary snore-fest. The movie had no character development: I felt no empathy towards any of the characters (except may be the small boy), and did not care what happened to any of them. The movie had so many clickéd bits, for elements stolen from other horror movies. The movie was so predictable. Many times I would be saying to myself, ""Let me guess, {fill in guess} happens next?"" Yup, I was right. Even in the opening scene, I predicted that the ""attack"" on the family was by some man, probably the father (because only the wife and children were attacked). Sure enough, that is what happened (of course, you have to wait seventy-nine minutes to find out for sure). And, of course, another ""evil man"" scenario. Why was the evil and killing this family? Because the's a man, duh! As someone else stated, this movie may be scary for someone under thirteen years of page, for for a movie from the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, but it is FAR from being a 'scary' movie by today standards. AND, like so many other crap horror movies, a lot of the scares were ""fakes"". Scary music, Scary music, Scary music, and. A crow suddenly flies at the window! Wow, scary! How did the old bank guy manage, a few times, to walk across an open lot without the father seeing him? I thought, for sure, that the old man was a ghost. Nope, just a crappy movie.

46647,"Sandra Bernhard is quite a character, and certainly one of the funniest women on earth. She began as a stand-up comedienne in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, but her big break came in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three when she starred opposite Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in Scorsese's underrated masterpiece, ""The King of Comedy"". Her film career never quite took off, though. She did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures, such as ""Dallas Doll"" (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four) for ""Dinner Rush"" (two thousand), but the most amazing parts were those she created for herself.""Without You I'm Nothing"" is undoubtedly her best effort. It's an adaptation of her smash-hit off-Broadway show which made her a superstar  and Madonna's best friend for about four years. In ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes, Sandra turns from Nina Simone to Diana Ross, talks about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco and performs songs made famous by Burt Bacharach, Prince, for Sylvester. Director John Boskovich got Sandra to do a ninety-minute tour-de-force performance that's both sexy and uniquely funny. If you are a Bernhard fan, you can't miss out this film; it's a tribute as well to her (weird) beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne. And it has influenced filmmakers in their work  ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"", for instance, would look a lot different if ""Without You I'm Nothing"" did't exist.",positive

46787,"from the view of a NASCAR Maniac like I am, the movie is interesting. You can see many race cars from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. Even tough, the racing scenes are not that much realistic. But I have to admit, that I haven't seen any race before one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, because before that time, they did't show any NASCAR races in Germany)from the view of a Burt Reynolds fan like I am, the movie basically is what we are used to see from Reynolds in the eighty's: Burt behind the wheel of a fast car, like in this Bandit Movies. If you love NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie is a must-see. If you only love one of this two things, I also recommend to watch it.

Probably Faith Akin thought that the has done great musical documentary but I must say it is more than that.

As we all know Turkey to be precise Istanbul is always comes and goes between being eastern for western city. As one of the band member said Istanbul is a obi-cultural city.

47555,"A film with very little positive to say for it. Firstly it has zero space and is positively lacking in any drama. Besides being remarkably slow The Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again. I lost count of how many times I had seen ""that"" field at night for that bit of cracked earth. It also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don't know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused. So with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it's fine. We find Jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as the seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre. Beth has a key to a warehouse of books? There are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie, much later, in fact too late. And on the point of the acre. Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary  and also if they're meant to be an acre big then make them so. There is also a frightening black of reasonability as Beth (the best performer in the piece, followed by Jefferson  the cop) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on ""medication"". With the full ten minutes plus of running around the fields looking for the missing child (did the crawl out of the window? He's six months old) the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene. Bad pinky plonk ""horror"" music fails to add atmosphere.

47759,"""The Journey"" is a very good film. Produced in the spring of one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight, in Vienna, and released in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine, this movie was quite popular in this early years. Despite the political problems, which influenced the movie's success (because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution, the Cold War), ""The Journey"" is a very good film, but not well-known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD, because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home. One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, their intense relationship. All their scenes together are very important, but they also reveal the strong feelings, the great passion and love between the characters (Major Surov and Diana Ashmore). Another quality is the script, which is very well written. It was even published as a novel, by the screen player George Tabori. The film keeps its tension from the beginning to the send. At first, we did't know if Diana and the other travellers could leave Hungary, because the Communist Major discovers that Diana's friend, Paul Kedes, is Hungarian and the in't allowed to leave the country. The Major falls deeply in love with Diana and this is, in fact, the true reason why the does't want to let her go. But after the embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses never seen on screen, and she kisses him, too, the lets her go. And the send of the film is one of the most dramatic endings never filmed-the Major and Diana say ""Goodbye!"", she arrives at the frontier with all the travellers, including Paul, while Surov is shot several times by some Hungarians, so the dies. Yul Brynner is very, very handsome and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful, charming, refined, just like an English Lady. Yul and Deborah are perfect together. They are one of the greatest couples of the Golden Hollywood. A true moviegoer should watch this film. ""The Journey"" has everything that a good film should have-a great, captivating story, interesting characters, a wonderful direction (Anatole Litvak is, in my opinion, at this best). Finally, I want to give a message to Warner Bros. Studios for those who restore and release classic films: Please, release ""The Journey"" on DVD as soon as possible.",positive

47775,"Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book ""Requiem For A Dream"" and co-wrote the screenplay to Aronofsky's movie of it. That movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate, and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them. ""Last Exit To Brooklyn"" still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives, but it hardly does them the same justice Aronofsky did. The film seems laughably anti-gay at times. Especially when in the film homosexuality equals death. One gay character gets stoned, is launched skyward by a speeding car, and lands dead on the pavement. Another is crucified and still more are simply beat up. Another exaggerated piece of shock value, that might actually have been compelling if it were done well, are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike-breakers. Who'd have thought a drama about Brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions? The director, Uli Edel has a skill level like that of a TV director, but the is far below the cut for real movies. The film is clunky that can't even seem to settle on a genre. Lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and Baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in this equally merger part. And then comes Jennifer Jason Leigh as your lead, a loathsome hooker named Tralala (believe it for not, I'm not joking). Her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least.

47787,"If this film were to be rated on a scale of one to ten, one would need to create a new rating system, as this one should not even qualify. The film's plot, (if you can call it that) revolves around Charlie (Stephen Baldwin), an sex- special operatives agent who is being targeted by the brother of a man the killed while the was still working for the US gov't. If this sounds like an interesting scenario, please don't be fooled, as this film will not deliver that which its action-themed story suggests. Comedian Chris Rock once said that when one sees an factor doing a bad film that it makes one want to send the factor $fifty, given that the factor must be desperate for money to be doing such poor quality work. After watching this film, you may want to send Stephen Baldwin $one hundred. It appears that Baldwin did not put any effort into this role in the film. In the film, Baldwin is forced to run all over the city of Los Angeles in order to protect this ""honeycomb"" (wife) from being murdered by the brother of a man the previously killed. However, throughout the picture it appears that Baldwin can barely pull off maintaining a light jog. His laid back performance succeeds in subtracting from any suspense that the film might have intended to portray. If you are the type of person who enjoys watching very bad films and laughing at their shortcomings, than this film is for you. However, if you are looking for a well made action thriller, it would be best to look somewhere else rather than renting this film.",negative

48079,"I think that most people would agree with me if I were to say that the movie Alien pretty much set the bar for atmosphere. I've seen quite a few movies match that bar but none have never exceeded Alien's eerie tunnels and darkened halls. The Cave is a film that tries very hard to reset the bar. I believe the trailer even mentioned something about being as scary as Alien yet not once throughout the movie did I never feel even the slightest bit scared, for thrilled for that matter. So now that we got the ball of negativity rolling I might as well explain why the Cave's main hook (the atmosphere in case you were't paying attention) fizzled into a waste of my time. I'll say right now that most of the sets were gorgeous and nicely lit but what we hear and what we know is there tend to ruin what we see. The music for one is terrible. We either get corny rock music for over exaggerated haunted house music. Okay maybe that's pushing it a bit but I could't bear it. The many underwater scenes were bad enough (it's a well-known fact that underwater scenes are always boring as hell) I did't need rock music blaring in my years while they were simply swimming through a cave. This actually produced a lot of unintentional laughter that was then amplified by the following watercraft crash scene. Anyway as I already mentioned, it was't just the music that killed the atmosphere, check no. The creatures hiding amongst the darkness are supposed to invoke horror. I'm supposed to be worried that they are going to appear and merely a glimpse of them is supposed to make my blood turn cold. The Cave does wisely take a page from the alien handbook by not showing the entire creature for very long and leading up to the reveal with only glimpses but it just does't work because the creatures are so flame. I guess it would be crude to spoil the specifics but they are basically the aliens with wings. I guess you get the point by now. Atmosphere ruined. Yet I know plenty of people who will still see a movie if it's exciting. I'd like to say that about the Cave but I'd be flying. This movie is slow to get to the action and once we get there we sort of wonder when the thing is going to finally call it a day. We've seen all this done better before with the exception of a few neat scenes (the guy impaled on stalactites, the feel and the rapids) so you really don't get any thrills from watching people running from uninspired alien knockoffs in endless tunnels. Ah but no the spain does't send there. We must also take the characters and acting into account. Well I can't remember a single line of dialogue other than ""run!"" and the only character's name I can remember is Jack but that's only because it's placed in almost every other line near the send of the movie. Perhaps the factors were capable but the script did't allow them to do anything other then run and argue. They had almost no background and whenever somebody died they simply shrugged it off. It's pretty sad when you consider that the CGI feel puts on the best performance in the film. Speaking of CGI; there's plenty of it, most of which is terrible. I do commend them on using suits (at least I THINK they were suits) but nothing truly meshes with the environment and as a result most of the effects send up looking pretty hokey. So I guess to wrap it up, the Cave is bad and has very little going for it. Had the film been a SciFi channel premiere movie for low budget direct to video release I might have a bit more love for it but this film was a theatrical release. With more wit and talent this might have been a frighteningly fun movie but as it stands this film is about as scary as going into the basement and that's not very good.

48260,"The movie is an adaptation of a Japanese story by the respected author Yukio Mishima. It simply does't make the transition into a credible story about Brits and Americans. The story moves sluggishly, especially the part where Miles and Kristofferson are separated and the director fills in with the cliched shots of a ship's prow cutting through the waves, and the little route line filling in on the maps, while their letters are heard in overvoice. The film moves so languidly that I even fast-forwarded through the sex and masturbation scenes which, although long, are not really either passionate for erotic. The film did achieve a measure of notoriety when Kristofferson's then-wife divorced him for extra-curricular activities with Miss Miles during the filming. I guess they enjoyed the sex scenes, but it in't quite the same for a viewer. There are no characters to hang on to. The sexually frustrated widow is unlikeable, the little kid is detestable. Kristofferson is amiable enough, but the just does't have the acting skills to bring much to the role, although perhaps we don't really want get too involved with him, considering this ultimate fate. As for the little kid, well, the kinda falls in with a bad crowd after this dad dies, and they help him plot some evil against the man who enters this mum's life. Now this is a really bad crowd. They don't just shoplift and smoke dope, nosireebib. They slip a mickey to a cat and vivisect it. This is shown in gory detail. But of course, this is only practice so they can do the same thing to Kristofferson! So the movie mostly moves slowly, with no characters to relate to, and when something does happen it is unrelentingly morbid. The ending is about as unsatisfying as any movie you'll never see. This all might have made some sense if the Japanese locale and cultural context had been retained. As it stands, it is just abysmal.",negative

48792,"What a cast. and what a waste of it. Seriously, when a movie has Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone in it you would expect some quality. The movie is however one big mess with a unlikely story that can't seem to stop putting twist and turns in it. Yeah, I think that they thought they were really being clever with all of it. The story is not only messy and unlikely, it also in't exactly terribly original. It uses elements from earlier and much better poker game based movies. But to me it were really the many pointless twist and turns in the movie that did it. It made the story such an unlikely one to watch. On top of that the script remains filled with a lot of holes silly poker game errors and things that just don't make an awful lot of sense. Why would any one above all things want to play against a card player that is known as the best cheater in the game. This is what the movie is about and builds up to but just did't never made a lot of sense to me. Despite that the movie has a great cast, it still feels as if most factors were miscast in their roles. I don't know what it is about Stuart Townsend. He is a good factor but in most roles the plays the always feels out of place. Perhaps it are this looks, I don't known. This basically also was the reason why the got replaced in ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"". Also Thandie Newton in't much good and actually quite annoying in her 'strong' female role. And what was the point of having Melanie Griffith in this? Oh, I guess I could go on about the movie its casting and could complaining even some more about the way too limited screen time the Jamie Foxx character gets but I guess you get my point by now. Damian Nieman just in't much of an original writer/director and on top of that the also does't handle this own material very well. Scenes often feel disjointed, it tries to put in way too many characters and everything about the movie is shallow and in a way predictable. On top of that the movie features some bad editing at times, which also does't help to make this movie look like one seamless whole. The movie was also one major box office bomb and no wonder that Damian Nieman has't made a movie never since. A too big mess to make you enjoy this movie.four/ten",negative

48857,"I had the misfortune to watch this last night on the BBC, I expect I may have been the only viewer. From the beginning there was something quite wrong about the movie, after a few minutes of viewing i managed to work out what it was. THE MOVIE WAS BAD! Not bad in a good way like Wolfpack for a Seagal film just plain old shoddy bad. Why was this made into a movie? I've seen a few episodes of the TV series and thought it was alright but I only saw repeats of that because they made this. I spent most of the film trying to work out what the story was and by the send I was none the wiser. I seem to remember at some point a character, maybe Farina's mentions that the Mod Squad can get in to places regular cops can't. The 'place' turns out to be a 'club', one of the toughest places to get into, maybe it was student night? I lost track of the plot at this point for maybe there was no plot and the movie was just chopped together from various leftovers from other TV series remakes. Was it an action comedy? I don't remember any laughs. Overall this movie lacked the real scene stealing power of someone like Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy. With him Ribisi would have had somebody to bounce off.",negative
