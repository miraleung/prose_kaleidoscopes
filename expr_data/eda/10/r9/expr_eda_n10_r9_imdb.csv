247,"This movie was so bad it was funny! For awhile there I thought I was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la ""For Your Consideration""). The ""cliffhanger"" scene at the send had me laughing until my insides hurt. The script was dreadful enough, but coupled with Sean Young's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! In fact the fake shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing got made. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did star factors get attached? Were they at low points in their careers? Questions, questions.",negative
3207,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Unorthodox journalist Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) flits away this time winding up the local constabulary and trying to romance a member of police personnel. But everything changes when the landlady of the Thames side pub the frequents is found murdered and a transcript of an unpublished novel cum confession by legendary writer Charles Dickens is found. As the digs deeper into both mysteries, the is plunged further into mystery and danger than the bargained for. In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight, former footballer Vinnie Jones shot out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise with this gangster cult classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Okay, no one was blown away by this acting ability, but this presence as a hard man looked set to ensure a decent career as a movie tough guy. But it all proved to be a one hit wonder, and all the really achieved after this was supporting role status amongst far more acclaimed factors in films like Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish, before descending into the realm of straight to DVD hell, the latest being this muddled and labourous thriller, which might have been okay had the not taken other acclaimed and promising new talent stars like Derek Jacobi, Julie Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng and Mel Smith along with him. What caused him to fall from the dizzying heights of success so quickly (apart from maybe being a one trick pony) is anyone's guess (a dodgy personal life being a possible guess) but there the is. A script as far fetched and incomprehensible as this would have been a task in anyone's hand, but with a miscast looking Jones in the lead, it's even more of a task to fathom. Jacobi's juxtaposing roles as a former these tramp and Dickens himself talking directly to the camera through-out are obviously hints building up to something and the script is predictable in other areas too. Add to this cheap looking production values through out and debut director (also writer) Brendan Foley has made a bad first impression. What exactly did I expect with something that came free with The Daily Mail? *",negative
3267,"Joe Don's opening line says everything about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (the island of pathetic men) and involves Joe Don Baker tracking down an Italian mobster. Joe Don's character is named Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and all the does in this movie is shoot people and get arrested over and over fagin. Everyone in the movie hates him, just like everyone hates Greydon Clark. I liked an earlier Greydon picture, ""Angel's Revenge"" because it was a shine for thirteen year old boys. Avoid this movie at all costs!!",negative
6584,"This film is another of director Tim Burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring this `vision' to the screen. He has done it with `Batman', `Sleepy Hollow' and now this. This is not a remake. The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo). Burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership. The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time. During the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's America was struggling to redefine its civilization. It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms. It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal. In that context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day. POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify this intelligence to a species the considered inferior. The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious. Burton's version is as much a product of today's times as POTA was of the sixties. This is Apes for Dummies. It is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance. The `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel. While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, Burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, `I know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'From a technical perspective, as is always the case with Burton's film, the film is excellent. The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camerawork is outstanding (though I continue to dislike this dark look). However, thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script. The story has been reduced to a monster movie. The humans band together behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight the monstrous Apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoat (notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari). The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality. The acting is mixed. Mark Wahlberg is a fine factor who is simply miscast in this role. Walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong. This part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in Wahlberg's repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant factor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable. She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a across between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager. Then there is Tim Roth. His is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from total ruin. Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade. He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time. Additionally, this physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists. This film is a great disappointment. It is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. I rated it a three/ten. From a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a nine/ten. However the story is an insult to the original franchise. It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius the is. Of course it's true, but it would be great if the used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.",negative
7198,"I went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the Second Coming. Boy, was I never wrong. BBC are dullard at spacing a movie, total idiots at creating suspense, fools at building intensity. And this movie is no exception to the rule of how much BBC sucks. Ugh, the spacing and time-wasting laborious dialogue was just painful to sit through. The first thirty minutes felt like two hours. I kept looking down at my watch wondering when the pointless, monotonous drivel would send. They wasted a perfectly good factor in the lead role, because the material is so lazy, and sloppily, written. Everything that happens is just to kill time. Out of one hundred and fifty-five minutes, only fifteen minutes are interesting (the controversial ending). What a shame. Reading the plot summary is more interesting than watching the movie. The preaching, the ""am I God"" endless blah blah blah-ing, the dumb as doornails boring miracles. UGH. DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP.",negative
8626,"My family goes back to New Orleans late one thousand, six hundred's early one thousand, seven hundred's and in watching the movie I knew it was a history my grand-parents never talked about, but we knew it existed. I have cousins obviously black aka African Americans and others who can ""pass"" as white and chose not to. It's a hard history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is all a part of that history. It makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the 'arse' of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of African heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence. And at the same time had I not come out of that history, I probably would't be the successful business woman I am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world. The acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the factor, but it is a movie that NEEDED to be made. Anne Rice is incredible and I ask myself, why is she 'symbolically' writing about my family and I'm not. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza",positive
9719,"Film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show is gaspingly pretentious. Sandra spoofs lounge facts and superstars, but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting, and fitfully funny. Her fans will say she's scathingly honest, and that may be true. But she's also shrill, with an unapologetic, in-your-face bravado that in't well-suited to a film in this genre. She does't want to make nice--and she's certainly not out to make friends--and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway, her material there is seriously lacking. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and, though not directed by him, the film does have this chilly, detached signature style all over it. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of Sandra's in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share. *one/two from ****",negative
11609,"""Eh-heh meh-heh they, dude - look at these aliens. They're like - biting the humans and stuff! Eh-heh meh-heh meh-heh"" This must rank amongst the worst movies of all time. It's butter drivel for anyone with a modicum of a brain. Sure, you have the reviewers on the payroll who give glowing reviews and vote highly for this abomination but it's easy to tell who these sell-outs are. Their reviews are TOO good. To give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some B-movie remedial appeal would be a glowing review! Calling this a great movie tips the hands of the corporate shills. But enough of that. This movie had about all the bad characteristics a movie can have without being SO bad that it's enjoyable just to laugh at. The old Japanese sixty's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked. At least in those sixty's films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked. Or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships, how the models dangled on the strings and how the flames curved UPWARDS out of the back. Those movies made fun of how BAD they were. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) seems to actually think of itself as a GOOD movie - which makes it incredibly absurd. The effects were awful by today's standards. Beyond awful. However not quite as bad as the sixty's monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal. The plot and dialogue were about as sophomoric as I've never seen, made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect. I won't even point out the plot and logic holes in this one; it just would't be fair to this pitiable plot (plus it would take to long to even get started). Most of the acting was awful; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one. SciFi Channel is rapidly becoming the ""cheap thrills channel"", producing movie after movie without an iota of concept for intelligence in the lot. I can only wonder - why bother? Don't bother with this stripe. It does't get any worse.",negative
11771,"What would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having this bachelor party with some of this closest friends at a Hawaiian guy bar? All smooth sailing until the takes this ""bachelor that"" off. What would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her? What would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of this finance? A new low, right? Well Paul Coleman, played comically by Jason Lee, leads this experience of a nauseous blur and a new low. I got to say this is one of this good leading roles. However I do believe this role in Vanilla Sky was better acted. His finance named Karen is played by the up-and-down actress Selma Blair while Karen's character, Becky, is played by the lovely and talented Julia Stiles. Getting back to where we left off, Paul now has to deal with one arising problem to another. He gets diseases, has to deal with certain people, and has to play this lie games with stealth for any member of each of the families could get P. O'ed, including one of this relatives that has't had a ""bowel movement"" for fourteen days. *Vomit* All of this leads to the long awaited wedding with one hilarious scene before it recapping all the hell that Paul and this brother had to go through. Overall, A Guy Thing is quite funny and is all right. Sometimes the story may seem to go nowhere and you get tired of scenes there and there but it's a mixed movie. And if you're a Canadian and a fellow fan of the CTV Brett Butt sitcom, Corner Gas, you'd recognize a small role played by Fred Ewanuick, the same man who plays the hilarious Hank in the series. This movie is all right. It's another feather in Lee's that (quite an empty that so far, however). My Rating: seven/tenEliason A.",positive

16137,"I love Memoirs of a Geisha so I read the book twice; it is one of the best book I've read last year. I was looking forward to the movie and was afraid that reading the book would ruin the viewing pleasure of the movie. I was't expecting the movie to be that bad. Some of the best part of the book was omitted from the movie and the characters were weak with Hatsumomo (Li Gong)been the worst. If I haven't read the book, this movie would be a little confusing and inexplicable. The Plot Outline of the movie states ""Nitta Sayuri reveals how she transcended her fishing.

18828,"When I saw that Mary Louise Parker was associated with this epic novel turned film, I was intrigued. Being a fan of the book, I assumed she'd be playing Tony, Roz, for Charis, but more so, I was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head-y, almost psychological (but not psychological thriller) novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who than't read the novel, and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had. The book is a complex reflection of society, women, and modern life, and I was interested to see how they used the three different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film. What they actually did was a crime. The biggest error and confusing issue is: Why would Oxygen, a network that advertises as being for women, take an amazing book about how complex, wonderful, and terrible women are and can be, and change the protagonist from three women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story? It seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask Roz, Tony, and Charis about how they knew Zenia and in doing that, they brushed through bulk of the book. In doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it, aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with. In the film, these women karen't people, they are characters. In the book Zenia does fake her death, but the book mentions it to get this point across, while the film wastes thirty-forty-five minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use. They tried to make this complex book an episode of Law and Order for CSI. It turns out that Mary Louise Parker played Zenia, which was SO wrong. Zenia is a Catherine Zeta-Jones, Angelina Jolie, for maybe even a Scarlett Johnasson type. She is a woman men can't not adore, and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by, but in a ""keep your enemies closer"" kind of way. And once she gets closer, she seems totally genuine and trust worthy, despite your better judgment. She's the kind of woman who, even when she closes, she wins: she's always still beautiful, still rich, and there are always still people out there who don't know her game. In the film, Zenia did't take Charis's man (the blonde American draft dodger who was using Charis in the first place. ) but instead took August and tried to become her legal guardian (and apparently came back to be her Lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies). And Zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with August, but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed. It's was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book, but I think had I not read the book, I would have spent the whole movie confused, if I had bothered to stick with it at all. And Roz's husband was dead before Zenia came in to the picture (which was weird since Zenia took Roz's business AND home life in the book, which is why Roz hated her so much) and she and Zenia had conspired to kill Roz's husband years and years back. And according to the film Tony and West had been dating forever. even at the party where Zenia and West (in the book) had painted the whole place black and they made Tony seem like this totally with it (and evil, bitchy) person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it. Tony's character was SO wrong in this film. she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky, mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book. The film basically implied smart women are evil, beautiful women are evil, powerful women are evil, and women who teach yoga are off their rockers. They basically tried to make it so Zenia was't necessarily as awful as she was in the book, and then, in the send, the three women convince this former cop (who, of course in the process of researching this, meets Zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to send with them moving to Barbados for something ridiculous, which of course Zenia bails on) to hide Zenia's body (which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at, but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony, for they conspired together to do it. ) and then Zenia also managed to take all of Roz's money in the process. By the send of the film I was only half paying attention between commercials of/c it had aspirated so far out in space from what it could and should have been. If you karen't confused by this breakdown of the film, then maybe you would like it, because I have read the book and seen the movie, and from the movie alone I am ridiculously confused. It was terrible. I get that making a film out of that book is quite a task, but if you are going to take on the task, you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary, instead of creating some useless character to be your Alice in wonderland. Are there really no fluffier books that Oxygen could be making at least half decent TV movies of?",negative
20160,"this movie is about people living at a trailerpark. later in the movie it gets obvious that those people are out-of-work comedians, mainly old males. well, more for less they sit around the whole movie and talk about of***ing. but never there is any action, just those people talking. in the beginning I thought it's some cool perverted redneck-stuff, but after a while it got boring. I mean, how many versions can you think of saying of***ing, cd**k & pc**t? for sure, this can be funny - for half an hour maybe, not eighty minutes. but it was funny to watch those people trying to act. I'm pretty sure that they often were reading their text on some sheet when playing. but it does not disturb the movie, it's cool like this. because those individuals seem so poor, of***ed-up, crestfallen a***oles that the style totally fits. their wooden, helpless reading of the texts makes quite good atmosphere, I fell in love with the characters a little.***SPOILER AHEAD*** later in the movie the of***ers do some comedy-shows (rhymes about of***ing) with just themselves as audience and imagined applause. then one gets an eviction-advice and so they decide to defend the trailer park and enter their proofs - armed with some weapons. then they got shoot. fin. sounds like action, but it's not. just some trashy home-camera takes. ***SPOILER END***but the movie is totally consequent in it's style and I'm pretty sure it's just what the movie-maker wanted to have. it's the portrait of those of**k-ups in an groggy home-camera style with characters who can not act but seem interesting personalities so they are nice to watch. but the texts about - you know what - the whole time get boring after a while.pretty young director who also seems an interesting person, as the played some teenager-stuff in popular movies/TV-series but now got in more horror-movies which is more this cup of tea I guess. and this, this first direction-effort will be distributed by roma now. don't know anything about a release, I got this one as an ""advance screener"" from this years cannes which says ""for bootlegging purposes only"".",negative
22739,"First: The recent campaigning of this movie is a huge hoax. Judging from the cover you'd think this was some kind of scandal movie about Kylie playing a character having sex, taking drugs and whatever. This is just a cheap market-scheme. She's barely in it and does neither of the things. The marketing there is unbelievable, and I'm surprised the filmmakers has't objected. The movie itself was to me a huge disappointment. It seemed like a Sunset Beach episode directed sloppy-handed by a teenage Quentin Tarantino. And that not meant as a compliment, mind you. I think the weakness of the movie first of all is the story. It seems to be about nothing. Just about cool teenagers stripping around living 'on the edge'. The characters themselves does have some personality though, but the movie does't use its potential. As said, there's no story of any substance there. It seems to elaborate too much on cool dialog and ends up looking like a colourful MTV had. It definitely has that feeling. Still though, I guess some people might enjoy it, but I'd say there's far better movies like this around.",negative
22779,"Sarafina was a fun movie, and some of the songs were really great. Sarafina was very entertaining. I don't normally like music things like this, but the singing was not flame like it looked like on the box. The movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the Soweto rioting of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six. It showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters. Because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience, and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government, who you can not sympathise with. The singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent. The clothing of the students in Sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from Soweto. They made the movie actually in Soweto, which is why it looks very accurate in many parts. All these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about apartheid. As viewers we must be critical of the way the history of Apartheid was presented. As I said before, you become sympathetic to the students - this makes it potentially less reliable and objective. Also, it changes some of the details from other accounts. In Sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students. The police and army were very aggressive at Soweto, but this is probably an exaggerated event. The police and army did shoot students, but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this. The fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime. This is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students. The movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about apartheid. The teacher was arrested for being against the government, and the mum goes to work in a white persons house. But there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it for any details about the racist policies and laws. -By George S, Chris and Finlay",positive

6584,"This film is another of director Tim Burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring this `vision' to the screen. He has done it with `Batman', `Sleepy Hollow' and now this. This is not a remake. The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo). Burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership. The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time. During the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's America was struggling to redefine its civilization. It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms. It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal. In that context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day. POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify this intelligence to a species the considered inferior. The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious. Burton's version is as much a product of today's times as POTA was of the sixties. This is Apes for Dummies. It is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance. The `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel. While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, Burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, `I know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'From a technical perspective, as is always the case with Burton's film, the film is excellent. The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camerawork is outstanding (though I continue to dislike this dark look). However, thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script. The story has been reduced to a monster movie. The humans band together behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight the monstrous Apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoat (notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari). The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality. The acting is mixed. Mark Wahlberg is a fine factor who is simply miscast in this role. Walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong. This part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in Wahlberg's repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant factor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable. She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a across between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager. Then there is Tim Roth. His is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from total ruin. Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade. He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time. Additionally, this physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists. This film is a great disappointment. It is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. I rated it a three/ten. From a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a nine/ten. However the story is an insult to the original franchise. It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius the is. Of course it's true, but it would be great if the used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.",negative

7198,"I went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the Second Coming. Boy, was I never wrong. BBC are dullard at spacing a movie, total idiots at creating suspense, fools at building intensity. And this movie is no exception to the rule of how much BBC sucks. Ugh, the spacing and time-wasting laborious dialogue was just painful to sit through. The first thirty minutes felt like two hours. I kept looking down at my watch wondering when the pointless, monotonous drivel would send. They wasted a perfectly good factor in the lead role, because the material is so lazy, and sloppily, written. Everything that happens is just to kill time. Out of one hundred and fifty-five minutes, only fifteen minutes are interesting (the controversial ending). What a shame. Reading the plot summary is more interesting than watching the movie.

8626,"My family goes back to New Orleans late one thousand, six hundred's early one thousand, seven hundred's and in watching the movie I knew it was a history my grand-parents never talked about, but we knew it existed. I have cousins obviously black aka African Americans and others who can ""pass"" as white and chose not to. It's a hard history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is all a part of that history. It makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the 'arse' of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of African heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence. And at the same time had I not come out of that history, I probably would't be the successful business woman I am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world. The acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the factor, but it is a movie that NEEDED to be made.

9719,"Film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show is gaspingly pretentious. Sandra spoofs lounge facts and superstars, but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting, and fitfully funny. Her fans will say she's scathingly honest, and that may be true. But she's also shrill, with an unapologetic, in-your-face bravado that in't well-suited to a film in this genre. She does't want to make nice--and she's certainly not out to make friends--and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway, her material there is seriously lacking. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and, though not directed by him, the film does have this chilly, detached signature style all over it. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of Sandra's in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share. *one/two from ****",negative

11609,"""Eh-heh meh-heh they, dude - look at these aliens. They're like - biting the humans and stuff! Eh-heh meh-heh meh-heh"" This must rank amongst the worst movies of all time. It's butter drivel for anyone with a modicum of a brain. Sure, you have the reviewers on the payroll who give glowing reviews and vote highly for this abomination but it's easy to tell who these sell-outs are. Their reviews are TOO good. To give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some B-movie remedial appeal would be a glowing review! Calling this a great movie tips the hands of the corporate shills. But enough of that. This movie had about all the bad characteristics a movie can have without being SO bad that it's enjoyable just to laugh at. The old Japanese sixty's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked. At least in those sixty's films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked. Or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships, how the models dangled on the strings and how the flames curved UPWARDS out of the back. Those movies made fun of how BAD they were. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) seems to actually think of itself as a GOOD movie - which makes it incredibly absurd. The effects were awful by today's standards. Beyond awful. However not quite as bad as the sixty's monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal. The plot and dialogue were about as sophomoric as I've never seen, made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect. I won't even point out the plot and logic holes in this one; it just would't be fair to this pitiable plot (plus it would take to long to even get started). Most of the acting was awful; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one. SciFi Channel is rapidly becoming the ""cheap thrills channel"", producing movie after movie without an iota of concept for intelligence in the lot. I can only wonder - why bother? Don't bother with this stripe. It does't get any worse.",negative

11771,"What would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having this bachelor party with some of this closest friends at a Hawaiian guy bar? All smooth sailing until the takes this ""bachelor that"" off. What would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her? What would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of this finance? A new low, right? Well Paul Coleman, played comically by Jason Lee, leads this experience of a nauseous blur and a new low. I got to say this is one of this good leading roles. However I do believe this role in Vanilla Sky was better acted. His finance named Karen is played by the up-and-down actress Selma Blair while Karen's character, Becky, is played by the lovely and talented Julia Stiles. Getting back to where we left off, Paul now has to deal with one arising problem to another. He gets diseases, has to deal with certain people, and has to play this lie games with stealth for any member of each of the families could get P. O'ed, including one of this relatives that has't had a ""bowel movement"" for fourteen days. *Vomit* All of this leads to the long awaited wedding with one hilarious scene before it recapping all the hell that Paul and this brother had to go through. Overall, A Guy Thing is quite funny and is all right. Sometimes the story may seem to go nowhere and you get tired of scenes there and there but it's a mixed movie. And if you're a Canadian and a fellow fan of the CTV Brett Butt sitcom, Corner Gas, you'd recognize a small role played by Fred Ewanuick, the same man who plays the hilarious Hank in the series. This movie is all right. It's another feather in Lee's that (quite an empty that so far, however). My Rating: seven/tenEliason A.",positive

18828,"When I saw that Mary Louise Parker was associated with this epic novel turned film, I was intrigued. Being a fan of the book, I assumed she'd be playing Tony, Roz, for Charis, but more so, I was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head-y, almost psychological (but not psychological thriller) novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who than't read the novel, and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had. The book is a complex reflection of society, women, and modern life, and I was interested to see how they used the three different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film. What they actually did was a crime. The biggest error and confusing issue is: Why would Oxygen, a network that advertises as being for women, take an amazing book about how complex, wonderful, and terrible women are and can be, and change the protagonist from three women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story? It seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask Roz, Tony, and Charis about how they knew Zenia and in doing that, they brushed through bulk of the book. In doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it, aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with. In the film, these women karen't people, they are characters. In the book Zenia does fake her death, but the book mentions it to get this point across, while the film wastes thirty-forty-five minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use. They tried to make this complex book an episode of Law and Order for CSI. It turns out that Mary Louise Parker played Zenia, which was SO wrong. Zenia is a Catherine Zeta-Jones, Angelina Jolie, for maybe even a Scarlett Johnasson type. She is a woman men can't not adore, and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by, but in a ""keep your enemies closer"" kind of way. And once she gets closer, she seems totally genuine and trust worthy, despite your better judgment. She's the kind of woman who, even when she closes, she wins: she's always still beautiful, still rich, and there are always still people out there who don't know her game. In the film, Zenia did't take Charis's man (the blonde American draft dodger who was using Charis in the first place. ) but instead took August and tried to become her legal guardian (and apparently came back to be her Lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies). And Zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with August, but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed. It's was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book, but I think had I not read the book, I would have spent the whole movie confused, if I had bothered to stick with it at all. And Roz's husband was dead before Zenia came in to the picture (which was weird since Zenia took Roz's business AND home life in the book, which is why Roz hated her so much) and she and Zenia had conspired to kill Roz's husband years and years back. And according to the film Tony and West had been dating forever. even at the party where Zenia and West (in the book) had painted the whole place black and they made Tony seem like this totally with it (and evil, bitchy) person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it. Tony's character was SO wrong in this film. she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky, mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book. The film basically implied smart women are evil, beautiful women are evil, powerful women are evil, and women who teach yoga are off their rockers. They basically tried to make it so Zenia was't necessarily as awful as she was in the book, and then, in the send, the three women convince this former cop (who, of course in the process of researching this, meets Zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to send with them moving to Barbados for something ridiculous, which of course Zenia bails on) to hide Zenia's body (which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at, but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony, for they conspired together to do it. ) and then Zenia also managed to take all of Roz's money in the process. By the send of the film I was only half paying attention between commercials of/c it had aspirated so far out in space from what it could and should have been. If you karen't confused by this breakdown of the film, then maybe you would like it, because I have read the book and seen the movie, and from the movie alone I am ridiculously confused. It was terrible. I get that making a film out of that book is quite a task, but if you are going to take on the task, you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary, instead of creating some useless character to be your Alice in wonderland. Are there really no fluffier books that Oxygen could be making at least half decent TV movies of?",negative

18828,when wherefore i world health organization saw comprise that mary louise parker was associated with this epic novel turned film i was intrigued being a fan of eastern samoa washington the book i assumed shed be playing tony roz for charis but more so i was intrigued to see how they would turn punt this very head y almost psychological but not psychological inbound thriller novel in to return a movie that would fancy be accessible to those washington who assort thant read the novel and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had the book is a complex reflection of society women and modern life and i was interested to see how they used the three different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film what they actually did was a crime the biggest error and confusing issue is why would oxygen a network that advertises as being for women take an amazing book about how complex washington wonderful inward and terrible women are and can be and change sol the protagonist from three women to some dumb former sol cop with no real motive practice of law inward to be involved in the story it seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to record book straight up ask roz tony and charis about how they aug knew zenia and in doing that they wa delay atomic number character reference brushed through bulk of the book comprise in doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great robust about the characters in it aside from making it so the audience defender detest had no one credible to induce eldritch associate with in the film these women karent people they are characters in the book spell zenia does fake her death but the book mentions it to get this unitedly point across while the film wastes

implies and zenia nearer washington did kill the chickens before past leaving with august but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed its was as wherefore if whoever wrote the screenplay was the likes of grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book but picture show i think had i not read the book i sol would have spent the whole movie comprise confused if i had bothered to stick with it at all and rozs husband was dead before zenia came in to the picture which was weird since zenia took rozs business and home life in the book which along is why record book roz hated her so much and she and zenia had conspired to kill rozs husband variety years and years back and according to the film tony and west had been dating forever even comprise at drive the record book party where zenia and west in the book had painted the whole place black and they made only tony seem like this totally with it and evil bitchy person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence crack up and find out popular for it tonys character inward was so wrong political party in previous this film she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind sports fan of gawky mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book the induce film basically implied smart women are evil beautiful eastern samoa to the lowest degree women are evil powerful women are evil and women who teach yoga are off their rockers they basically tried to make uncoiled it information technology so zenia wast necessarily as awful as she book was in the book and then in the send the three women convince citizenry this former cop who of counterbalance course in the process of researching this meets zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to send with them moving to barbados for something ridiculous which of course zenia character reference bails on to hide zenias body which they found splat at the hotel she was atomic number staying interest at but the film implies that one of the three lieu women pushed her over the balcony for they conspired together to do it and then zenia also managed to take all of rozs money in the process by the send of the film starting time i was only half paying attention between commercials of c it had aspirated so far out in space from what it composite could eastern samoa and should have been if drive you karent confused by this breakdown of the film then maybe you would like it because i have read the book and seen the movie and from the movie alone composite

22739,"First: The recent campaigning of this movie is a huge hoax. Judging from the cover you'd think this was some kind of scandal movie about Kylie playing a character having sex, taking drugs and whatever. This is just a cheap market-scheme. She's barely in it and does neither of the things. The marketing there is unbelievable, and I'm surprised the filmmakers has't objected. The movie itself was to me a huge disappointment. It seemed like a Sunset Beach episode directed sloppy-handed by a teenage Quentin Tarantino. And that not meant as a compliment, mind you. I think the weakness of the movie first of all is the story. It seems to be about nothing. Just about cool teenagers stripping around living 'on the edge'. The characters themselves does have some personality though, but the movie does't use its potential. As said, there's no story of any substance there. It seems to elaborate too much on cool dialog and ends up looking like a colourful MTV had. It definitely has that feeling. Still though, I guess some people might enjoy it, but I'd say there's far better movies like this around.",negative

22779,"Sarafina was a fun movie, and some of the songs were really great. Sarafina was very entertaining. I don't normally like music things like this, but the singing was not flame like it looked like on the box. The movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the Soweto rioting of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six. It showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters. Because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience, and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government, who you can not sympathise with. The singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent. The clothing of the students in Sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from Soweto. They made the movie actually in Soweto, which is why it looks very accurate in many parts. All these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about apartheid. As viewers we must be critical of the way the history of Apartheid was presented. As I said before, you become sympathetic to the students - this makes it potentially less reliable and objective. Also, it changes some of the details from other accounts. In Sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students. The police and army were very aggressive at Soweto, but this is probably an exaggerated event. The police and army did shoot students, but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this. The fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime. This is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students. The movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about apartheid. The teacher was arrested for being against the government, and the mum goes to work in a white persons house. But there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it for any details about the racist policies and laws. -By George S, Chris and Finlay",positive

43044,"Like all of the very earliest films, this ""movie"" is very, very short--lasting about one minute! So, because of its brevity, it's not really possible to compare it to more modern films. But, for its time, it's actually a very remarkable film. Much of this is because the prints were hand painted--making Annabelle appear red and other color as she does her amazing dance. I've actually seen two different versions--one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout. I think the red one depicted on the DVD ""The Great Train Robbery and Other Primary Works"" is the best of them. The dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a piece of amazing performance part. And, unlike other one minute (or less) films of the day, this one is one I could see repeatedly--it's just that visually compelling and odd.

44350,"Some years ago, satellite channel U. K. Gold promoted repeats of 'Men Behaving Badly' with the hype: ""Here it is, the original flat-sharing sitcom!"". This was in fact untrue. 'Man About The House' was also a flat-sharing sitcom and iran from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three-seventy-six. It was the brainchild of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, creators of the popular sitcom 'Father Dear Father'. When it ended, they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times. In the first episode, Chrissy ( Paula Wilcox ) and Jo ( Sally Thomsett ) are tidying their Myddleton Terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath. He is Robin Tripp ( Richard O'Sullivan ), a Southampton cookery student of no fixed abode. While this clothes dry out, the puts on a ladies' dressing gown and prepares them a meal. They are so impressed by this culinary skills that they invite him to stay. But there must be no naughty business. So Robin has to pretend to be gay. On B. B. C.-two's 'I Love one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three', shown in two thousand, Julie Burchill claimed that 'House' showed her a way of life she envied. She was not alone. One of the most iconic ( for me, anyway ) images of 'seventy's British television was Sally Thomsett coming out of the London Underground carrying a parasol, and a 'blind' man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past. A man living with two girls was a risqueé subject for the time, but Mrs. Mary Whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar, it was innocent, good-natured fun. Mortimer and Cooke's scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it. Richard O'Sullivan was still playing 'Bingham' in I. T. V.'s 'Doctor In Charge' when this got started. In fact the second run of 'In Charge' overlapped with the first of 'House'. He was born to play the sex-mad Robin. Paula Wilcox's 'Chrissy' was more streetwise than 'Beryl', her character she played in 'The Lovers', while Sally Thomsett's 'Jo' was a lovable dizzy blonde. As time wore on, the became almost like an older brother to them. For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole the show as the warring Ropers. George had lost interest in sex, but Mildred had not. They went on to their own show - the aptly titled 'George & Mildred'. The late Doug Fisher was good value as as Robin's wideboy friend Larry. He worked so well the was made into a regular. Within a year of its debut, there was the inevitable movie spin-off. I am not a big fan of the 'Man About The House' movie because I think it was stretched to fit the big screen. Most of its characters had never appeared in the series. The format was sold to America, where it became the long-running 'Three's Company' starring the late John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. It was far more suggestive than the British original, with Somers often seen in sexy clothing. After six seasons, 'House' ended with Chrissy marrying Robin's older brother Norman ( Norman Eshley ). Fans were devastated to see Robin failing to get the girl the loved, but there was some consolation in the fact that the too landed this own show - 'Robin's Nest'.",positive
