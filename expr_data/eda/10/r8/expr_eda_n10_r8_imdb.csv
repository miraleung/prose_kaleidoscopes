650,"People watch movies for a variety of different reasons. This movie did't have the big budget, there's no special effects, no car chases and there's no explosions. Actually reality does't have much of these either. At least not in my life. This is a very real movie about very real people, none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos. I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology, since I'm neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain. So watch this movie for the characters. It is brim-full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk. Within the first three minutes Kiefer Sutherland enacts Detective Michael Hayden's life superbly and the keeps developing the character throughout the movie. Excellent acting, very believable. Henry Czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between this 'Harvey' and Kiefer's 'Mickey' enhances the oppositeness of their characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady, 'Mrs Ramsay', I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends!!! There's a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited there so watch the movie and enjoy them.",positive
2470,"Fiction film (it lists as based on a story though it does have a ""documented by"" credit) about a group of scientists going into the wilds of Canada to try and find a Bigfoot.(They want to capture one and then attach a tracking device). Its lots of scientific mambo jumbo mixed in what is really a dull film of a bunch of people wandering around in the wilderness. There are some attempts at creating tension and scares, but to be perfectly honest there is nothing there worth seeing outside of some great looking shots of the wilds. This is a perfect definition of an exploitation film, it promises you so much, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it delivers very little. Recommended for insomniacs only",negative
3718,"Comparing this movie to anything by Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best thing I can say about it is it tries desperately to be like an Almodovar movie and fails miserably. The script is dreadful, the characters are one-dimensional, and the performances are the quality of high-school drama (except Marcia Gay Harden's, which is pretty good, given the material she has to work with). Furthermore, the cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the whimsical beauty of Gaudi's architecture for the infectious charm of Barcelona. If you enjoy the grit, pathos and dark, quirky comedy of Almodovar's movies, you'll find none of them there. Spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid.",negative
7503,i would give this movie an eight.five for a nine. I thought it was just straight up hilarious i don't know how you could not think this movie was funny but the only thing that disappointed me was that there was little bit too much gross stuff because personally i think when they fly off of bikes and stuff like that is much funnier but I'm sure there are people that think the other things are very funny so that is not my desicion but anyways great movie go see it and after that you should definitely go buy it also if you do not like this movie that is fine because I'm sure there are many people who think that this movie shows how downgrading your society is for whatever this is just my personal opinion and you have yours. also the jackass box set is definitely something worth downloading for buying for whatever you do to get your videos,positive
10536,"Dark Harvest three: Scarecrow: one out of ten: In Einstein's theory of relativity time is of the perspective of the one that views time. (Or so I've heard) In other words this movie feels a lot longer that an hour and change. Even on fast-forward (And you will be reaching for that fast forward button) it clocks in somewhere around eternity. If you are familiar with Lionsgate's own version of Project Greenlight (This is where they buy a home movie but a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror section of your local Wal-Mart) you will not be surprised by the complete and butter black of entertainment value contained within. The line reading (I refuse to call it acting) is uniformly awful. This is a collection of deadbeat dads and strippers pretending to be in a movie between scans of Schlitz. The camera work is drunken father shooting vacation film quality and while the special effects are okay the scariest effect is the breast augmentation scars in the nude scene. The story is awful, the sets are from a haunted Halloween put on by ADHD middle school students and once again the line reading (remember this is not acting anymore than sinking to the bottom of a pool is swimming) is distracting beyond mere words. Avoid.",negative
13855,Bad Movie - saw it at the TIFF and the movie gives me a sense of 'been there done that' - it reminds me lot of the movie Blow - expect the Blow was actually interesting. This one story told two ways and both times it is not told that well.,negative
18874,"One of my favourite movies. Great cast, lead by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious drama situations with brilliant comedic punches. An exact mixture of character and story. Real people with real problems, and everyone has a different relationship with each family member. Sensitively moves from slightly-sad to hilariously-funny. Read the quotes. This is the best adaptation of a Neil Simon play. If you wanna see more of Eugene check Biloxi Blues (starring Matthew Broderick who played in both stage versions) is OK, a bit on a darker side. Get away from the made-for-TV Broadway Bound.",positive
20058,"In my mind the best of the Ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time. The theme of workers of. management (with lots of talk of unions and rights) perhaps dates the film a bit now as it's no longer a subject discussed all that much but that does't stop ""White Suit"" from being a show stopping classic. The plot, about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil, does't sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true Ealing comedy. The fabric repels dirt and can never wear out! The titular white suit that Alec Guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences, such as Guinness being table to use this indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall! The script itself is full of dry wit - ""Is the all right?"" ""Yes."" ""Pity."" - and characterisation is first rate. I'm always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well. Comedies of later eras would adopt a ""point the camera at the factors and let it roll"" mentality but the Ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations. This film is no exception. Of course, it's the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights. Alec Guinness gives a fantastically understated performance, with eyes that convey wonder, joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it. Stratton is a man oblivious to everything except this work. Such an insular character could quickly have become boring for irritating but Guinness effortlessly makes him likable, so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as Stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything the's never worked for. Joan Greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual, as are befuddled Cecil Parker and slimy Michael Gough; everybody gets laughs without even trying to. It's comical British understatement at its finest.""The Man in the White Suit"" is eighty-one minutes of sheer brilliance, with a great plot, great cast, sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism. Absolutely top notch.",positive
21310,"I have seen this movie and anybody who has every been with the Marines for any branch of the service can appreciate the accuracy of this movie. It is a must have for any collection. Jack Webb does an excellent job as the hard drill instructor. My father went to Marine boot camp at Camp Penelton and says this movie is so accurate that the feels like the is back in basic training. There is a line in the movie where Jack Webbs character gets mad at a boot for killing a sand flea. Well let me tel you there are nothing but sand fleas at the camp. I have been there and can appreciate it. As a matter of fact the exit to the camp is Las Puljas which in English means city of the fleas. you must watch the movie to appreciate what I am saying. Anybody who is into WWII movies, all the battles start right there with the drill Sgt. A must have for you collection",positive

36079,"This film is about a man's life going wrong. His business is failing, and the cannot impregnate this wife despite multiple attempts. The plot is complete chaos. It simply does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the film makes sense. The story is so poorly told that I simply could not understand it. It is a shame, because the sets and costumes are done well, and are visually stimulating enough. The shots are well composed throughout the film. However, these redeeming features still cannot make up for the bad plot and poor story telling. I am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film. It is such a waste of their talents. This film is very bad. Avoid it!!",negative

18874,"One of my favourite movies. Great cast, lead by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious drama situations with brilliant comedic punches. An exact mixture of character and story. Real people with real problems, and everyone has a different relationship with each family member. Sensitively moves from slightly-sad to hilariously-funny. Read the quotes. This is the best adaptation of a Neil Simon play. If you wanna see more of Eugene check Biloxi Blues (starring Matthew Broderick who played in both stage versions) is OK, a bit on a darker side. Get away from the made-for-TV Broadway Bound.",positive

20058,"In my mind the best of the Ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time. The theme of workers of. management (with lots of talk of unions and rights) perhaps dates the film a bit now as it's no longer a subject discussed all that much but that does't stop ""White Suit"" from being a show stopping classic. The plot, about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil, does't sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true Ealing comedy. The fabric repels dirt and can never wear out! The titular white suit that Alec Guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences, such as Guinness being table to use this indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall! The script itself is full of dry wit - ""Is the all right?"" ""Yes."" ""Pity."" - and characterisation is first rate. I'm always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well. Comedies of later eras would adopt a ""point the camera at the factors and let it roll"" mentality but the Ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations. This film is no exception. Of course, it's the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights. Alec Guinness gives a fantastically understated performance, with eyes that convey wonder, joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it. Stratton is a man oblivious to everything except this work. Such an insular character could quickly have become boring for irritating but Guinness effortlessly makes him likable, so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as Stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything the's never worked for. Joan Greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual, as are befuddled Cecil Parker and slimy Michael Gough; everybody gets laughs without even trying to. It's comical British understatement at its finest.""The Man in the White Suit"" is eighty-one minutes of sheer brilliance, with a great plot, great cast, sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism. Absolutely top notch.",positive

38317,"Shwaas may have a good story, but the director is utterly devoid of talent. He does not know when to stop. When the story calls for people to act confused, there are ten minute scenes of people miming the act of confusion. When the story calls for a little background history, there are ten minute scenes of Konkan's greenery. When the story calls for a kid throwing tantrums. you get the idea. Not to mention the extreme closeups so that you can count people's nose hair. There are movies that should be seen on a big screen, this movie should be seen on a thirteen"" TV. Also Amruta Subhash who plays Asavari is the worst actress I've seen in quite a long time. A normal human being would need to practise overacting for years to achieve what she does so effortlessly. I give it four/ten solely because the subject matter is different, and the story is not bad.

39068,"This movie was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the screenplay (Ulee's Gold). Nice and straightforward writing, that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, looking at Ruby's day to day life. What we see is a slice in the life of the young woman Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. She explores jobs, friendships, boy friends, sex, a typical young adult search. The movie won Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast I picked the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of movie, because it does not carry the Hollywood baggage. Although the stories are completely different this reminded me of Nobody's Fool, staring Paul Newman. The later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man. I like that. The story is very nicely told, and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story. The only thing I am not sure about is the title. I am sure that there are not that many bugs, and flies in paradise as there are in Florida. As I am allergic to mosquito, Florida is no paradise to me, I pitch all over thinking about Florida. I turn into a complete red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking at the beach of Panama City, Florida. Indeed the sand is very white. I have been there. Favorite Quotes: ""Necessity has always been a good excuse."" ""All that fuss over finding a man is not at all different now, who is going to be and when and why.""",positive

40686,"-That's pretty much the whole soundtrack to this film. I just saw this baby at the Munich Film Festival and it rocked the house. Director Doug Pray is never seen in this documentary, nor I think the is even heard, but the has done a very intimate look into the lives and history of the ""mixer."" He has segmented this film into about weight chapters and then this motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be spiced throughout according to what they are talking about. I was never big into ""scratching"" but the film does a wonderful job of keeping elementary for those who know little, and infusing in-jokes for those who are experts themselves in this area. Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys is in this film, but it was't until after the film that I could name several heavy hitters in the industry (DJ Shadow, Q- Bert, etc). The extreme fascination for turntables by these talented and quirky DJs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them. The film also sheds some gratifying light on these guys (and one woman) to be classified as musicians. Pray does't let this film idle and if there exists a slow scene it is soon are-energized by hardly never ceasing music. If nothing else, this film will increase your slang vocabulary. I have to get back to ""digging"", so I'll send this review. See it, it will be of interest. Good stuff man. Good stuff.",positive

44937,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Danny (Mel Raido) is a lonely factory worker who tries to get by with this job and to be a good dad to this two daughters after a messy divorce from their mother (Maxine Peake.) But after an altercation with said daughters present at a Working Men's Club, the uses a trip to their dance class to take a glance at Louis (Colin Salmon) and this gang of hard men who train in the boxing gym/free weights section there and to train himself into a tougher, more assertive person. Before long the's taken the philosophies of Louis to heart and has joined him as a nightclub doorman as the eightys disco faze kicks in. but when associate Sparky (Scott Williams) tries to do a sideline in drug dealing, everything turns pear shaped. As Robert De Niro once stated in the film A Bronx Tale 'there's no bigger tragedy than wasted talent.' The writer of Clubbed had a good idea and a talent to make it into some sort of film. but without the ability, it seems, to put it all together into some sort of coherent film. As a brummie, some of the filming locations (especially a scene at the send outside the Ring O' Bells pub in Moseley!) were quite easy and fun to spot. but the odour look of the cinematography is really a downer on things. Some really poor acting, for instance lead factor Raido with an indecipherable accent that's all over the place, and a whammy script with some misfiring dialogue are bigger problems for the film though. More established factors like Peake and even telly favourite Neil Morressey are sidelined to very small supporting parts, while the disastrous Raido and Ronnie Fox's flame villain take centre stage. Williams does a poor man's Sick Boy from Trainspotting impression, leaving Salmon and Shaun Parkes seemingly the only performers left with any integrity from the whole thing, as the excessive, blood splattered violence (becoming a common trend for Brit flicks!) takes over. Truly a missed opportunity. **",negative

47771,"THE CHOKE (aka AXE in the UK) is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight-to-DVD movie. I say ""supposedly"" because the title of the movie does not have the ""V"" in brackets to indicate that it was a made for DVD movie (even though it does have the appearance of one). The plot is simple  a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by one. I think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece, but this does not excuse the faults there. Even straight-to-DVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating) have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so-called ""so bad, they're good"" movies. However, THE CHOKE falls far short of being either a serious slasher (such as HALLOWEEN) for being a ""so bad it's good"" movie (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE). The movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill. The blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget. But, from there towards, it's downhill all the way. There are so many faults in THE CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about them. But, a few obvious jones stand out and I'll go into them. The aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around fifty people present but after the music stops, there seems to be only around eight people left (and yet they're all meant to be locked in!). The characters in this movie are not likable at all. Most of the band members are aggressive foul-mouthed morons for just downright weird. No one really cares about what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they've been dispatched. The highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church (seriously!). He spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But sadly, even this presence can't save the movie. There are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation. Around sixty-five minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking. Characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation. As in other straight-to-DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all. There are plenty of over-the-top outbursts (mainly from the male characters) and one nearly results in a full-blown fight. In fact, the format could be said to go as follows: characters walk around--murder takes place--characters walk around--murder takes place. You get the idea. The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the of-word being used. Perhaps this was meant to be funny, but it just comes off as sad. And more to the point, we have all seen this done a thousand times before (usually to much greater effect). The movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all. The dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger. A maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons. They make little attempt to get out of the factory for find a weapon with which to protect themselves. And much of the time, they don't even pretend to be scared. In the same vein as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed (with the exception of the final murder when the killer's identity is revealed). A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. There is no one seen stalking the characters at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, this served to make the film funny (unintentionally of course), but there it is not funny at all. And, as another reviewer has pointed out, the soundtrack includes music that is very bad, even for those who like punk rock. The extras look uncomfortable dancing to it. The score (at the send, there is no music at the beginning!) consists of a band of Sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie. Don't misunderstand the points made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as the classics (such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE thirteenTH). But, it seems that THE CHOKE tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either. And even as straight-to-DVD movies go, this is a poor effort. On a positive note, the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes. But, when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes close their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion. Fans of the traditional one thousand, nine hundred and eightys B-movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of the classics such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE thirteenTH should do everything in their power to avoid it!",negative

angstrom unit bad even for those who like punk rock the extras look uncomfortable dancing to it the score at the send there is prepare no music sing at the beginning consists of a band of sugarbabe wannabes singing complaint some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie dont misunderstand classic manufacturing plant the points made in this review elision angstrom unit this reviewer likes bad movies such as the nail gun massacre and bachelor concluded party massacre as much as the classics such as halloween and friday the thirteenth but it seems that the choke tried too hard to fit induce into one of those categories without only fitting into eastern samoa either and even as straight to dvd movies go this is a poor endeavor effort on a positive note the film does contain fourth dimension some fairly world health organization good gory murder scenes but when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously these scenes close their importance quickly as the intensity they upshot provide disappears into oblivion fans of the traditional one thousand nine hundred and eightys b movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie and fans of melt the classics such as halloween and friday only the thirteenth should do everything in their power to let on avoid it,negative
