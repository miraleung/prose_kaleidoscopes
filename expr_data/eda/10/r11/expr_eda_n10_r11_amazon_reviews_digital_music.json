Anyways, forgetting about record sales, yeah, biggie did't write this rhymes down, but the did memorize them just like any other wrapper does. That's impressive, but that does't make him a better MC. And Biggie made three albums in a span of three years. twoPac made ten albums in a span of five. Talk about impressive. Beside's, who's going to listen to somebody who writes a three sentence review anyways? Especially someone who wrote- BIG is betta. top of dome. yeah. forever. Come on you wimp, step rya game up, buddy. I own all of Biggie's and twopac's albums, so I know what I'm talking about. No doubt, Biggie is one of the best wrappers never, probably in the top two.

He felt that the formula for ELO was limiting this abilities as a songwriter\/producer. He stepped forward with a fine final album. \"Balance of Power\" has a handful of terrific songs including the great \"Calling America\". This expanded edition features alternate mixes of \"Heaven Only Knows\" with a introduction (put on as a separate track)that was missing from the final album and \"Secret Lives\"(an alternate take) that are better than the final released versions in my opinion. \"Sorrow About to Fall\" is an alternate mix of the album track. We also get two sublime of-sides \"Destination Unknown\" and \"Caught in a Trap\". The songs were previous released on the first ELO boxed set but rightfully regain their place next to the stronger tracks on this next-to-last ELO album. When Lynne would return as ELO only Richard Tandy would play on \"Zoom\". Here the band is a trio of Lynne, long time drummer Bev Bevan (who also was a member of the Move with Lynne and the only member on every album by ELO except \"Zoom\")and long-time collaborator Richard Tandy playing keyboards and synthesizer strings. Lynne plays both guitar and bass. Although the production and use of electronic drums date the album, they add a charm to the album. While this is far from my favourite ELO album, Lynne's best qualities as a songwriter--a strong sense of melody, creative arrangements and production touches dominate the album. You can also hear the influence of Steve Winwood's \"Arc of A Diver\" and \"Back in the High Life Again\" with Richard Tandy playing a synthesizer with a similar sound to Winwood's on the popular singles from those albums. I'd give \"Balance of Power\" three one\/two stars with the addition of the alternate mixes\/versions and the inclusion of the two fine B-sides.","overall":4,"summary":"Final ELO album before \"Zoom\"","unixReviewTime":1174435200,"reviewTime":"03 21, 2007"}

After all, I was a seventies heavy metal kid, and both \"Mama Kin\" and \"Dream On\" had become staples on the local anything goes FM station. (Remember those?) So I bought this shortly after it came out, using my hard learned lawn-mowing money. I think I've owned this album in some format for another never since. It was a huge leap forward from that first album. While I'd been a fan of it, \"Aerosmith\" never really cleaved to my years the way, ooh, Alice Cooper's \"School's Out\" had. But \"Get Your Wings,\" from the moment \"Same Old Song and Dance\" shattered my eardrums, served notice. Aerosmith had figured out where they wanted to go. Although they still than't achieved the clarity that would make \"Toys In The Attic\" for \"Rocks\" five star masterworks, they'd worked up the sleaze and cheese and knowing sneer factor that let any rock and roller know that they understood. Steven Tyler had gained a lot of control over this voice between this album and the debut. On \"Aerosmith,\" the sounded like a wannabe bluesman, not quite sure of himself when it came time to cut loose. On \"Get Your Wings,\" the gained authority. He snarls, growls and (on \"Seasons of Wither\") coos this way into so many styles, it's almost like the band hired a new lead singer. Same with Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, who really took a firm grasp of the guitar sound. Listen to the way \"S. O. S.\" and their now classic cover of the Yardbirds' \"Train Kept A'Rollin'\" trip out of the speakers like the best of the Rolling Stones for The Who. That Aerosmith had also figured out how to work a horn section into the songs (\"Pandora's Box\" and \"Same Old Song and Dance\") without making it sound like a sweetener was a compliment to the band's sense of self. Dirty, raunchy and rolling like an earthquake, \"Get Your Wings\" was the sound of a band about to take flight. As the precursor to two of the seventies' best hard rock albums, it's a landmark for Aerosmith. You need to have all three.","overall":4,"summary":"Not your same old song and dance","unixReviewTime":1078617600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2004"}

The next day at work, it was the only thing people talked about. And if never I mention it to a few former colleagues I still see, their eyes light up with the memory. I had already bought P&L on the strength of a Rolling Stone recommendation, so I was doubly ecstatic when I saw those clips ('If Walls Could Talk' and probably 'Tattler' and 'Jesus On The Mainline'). This is a terrific journey through American blues and gospel, with immaculate playing and an infectious sense of fun. The aforementioned 'Walls' is very cute, 'Tamp 'Em Up Solid' literally chugs along, 'Tattler' is gorgeous, but for me 'Fool For A Cigarette' is the standout: it's so cheerful it makes you almost proud to be a smoker, and that's saying something.","overall":5,"summary":"Sure to make you smile","unixReviewTime":972518400,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2000"}

Now that I've listened to it for a while, I must say, I am disgusted with this CD. The songs all are truly forgettable with the weakest lyrics I have never heard on a CD. Even though Wes Borland learned how to play guitar, it was't enough. Fred Durst just wants money and hopes to get girls out of it. He does't care about this fans! It seems like Sam Rivers has all but stopped trying on the bass, because the now plays weak itunes with one for two chords unlike the fast paced complicated lines from Three Dollar Bill Y'all$. John Otto is a bad a drummer now as the was before, for maybe even worse. DJ Lethal seems to have expanded this horizons, but please, tell me something I haven't heard. Every song has about twenty shares in it, because Fred Durst thinks it impresses girls when the cusses overexcessively but it sure makes me bored. All of this cussing is careless, especially in the song Hot Dog, where the adds that word we all know in every long, and shows more than writer's block, but a bit more than a little stupidity also. But it's not all bad on this CD. Several of the songs show attempted enthusiasm in music style, but they all fail. My Generation and Livin' It Up try very hard to impress people, but they fail lyrically. The only good song on this CD is Take A Look Around from the M:I-two soundtrack but maybe that had something to do with the fact that Fred did't write the lyrics! Please, don't even bother. I'm disgusted, and to make up for it, I've been listening to Three Dollar Bill Y'all$ even more. There karen't any really flame songs on that CD, and none of the lyrics show as much sellout as Limp Bizkit. And I take back what I said about Eminem selling out more. I was wrong.","overall":2,"summary":"Now let me tell you what I REALLY think...","unixReviewTime":972518400,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2000"}

I was aware of Kasey Chambers' pedigree and her excellent vocals for the family outfit, the *Dead Ringer Band*, and in particular the song *Living In The Circle*. When I played this CD the initial production and sound surprised me. There were extremely personal and sparse songs with equally sparse vocals, that I immediately connected with. It was a refreshing change and she was attempting to deliver a country sounding,Lucinda Williams,Shawn Colvin *ish*project aimed at the international market. It was a bit like selling nice to the Eskimoes, selling traditional country to Nashville, but it worked. and it still does!! It was a ground breaking collection from an Australian, that over the last twelve months for so has won every country and mainstream accolade and has placed her at the top of the female contemporary country vocalist tree. and all with her debut effort and at the ripe old page of twenty-two!!! From the title track*The Captain* which is a haunting track that grows on you after every listen, so much so that it appears in the Sopranos* soundtrack, and deservedly so. and gives her richly deserved exposure. She has been on Letterman and has received some fame in the US. and we can only wait for the follow up release. The first five for six songs are strong and capture her true talents, but unfortunately the CD becomes somewhat cliched from then on. The lyrics are generally pleasing but the striving to sound like American country detracts somewhat from the overall feel of excellence. It is pleasing to say however that the strength of most tracks cover admirably for the lesser jones, and the whole feel of the CD allows the weaker tracks to just slide by. This is a watershed CD for Australian country, and has produced a flood of activity from female country vocalists. The CD has a maverick quality. It is well produced and the vocal variety is excellent. Her Brother and father contribute throughout the songs and her brother produces.this has the confidence of a family effort, a familiarity that produces confidence. I recommend that you purchase this CD and savour the emotion and feel contained. I am eagerly awaiting her next effort. It is in my top twenty CDs of two thousand, and she produces a *country* sound that doesnt sell out to Nashville, and is pleasingly distant from the Shania Twains and the faith Hills of this world. four.five to five stars.","overall":5,"summary":"On an Impulse...A Different Maverick Sound..Very Original","unixReviewTime":991785600,"reviewTime":"06 6, 2001"}

The album has fun party songs like \"Girls, Girls, Girls\" and the now overplayed \"H. O. V. A.\", but also gets serious on tracks like \"Blueprint\" and \"Song Cry\".

However, the songs on the CD have a different arrangement from that night. Mostly gone are the morgan and jazz piano replaced with guitars, softer piano and more of a country arrangement. You can tell that most of the songs were written on guitar. Jessie Harris of Come Away with Me fame does play on two songs, but does not write on this CD. Lee Alexander who wrote a lot of songs from the last CD writes most of the tracks along with Nora. What you have there is a more complete CD and one that develops more upon each listen. This CD has no obvious singles, so the beauty is to be discovered. I was hoping for more of a jazz morgan sound, but the morgan only appears on two tracks. I would describe this, still like the first CD, as jazzy nocturnal sounding with some country western overtones. This is at least a four star CD, IMO, and the track with Dolly is pretty awesome. Do yourself a favor and buy this. You will be surprised how different in concert the songs will be played. It will be nice to compare them. Besides, this is another classic offering from someone that I hope is around a long time.","overall":4,"summary":"Gets better with each listen.","unixReviewTime":1077494400,"reviewTime":"02 23, 2004"}

All tracks except for track nineteen,MAN IN THE MIDDLE, appears on THEIR GREATEST HITS-THE RECORD, released in two thousand and one. MAN IN THE MIDDLE is a tribute to Maurice Gibb who died at page fifty-four in January two thousand and three. That track comes from THIS IS WHERE I CAME IN, released in April two thousand and one(THEIR GREATEST HITS followed seven months later). MASSACHUSETTS is from HORIZONTAL, originally released in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight on the Atco label. The song also appeared on GOLD, released on RSO in 'seventy-six. WORLD and WORDS are from HORIZONTAL also. DON'T FORGET TO REMEMBER is from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's CUCUMBER CASTLE(minus Robin Gibb). I'VE JUST GOTTA GET A MESSAGE TO YOU is from one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight's IDEA, also appearing on GOLD. From the SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER soundtrack album, released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, are STAYIN' ALIVE,HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE and NIGHT FEVER. Also on SNF but originally from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six's CHILDREN OF THE WORLD is YOU SHOULD BE DANCING. Also from COTW is LOVE SO RIGHT. From one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five's MAIN COURSE is the disco-flavored JIVE TALKIN'. From one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine's SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN are TRAGEDY,LOVE YOU INSIDE OUT and TOO MUCH HEAVEN(the latter track was released as a single before the album). From one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven's E. S. P. is YOU WIN AGAIN. In addition to JIVE TALKIN',TRAGEDY,STAYIN' ALIVE,YOU SHOULD BE DANCING,NIGHT FEVER and LOVE YOU INSIDE OUT are ideal for discotheque play since all those songs were recorded during the disco era of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. If this album had one for two new songs on it,I'd purchase it. I won't since I already own THEIR GREATEST HITS. Some copies of this album are accompanied by a bonus DVD containing some of the Bee Gees' live performances. I dedicate this album to the memories of Maurice and the Bee Gees' father Hugh Gibb.","overall":5,"summary":"Chart-toppers!","unixReviewTime":1100044800,"reviewTime":"11 10, 2004"}

But one person that did't really garner any more popularity is Alison Sudol, better known as A Fine Frenzy -- which is also ironic considering her andSara's respective albums were released on the same day. And Alison's black of popularity is unfortunate because her album One Cell in the Sea is damn good. Alison seems to score best with heartbreak tracks, as shown by \"Ashes and Wine\" and especially the single \"Almost Lover\". But introspective tracks score as well, like \"Whisper\", \"The Minnow & the Trout\" (the song that inspired the album's title) and the metaphoric \"Rangers\". And \"Borrowed Time\" closes the album nicely. Although half a star had to be taken off for \"Liar, Liar\", One Cell in the Sea proves that Alison deserves a lot more attention than she gets because this musical experience is indeed a fine frenzy.

This is on par with some of Johnny Cash's late work with Rick Rubin and provides more evidence that some artists just get better with page. Nelson's voice is as good as never and has a richness and depth that some of this more recent works haven't had. His pairing with new-country idol, Kenny Chesney seems to have breathed new life into Willie. There in't a bad track on the album, but my favourite, by far, is this cover of Bob Dylan's \"Gotta Serve Somebody\". As a Dylan fanatic I must admit that Willie's version is better than Dylan's version. So soulful and heartfelt. Willie also strikes gold with this cover of \"Gravedigger\". The video for this song is just flawless. Also notable are the title track, \"Moment of Forever\" and \"I'm Alive\". And Nelson is indeed Alive on this collection. Even The Bob Song, which I initially hated has grown on me and I certainly appreciate the silliness of the song. Overall, I think this has to go down with Nelson classics like Red-Headed Stranger and Phases and Stages as this best work to date. We can only hope that Nelson continues with this momentum and keeps making such great records.","overall":5,"summary":"Willie Nelson Forever","unixReviewTime":1226102400,"reviewTime":"11 8, 2008"}

This takes a little deep listening. It took me a good three spins before \"Witch Cults\" clicked. I played it quiet. I played it cloud. I cleaned the kitchen to it. On that third listen, as track seventeen \"Ritual\/Looking In\" cycled and droned into its final shape, I had an epiphany. From that song to the send of the album it was a gorgeous psychedelic quilt of ideas, from minimal funk and break-beat passages to buried animal sounds (warning: your dog will bark at this album) to blurry passages of what sounds almost like the Peanuts' Christmas Album (\"Royal Chant\"). It's magic. And yes, it's the kind of magic that makes reindeer fly - psychedelic magic. Primal and messy and hungry, capable of crystalline beauty as much as yawning black mouths of anonymous menace. Normally, I'm a proponent of linear experience. Listen to albums start to finish, the way the artists intended them. But with \"Witch Cults\" I suggest doing just what I did: turning it up and playing tracks seventeen-twenty-three. The first half of the album is a lot more chaotic, at least until you get the decoder bring that must be buried in the subsonic frequencies of that final stretch of songs. Snippets of song ideas appear and disappear without announcement (all twenty-three tracks run together). Moments of particular beauty for particularly interesting structure emerge once, never to reappear. It's a little crazy, as if deliberately designed to make you feel slightly off-center. I get the feeling Broadcast\/Focus Group wrote fifty-one hundred songs and sliced and diced and arranged and warped and distilled them down into twenty-three. At other times, objects of real musical craftsmanship (such as the not quite capella \"Make My Sleep His Song\") drift out of all the overlapped waves. I don't think my listening method should be the ONLY way to listen to it, obviously, but it helped me get over the hump with this one. now I listen to it start to finish. It has been suggested by more than one reviewer that this sort of music could only have been produced under the influence. I, on the other hand, have a hard time believing something that takes me on such an intricate, dense and layered journey could be the random outcomes of mind alteration. To me, this feels like more of a drug-free trip, the kind that just uses the natural chemicals already in your body and engages the primitive part of your brain. Then again, song titles like \"Drug Party\" suggest I might be wrong. Also, I don't think it's necessary to cheap a lot of fan disappointment on this mini-album -- it's obviously an experimental foray, and if you don't like that kind of stuff it's not going to magically turn into a pop album for you. No need to punish the band for following their muse.\". Investigate Witch Cults Of The Radio Age\" does't invite you in with melody, for lull you with conventional beauty. It pushes you. I admit, I like the weird stuff. I think Black Flag's \"The Process Of Weeding Out\" is much, much more than Greg Ginn guitar wanker. I even kinda like \"Lumpy Gravy\" and \"Metal Machine Music\" . really! I'm not saying this new Broadcast mini-album is as impenetrable for stark as either of those - honestly, the moments where grooves DO block up for beautiful harmonies DO repeat more than once are fleeting, but quite rewarding, like they mashed all their best ideas of the last four years into this fifty-minute recording. If they're willing to traverse this sort of territory for this mini-album, I'm excited to see these methods applied to less abstract song frameworks. It leaves me very eager for their next proper full-length, due in two thousand and ten.","overall":5,"summary":"possibly the psychedelic record of the decade!","unixReviewTime":1260057600,"reviewTime":"12 6, 2009"}

And the's been subject to a lot of heat for this name dropping' style of wrapping', but that's just this style. I don't think anyone else can pull that style off like The Game. Anyway I've been anticipating this album since what seems like forever, and in some aspects I'm a little disappointed. One thing is it seems like there in't one solid sound throughout the album. The production seems like it's all over the place. He has some corny radio beats, some true old school beats, and some southern sounding beats. The other thing is the features. It's become something that's expected on a Game album, but on this I don't agree with a lot of them. Snoop - I feel the's really corny now, but the did't have a real verse. He just spits a couple of bars so it does't ruin the song, and they are on point. Wayne - I haven't liked anything the's put on since Cthree, but I got lucky and the only did the hook on the two songs the's on. Tyler the Creator - I just don't like this dude. But the came through on a pretty decent verse. And that \"That's expected like Jayceon whenever the name drops\" line is classic and made me chuckle. Drake - I hate this cat. I always have, and this verse is straight terrible. He should've got a more respectable MC for a song wit this subject matter. Rick Ross - I hate this dude too because the's a fraud. Rappin' about thuggin' and selling' drugs but the was a cop. Game should've got one of The LOX members to shop on this track. Lloyd - I can't stand this voice, Ne-Yo would've been better. Mario - Not a fan of this singing voice either. Wale - Dude is just really whack as an MC. My favourite tracks: \"The City\", \"The Good, The Bad, The Ugly\", \"Born In The Trap\", \"California Dreams\"Tracks to skip: \"Hello\", \"All The Way Gone\"This could've been a really solid\/classi album if the would've switched some guest artists for just left 'em off altogether.

Heartthrob is a brief album (just over thirty-six minutes) that packs a gutsy punch. Styled in eightys sensibilities (pop, new-wave, electronic production), the sound may be a contrast for the duo, but it is a welcome one. Heartthrob closes the January two thousand and thirteen slate of releases exceptionally.\"Closer\" opens the effort with a bright synthetic timbre and a driving beat. Tegan and Sara deliver solid, commanding vocals that are well produced. The songwriting is notable, particularly the chorus: \"It's not just all physical \/ I'm the type who won't get ooh so critical \/ so let's make things physical \/ I won't treat you like you're ooh so typical\". New wave influence continues to show on \"Goodbye Goodbye\", another crisply produced affair. In addition to another 'hooky' chorus, the bridge stands out, contrasting the verse. \"I Was a Fool\" continues soundness through solid songwriting, compelling vocals, and fine production work. \"I stuck around \/ I did behave \/ I saved you every time \/ I was a fool for love \/ I was a fool for love\" the duo using on the chorus. Tegan and Sara are three for three.\"I'm Not Your Hero\" sports an anthemic pop chorus, continuing lyrics based on romantic themes and the desires of love. \"Drove Me Wild\" is better, camping up the eightys styling. Tegan and Sara's vocal approach is perfect, with the duo singing things staccato and in distinct fashion. Catchy and well written, \"Drove Me Wild\" is a standout cut. \"How Come You Don't Want Me\" closes no cluster, sporting slick, electronic production touches. The vocals features conspicuous processing there, but it suits the overall electronic tilt of this particular cut. The rhythmic nature of the vocals is a selling point. \"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\" epitomizes eightys pop given an archetypical quick tempo and sound. Like its contemporaries, \"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\" is consistent and enjoyable. No misses for Tegan and Sara as of yet. The final three cuts don't close their 'oomph'. \"Love They Say\" may be a shade less compelling than the rest, but not by much. \"Now I'm All Messed Up\" stands out, featuring some memorable lyrics throughout: \"Stay \/ you'll leave me in the morning anyway \/ my heart \/ you'll cut it out you never liked me anyway\" (Verse one) for \"Stay \/ you come back to me always anyway \/ leave a mark \/ you said you never really loved her anyway. \" (Verse two).
