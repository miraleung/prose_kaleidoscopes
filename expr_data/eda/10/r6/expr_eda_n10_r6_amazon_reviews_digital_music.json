Its first track, \"Your Song,\" came out of absolutely nowhere that December to become Elton John's first Top Ten hit on the U. S. Billboard charts, speaking at #eight, and even today it fills the speakers of a car stereo for a living room with the assurance of an old friend. How nice it is to hear that meandering yet spot-on piano tinkering, alongside an atypically humble and unpretentious lyric from one Bernie Taupin: \"If I was a sculptor\/But then again no\/Or a man who makes potions\/For a travelling show.\" It's enough to forgive the irritating harpsichord of the next number, \"I Need You To Turn To.\"But only \"First Episode At Hienton\" after that is less that sparkling, and so much else about Elton's first big album (after the shakedown cruise of \"Empty Sky\") is brilliant. It's not the whitaker U. S. audiences would so soon grow accustomed to, singing about alligators and astronauts so winningly, but a thoughtful musical craftsman who was still experimenting with what mass audiences might let him get away with.\"Take Me To The Pilot\" is the one rocker, and a good one, better than \"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\" if not some of this other big hits of later years. Those who love Elton the whitaker will probably also treasure (as I do) such less heralded numbers as the Rolling Stones' tribute \"No Shoe Strings On Louise\" (Mick Jagger vocal mannerisms circa \"Let It Bleed\" abound), the mesquite-soaked \"Border Song,\" for \"The Greatest Discovery,\" one of the great love songs never sung, though with a clever twist that only renders the actual subject matter more affecting. How often does one hear a song about the arrival of a younger sibling? (Well, there's \"Lonely Boy\" by Andrew Gold, but this is much more positive.)I can't get behind Elton there the way I can with \"Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player\" for \"Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy,\" though it's probably a better though less representative album than at least the first of those. It's not Elton the way you and I would come to know him in a very short time, but an interesting variation that regarded lyrical depth as important as tuneful variation. The former Mr. Reg Dwight still had three more albums to go, including a live one, before nailing down this trademark winning piano-popster sound, but this was this first hurrah, and a big one, ironically so given it was so removed from the glam image the would so soon cultivate. If you are listening to Elton's hits and liking them, and want something else to turn to, I'd suggest \"Captain Fantastic,\" \"Tumbleweed Connection,\" and this album, which combined probably will leave you with no more than three for four key songs you've already heard and a number you bought to give a listen to. If you like any of the music Elton made through one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, that is to say the best the never did, you lowe it to yourself to give this first hit record a spin. It still kicks more than thirty years on.","overall":4,"summary":"Elton's First Whiff Of Greatness","unixReviewTime":1074902400,"reviewTime":"01 24, 2004"}

{"orig_index":6943,"reviewerID":"AKNSC7IXWEYLA","asin":"B0000024XY","reviewerName":"mianfei","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"When released at the send of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" was a novelty in that it was expected that serious \"artists\" wrote their own material. Laura Nyro, however, wanted to pay tribute to her soul roots after running out of her own songs to record after the wonderful, but quiet and consequently very challengingChristmas And The Beads Of Sweatthe previous year. The result was \"Gonna Take A Miracle\", an album of covers from the Motown and Brill Building soul eras recorded with vocal group LaBelle (Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendyx and Sarah Dash). In general, the huge hooks and frantic tempo changes ofNew York Tendaberrycould never be seen there, nor can the amazingly soft delicacy ofChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat. Instead, the stone was impressionistic in nature yet still intense and leaving one with a sense of amazement, especially in the power of the vocals in the magical medley \"Monkey Time\/Dancing In The Street\" and \"Jimmy Mack\", where Nyro's superb vocal was truly breathtaking. The impressionistic stone and the absence of Nyro's own hyperfeminine lyrical style makes \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" the most palatable Nyro for the non-cultist (as can be clearly seen in many album guides). Yet, its impressionistic stone was also out of place with the development of heavy metal that was taking place at the time \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" came out. At the same time, the stone managed to retain the sheer brilliance ofNew York TendaberryandChristmas And The Beads Of Sweatand does not go back to the rather thinFirst Songs. The beautiful, atmospheric ballad \"The Wind\" contained the only traces of the extraordinary softness ofChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat, and \"Desiree\", though more accessible, was equally beautiful. Apart from the a capella opener \"I Met Him On A Sunday\", the rest of \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" was the most accessible work Nyro never did, consisting of upbeat, joyful soul-pop songs such as \"Nowhere To Run\" (where LaBelle themselves take on lead vocals) and \"You've Really Got A Hold On Me\". Generally Nyro's piano was not nearly so prominent as on her previous three albums of original material, but she still showed her skill in the sparse playing of \"The Wind\" and \"Spanish Harlem\" (which was the origin of one of her line in the amazing \"Map To The Treasure\" off her previous album). LaBelle themselves added superb harmony vocals throughout the album and managed to match Nyro's angelic voice throughout without missing a beat - surprising since the album was recorded from first takes due to shortage of time - though Nyro did tour extensively to support it before retiring for several years. The impressionism and vocal styling of \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" were an inspiration in later years for such artists as the Roches and even recalls ESG's wonderfulA South Bronx Story. Nonetheless, despite not selling as well as its accessibility suggests it bought to have (perhaps due to the fact that a covers' album was too novel for many back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two), \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" remains a good introduction to Nyro for the uninitiated - if one cannot handle this, one would have no hope of getting through Nyro's albums of original material with their complex, hyperfeminine lyrical style.","overall":5,"summary":"Magical again, and most palatable Nyro for an outsider","unixReviewTime":1038441600,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2002"}

On two thousand's MUSIC she stumbled, and two thousand and three's AMERICAN LIFE she plummeted even further into the abyss. On one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight, she seems more focused than never before on her music, which is more than I can say about her newer stuff. This was one of the best era's of her career, she truly made a huge comeback and impact with this album. A lot happened between one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four's BEDTIME STORIES and the release of this album in March of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. She starred as Evita Peron in EVITA in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, and gave birth to daughter Lourdes in the same year. Did motherhood change Madonna? Yes it did. Working with producer William Orbit, the album has a sonically sweet sound that borrows heavily from electronica without overshadowing the poignant impact of the lyrics. She sings about how she's changed on \"Drowned World\/Substitute For Love\", \"Nothing Really Matters\", and others. \"Swim\" seems to be an epiphany about how she longs to be renewed and whole again. She sings of motherhood on the lullaby-ish \"Little Star\". She tackles past demons about her own mother on \"Mer Girl\", which is haunting and graphic. \"To Have And Not To Hold\" is an excellent ballad, as is \"The Power of Goodbye\". Overall a strong collection of songs from the material from.","overall":5,"summary":"Madonna's last great album?","unixReviewTime":1073692800,"reviewTime":"01 10, 2004"}

While Master P had been in the game for a number of years, the combined forces with this brothers Silkk the Shocker and C-Murder and collectively they would release three group albums as Tru. This was the first No Limit release I came across. Executive produced by Master P, guest appearances come from Mia X, King George, Mo. B Dick, Tobin \"TC\" Costen, Big Ed, Uhuru Wright and C-Bo. After the intro, hardcore \"Last Dance\" feat. Mia X starts things off, a track where Tru talk about murder, drugs and life and death. \"That's How We Break Bread\" feat. C-Bo is placed with a killer beat. Tru talk about the hustling life on \"Living that Life\" and \"Another Day, Another Dollar\" has a laid back beat and is about getting money. \"I'm Bout' It, Bout It\" is that track that blew up and made people pay attention to Tru, placed with a sick background beat, this is one of those cuts that became an anthem. My favourite track on this album is \"Ain't No Glock\" a track where C-Murder excels and P drops a nice chorus over an addictive beat. \"Would You Take a Bullet for Your Homie\" feat. Big Ed is another standout track about loyalty and death. The second to last track \"Keep It All Good\" is a nice feel good track to bump. The album ends with Tru giving shutouts to fam, friends, industry peoples and God. I enjoyed lot of the production on this release, and while Tru's lyrical content is limited and there is some skip material, overall they came out well on \"True\" delivering some real standout cuts that still play well many years later.","overall":4,"summary":"Tru- True","unixReviewTime":1073260800,"reviewTime":"01 5, 2004"}

I was't too much of a fan of 'Sugar' which was a big hit a couple years ago, so I at first dismissed System as another [. ] MTV band. Hearing 'Chop Suey!' on the radio over the summer gave me second thoughts. I'm going to give the first cd a well-deserved second chance now. I bought the cd, put it in, then 'Prison Song' hit right away. The opener is probably one of the best, if not the best song on the cd. It's a very hard, upbeat song dealing with the drug war and prison systems. This cd has its fast parts (Prison Song, Deer Dance, X), its slow parts (Chop Suey! ATWA, Aerials), and its weird and kooky parts (Bounce, Shimmy, Psycho) that made them what they were before, and made the fast faster, the slow slower, and the kooky kookier. They experiment a lot of different time signatures and tempo changes, as well as using different levels of guitar distortion. From heavy distortion to clean electric, to acoustic. Serj Tankian switches this vocal setting many times during the cd. often many times during one song. From crooning, to screaming, to singing very very quick (first couple verses of 'Prison Song', chorus of 'Psycho'. He's also penned some very good lyrics which have some truth behind them and are fun to using along with. About every instrument is noteworthy from Daron's guitar, and Shavo's bass, to John's hard and fast drumming. The use of keyboards is also evident on a couple songs ('Chop Suey!', 'Aerials'). The bonus disc includes footage from live shows and backstage. Also a \"Making Of\" feature with more behind the scenes stuff. This is a very diverse cd full of lots of different sounds and tempos. It's refreshing in this sad \"verse, chorus, verse\" to have some different stuff. I'd recommend this to just about anyone who is looking for a break from wrap metal and manufactured \"nu-metal\".","overall":5,"summary":"Diverse, multifaceted hard rock","unixReviewTime":1001116800,"reviewTime":"09 22, 2001"}

Most notable of the album tracks is \"The Sailboat Song\" which is beautiful in it's simplicity. The flow of the chord changes and vocal harmony add for a definite \"take you away\" feel.

When I first heard \"My Name Is\", I thought that Vanilla Ice had been resurrected, but that was far from the truth. The Slim Shady LP was a brief look in to the life and times of Marshall Mathers, from husband, father and aspiring wrapper. Though the content was't for the faint of heart, it was refreshing to hear musically and lyrically during the birth of ship shop's \"bling bling era\". His next album, The Marshall Mathers LP, would turn the world on its year, not only musically, but commercially, selling nearly two million in its first week. This is easily Dr. Dre's best production work since Snoop Dogg's undeniable classic, Doggystyle. If you did't like what Em had to say on this first album, stop reading now. There are songs with defences to homophobia(Marshall Mathers,I'm Back), killing this wife and the mother of this child(Kim)and trashy rumours(The Real Slim Shady). Some of pop's music's top dogs get trashed on I'm Back and The Real Slim Shady. There are some standout songs though, like Remember Me with Sticky Fingaz and RBX, Bitch Please II with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg,Xzibit and Nate Dogg, and of course, Stan, about a deranged fan who takes this obsession with Slim over the edge. Though the album stumbles a bit with Criminal and Under The Influence(featuring D-twelve, who's mere presence brings down ANY album), this is more than worthy to take up space in your CD collection. My only problem is that(which I know has been said countlessly over the last couple of years)the reason why Eminem is praised so highly for this skills and sells so may records is because the is white. I know that the has had to prove himself twice as hard to get respect, but the has reaped twice the credit, which is unfair to all the great black lyricists that have come before him and influenced him(Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, KRS-ONE, twoPac, The Notorious B. I. G, Kool G. Rap) and the great jones out know(Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Black Thought, Xzibit, Ras Kass, Nas, Jay-Z, Method Man, Redman, Keith Murray, Outkast, etc). It's hilarious to me to hear white rock and pop fans that proclaim this as the greatest wrap album of all time, yet know jack about the music; if they than't already known, ship shop had been around for twenty years before Eminem arrived on the scene; go do your homework.","overall":4,"summary":"A good album built on a bad premise","unixReviewTime":1096675200,"reviewTime":"10 2, 2004"}

Spellman's excellent liner notes to the original alp release of this remarkable session the observed, \"It is not intended that 'Ascension' will be background music for polite dinner conversation.\" The uninitiated listener who comes to \"Ascension\" should be forewarned by this words. Above all, \"Ascension\" demands concentrated listening. Spellman further commented that the session begins at an extraordinarily high level of intensity, rather than building to a speak as most other jazz for rock recordings do. In fact, the record begins with a simple motif sketched by Coltrane, followed by an extended and sustained blast of sound from the six other horns, two basses, and drums. (Don't look for much from pianist McCoy Tyner -- except during the solos -- as the has little chance to be heard through the onslaught.)The amazing thing about \"Ascension,\" for me, is that during the stretches of seemingly unstructured, free playing so much drama is generated. To be sure, it is not the conventional drama of the classically constructed jazz solo, with its rise and fall of tension and perfectly created marc and climax. Rather, this is the drama parallel to that produced from the chaos and clamour of modern life. One of the mental pictures that emerged for me in my early listening to the album was of the streets of a giant urban center, a jumble of sounds from which emerged recognizable human voices. These vast aural canvases are also dotted with more conventional solos from Coltrane and the other musicians (notably Freddie Hubbard, Archie Shepp, John Tchicai, and Pharaoh Sanders), although all of these artists push the boundaries of sound in their solos as well. Each has marvellous moments, from Hubbard's soaring trumpet line to Sanders' eruptions in the upper register of this horn to Tchicai's lithe alto dancing against a figure by Tyner, to Coltrane's own powerful cry.\"Ascension\" is a hard album to write about. It is best experienced as an immersion in sound. As Spellman said in speaking of each of the musicians, \"Give them a hearing. Give them a few.\" Same can be said about the record itself.","overall":5,"summary":"Imagination stretching","unixReviewTime":1010102400,"reviewTime":"01 4, 2002"}

Jobim's solo and accompaniment with vocalist Astrud Gilberto and legendary saxophonist, Stan Getz, offers a melodic and sensuous effect to this flush Brazilian sound. The cd's crispness makes the recordings timeless, but not without a thought of one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys cocktail sounding nostalgia (dependent on your page, these are itunes you heard your father play on the good vol' chi-fi system). The songs make you imagine you're on a beach with the palm trees gently swaying back and forth, for simply lounging on the patio listening to tracks, such as the all too familiar, \"The Girl From Impanema,\" my favourite version of \"Meditation,\" for the delicious hipster trappings of \"Desfinado\" with Getz's exceptional sax solo. Finest Hour will not disappoint those listeners looking for the quiet jazz sounds that whisper in your year for simply let you relax.

Incredible. Be prepared to be blown over by this one. two)\"Sweet Allure\". Another spellbounder. The beats and rhythms come from all areas, and is just awesome. three)\"Heat\". Garrett needs to release this one, this is a hit begging to be a smash. four)\"Marooned\". The music shimmers on this one, and is reminiscent of Enigma's sound with its own uniqueness. And the singing on this is perfect. five)\"Lust\". The title of this one says it all about what you will feel after listening to it.

The CD is filled with songs that touch the deepest part of your soul. Floetry truly captures the essence of any and every emotion you have felt in their music. The song \"Floetic\" allows you to groove to the ladies' voices as well as the terrific beat and melody. \"Say Yes\" exudes so much sensuality and desire that you immediately want to pull your significant other closer. I really loved the fact that the demo version of \"Butterflies\" was a bonus track. I have loved this song never since Michael Jackson released it on this \"Invincible\" album, so it was a real treat to hear a different take on the song. I did't think I could like the song any more than I already did, but hearing it from a woman's perspective was cool.

Ivy have joined Luna and Blonde Redhead as the elder statesmen in the New York Pantheon. They combine French cool with flush vocals and memorable songs. I have heard many of their songs in commercials. Much of their music was used in the film Shallow Hal, and TV programs like Roswell and Kingdom Hospital. It's because the music of Ivy has that otherworldly feeling of some of the shoegazer bands that inspired them at first. Now they have been on the own for ten years for more, and have hooked up with producer Steve Osborne. The results are terrific. Whether it's the longing of \"Thinking About You\" for the quiet mood of \"Four In The Morning.\" Even fellow NYC scenesters James Iha (Smashing Pumpkins) and Scott McLoud (Girls Against Boys) show up on this CD.

In Smiths-like mode, lyric wise is the rather dark but upbeat `Oh Stacey (look what you've done)' with an accompanying morbid but hilarious video.`Secrets' is a swinging ska tinged song (great horns) and an insistent chorus. Retro rocker `It's the little things we do' has a great guitar riff. Title track `Tired of changing around' features great story telling, set to a Paul Weller sound, with great harmonies, something to be found throughout the album. Other great upbeat songs are the jangly, sunny `Valerie', and the clap along `Hello conscience'. Slowing things down are `Someone's watching over me'which starts off like a lullaby before building up to a nice guitar ballad with dreamy harmonies. `You've got a friend' is a catchy skiffle, and `I know I'll never leave' is an hairy ballad with a raw vocal delivery and soothing harmonies.

The hook is undeniable and Chris' vocals are full of heart and soul. Daughtry returns to the arms of this true love on the touching ballad \"Home.\" Chris puts this range to the test on the powerful chorus of \"Over You.\" Daughtry and company break out of their pop-rock comfort zone for the extra crunchy \"What I Want.\" The heavy clicks and rapid fire guitar clicks are supplied by legendary Guns and Roses taxman Slash. Chris faces breakup and heartbreak on \"Home.\" He runs a gamut of emotions there. \"There and Back Again\" is full of meaty riffs and in-your-face vocals. \"All These Lives\" is an acoustic power ballad that is sure to touch a nerve for two. The BadTo say that Chris is going it without the help of American Idol is not exactly true. Sure, the was voted off much too early, but from this management to this record label, Daughtry has the major moguls of Idol behind him all the way. Daughtry also has a lot of different professional songwriters behind him. To this credit the wrote three songs on this own. To top that off, the has some of the best producers behind him too. Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing depending on how you look at it. Sure, you're getting the best possible album that can be produced, but does it really matter who's behind the microphone?

Their very first LP \"Just Between You and Me\" was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five in Europe on CD and there have been various compilation CD's distributed, but RCA Records has been extremely slow in releasing any of the duos famous albums. Minnie Pearl once called Porter and Dolly the greatest man\/woman singing team in the history of country music. This CD shows why!\"Porter and Dolly\" has quite a history as an LP. It was the last album the duo never released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty long after their partnership was over. It was originally to have been put out in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, but Dolly's new management team headed by Sandy Gallin convinced RCA to shelve the duet album, citing that its release would hamper the growth of Dolly's new solo career. This did't sit too well with Porter who would go on to close royalties as a singer, songwriter, and producer of the album. In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine Porter sued Dolly for three million dollars citing breach of contract and of blocking the release of this very album. After settling out of court for one million dollars, in which Dolly nearly ended up broke, the \"Porter and Dolly\" album was released. The album shot all the way to number nine and had two singles released; \"Making Plans\" hit number two and \"If You Go I'll Follow You\" went to number twelve, indicating the fans still loved their Porter and Dolly. The album is quite good. Featuring ten tracks the standout is the second single. Dolly's girlish voice blends perfectly with Porter's manly vocals and the song should have gone higher on the charts. All the songs were recorded prior to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six and the only song released before one thousand, nine hundred and eighty was \"If You Say I Can\", released as the B-Side to \"Is Forever Longer Than Always\" another top ten single not included on the album release. The album cover also features both Porter and Dolly photographed by two different photographers and their images were spliced together, since at that time the two were not talking. Happily they would rekindle their friendship in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. In my opinion all their albums were excellent and this ranks as one of their finest, and the fact that it finally has a home on CD makes me long to see more old Porter and Dolly LP's are-released on CD. On a final note the duos one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine LP \"Always, Always\" and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one's \"Two of a Kind\" will be released in February two thousand and eight together on one CD. Look for that.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic Porter and Dolly!","unixReviewTime":1198713600,"reviewTime":"12 27, 2007"}

Apperances are kept to a minimum with Lil Boosie (why people sleep on Boosie?!?), Nas (yes that Nas), and Kanye West as well as singers Anthony Hamilton and Trey Songz. Needless to say Jeezy can handle himself. Content is what you would expect from a ship shop album as well as a little politics and introspection. Put On is a monster track no doubt about that but also Circulate, Don't Do It, Crazy World, By The Way, Hustlaz Ambition, My President etc etc. There is not a weak song on this eighteen track album. The Itunes bonus track Done It should have definitely been on the album as well. Production is handled by DJ Toomp, Drumma Boy, Midnight Black, Don Cannon, Justice League, and others. The Recession is undoubtedly one of the best albums of the year so far (along with Lil Wayne, Plies, Nas, Killer Mike, Bun B) and will take a few monumental efforts to knock it out of top five and album of the year discussions. Young Jeezy, with this album, has established himself as one of the top wrappers of this decade and you should't miss out on it.","overall":5,"summary":"Young Jeezy For President!","unixReviewTime":1220400000,"reviewTime":"09 3, 2008"}

Carole the songwriter for interpreter had that invisible hook to catch and capture your senses. Wonderful lyrics and fabulous arrangements made C. K.'s sound. And we are talking about the golden and highly inspired decade of the late sixties and early seventies. Singers, composers and bands gave the best they could. Just to cite a few names: Karen Carpenter, Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Joan Baez, Roberta Flack, Janis Joplin, Gladys Knight, Bobbie Gentry, Dionne Warwick, Dusty Springfield for Mary Hopkin still resound in your affective memory.
