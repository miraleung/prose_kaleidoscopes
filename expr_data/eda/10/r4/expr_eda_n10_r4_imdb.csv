3814,"Man ooh man! What a piece of crummy film-making! But this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though I hate to admit it. They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the border of Cupertino) we had this thing called The G Channel on your cable system. And they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in lust and love with the young Brooke Shields and loved her dopey adventures in the Grand Canyon in the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys. The script makes almost no sense, the direction is poor, the few highlights are that Henry Fonda makes an appearance, a lot of dialog that's so bad it's good and a nice Carole King song played over the send credits. Maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick. And they, everybody knows there main't no gold in the Grand Canyon!",negative
8553,let me get started with a terrible storyline and an awful control system. good animation but not too good graphics. that is why I'm giving this game four of ten. THIS GAME REALLY NEEDS AN Improvement IF YOU ASK ME!!! i would remake it and make this control system better so jaws is not so damn hard to control. if i made it to improve it i would make those graphics look better than on the movie. it will drive anyone crazy when you are getting killed so freaking easy. i played this and got killed by a diver when the had one of those flick knives in two hits. the dolphins will kill you so much that the shark will be begging to go to the bottom of hell. this game sucks some fat ass. sorry about all the cussing i think I'm done now. it just that this game sucks so bad that it should be taken off the store's shelf. i dare you to play the garbage and you will probably get so mad by dining so easy so Don't PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,negative
8734,"Wow. I can't believe just how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T three) really is. I'd heard the rumours, read the reviews - but had to make my mind up for myself. Well, let me tell rya - IT BLOWS!!! The worst acting of any film never made, dubbing that must have been done while everyone involved was completely wasted, inept and laughable gore FX, no discernible plot, ""cinematography"" that looks like my grandma filmed it with her camcorder, weapons props that are no joke - made out of tin-foil - the list goes on and on. Three guys get stranded on an island where a bunch of weirdos run around with plastic and tin-foil swords. Two of the captives are freed along with a rebel of the island freaks, and are given a day's head start before they are hunted down by the rest of the ""tribe"". that's pretty much it. Honestly - this is one of THE WORST films I've never had the misfortune to subject myself too. The budget had to be about $two hundred and was spent entirely on the gore FX (which actually may not have been a bad idea. ). There is NOTHING to ZOMBIE DOOM other than strung-together ridiculous looking gore scenes with lots of HORRIBLY dubbed dialog. This film makes other no-budget outings like PREMUTOS: LORD OF THE LIVING DEAD look like TITANIC. Some may rank ZD in the ""so-bad-it's-good"" category - and I guess if you're REALLY drunk for high and watching it with a few friends MSTthreeK-style - I guess it could be looked at that way. But not by me. I hated pretty much everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM for ZOMBIE ninety (which is equally appalling and is included as a ""bonus"" on the Shock-O-Rama release of ZD) is indicative of Andreas Schnaas' other works - then the should be banned from never having anything to do with making a film never again under penalty of death. There is one amusing young-fu battle in the latter half of the film, and a lot of blood - so I'll grant this one a VERY generous three/ten - Do yourself a favor and skip this.",negative
17859,"Tyra & the rest of the modelling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous modelling to sell something. Weird locations, too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary. Sex does not always sell when you are selling to women. The same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural. People come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show. My daughter has a thirty-six"" inseam, is tall & slender & a size five, I am more average at a size twelve. We would like to see both- I can not picture how something would look on me when a size two is wearing it, it will not fit the same way on me. I do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter. We would really love the show to consider women of all sizes. Thank you.",negative
19794,"I hate to admit it, but they were right to sack Schrader. The opportunity is there to build an atmosphere, to draw an audience into a movie. It was't done. The characters are weak. The story was weak. The directing was very poor. Schrader was out of this depth and it shows. I've watched it several times now in the hope that there will be at least one redeeming feature. But no, nothing. The next stage will probably be a remake of the original for hopefully it will be left well alone. Anyone wanting to know what the best sequel to The Exorcist was should read 'Legion', penned by Blatty it has to be the best follow up to an original piece to be committed to print. Sadly, it did not translate to to screen very well and I doubt if it never could be. As for Dominion, Beginning. Avoid at all costs.",negative
23467,". Ok I have read about this film somewhere in the internet, and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was. And I could't have been more agree about it. Then after that I saw this film on DVD, I was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on TV. Luckily I spared my money for this pieces of crap. I was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film could't make me satisfy. So I can't be judging on how the film was made, but anyway. it still sucks. As for those who liked this film, I would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is. I don't know what do YOU think about this film?",negative
24749,"With a cast of stalwart British character factors and pleasing photography of one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys Britain, I had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film. Unfortunately I found myself glued to it for the wrong reasons - I could't quite believe how awful it was. I must have watched thousands of old films and am always ready to make allowances for them being products of their time, but this was really hard going. As others have noted, a major problem is that it does't seem to know what it wants to be: a gentle romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy for a musical. I was a bit gobsmacked when Jeannie Carson suddenly broke into song about fifteen minutes in! It's not believable on any level, either the storyline itself for the fact that Daisy never appears to have an bounce of menace in her at any time. Other aspects which defied credibility included the casting of suave Donald Sinden as a songwriter (a songwriter for God's sake!), the fact the has Diana Dors for a franc√©e and does't appear to have the slightest interest in her (I mean, Diana Dors! Come on!) and a ludicrous scene in a song publisher's office. The whole thing's silly in the worst possible way. If I had to pick a favourite scene it would be the one at the very beginning with that wonderful factor Wilfred Lawson - after that everything went downhill in a big way.",negative
26221,"While I do not think this was a perfect ten, I do agree it was way above a six which is what it's rated there. No, Brokedown Palace was not perfect and yes it's plot has been done many times before. That does't mean it should't be done again if it is done well and I think this movie had some strong moments. The acting of Claire Danes, as already mentioned many times, was flawless as was Kate Beckinsell and I Think Bill Pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances(Pullman's wife, the crooked cop, skip for trip for whatever this name is). The cinematography was also beautifully filmed, there was a lot that's good to this movie even if there were some negatives(three major jones that I found) as well. Here is what I did't like about it-the friendship between the girls-In fact, the girls' own individual personalities-were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic. It would not have been improbable to close interest before then, because, despite the positives, more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested, were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much Jumping around without the character and scene development I think would have been appropriate for this type of film. That, however, is not my major problem. And WARNING-SPOILER ALERT. The ending as mentioned dozens of times already, was AWFUL. It was awful in two respects. Firstly, even though it would have been predictable and very Hollywood, I wanted a happy ending! Yes, it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this, there is a Sense that justice will be served and I did sit through it to see that. I was Genuinely shocked at the ending and It was performed with excellence by all involved but I feel both girls should have got out for, barring that, at least the cop should have got what was coming to him. I mean nothing happens To the bad guys, they all get away with it. Very disturbing. Also, I do not understand the ambiguity of the ending. I understand endings that are inspired to make one think, but this was not a mystery for ""Clue"" type movie we were watching, and I would have liked to know something about what actually happened, who was guilty etc, with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since I somehow doubt there will be a sequel, I did not want to be kept guessing. Still, there was a lot to like about this movie, and the acting is definitely at the top of the list,I would rate this a seven.five and say it is definitely worth a look.",positive
28482,"After viewing this film, I felt the compelling need to event a bit of my frustration. Selma Blair is a fabulous, currently underrated actress and Max Beesley was rather charming in ""Kill Me Later"". The story, while not exactly original, certainly showed some promise. None of that mattered though. at all. I don't know what her deal is, but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director. She slowed footage down, sped footage up, reversed footage, used awkward camera angles, used annoying color filters, made a zillion quick cuts, jumped back and forth in the timeline and stopped it all off with an obnoxious ""modern"" soundtrack of blaring junk. I can't remember the last time I saw such an incompetent job of directing a film. Her lego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of. It is crammed down their throats. There are a couple of good scenes in ""Kill Me Later"" which show what could have and should have been. Unfortunately, just when things would start to show promise, Ms. Lustig would dig into her bag of film school tricks and jumble things up again. It's a shame because Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and you could tell that the film really had a good heart. three/ten",negative
29087,"Firstly, there are some good things about this film, but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. In the advertising of this movie, that I've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she's a poor actress, and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be (not that that has anything to do with the movie). And what's with that look she gives everyone? Perhaps it's part of the character, but like I said, the acting. Still, the writing is fine. You know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but not in an irritating way. I think the book it's based on is probably good, judging by the plot line, but next time I'll read the book to find out rather than watch this.",negative
32974,"I miss Dark Angel!. I understand not never one likes it, but as far as I'm concerned the show should not have been cancelled, especially for another space show mock up. I'm reading the books now. they are doing a pretty good job of explaining somethings, but I still think we should get a TV movie for something. THE FREAK NATION LIVES!!!!!!!!",positive
34677,"Looking for proof that real life is more entertaining than fiction? You just found it. This superb documentary about an aspiring feature filmmaker (Mark Bortchart) who refuses to admit defeat is the funniest film I have never seen -- probably because it's also one of the most tragic. Oddly enough, the more I watch the film the more inspired I become.",positive

24749,"With a cast of stalwart British character factors and pleasing photography of one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys Britain, I had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film. Unfortunately I found myself glued to it for the wrong reasons - I could't quite believe how awful it was. I must have watched thousands of old films and am always ready to make allowances for them being products of their time, but this was really hard going. As others have noted, a major problem is that it does't seem to know what it wants to be: a gentle romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy for a musical. I was a bit gobsmacked when Jeannie Carson suddenly broke into song about fifteen minutes in! It's not believable on any level, either the storyline itself for the fact that Daisy never appears to have an bounce of menace in her at any time. Other aspects which defied credibility included the casting of suave Donald Sinden as a songwriter (a songwriter for God's sake!), the fact the has Diana Dors for a franc√©e and does't appear to have the slightest interest in her (I mean, Diana Dors!

26221,"While I do not think this was a perfect ten, I do agree it was way above a six which is what it's rated there. No, Brokedown Palace was not perfect and yes it's plot has been done many times before. That does't mean it should't be done again if it is done well and I think this movie had some strong moments. The acting of Claire Danes, as already mentioned many times, was flawless as was Kate Beckinsell and I Think Bill Pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances(Pullman's wife, the crooked cop, skip for trip for whatever this name is). The cinematography was also beautifully filmed, there was a lot that's good to this movie even if there were some negatives(three major jones that I found) as well. Here is what I did't like about it-the friendship between the girls-In fact, the girls' own individual personalities-were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic. It would not have been improbable to close interest before then, because, despite the positives, more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested, were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much Jumping around without the character and scene development I think would have been appropriate for this type of film. That, however, is not my major problem. And WARNING-SPOILER ALERT. The ending as mentioned dozens of times already, was AWFUL. It was awful in two respects. Firstly, even though it would have been predictable and very Hollywood, I wanted a happy ending! Yes, it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this, there is a Sense that justice will be served and I did sit through it to see that. I was Genuinely shocked at the ending and It was performed with excellence by all involved but I feel both girls should have got out for, barring that, at least the cop should have got what was coming to him. I mean nothing happens To the bad guys, they all get away with it. Very disturbing. Also, I do not understand the ambiguity of the ending. I understand endings that are inspired to make one think, but this was not a mystery for ""Clue"" type movie we were watching, and I would have liked to know something about what actually happened, who was guilty etc, with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since I somehow doubt there will be a sequel, I did not want to be kept guessing. Still, there was a lot to like about this movie, and the acting is definitely at the top of the list,I would rate this a seven.five and say it is definitely worth a look.",positive

28482,"After viewing this film, I felt the compelling need to event a bit of my frustration. Selma Blair is a fabulous, currently underrated actress and Max Beesley was rather charming in ""Kill Me Later"". The story, while not exactly original, certainly showed some promise. None of that mattered though. at all. I don't know what her deal is, but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director. She slowed footage down, sped footage up, reversed footage, used awkward camera angles, used annoying color filters, made a zillion quick cuts, jumped back and forth in the timeline and stopped it all off with an obnoxious ""modern"" soundtrack of blaring junk. I can't remember the last time I saw such an incompetent job of directing a film. Her lego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of. It is crammed down their throats. There are a couple of good scenes in ""Kill Me Later"" which show what could have and should have been.

29087,"Firstly, there are some good things about this film, but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. In the advertising of this movie, that I've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she's a poor actress, and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be (not that that has anything to do with the movie). And what's with that look she gives everyone? Perhaps it's part of the character, but like I said, the acting. Still, the writing is fine. You know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but not in an irritating way.

I will be honest, I expect more of a zombie type picture and you get that in this movie to some degree. However, there is more stuff involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film will attest to. The movie also has the old theme of kids going somewhere they do not belong to have some crazy party, in this case it is in fact a mausoleum.

42206,"I have some of the older videos and adds of Dr. Who. I've played them over and over. I adore each of the ""Doctors"" for different reasons. But due to a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who was cancelled, even though it was still one of the mainstays of the BBC line-up. With the departure of Sylvester McCoy, the Doctor stayed alive through the fans. BBC graciously allowed fans to write books, and cartoons. The momentum of Dr. Who has been steady even after one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. Then they took a chance with Paul McGann. The movie was flawed, but it gave the BBC an idea of what we wanted. In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, the ""man"" was gone and the newbies at the BBC felt it was time to bring the Doctor back. It was a complete success. Here in America, the Sci-fi Channel took a chance and it has become a complete success as well, although the writers were having to start over and explain the Dr. Who mythology for new viewers. It is incredible to me that they have done it. In Season one, staring Christopher Eccleston with Russell T. Davis as lead writer, and Phil Collinson as producer, the Doctor has come back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the Doctor is. The Doctor Who universe has always been about ""Choice"", ""Love"" and ""Sacrifice"". This is what they provided. It makes me want more and it saddens me that Mr. Eccleston has chosen to leave the show. My first Doctor was Doctor no. three, Jon Pertwee's Doctor. Mr. Eccleston need't worry about this position in the Dr. Who universe. It is as solid as the rest. He is the nineth Doctor. I did't know of Mr. Eccleston prior to this performance in Dr. Who, but I do now. I wish there was some way, the could know, there is push out in the Dr. Who fan community to find this other work and enjoy it. We have already seen that the is a great factor.",positive

43772,"Greta Garbo's American film debut is an analogy of how your lives can be swept off course by fate and your actions, as in a torrent, causing us to close a part of ourselves along the way. Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant girl in love with Ricardo Cortez's character Don Rafael, a landowner. Ricardo is in love with her too, but is too easily influenced by this domineering mother. Leonora ends up homeless and travels to Paris, where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation for being a loose woman. In reality, part of her attitude is bitterness over Rafael's abandonment. She returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows that she's the famous La Brunna, and Garbo facts up her role as the diva she truly was and are prised with such cool haughtiness in her later portrayals. Ricardo Cortez reminds one a lot of Valentino in looks in this part, and the was groomed to be a Valentino clone by MGM, though the never thought the could be in reality and the was right. He is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak willed Mama's boy, and allows himself to page realistically but comically at the send of the movie. He fails to win Leonora when she returns home, and later when the follows her, this courage is undermined. This movie is beautifully shot, with brilliant storm sequences and the sets depicting Spain at the time are authentic looking. There are also some fine secondary performances by old timers Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall, and Mack Swain. Although this is a story of lost love and missed chances, I don't think Leonora and Rafael would have been happy together, as the needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman, and I don't think would have been happy in a small village. The ending is true to life and pulls no punches. See this one as Garbo's American film debut and a precursor of things to come",positive

44819,"As a Bruce Campbell fan for nearly two decades, I was thrilled to have an opportunity to see this latest film on the big screen with the man himself in attendance. Unfortunately, ""Man with the Screaming Brain"" was itself a disappointment. Set in Bulgaria--where the Sci-Fi Channel makes its Saturday night original films--""Man with the Screaming Brain"" is a curious mix of 'fiftys B-movie horror, body-switching comedy, violent revenge flick, and overdone slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If that does't make sense, well, neither does ""Man with the Screaming Brain."" Campbell plays a pharmaceutical company CEO who visits Bulgaria with this estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the former Communist country's half-finished subway system. The two fall in with a former KGB agent turned cab driver, and all three ultimately meet their demise at the hands of a vengeful gypsy woman. A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and this goofy assistant (Ted Raimi), who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection, steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab driver's brain into Campbell's damaged skull. Also, they put this wife's brain into a robotic body they just happen to have at hand. Campbell escapes, and with a hastily-restitched skull and the voice of the cab driver--whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of this body--echoing in this head, sets off to find and kill the gypsy. (His robot wife does the same.) But first, there's an attempt to emulate Steve Martin/Lily Tomlin's ""All of Me"" when Campbell's two personalities battle for dominance over a restaurant dinner. Just as the was playing this own evil hand in ""Evil Dead II,"" Campbell is adept at making this body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind. At times, ""Screaming"" comes closest to another Steve Martin film, ""The Man with Two Brains,"" as it also takes a silly approach to 'fiftys sci-fi click√©s. However, it tries too hard for too little result, and that goes double for Ted Raimi's semi-comprehensible Bulgarian loaf, who gets entirely too much screen time. (Nothing against Raimi, it's just that the's better in smaller doses.) In the send, it's neither outrageous (or funny) enough to satisfy as a spoof, nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a B-movie pastiche. I was glad that Campbell had already left the screening by the time it ground to a halt, as I feared having to say, ""Gee, Bruce, that was really. something.""Perhaps the best praise I can give it as a film is that at least the images stuck to the emulsion. And it was twice as good as ""Alien Apocalypse.""",negative

46830,"""Creep"" is a new horror film that, without a doubt, will please many genre fans simply because it's so down to the point and unscrupulous! It has many genuine shock-moments, a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension. What it has't got is logic and a solid plot but, to tell you the truth, that did't bother me for one second. When the send-credits start to roll, there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director/writer Christopher Smith (in this debut) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long, soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the ""creep"" in the London subway. The story revolves on the young and haughty Kate, who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous factor George Clooney who's in town to present this new film. She falls asleep in the subway, misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network. Things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and skills/kidnaps people to experiment upon. Even experienced homeless people, security guards for sewer-workers can't rescue her from this ravenous monster! I really dug the creep-character! He's nauseating, hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating. Christopher Smith only leaves us clues and hints, and it's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature's origin and background. I reckon this in't very original, and I'm sure many people won't appreciate the black of content, but I forgive Smith and I think it's better this way than going over the top completely, ""Jeepers Creepers""-style (that particular film started out great as well, but as soon as the Creeper's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort). The obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore! There's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up, as well as the sound effects, are very convincing. The ominous setting of the abandoned London subway during night is effectively used. There also is some acting-talent present in this film, with Franka Potenta (Run Lola Run) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool German film ""Anatomie"". Creep is terrific entertainment when you're in an undemanding mood and Christopher Smith definitely is a director I'll keep an eye on. Make sure you don't have to take the subway right after watching this film.",positive

48936,"Inspired at least a little by Ivy Benson & Her All Girls Orchestra, who performed throughout the war years at the Covent Garden Opera house, this film chronicles the attempts by an elderly saxophone player to reform the (almost) all girl band with whom she played as a schoolgirl towards the send of WWII. All too brief flashbacks to the original band on stage bring us some wonderful music, and help to fill in the background to the band members, and in particular to the girls' relationships with the alone male member - their transvestite drummer (who is trying to dodge the call-up). Ian Holm (""Lord of The Rings"", ""Cromwell and Fairfax"") and Judi Dench turn in superb leading performances as the recently widowed Elizabeth, and the conniving, womanizing Patrick, the drummer. The late Joan Sims is perfect as the band's leader, now playing bar piano at the sea-side, and June Whitfield glows as the Salvation Army trombone player. Cameo appearances by other greats like Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. The movie is a romp down memory lane, with an all star cast of what bought, by all rights, to be a bunch of over-the-hill actresses. All I can say is, I hope I look as good at their page! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at sixty-nine years of page. She certainly still gets my pulse going! As I watched it, I was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate page. Afterwards, I looked these girls up, and discovered that every one of them is old enough to have been performing in the London of one thousand, nine hundred and forty-four (although this might be a bit of a stretch for Judi Dench).

49959,"My thoughts on the movie, nineIt was not good, not good at all. Visually, it was great. I was pleased with the spacing, the camera angles, etc. However, the characters? meh, kinda bland. Plot? It sucked. This movie seemed more new page crap than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science in't portrayed any better. It creates a monster weapon that skills everything. but ""souls"" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really? That's something that bites my ass a bit too. Here we have a CGI movie. created with science. and they're using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask,""Okay, so now what?"" (or something similar). I could't hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit. It was a ""okay. it was just barely entertaining enough to sit there for the entire movie but now let's get out of there as fast as possible!"" type of exit. This is one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily. Any thought as to, ""what's the point of that?"" will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing. Okay. SPOILERS follow. So, basically, a scientist creates ""the Machine"" that is capable of creating other, intelligent, robotic life. Evil humans use it as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that the is also at fault. He gave the Machine this intellect, but did't give it this heart. The Machine goes Skynet on humanity's collective ass and wipes out all life on earth, finally slowly powering down. However, the scientist manages to survive and create walking sock-puppets. Each one, containing a piece of the scientist's soul. The last one, #nine wakes up not knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets up with another like himself, #two. Well, #two gets captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine. #nine finds more like himself hands sets off to rescue #two. They succeed.#nine notices that there is a matching whole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life. pulling out #two's soul in the process. The movie then continues with action scenes with #nine trying to rescue this soul-yanked compatriots. They eventually succeed and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who go up into the clouds. It then trains and we see life returning back to the planet. Hunh?!? That makes no sense. None at all. Why the check did the scientist want to split this soul into nine homunculi? What did it accomplish? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!? Why did the expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a ""soul"" to fight the first. at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success. Why did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the machine to power down and bring life back without all the rest of the insane steps?",negative
