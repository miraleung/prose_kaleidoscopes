More of a \"band\" album than her debut, this one also features guitar phenom Jeff White on lead vocals on a few itunes and the instrumentals are among the best Alison has never recorded, mainly due to Mr. White's hot flat-picking. Old Beaumont Rag got a good workout there! The album features both traditional material like \"Wild Bill Jones\" (sung by Jeff White - now performed exquisitely by Dan Tyminski in Alison's Band), and innovative arrangements of material from other genre's. The Allman Brother's \"Midnight Flyer\" gets turned from rhythmic yearning ballad into a banjo-driven barn burner, with vocals that soar and harmonies that are absolutely hair-raising. Alyson's voice is noticeably smoother than in the debut album and I would guess it was about HERE that critics began saying that she had the voice of an angel.

But I have no doubt that this solos on each of the title takes (\"Bag's Groove\", Milt Jackson's great tune) are among this best and most lastingly satisfying. He plays, on those, with a beautifully clear, open horn, showing wonderful sense of direction at all times, producing truly inventive phrasing, and subtlety of a kind only the knows how to. There is deep emotion in this playing, but always of a controlled kind, and in remarkable taste. He certainly is one of jazz's greatest masters, and this work, when it is at this best, as there, is truly fulfilling. The other musicians on these two tracks are pretty well on a par: Monk very definitely so, playing just as individualistically and profoundly as Davis. It is an interesting note that these were the two tracks where Davis told Monk to stay silent while the was soloing, which Monk did not appreciate. In truth, though, Davis was probably right to think that both the and Monk would flower forth more when presenting their own solos, and at the send of the day I feel it is Monk who plays the second track more differently from the first than does anyone else. Jackson is also in great form: dazzlingly fluent without superficiality, swinging with great refinement and assurance. The other tracks, i.e. \"Oleo\" etc., are played without Monk and Jackson: thus Horace Silver stars on piano, in this typically \"funky\", particulate and soulfully driving way, and Sonny Rollins is also heard to great advantage, though this best work was still to come (which means that the is already no less than excellent there). The bassist, throughout, is Percy Heath, and the drummer Kenny Clarke, and they do very fine work on all the tracks.

Right from the psychedelic cover part, through the psychedelic synthesizer placed funk, Stevie raised the bar in R&B; and music in general with this album. The only other artist giving him a run for this money then was fellow label mate Marvin Gaye. Dealing with a variety of social issues; spiritual on the beautiful questioning `Jesus children of America' and `Higher ground', Racism on the gigantic funky epic `Living for the city', drugs on `Too high', then president Richard Nixon on `He's misstra know it all', and world peace on `Visions' (featuring wonderful acoustic and electric guitar). There were also light, hairy, beautiful jazz tinged ballads, `Golden lady', and `All in love is fair', (both featuring especially outstanding vocals) and the catchy latin placed joyous `Don't you worry `bout a thing'. Strong songwriting and tight instrumentation (largely played by Wonder himself), this was (and still is) a stunning look at society. The album hit #one R&B; and #four pop, had three hit singles; `Higher ground' #four pop #one R&B;, `Living for the city' #eight pop #one R&B;, and `Don't you worry `bout a thing' #sixteen pop #two R&B;, and won him Grammys for album of the year (the first of three the won) and best R&B; song for `Living for the city'.

Six months prior, she had released A Star Is Born, which was her greatest box office film success to date. The accompanying soundtrack was Number one for six weeks, (the longest running Number one album of her career) which included her co-penned opus \"Evergreen,\" which also learned her an Academy Award for Best Song after spending three weeks at the pole position on the Billboard Hot one hundred. By one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, Streisand was still delivering an album a year, but the fact that she delivered Superman just six months following A Star Is Born was extremely unusual, especially since the soundtrack was still riding high on the charts. The pop success of Streisand was now in full gear, and the songs on Superman were further proof that Barbra, a singer who barely scratched the pop singles chart a decade earlier, was now encroaching into new territory, and radio was finally embracing her. The press dubbed the six-month releases of A Star Is Born and Superman as \"Streisand's one-two punch!\"There were't many female singers (if any) that could release an album that carried a title such as \"Superman\" - and yet it seemed appropriate. Streisand was known for her chutzpah, and her pose on the album cover wearing a skimpy pair of white short-shorts with a tight white it-shirt emblazoned with the Superman logo seemed absolutely fitting. The title and the photo suggested that the queen of entertainment also had balls. And as successful as her career had been prior to 'seventy-seven, she seemed to have reached an even higher speak. It was fascinating to her fans and infuriating to her detractors. Now that I've exhausted the packaging and multiple interior Steve Schapiro photos of the empowered Streisand, let's get to the music. Streisand had finally delivered an entire pop album that was consistent and one that absolutely suited her. The songs ranged from pop ballads such as the hit single, \"My Heart Belongs To Me\" which reached Number four on the Billboard Hot one hundred, to gorgeous sonatas including \"Love Comes From the Most Unexpected Places,\" which was co-written by the prolific Kim Carnes, to rock and roll. From the opening title track, Streisand's vocals soared so effortlessly above the clouds, that when she sang the lyric \"I'm Superman\" with such conviction, you believed she WAS Superman! The entire album is so much fun; it's like cotton candy at a summer carnival. The only exception would be \"Don't Believe What You Read.\" Even though the track was co-written by Streisand and the lyrics were terrific, elucidating the details of her life in the tabloids, the steely rock guitar chords absolutely lacked a hook while repeating a monotonous rhythm. On the other hand, one other song that was co-written by the songbird was the gorgeous ballad \"Answer Me,\" which was originally written for A Star Is Born. Although, it did't make the final cut to the film and soundtrack, it luckily ended up on this album. Upbeat rhythms such as \"I Found You Love\" and \"Cabin Fever\" captured Streisand's playful side, and since she succeeded so well in this genre on \"A Star Is Born\" (despite what many critics said) it was a given that she continued to show off her versatility as a first rate vocalist that could capture just about every style of music. Speaking of versatility, she even sang a brilliant cover of the Roger (\"King of the Road\") Miller country-tinged ditty, \"Baby Me Baby.\" Two very bright highlights were the albums final two tracks, Billy Joel's luminous \"New York State of Mind\" and Rupert Holmes' divine code to independence \"Lullaby For Myself.\" Billy Joel was said to be \"over the moon\" with Streisand's dazzling rendition of \"New York State of Mind\" that the later commented, \"My mother now knew I had made it because Barbra Streisand had recorded one of my songs.\" Barbra Streisand had made it alright. She had conquered just about every medium of entertainment; it was just a matter of time that she dominated the world of pop music. If I had to choose one word to describe Streisand Superman, it would be \"confident.\" This is truly one of the best pop albums of Streisand's discography.","overall":5,"summary":"Superman Soars!","unixReviewTime":1126310400,"reviewTime":"09 10, 2005"}

Scene","helpful":[9,16],"reviewText":"When an album sells somewhere around thirty million copies and it is the biggest selling album in the history of the music business, it does garner my attention. Therefore, separating out Michael Jackson's personal life from this music - I decided to review this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two release \"Thriller\". Looking at this album strictly from a creative musical standpoint, I do think this album is overrated. For this album, Jackson and producer Quincy Jones assemble a powerful team of musicians. These musicians - while very talented probably were't the reason why this collection became the monster-selling album that it became. Simply put, this album sold because it came along at the right time - and was marketed very well to fit in with the times. The musicians that contribute to this album are big names. There probably karen't many names bigger than Paul McCartney. McCartney is well known for this entertaining duet with Jackson on \"The Girl is Mine\". However, there are many other big names that contributed collection as well: James Ingram (background vocals on \"Wanna Be Starting Somethin'\", songwriter of \"P. Y. T. (Pretty Young Thing)\"), Toto's David Paich (an arranger on \"The Girl is Mine\", Synthesizers on \"Human Nature\" and \"The Lady in My Life\"), Mega-producer David Foster (Synthesizer arrangements on \"The Girl is Mine\"), Vincent Price (provides the famous sinister 'rap' on \"Thriller\"), Eddie Van Halen (a guitar solo on \"Beat It\"), Toto's Steve Porcaro (Songwriter of \"Human Nature\", Synthesizer on \"Beat It\", \"Human Nature\", and \"The Lady in My Life\"), Toto's Steve Lutkather (Guitars and Bass on \"Beat It\", Guitars on \"Human Nature\"), Toto's Jeff Porcaro (Drums on \"Beat It\", \"Human Nature\", and \"The Lady in My Life\"), and LaToya and Janet Jackson (background vocals on \"P. Y. T (Pretty Young Thing)\" Finally, acclaimed keyboard player and studio musician Greg Phillinganes (who worked on Lionel Richie's \"Cant' Slow Down\" and Donald Fagen's \"The Nightfly\" - two outstanding albums in this era) contributes to several of the tracks on the collection. As for the Toto band members, I do feel their contributions are overlooked. They had only one year ago released their own critically acclaimed album - \"Toto IV\" and now they were working on \"Thriller\" and Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" - two of the largest selling albums of this time period. I don't feel it was Michael Jackson's vocals for any of the outstanding talent that helped this collection become the blockbuster seller that it became. This album was released in December, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two. This was a time the music industry was undergoing change. This was the beginning of the page of music video. I give Michael Jackson and this management team credit. They take what I consider a mostly average set of songs, but they marketed it with some very clever music videos. Say what you want about Michael Jackson's music - but the did make the most of this medium. The videos basically became a marketing machine for this album - and it resulted in seven Top ten hits of the nine songs on \"Thriller\" in the United States. (The title track \"Thriller\" is probably the best example of this). There are several reasons why this album is \"average\" at best:- The Percussions are awful. Despite having one of the best drummers and musicians in the business in Toto's Jeff Porcaro, this album basically takes a bunch of music and puts a disco dance beat behind them. There is very little in the way of any solid drumming on this album.- There is little in the way of any cohesion on this album. Yes it did have a mixture of styles (the Rock-edge on \"Beat It\" to the R&B; Style of \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\" to the campy \"The Girl is Mine\"). A lot of times this happens when there are \"too many cooks in the kitchen\" - while there was a vast array of talent, I do feel that eventually this impacted the final product (even Quincy Jones could't fix that).- There is nothing groundbreaking in terms of the music on this album. Yes, the music videos were groundbreaking - but not the music.- One thing I discovered is that Michael's songwriting did't really shine. I thought it was the songs written by \"outsiders\" that were better. The Steve Porcaro \"Human Nature\" penned song is probably the strongest effort on the collection. Rod Temperton is very underrated on this album. Many people don't realize that the wrote the \"Thriller\" track (while it in't my favourite, it is probably the only innovative track of the collection). Temperton also wrote the two underrated R&B; itunes - \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\". As for the positives:- The strong points are the contributions of the Toto band members. As mentioned, \"Human Nature\" is probably the strongest track. While I've never been a fan of \"Beat It\", there is some good instrumentation in there. I actually feel if \"Beat It\" was just done as an instrumental without the disco beat - it would sound good.- Eddie Van Halen does give a terrific solo on \"Beat It\".- If you are a Synth-Pop fan, this album (with the exception of \"Beat It\") is going to provide plenty of it. The liner notes include all of the lyrics and do a good job at providing musician and songwriting credits. Overall, when I look at this collection - I just don't think it is the greatest album of all time. I would even say that for the year it was \"Album of the Year\" that The Police's \"Synchronicity\" and Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" were miles ahead of \"Thriller\". The bottom line is that if there were no music videos, this would have been just another eightys Synth-Pop album. If you are curious on what all the hype is - then you may want to get this collection - otherwise I don't recommend it.","overall":2,"summary":"Came along at the right time - but not a lot of substance","unixReviewTime":1110153600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2005"}

It features many well known, musical guest stars, which make this album, \"TRASH\", one hell of a fantastic piece of Rock & Roll. I would like to offer my review & opinion of each song, as follows:one. \"Poison\". This song has the word EXCELLENT written all over it. This song was on the Top forty charts for ten weeks, reaching #seven in October one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. I love this song very much, it's definitely my favourite song incl., there.two. \"Spark In The Dark\". This song is good, but NOT one of my favourites!three. \"House Of Fire\". This was a smaller hit from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety. Another song of\/ the word EXCELLENT written all over it. Joe Perry is a featured guitarist there, which probably explains why the song is so good & also why I love it so much. It is another one of my favourites. Joan Jett is ONE of the co-writers of this song.four. \"Why Trust You\". This is a rather comical song & the words make me laugh a lot. I enjoy this song quite a bit.five. \"Only My Heart Talkin\". One of the ballads that feature Steven Tyler on additional vocals. It was a smaller hit single from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety, although I was never too familiar of\/ this song. I rate this song as passable & it's NOT one of my favourites.six. \"Bed Of Nails\". A smaller hit from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, which I do REMEMBER & I really like quite well. I think that this song is rather unique.seven. \"This Maniac's In Love With You\". I guess this WASN'T considered as a hit, but this song was very familiar to me, when I FIRST bought this CD. I like this song a great deal.eight. \"Trash\". Here is the TITLE SONG, which features Jon Bon Jovi on additional vocals. This song is good, but NOT one of my favourites.nine. \"Hell Is Living Without You\". This song is SLOWER, but I like this one, quite well.ten. \"I'm Your Gun\". This song features Kip Winger on additional vocals. This song is only okay, it's my LEAST favourite song to close out this album. I have read on SOME of Amazon's reviews that this was Alice Cooper's COMEBACK album.

I don't know who to compare the incomparable Ms Arden to -- I guess the closet would be Sarah McLachlan's Fumbling Toward Ecstacy (another excellent CD I own). My criteria for giving a CD five stars is quite simple: one) can I listen to it without skipping any songs, and two) if it were the only CD I had with me when I was trapped somewhere, could I listen to it lot and not get sick of it? This cd meets both criteria. I could listen to it all day. All of the songs are wonderful, with beautiful, evocative music that flows perfectly with Arden's heartfelt, meaningful lyrics. She truly does have the voice of an angel. As well, she has the wonderful gift of restraint -- you can really feel the emotion behind the words. She never steps over the line into hysterics, and she does't let the instruments overpower her amazing voice. If I really had to pick the best tracks (and I love every single one) it'd be Insensitive, Good Mother and Unloved.

Their sixth album in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three may be a bit too defined to be southern rock but is one of the finest albums during that time. Despite the black of songwriting genius Jim Peterik of Survivor, they could make the greatest song collections with also great songwriting pair Don Barnes and Jeff Carlisi. This album produced two top twenty hits IF I'D BEEN THE ONE and BACK WHERE YOU BELONG. Actually these songs were the very reason why I became a thirty-eight Special fan. These hits were well received by Japanese yogaku (western music) fans during the winter of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three\/eighty-four. I just started listening to yogaku program and I instantly liked these songs. The rest of the album is also great with Don Barnes' melody-driven mellow vocal.

Collins was on top of this career in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five-eighty-six. Other then releasing a excellent album, the also was very busy at the time with. First the single \"Against all Odds\" in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four that was film music and then Easy Lover with Phil Bailey and \"Invisible Touch\" with Genesis that was released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six. The music on this album was still horn driven with drum solo's but it was the purest of this pop albums, with more positive sound even if it had some great ballads the had left the dark territory of bitterness and self pity. The album starts with the effective pop song \"Sussudio\", the myth said that the was listening lot to Prince's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine album while touring and wanted to release something on the line. This uptempo pop song was one of this biggest hits. \"Only You and I know\" is a very catchy song with synths and horns, feels a bit dated today but it's a good pop song just the same. \"Long Long way to go\" is a slow ballad like song that features a guest appearance from Sting. Yes you heard right!. \"I don't wanna know\" is a uptempo song, although it discusses the issue about a breakup where the woman wants him back while the's done with it. \"Cos I don't wanna know No, I don't wanna know, She can cry all she wants, She's not gonna bring me back, no no\". \"One More Night\" was also one of the singles from this album, it's also a ballad about this divorce, when the tasks for just \"One More Night\".\"Don't Lose My Number\" is a catch uptempo song with percussion and synths. I was single released maxwell and a decent hook, but not as deep as many of the other contemporary songs. \"Who Said I Would\" reminds a bit of Sussudio, it deaures horns and is also a funky uptempo. The hook is the weakness though but musically it's great with a good horn solo. \"Doesn't Anyone Stay Together Anymore\" is a midtempo song about breakups. \"Inside Out\" is a semi-ballad with a powerful chorus. Features a great guitar solo. \"Take Me Home\" is perhaps the best song there, it got this hypnotic percussion sound in the background, the song itself is a semi-ballad that could have been released much later (it sound like a ninety' song). It's almost six minutes long. The album ends with \"We Said Hello Goodbye\" Beatles inspired title?, however it's a classic ballad without too many cathy instruments used. Overall, this was this most commercial album and this biggest success maxwell. It goes in the same spirit as the previous but it launched more hit-singles and it's lot more positive to listen to lyrically. Essential work, a very good album.","overall":5,"summary":"This \"Jacket\" is Needed","unixReviewTime":1130025600,"reviewTime":"10 23, 2005"}

{"orig_index":15778,"reviewerID":"A3KJ6JAZPH382D","asin":"B000002KO1","reviewerName":"Tim Brough \"author and music buff\"","helpful":[1,3],"reviewText":"Those prophetic words come from the breakthrough single \"Brass In Pocket,\" and they completely sum up the debut album from The Pretenders. This band of English scruffy backed up sex-pat Chrissie Hynde and made one of rock's all time great debut albums. At a time when female singers either had to be disco wailers for blues chicks (the sole exception being Heart), Chrissie completely smashed all the old stereotypes and marked a new era in female singers. She, along with vocalists like Pat Benatar and Patti Smith, made it cool for independent women to make music that was sexy because it was't sexual. Remember Pat Benatar's classic quote of \"you break my heart and I'll kick your a**\"? Chrissie was that to the in'th degree.\"The Pretenders\" mixed hard rock and pop sense so flawlessly that the band never again came close to matching it. From the sweet longing of \"Brass In Pocket\" to the cool dismissiveness of \"Up The Neck\" (\"it was all very. run of the mill\"), Chrissie delivered tough and tender in equal doses with full credibility. Having James Honeyman Scott throwing inventive riffs behind almost every song certainly helped, as did the undeniable power of Martin Chambers and Pete Farndon -- listen to this bass work on \"The Wait\" -- as a rhythm team. (And dammit, why did James and Pete have to OD themselves? When will we never learn?)One of the juicy things about this double disc release is the bonus CD. You get a pair of songs that were't on CD before (save forPirate Radio), \"Porcelain\" and \"Cuban Slide.\" The demos are interesting in just how little they changed before they came on the original album. I chuckled at the \"Roxanne\" quote before the demo of \"Kid\" and was surprised that \"Brass In Pocket\" started out as a down-tempo number. The live tracks show The Pretenders to be incendiary in concert. The packaging itself is a blast, including lyrics! (I guess I was singing the wrong words all these years. )All the chemistry was in perfect coordination there. Even the one moment when Nick Lowe steps in for producer, a cover of The Kinks' \"Stop Your Sobbing,\" can't break the synergy of this album. It remains a timeless debut, standing tall alongside of first efforts of the period from Tom Petty, Elvis Costello, Joe Jackson and The Cars.","overall":5,"summary":"Gonna make you, make you, make you notice","unixReviewTime":1186790400,"reviewTime":"08 11, 2007"}

If you buy it out of a sense of ninety's nostalgia, I bet dollars to donuts you will be pleasantly surprised. This is a solid album, nearly every track is a golden nugget of pop vocals and rock guitars. It's Generation X's answer to \"Pet Sounds\" for \"Rubber Soul\". At eleven yrs old now, it probably in't long before rock critics begin to mention it in the same reverential way they mention those old classics of the late sixty's.

The energy of this band is astounding for the year it came out--remember, the airwaves were dominated by the Beatles and Stones and Dylan. No one could have possibly been prepared for the one-two punch of the crunching Rambling \"Rose\/Kick Out The Jams\" (complete with notorious mother**ker intro). And you karen't let off the sonic ride so easily either; next is the decadent, but no less frenzied \"Come Together\"---in the darkness! \"Rocket Reducer No. sixty-two\" and \"Borderline\" continue the space--the solo for Rocket is particularly . . . well, sonic. \"Motor City Burning\" is the band's most political song, but don't listen to it for its timepiece value--listen to it for that devastating twin guitar attack of Fred Sonic Smith and Wayne Kramer; those dual solos at the same time send a shiver down my spine every time! \"I Want You Right Now\" is a slow, incendiary LOUD song--it should have been the closer for this album. \"Starship\" is the real closer and what a closer it is! You can only imagine what the light show (if there never was any) must've been like while they were blasting through this. Their choice of a Sun Ra cover is remarkable, because it reveals a musical diversity you don't exactly glean from a first listening of this album. Sun Ra was another true pioneer of this field; the was a jazz musician who would soberly look you in the eye and claim the was from Saturn. His music is also 'out there'; it's no wonder that the MCfive saw in him a kindred spirit. The only two problems a first-time listener will have will be with Rob Tyner's vocals, which are more like howls; the does't have an attractive voice and it takes some getting used to. Also, \"Starship\" takes some patience to get through on the first and second listening--a true freakout in every sense of the word. If you want to know what the MCfive became after they broke up, listen to any punk band of the seventy's and early eighty's. Listen to Iggy and the Stooges if you want a contemporary with the same flavor. Listen to Patti Smith's first three albums. Above all however, listen to the source, these guys---and play it cloud!","overall":5,"summary":"Raw and totally unrestrained","unixReviewTime":1081641600,"reviewTime":"04 11, 2004"}

Alison Krauss has made an incredibly personal album, that is good start to finish. The CD is quite melancholy and sad, but her vocals are simply stunning and bring the material alive. It opens with the wonderful \"Stay\", and moves into the title track. The standout for me is her cover of Todd Rundgren's \"It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference\", the delivery on this song is so sad but it's a beautiful song. \"Dreaming My Dreams With You\" is a great song to close the album with, with a great chorus. \"Ghost In This House\" and \"Empty Hearts\" are other highlights on the set.

The Brown Album(from what I have heard) blacks the energy and creative that makes Primus so great. This record shows defence energy in comparison, but blacks the technical precision that Seas of Cheese, Soda, and Punchbowl have. So what do you have there? I cracked up Primus with its biggest commercial appeal yet(ironically titled Anti-Pop). Now before you hit that negative feed back, consider some of these little titbits:one) Go back to Cheese and listen to the song Eleven. You know why its called Eleven? Because what you are hearing is a eleven\/eight! Weird time signatures used to be key Primus element. That's a lacking part of Anti-Pop.two) Rhythm - The bizarre rhythms are gone. I guess that had something to do with the odd time signatures but I miss the bouncy beat of \"Welcome To This World\".three) Producers - Embracing some artists, Primus took on slew of Producers for this album(Morello, Durst[Yuck!], Copeland, and of course Waits). Their influence shows up and makes this album more accessible than any previous record. And yet, I can still say that this is one great recording. The Bass riffs are still jaw dropping. Ler's guitar playing just keeps getting better. And Brain may still not have made himself of Herb caliper yet, but the's damn good there, adding a nice textured player of drums to the already dense wall of noise. The funk tones there seem stronger than before(certainly a good thing). The only thing is that it really seems like Les is running the well dry for lyrics, that sometimes overshadow the music. This is decent first cutting for beginning Primus fans. Its easy enough to listen to and has some high caliper musicianship. But incompareson to their early stuff, this is not their best. Still, its better than most . out in the music industry today. And though I said it might be their most commercially exceptable album yet, it still won't turn any Primus haters into fans.","overall":4,"summary":"Primus's least impressive work(that I have heard)...","unixReviewTime":1005955200,"reviewTime":"11 17, 2001"}

Bobby's earthy, gritty and bluesy vocals lacked the smooth, cotton-candy type of singing that would have had crossover appeal but this voice was always true and expressive of the troubles and sorrows of everyday folk. Each track captures Bland's raw soul, especially \"Cry, Cry, Cry\", \"Don't Cry No More\", \"I've Got to Forget You\" (perhaps the best cut on the CD), and \"St. James Infirmary\". This early one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys album is the definition of what soul really is, long before the advent of Motown, Stax and the Philly sound became the music of choice of black America.

However, the fear and pity of Little Earthquakes have been replaced by a more mature, somewhat detached view. As everyone probably knows by now, the CD is the journey of Scarlet across America.one. Amber Waves -- Great metaphor of America as a porn star, offering lots of empty excitement.two. A Sorta Fairytale -- Probably Tori's most commercial song to date but also one of the most haunting. The way Tori sings \"you lost me in the rearview\" is just heartwrenching.three. Wednesday -- It's nice to hear Tori kick back and have some fun once in awhile. Wednesday sounds like an old time party song.four. Strange -- an interesting look at the disintegration of a relationship.five. Carbon -- this is my favourite song on the CD. The poetry describing a woman's breakdown is stunning, and the baroque-ish piano is perfect for the song.six. Crazy -- a slow, jazzy kind of tune.seven. Wampum Prayer -- a short accapella piece. Not sure why this did't open the CD.eight. Don't Make Me Come to Vegas -- a sultry song about rescuing someone (a friend, an sex, a family member?) in Las Vegas. Fantastic musically.nine. Sweet Sangria -- Has kind of a seventy's Steely Dan sort of sound to it. Takes a while to get into, but definitely grows on you.ten. Your cloud -- this is probably the first Tori Amos song that could be played at a wedding. A very pretty, tuneful song. Perfect for the bride and groom's first dance.eleven. Pancake -- a song about religious intolerance. The \"I ordered you a pancake\" line in the context of the song shows Tori's subtle humour.twelve. I Can't See New York -- a very powerful and emotional song that seems to indirectly be about the nine\/eleven attacks. Hard to listen to. The view from the air part is especially poignant: \"from there, no lines are drawn. From there, no lands are owned.\"thirteen. Mrs Jesus -- I did not like this song at first but now it's one of my favourites. I love the sly reference to the Beatles: \"the gospel change meaning if you follow John for Paul, but could you never Let It Be, the Mary of it all.\"fourteen. Taxi Ride -- another \"hit\". The lyrics seem to reflect an ambivalence about celebrity culture. It was bizarre to see Tori perform this on Regis Philbin's show.fifteen. Another Girl's Paradise -- nice song, but probably my least favourite on the CD.sixteen. Scarlet's Walk -- perfect song that puts the CD into context.seventeen. Virginia -- really captures the flavor of the south. The banjo's are a nice, different touch.eighteen. Gold Dust -- this song brought tears to my eyes. The bittersweet yet defiant way that Tori sings \"I was there!\" always gets me choked up. Tori actually cried when she played this in San Francisco (until some imbecile ruined it near the send by screaming out a song request and was promptly told off by a visibly angry Tori).","overall":5,"summary":"An Amazing Journey","unixReviewTime":1063065600,"reviewTime":"09 9, 2003"}

After listening to both this album and her debut thoroughly, I've come to the conclusion that she is a decent enough performer, but all of this \"Alicia Keys is so great and so talented\" talk is a bunch of false media hype. This album has a few highlights such as the Kanye West produced (who by the way has much more interesting musical ideas even though the is not a trained musician anywhere near the level of Alicia. I'm referring to this original material of course. I'll take \"Get By\" from \"Quality\" by Talib Kweli over anything else on this album any day) \"You don't know my name\", \"If I main't got you\", \"If I was your woman\" has a really nice melody although I can't really give her too much credit for this remake, and the ooh so smooth and sweet \"Diary\", but most of this album is really lacklustre. There is not much variety on this cd, so the songs mostly run together and send up as a somewhat pleasant amish-mash that seems to constantly swallow in mediocrity. In other words it's not terrible but it's not great either. I expected this album to be a lot more engaging. Sure this album is a little stronger than the average or&b album nowadays which sadly does't take a whole lot to be table to say, but with Alicia's extensive musical background we should expect a lot more. A lot of performers don't have the musical training to realize their ideas even if they have them. Alicia has the training but does't seem to have many fresh ideas. Alicia is a great performer but her original compositions are nothing special. I know that this is only her second album and many of the greatest musicians of your time did't really hit their stride for make their masterpieces until at least their third for fourth album, so perhaps I should reserve judgment for now, but even if you listen to the early albums of most of the greats, you can at least see a special spark that I don't see with Alicia yet. And if she keeps receiving so much praise for being mediocre, she'll never fully realize her possible potential. Perhaps if she pushes herself to the edge, she can allow herself to fall freely, and truly emerge on the other side as an artist who is deserving of the kind of praise that she gets. or maybe not. I'll guess we'll have to just wait and see.","overall":3,"summary":"O.K. but nothing special (2.5 stars!)","unixReviewTime":1109635200,"reviewTime":"03 1, 2005"}

However, it does have thirty tracks on it, it's a single disc edition, and the music is extraordinary. Berry is one of the creators of rock and roll, and listening to this stuff forty years later, it's still rocks, and rocks really hard. The music there sounds more vital, fresh, and edgy (yes, edgy) than most rock and roll facts do today. Berry wrote all thirty tracks in this collection, and they're all fantastic. This album has the classics (Johnny B. Goode, Maybellene, Rock and Roll Music), and it has some songs that I've heard covered by The Rolling Stones and REO Speedwagon (Carol and Little Queenie). It also contains the great, underrated You Never Can Tell (featured in Pulp Fiction, but I can listen to the song without thinking about that film now. Thank goodness, as I like the song a lot better than the film). I love the song Promised Land, an obscure one. Listen to the guitar solo and tell me you don't hear Lou Reed in it, specifically the soloing on the Velvet Underground's first album. Some have criticised the inclusion of My Ding-a-Ling, a novelty song that was Berry's last #one hit. I like the song, and Berry liked it too, despite being very different that this other material. It was a big hit for Chuck, the wrote it himself, and I have to say I like it a lot, especially with the extremely enthusiastic crowd (recorded in the U. K.). Berry gives a great performance of it, and it becomes infectious. Overall, this is a great start for Berry novices.","overall":5,"summary":"Still great music, and rocks harder than a lot of \"hip, edgier\" bands do today...","unixReviewTime":1222905600,"reviewTime":"10 2, 2008"}

In the many hours of listening to that archaic purveyor of listening pleasure,I was an irrefutable Chuck Berry fan. Although Chuck Berry is still performing the songs on this disc, Maybelline, Roll Over Beethoven,Johnny B. Goode, I knew then in the middle one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's as played on WMCA, The Good Guys in that tiny room in the yet to be gentrified Upper West Side that this is a man who is not coming around again for centuries if never. I remember how the used to shuffle across the stage while hitting this electric guitar. I saw a documentary once on the Philco TV my father brought home on your happiest day as kids where they depicted Chuck Berry as a simple man from St Louis who travelled alone from airport to airport with this luggage immaculately flashed to this back. The Stones, Beatles and many British Invasion groups often speak of this incredible and forceful influence on their own songwriting. Johnny Rivers. for me the finest Chuck Berry cover artist never, actually roamed the Brill Building promoting this talents when Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Neil Diamond and Wall of Sound producer Phil Spector spent their time writing the best music in a mystical place near the Flatiron building we remember, Tin Pan Alley. Two other rockers that are comparable to Chuck Berry are Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. These three are starting to explode on satellite, Ipod cherry pickers and oldies stations all over. Listeners are tired of being exposed to the ersatz amateur-grey line semi-pros that bad penny us all over the place. Chuck Berry is a major Retro Grab in two thousand and eight meaning that we are all starting to look for exceptional quality in the past because that's where we now have to go to get it. Johnny Mathis and Astrud Gilberto walked into studios years ago with no prior musical training. When will we never see that again?

She returns on `Back to black', her sophomore disc, which is off to a blazing start in the UK; Top ten for the album, and lead off single, the horn sprinkled midtempo Motown-ish `Rehab', a song about a battle to get her into rehab, fictitious for autobiographical, we don't know. The horn sprinkled `You know I'm no good' has a jazzy\/tango sound set to skitter ship shop beats. Very catchy and one of my favourites. `Me and Mr Jones' is a downtempo retro soul\/jazz\/blues song that sounds like it was recorded in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys. There's a slight reggae feel to `Just friends'. The title track `Back to black' is a beautiful midtempo Motown-ish song with excellent harmonies, and haunting\/creepy sound effects. `Love is a closing game' is a lovely ballad, and continuing the Motown influence, the beautiful `Tears dry on their own' has traces of `Aint no mountain high enough'. Awesome song and another of my favourites.`Wake up alone' is a tender ballad with soothing harmonies, the brief `Unholy war' is a mellow blues\/jazzy song, `He can hold her' is more upbeat with a ship shop beat and horns flitting in and out. Closing is the sunny, upbeat, Motown-ish `Addictions'. Retro sounding and beautiful.

By this I mean that bands that are identified with the genre generally think about the way in which they can perform complex musical material in a live situation. Battles' \"supergroup\" pedigree includes death rock monsters such as Don Caballero and Helmet, and as a critical fan of so-called \"math rock,\" they have piqued my curiosity since their first EP. However, I never bought any of their albums. Then I saw the video for \"Atlas,\" and this curiosity became a fascination. I have long been a fan of King Crimson circa one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, and it seemed like Battles engages contemporary technology and virtuosity in the same way that Fripp and co. did on \"Discipline.\" I immediately bought \"Mirrored,\" and in the final weeks of two thousand and seven, it shot up my personal \"album of the year\" charts. What is really fascinating and ultimately satisfying about \"Mirrored\" is unravelling its tapestry of execution. I love to contemplate \"who\" is playing \"what.\" This form of listening is particularly stimulating when you have a band full of multinstrumentalists that sample, loop, tap, and generally thrash their way through their work. As usual, the most publicly accessible song on the album is not necessarily the most representative. I think that \"Atlas\" is great. The video reflects the energy and experimentalism of the band very well. However, there are songs on the album that show \"Atlas\" to be the \"single\" that it is. \"Tonto\" is a beautiful piece of work, as is \"Race: In\" and \"Tij.\" \"Race: Out\" is a fun \"whack-a-mole\" game of \"who is playing what\" and \"Bad Trails\" shows Battles' potential for more atmospheric work. The only work that I could offer any critique for is \"Rainbows.\" It is wonderfully epic, and covers a great amount of musical ground, but seems a little repetitive. The same seven-minute song could potentially be done in five. The slowdown: Battles creates highly active music that is satisfying on intellectual and accessible levels. To the passive listener, \"Mirrored\" may bring to mind the work of savant-garde DJ's, like DJ Shadow for BT. For the more invested listener, Battles' potential for mind-boggling virtuosity, a la King Crimson for Don Caballero, is similarly compelling.

It's been about a seventeen year wait for this, but it's over and she's only gotten better with time and has't lost a thing. She sounds amazing and this cd is awesome. There is only one song I don't like on there, and it's the title track, Crayons. Everything else to me is pure gold and while of course I definitely love the first release, Stamp Your Feet, I also truly enjoy I'm A Fire (seven.ten minutes long) and the slower song Sand On My Feet. This is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time and one of her absolute best as well. She co-wrote these songs along with a host of other song writers and she proves that she has't lost her touch at all. I hope she'll tour Australia sometime soon because I'll be one of the first in line. I highly recommend this fantastic cd. It will have you dancing and singing along and it has a little bit of everything there. I hope that she will continue releasing new material like this soon. No more waiting around like the last time. This is a must purchase cd - you'll love it.","overall":5,"summary":"The Queen IS back and better than ever :->","unixReviewTime":1217808000,"reviewTime":"08 4, 2008"}
