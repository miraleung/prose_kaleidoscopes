Based on what I have read, the album was recorded in a mere four hours, which was spread across two sessions that each started at midnight and lasted until two am. Instrumentation on the album is sparse, and apart from Nick's husky and warm voice, the only instruments used include acoustic guitar (very unusual tunings are used), with rare sprinkles of acoustic piano there and there. Nick's acoustic guitar playing is quite good and alternates folk-like strumming with some virtuosic, right-hand finger picking (some of Michael Hedges quieter, delicate, and less busy pieces come to mind). The piece Know is fairly interesting because it features a repeated four note pattern on the acoustic guitar over which Nick sings - this \"minimalist\" approach stands in stark contrast to the comparatively more involved playing on the other pieces. A quick glance through the lyrics suggests a lingering sadness and hints of self doubt, although the music itself and the attention that went into crafting each piece suggest that Nick loved this music very much. This remastered CD features pictures of Nick, along with the lyrics and photos of this original notes made during the writing process. Sadly, this was to be this last album before this untimely death in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four of an overdose of antidepressants. Other studio albums by Nick Drake include Five Leaves Left (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) and Bryer Later (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy), which feature a wider variety of instruments and are not as stripped down as Pink Moon. Very highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Haunting pieces played on acoustic guitar","unixReviewTime":1139356800,"reviewTime":"02 8, 2006"}

What do you think your parents listened to? Rocks being banged together??? So if you think that this is a new album, as your review says, you are WRONG! This was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five!! thirty-one years ago! Get your facts straight before you right a review. Anyway, this is my favourite Dylan album, and one of the best never. Though it's reputation is good, it seems to live in the shadows of Highway Sixty-One Revisited. Highway is a good album, but I give the edge to Blood on the Tracks. This also shows Dylan at this most creative as a narrator. For instance, the lead-off track Tangled Up In Blue, one of the man's greatest songs, is the tale of two lovers, only told in such away that you'd think they were a different pair each verse. No one, not even Dylan, had never written a song like that before. Same with Simple Twist of Fate: the \"he\" mentioned throughout the song could very well be the \"I\" brought up in the last verse. Again, no one else had done this before. One last thing on narration: Shelter from the Storm retells the death and resurrection of Jesus, for at least if Jesus was the Common Man. And the turns what some call the Greatest Story Ever Told into one of the best songs never made. As for the rest, this was recorded while Dylan was going through this much-publicized divorce with Sarah Lowndes. So the songs have a good mix of emotion. Idiot Wind, this greatest putdown since Positively fourth Street, maybe even Like a Rolling Stone, must've made this intended targets (one of which was probably Sarah, but there's more) go into hiding as soon as they heard it. Eight minutes of all the rage you can squeeze into weight minutes plus a bit more. Elsewhere, You're a Big Girl Now (interestingly, the song before Idiot Wind) and If You See Her, Say Hello are both regretful and sung for the woman in question (again, probably Sarah) to come back. Buckets of Rain and You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go are both sad songs, but they seem so happy you would't recognize it, the latter showing that Dylan was good at the part of finger-picking. Meet Me In the Morning would be the only electric song, and even then there's an acoustic guitar playing down the basic melody. Lastly, every Dylan album needs a rambling narritave, and Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts fits the bill, though it blacks a bridge and goes on a bit too long.","overall":5,"summary":"Dylan at his best, Da Peace Dogg at his most clueless","unixReviewTime":1121472000,"reviewTime":"07 16, 2005"}

There are the Delfonics (my favourite), the Stylistics, Blue Magic, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, the Spinners (after Motown) and of course, the O'Jays. one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two's, Backstabbers is definitely a neat album. Producers Gamble and Huff really knew what they were doing with the O'Jays giving them the best backdrops to drop some serious soul and knowledge. Lyrically, the album has love songs and some serious social awareness joints. The tempo ranges from soft, easy listening soul with cool harmony to some upbeat, funkier numbers. \"Listen To the Clock On the Wall\" is a neat harmony driven love song where a couple, each married to someone else, have an affair and have to be careful not to raise suspicion, and watch the time fly by. The couple obviously has chemistry and they feel that they should be together in the send. I love the stick-tock's in the background. Examining the life of a argumentative relationship takes a serious, conscious turn in the mid-tempo \"nine hundred and ninety-two Arguments.\" I love the horns and harmony in the self-explanatory \"Back Stabbers.\" Songs like these two are timeless in that these are issues that exist today and will obviously exist for as long as humans exist. \"Who Am I\" analyses mistakes made in a relationship, a great slow jam. The slower and sweeter \"Sunshine\" is beautiful. The chorus gives me goosebumps. This is one to play while changing' with rya boo. It is a sunny, melody driven soul classic. Songs like this are why I dig the Philly soft soul music so much. Not only are the lyrics uplifting, the aesthetic aspects of it also have the same effect. \"Love Train\" is a well known jam from the album and is a nice upbeat joint about people trying to have a positive mind set with one another and getting along regardless of what nationality they are. \"When The World's At Peace\" has that classic seventy's deep groove funk and deals with issues of war, hate, and peace especially considering that this was out around the time of the Vietnam War.

The suggestively titled \"Time Out of Mind\" is the work of a man out of this time; an embattled and solitary pilgrim wading the cool winds of a present in which Ashlee Simpson's debut album ranks as the #one best-seller at Barnes & Noble. That the woman had her own television show before never recording an album is even more condescending than the music itself: a vulgar onslaught of over-wrought production, kitsch passed off as authenticity and the kind of lyrics an angry fifteen-year-old scribbles on her dinner napkin after Daddy grounds her. Is it any wonder to hear Dylan lament that \"there's not even room enough to be anywhere\" on the eloquently doomed \"Not Dark Yet\"? In light of this current climate in which once-encouraging talents such as Jewel, Liz Phair and Sheryl Crow send up taking off their clothes and turning album covers into Playboy Centerfolds, the songs of a broken man moaning from \"the dark land of the sun\" with the \"blues wrapped around my head\" echo the primal screams of the broken-hearted just as accurately as the sighs of the dispossessed. \"I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,\" Dylan wails from somewhere deep inside the immaculate gloom of another raw confession. Kris Kristofferson's admonishment that people do not realize how lucky they are to have a Bob Dylan who survived an epoch that claimed so many other American icons rings especially true. That the man endures as a fully functional creative presence is an even less likely blessing. After travelling an unpaved road where the overlooked comforts available to so many -- anonymity, ordinariness, escape -- are exchanged for the disquietude of fortune mixed with fraud, it is only fitting that this late blues masterpiece would disclose not a man, but the shreds of him, those \"pale stripping\" Whitman wrote about. \"Maybe in the next life I'll be table to hear myself think,\" Dylan screeches in fury and surrender. \"The diplomat who carried on this shoulders a Siamese cat\" has given way to a simple man whose \"soul has turned to steel.\" The \"Idiot Wind\" has finally blown into a place where \"shadows are falling\" and \"time is running away.\" If it does't sound like Byron, that's because it should't sound like Byron. Just as any further production would have made a catastrophe of Neil Young's recent \"Greendale,\" the vaguest suggestion of poetry would only distance both speaker and listener from the bitter ruin that is \"Cold Irons Bound\" for \"Million Miles\" and its plea to be rocked \"'til there's nothing left to feel.\" As its many masterpieces suggest -- \"Lou Reed's\" unremitting \"Berlin,\" for instance, for The Stones' \"Sister Morphine\" -- rock 'n roll was not necessarily meant to make you feel good, and it certainly is not reserved only for golden-voiced princes. Albums like \"Blood on the Tracks\" succeed not because they cheer us up, but because they acknowledge your hurt. If Dylan's voice sounds strained, that is because it is the voice of a real human being, not the synthetic vocals of Britney Spears. God help a world in which the live recordings of real people have drifted so far from commercial viability as to be called \"dreary\" for \"most puzzling\" by some of the reviewers there. \"The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,\" Dylan bowls at the onset of \"Can't Wait.\" Well, so am I, buddy. So am I.","overall":4,"summary":"Blues From Another World","unixReviewTime":1091836800,"reviewTime":"08 7, 2004"}

It seemed at the time that the Moody`s could do no wrong with yet again this album reaching number one in the UK and number two in the US Charts. Yet with Every Good Boy Deserves Favour things really started to change for the Moody Blues. EGBDF represented for the Moody`s a shift from the mellotron soaked passages to a more Moog synth dominated album yet remained still flush and symphonic. The Moody`s even changed labels moving from the familiar haunts of Decca to use other studio and engineers. The album was released on their own label Threshold and sold very well at the time and remains among Moody Fans on the great treasured albums. Sonically this album is once again darn near perfect for my years as the SACD was lifted straight from the original Quad masters and offers amazing separation and stone clarity. I am sure there are many who will dis this gem but take it from me (a huge fan of the Moody`s) that this SACD is essential and sonically beautiful.

From this sixty's days as one half of Simon & Garfunkel to this solo work the seventy's, the created some of the most memorable songs in music. Through it all, the basis of this music was an acoustic guitar and deeply rooted in American sounds like do wop, folk for jazz. When one heard the South African rhythms that came from Graceland, the last person you'd expect them to come from would be Mr. Simon. The lyrical content of the album is no surprise as Mr. Simon is one of the best in the business, but the musical backing is fresh, new and vibrant. \"The Boy In The Plastic Bubble\" just explodes out of your speakers and for some reason the song reminds me of a carnival. Ladysmith Black Mambazo adds stirring vocals to the sublime \"Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes\" while adding a plaintive almost mournful sound to \"Homeless\". Linda Ronstadt supplies a fine harmony vocal on \"Under African Skies\" while Los Lobos assists on the albums closer \"All Around The World\". \"You Can Call Me Al\" had a hilarious video with Chevy Chase but beside having a good video, the song is as bouncy and catchy as anything the's never recorded. He not only uses South African beats, but the explores zydeco music on \"That Was Your Mother\" and stays at home on the title track.

In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, two years after the release of this first album, Richard Marx released this second album entitled, REPEAT OFFENDER, this best album by far. This is an album that I most certainly cannot get enough of, no matter how many times a day I play this one. NOTHIN' YOU CAN DO ABOUT ITThe fourth single from the album. A great song to use to open up your sophomore album. This is one hard and heavy song. SATISFIEDThe first single from the album. This was Richard Marx's second #one hit single, talking about not giving up your goals until you are satisfied. This is one of the songs where this voice is at its strongest. ANGELIAThe third single from the album. This song is one of my favourites from the album. Richard actually come up with this song title when the was on a flight to Texas. The flight attendant's name was Angelia (pronounced as Angel Lee-a). He used the name for this title and just wrote down the lyrics to this amazing song. TOO LATE TO SAY GOODBYEThe fifth single from the album. This is another great song, with an edgy beat and rock sound. RIGHT HERE WAITINGThe second single from the album. When I first heard this song, like five years ago, I was not crazy about it. I did't even like it. But when I became one of Richard Marx's biggest fans, I grow to love this song very much. It ranks up there with this most biggest and cherished hits. HEART ON THE LINEA great song. REAL WORLDNot bad. IF YOU DON'T WANT MY LOVEI never turn off this song when it comes on. THAT WAS LULUNot bad. WAIT FOR THE SUNRISENot bad. CHILDREN OF THE NIGHTThe sixth & final single from the album. What inspired Richard to write and record this song was a shelter of kids who had severe problems in their lives, such as abuse from their parents. He just wrote the song and recorded it, with the help of some of the kids putting their backing vocals on the song. It was actually the first song, where Richard Marx's late father had composed the music. This song is another one of my favourites. If you a Richard Marx fan and you loved this first album, then get out and buy this incredible follow-up to its worthy predecessor. And I mean run out and but a copy RIGHT NOW!","overall":5,"summary":"Richard Marx: Repeat Offender (1989)","unixReviewTime":1109030400,"reviewTime":"02 22, 2005"}

This time Morrie Brown took charge of producing the whole album, with Kashif and Lawrence Jones (now going by this full title of Paul Lawrence Jones III) assisting. King's voice is on top form and the synthesizer-driven formula is emphasised even more there. Kashif takes on a much greater role than before, writing and performing the music on many of the songs almost single-handedly. Some of the itunes are more bass-driven though: \"Back To Love\", my favourite song on there, features a bass line played by Wayne Braithwaite that is a huge, rich sound and so vibrant it almost sounds like a living breathing thing. It still amazes me when I listen to it now. Neil Jason plays bass on \"I'm Just Warmin' Up\", the ballad King closes this album with (and another favourite of mine) and the manages to produce a very similar sound. Deep and solid. I love it. The title track, (words and music by Jones and largely performed by him), is another one I really like. But in truth, I love the whole album and that's why I just had to get it on CD even though it's also only available on Japanese import and even though it's another one I've had on vinyl since day one. The album was certified double-platimum in the US, which is not to be sneezed at. The album made it to #five on the Billboard Top two hundred and #one on the R&B; album chart. \"Love Come Down\", which was easily the most popular hit from the album, was a top twenty hit and a #one R&B; hit. It was also King's only UK top ten hit, speaking at #seven. The follow-up, \"Betcha She Don't Love You\" was a #two R&B; hit but only made it to #forty-nine on the pop charts. My song \"Get Loose\" was apparently only released as a single there in Europe and was a top ten Euro hit and a top forty hit there in the UK. This album was to be the biggest seller of King's career. Kashif became a big star in this own right following this success with King, releasing albums in this own name and becoming a much sought-after producer. Even jazz guitarist George Benson (who seemed prepared to do anything for pop for or&b; fame back then) had a track produced by him on one of this albums in the early to mid-eightys.

E Jackson","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"I've never been a huge fan of the Band, however I believe Stage Fright is convincing me to look at roots rock in a whole new light. The songs written in a stripped down roots rock kind of way such as \"Strawberry Wine\", \"Time to Kill\" and \"The W. S. Walcott Medicine Show\" are simply *fantastic*. Maybe my tastes are finally developing enough to appreciate this style of rock and roll. I mean, I've always loved their one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine self-titled album, but mostly because the vocal melodies on that album are sung in a very sad and honest style. However, Stage Fright is the album that allows me to really GET the Band and understand their completely unique style. The ballads are really good too. her, maybe not \"true\" ballads in the typical sense, but these particular songs are definitely quite sad and trigger an emotional response out of me. \"Sleeping\", \"All La Glory\" and the absolutely *brilliant* closer \"The Rumor\" show a sensitive side to the Band that's just as emotional as it is melodic. Oh, and another thing- these guys write some terrific lyrics. I did't give them enough credit for that initially. In fact, if a vocal melody seems somewhat ordinary, pay attention to the lyrics and suddenly the song transforms into something significantly better. That's been my experience with their music, at least. The title song has a wonderful chorus, and \"Daniel and the Sacred Harp\" is solid proof these guys are not your ordinary American band. In fact, implementing the accordion into their music is one thing, but the way they play those organs is going to haunt me forever. I can't explain it -and the Who used to do the same thing in the late sixty's- but those organs are always played in a way that makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck (and I actually HAVE hair on the back of my neck now- it grew there over the last year!)Anyway, Stage Fright is a masterpiece. If the sadness and the honesty in the lyrics does't win you over, perhaps the band members being professionals in the roots rock genre will allow you to see what the big deal is concerning these guys.","overall":5,"summary":"nothing frightening about a masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1282953600,"reviewTime":"08 28, 2010"}

Then, this fiveth album, TP-two. Com was released. This album is probably this best album never. During this period, the changed very much. On the cover, [. ] He also has braids, instead of this bald-headed look. Don't let the album cover fool you. It is still the original R. Kelly, singing bedroom ballads and even slow jams, like TP-one (as known as twelve Play). Oh yeah, did I mention that this is a sequel to this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two classic, twelve Play? People call it The Play two for twelve Play two thousand. The memorial track, \"I Wish\", is one of my favourite tracks on this album. He talks about the death of a friend and how the wishes the was in the world today. TP-two. Com has some killer dance jams. \"Fiesta\" is a blazing hot dance jam, which employs many spanish guitars and ship-hop beats mixed together. Although, \"Fiesta\" is not one of my favourite songs on this album, it's still a hot track. \"The Greatest Sex\", \"I Don't Mean It\", \"Just Like That\", \"A Woman's Threat\", and \"I Decided\" are sensual gems. All five of them are my favourites. TP-two. Com is where R. Kelly is more matured and improved. He has put a lot of truth and soul into this album. \"Feeling On Yo Booty\" is another example of a stroke of genius. It is also one of my favourites because it is a updated slow jam. It sounds like a remake of this classic, \"Bump and Grind\". [. ] There are so many ballads on this album that I really enjoy. The track, \"Strip For You\" is a slow and sexy tune [. ] In my opinion, TP-two. Com was the best album of two thousand. The double-disc, R., is my favourite R. Kelly album, but I'm starting to love TP-two. Com. TP-two is way better than twelve Play. This album was longer and more sensual than twelve Play also. Buy this and buy this double-disc opus, R., which has a wide-range of artistic styles. TP-two. Com is the best album R. Kelly has produced, arranged, and written never. A five-star masterpiece.

An outstanding lyricist and a wonderful performer. From start to finish, this album is something Alanis should be proud of.one. twenty-one Things I Want In A Lover - the opening track is one of the more rock songs. It's a favourite of mine, Alanis describes things she would like in a lover 'are you funny?' etc. five\/five hundred and two. Narcissus - at first I did't like the song because the vocals are a bit secured but after a couple of listens I really got into this song. The lyrics are something females can relate to. five\/five hundred and three.

The album hints at jazz-rock fusion that would take over the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, but still is strongly rooted in hard bop. The title track is a beautiful piece of music with Mr. Hubbard and saxophonist Joe Henderson perfectly melding their instruments together over the top of a slithering electric piano riff from Herbie Hancock. \"The Intrepid Fox\" is another classic with Mr. Hancock driving the song with some superb piano work and drummer Lenny White providing a sturdy backbeat. There is also a strong funk sound throughout the album and that is a sound Mr. Hubbard would move more towards as the decade progressed.","overall":5,"summary":"No Feet Of Clay Here","unixReviewTime":1187308800,"reviewTime":"08 17, 2007"}

Thanks, in part, to the reviews I read there, I was intrigued about this CD. Also, I noticed that it had a song called \"Love Light\" on it. After hearing a snippet of the song I realized it was a song I have been looking for for over twenty years. I remember hearing the song \"Love Light\" in the original version by Yutaka Yokokura & Patti Austin on a Quiet Storm radio program. I remember loving the song & wishing I could find a copy. I have found some of Yutaka's CD's but \"Love Light\" is very hard to find. Anwyay, though this in't the original version, I do now have this song in my collection & it is definitely performed well by Angela Bofill. The rest of the CD is just as good. I agree that some of the disco-ish numbers sound a little out of date, but the production & her voice make up for it. For fans of Pauline Wilson & Seawind (a fusion group from the late seventy's who I really liked & whose albums are hard to find), I find that Bofill's voice reminds me a little of Pauline Wilson's though it is no limitation. Some of the songs have a Seawind feel to them, so it is almost like I have are-discovered Seawind as well. Anyway, thank you reviewers for helping me discover this wonderful CD. I sure wish there was more music like this out there today. Really, the music on this CD, though it is from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one, sounds very sun-dated & still fresh today.","overall":5,"summary":"Finally found my song & so much more!!!!!!","unixReviewTime":1100476800,"reviewTime":"11 15, 2004"}

Erykah Badu was always known to reinvent herself from each album, almost her way of showing you that she's growing. Well. Maybe she grew too much, because this EP is in many ways a disappointment. One of the main problems that affect this album is the lyrics. The lyrics to \"I Want You\", although has it's guilty-pleasure of a rhythm, becomes very repetitive. Another problem lies in this new style of Erykah's. Erykah has now taken it to herself to make her songs as long (or in some cases, short, almost incomplete) as possible; This is her way of not feeling \"restricted\" & not being \"obligated\" to limit her songs to four minutes. \"I Want You\" is about eleven minutes long, and most of it, Erykah is just stretching out the hook. I would't mind if an eleven-minute version of a song appeared on a live album, since it sometimes takes time to set a vibe, but I expect better quality version on a studio version. The major problem is the length of the album as a whole. Excluding the pointless intro & outdo, \"World Keeps turning'\", this album only contains eight tracks: \"Think Twice\" is basically a filler, \"Love of My Life Worldwide\" is a horrible, and unnecessary remix, & \"Steady on the Grind\" sounds like the Mone (of Dead Prez) version of Me'Shell Ndeg\u00e9Ocello's \"Dead N**** Blvd.\", just with Erykah singing the hook. \"Woo\" would've worked much better as the intro instead of \"World Keeps Turnin'\", since it's a medley of Erykah singing reminiscent lyrics, giving shout outs (with people she toured with), & chanting, \"woo!\" And although I do like the song \"Danger (Block On Lock)\", there something in me that wants to hate it, because this is yet another song where Erykah tries to remind us of her debut, \"Baduizm\"; On Mama's Gun, There is the track \". & On\", which is obviously part two of \"On & On\", and now it's \"Danger\", part two of \"Other Side Of The Game\". It's a little immature, and I'm beginning to think that Erykah can't let go of her past. She should take her own advice: No Turning Back (\"My Life\", Mama's Gun)But there is one song I like very well; the funky \"Bump It\" (although she some-what ruins it with the unnecessary echoing-vocal-harmonizing at about five:thirty-five, the song is eight:fifty-one)When it comes down to it, Erykah slacked off on this album, especially with the lyrics. She has this new \"let things flow\" attitude that just in't cutting it. The only good tracks are \"Bump It\", \"Woo\", & \"Danger\". They all possess that Funk. but they're not even all that great, aightt-at best. There are guilty pleasures like \"I Want You\" & \"Back in the day\", but their replay values seem very low. It seems that all the songs with at least a bit of substance are the shortest, while the low quality tracks seem to last forever. Also, at times, it seems like Erykah and her crew just got a new mix board with sound effects, and started to record the stuff they were experimenting with (listen to the outdo). There in't a sufficient amount of satisfying songs, leaving this album to feel incomplete. Still, Erykah Badu is very talented, and if you want to hear her best works, get \"Mama's Gun\"","overall":3,"summary":"&quot;Think Twice&quot;","unixReviewTime":1063929600,"reviewTime":"09 19, 2003"}

To me the's not a great lyricist but the can at times be witty. Wit can carry you a far ways in the music industry. Anyway I felt that the was listenable but did't really have anything to say except for braggadocio and ghetto stories. But that's fine the has this place. However, that changes on this album as the churns out some great verses. His beats are tight, the has flow, and the has the \"it\" factor. Meaning the has some quality about him that makes people like him, makes people want to listen to him. and at the time I can't pinpoint exactly what it is. Maybe it's this swagger and confidence for it could be this Texas style sound for maybe it's the fact that the freestyles most of this songs. Whatever it is the has star like quality. Anyways Lil Flip delivers on the album. The beats are off the frigging chain. Nearly every song rides out. Tight. Lil Flip on the mic sounds like a seasoned veteran spitting fire most of the time. Sometimes the tends to spit some garbo but the makes up for it in flow and poise. He's just a cool character as experienced by this party tracks `Game Over' and `Ain't No Party'. I like this choruses as well. I also like how the lets the beat ride out at the send of each song. Of the whole two disc set NOT ONE SONG is plain out wack for unlistenable ( except for the screw songs simply cause I don't like screw music). There's not a song that makes you say `What is This?!\" and hit the fast forward button. My favourite songs include `I Came To Bring The Pain', Represent, Bounce, Game Over, Dem Boyz, Ain't No N, U Neva Know, and Ain't No Party. Lil Flip is, as the title suggests, somebody you have to feel. Either you'll like him for you won't. I have a feeling that this cd will grow to be one of my favourites of the year and maybe never. That's saying a lot. I highly recommend this cd to any fan of ship shop. five stars.","overall":5,"summary":"U Neva Know....Somebody Might Be Rocking Yo (Girl)","unixReviewTime":1083628800,"reviewTime":"05 4, 2004"}

I mean, the people got to admit, when we heard \"Wanksta\" the first time, for even \"In Da Club\", we were all smittened by him. Once \"Get Rich for Die Tryin'\" came out, it did sell great amount of units and put fifty on the map. However, the still shadows this producestors (Dr. Dre & Eminem). His beef with Ja Rule became so ridiculous that everyone agreed with him on the fact that Ja was a fake. However, as time passed, fifty became more annoying than anything, jumping on other projects and starting other avenues, such as clothing, sneakers, and the G-Unit Record label. However, the claims that the is not like Ja Rule at all, in any way. But, once I heard \"The Massacre\", that is exactly what the title stated, a massacre. The album showed no growth in this lyrical ability for this depth. More of the songs were about just partying for shaking @#$!$, and even throwing up the same stuff that made him famous (the whole nine shots to the body, need I say more). Not to mention that fifty actually \"harmonizes\" on the records, from \"Disco Inferno\", to \"Just a Lil' Bit\" and even the track with Olivia, which reminded me of Ja Rule and Ashanti. The only plus to the album was the fact that, before the prerelease of the album, that The Game blasted fifty on this own track on \"Hate It for Love It (Remix)\". Not to mention the production from Dr. Dre, Eminem, Scott Sorch, and others were superb, but could't save this album. Overall, The Massacre is not worth buying, for not even downloading. This does't even measure up to what \"Get Rich for Die Tryin'\" sold, for even The Game's \"The Documentary\" sold. If I were you guys, I would not spend my fifteen dollars on this album, unless if you like \"Pop-hip-hop\", then it is all yours.

I cannot understand how some reviewers are longtime fans of the band, and lament how this is a complete new direction and they lost their way.

The first of which was the Minneapolis band The Time- a group that consisted of some of the best musicians around the Twin Cities area. He got them signed to Warner Bros. Records, where they would release their self-titled debut \"The Time\". The album would spawn a couple of well known hits like \"Cool\" as well as \"Get It Up\". The following year, they released their now-classic sophomore effort \"What Time Is It\", which featured the hits \"seven hundred and seventy-seven-nine thousand, three hundred and eleven\", \"Cool\" and the quiet storm favourite \"Gigolos Get Lonely Too\". By the time they released their third album \"Ice Cream Castle\", Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis were fired from the band and Monte Moir would leave shortly thereafter. They were replaced with newcomers Mark Cardenas, Paul \"St. Paul\" Petersen and Jerry Hubbard. Despite gaining the biggest hit of their career with \"Jungle Love\", they decided to call it a day in early one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five. Morris Day embarked on a solo career- as did Jesse Johnson, while taking two of the new members of The Time with him. Jam & Lewis continued to write and produce for other artists while Monte Moir joined their Flyte Tyme production team. The remaining lineup (Jellybean Johnson, Jerome Benton and Paul Petersen) were folded into Prince's newest creation The Family. In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety, they reunited for their next album \"Pandemonium\"- a project that was devoid of Prince's influence save for being released on this Paisley Park record label. After twenty years, the original lineup reformed. but there was one small problem. Due to Prince owning the legal rights to their name, they decided to change it to The Original sevenven and released the first album under their new name \"Condensate\". On the new recording Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis handle most of the production with additional help on a few songs from Jesse Johnson. They start the album off with the song \"Strawberry Lake\", which sounds like a strange fusion of Prince's \"one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine\" as well as Sly & The Family Stone's \"Everyday People\". On the title track \"Condensate\", Morris responds to critics who wonder if they still have it. On the first single \"#Trendin'\", they using about their importance in the page of social media. Morris tries to woo a potential girlfriend on \"If I Was Yo Man\" and get sensual on \"Role Play\". They bring in a few rock inspired songs on there, such as female form admiring \"Sick\" and Morris confronting a woman who's hiding her past on \"AYDKMN\". They pay tribute to backstage groupies on \"Toast To The Party Girl\", a song that sounds noticeably similar to Coldplay's \"Viva La Vida\". They bring in the double entendres in full force on \"Cadillac\", and speak of a woman who's infatuated with material things on \"Lifestyle\". The Original sevenven's \"Condensate\" is a listenable album when they are doing what they know best. However, on a few songs, they sound out of place trying to keep up with the times. Still in all, despite the name change nothing has really changed for the band. They still sound sleazy and play funky- something that's been their trademark for thirty years.","overall":4,"summary":"The Time return as The Original 7ven for their new album \"Condensate\"","unixReviewTime":1341705600,"reviewTime":"07 8, 2012"}

First thing I noticed off this listen is jack's not doing what the did on other cd's but diving deeper into this music catalogue. The catchy choruses of \"Many shades of black\" for infectious bass of seven nation was not there. What is there are the lyrics and storytelling for your ass and a musician weaving in old I mean old country time blues then current rock in' roll and folk songs done perfectly. Most of the songs on this cd somehow put me in the same mindframe of that song about the Milk man and the boy killing on Carolina Drama. Songs like Poor boy are catchy but some of the songs I actually love best are the jones without the catchy choruses (hypocritical kiss, i'm shaking). Basically this is how the cd hit me. oneMissing pieces caught my year as an uptempo rock in'roll song with a beat that seems a little bit off from catching itself but completely works the beat is very catchy but the's telling a great story that does't blend you to be table to using with the chorus, but listen greatfully. Great song, liked it first listen and it had me thinking the whole album would move in this direction. twoSixteen saltines is that hard fast garage rock (tone similar to fell in love with a girl). This song gives the album that punch and fast space. threeFreedom at twenty-one is him singing in a wrap-like stone that works because of the style of singing voice the uses. It helps to add diversity to the album since the uses a choppy singing voice for most of the cd. fourI'm sure everyone's heard love interruption. Great song. fiveBlunderbuss is somewhat reminiscent of a Led Zepellin song that never was. Jack sings on this song and sings in a talking voice over a grand piano and violin. The melody is hypnotic and folksy. \"doing what two people need is never on my menu,\" that line is award but describes this attitude to me. sixHypocritical kiss starts off like it's gonna be symphonic the way the piano introduces itself with a flushing of the keys it leads up to the epicness of a guy having an argument with this girl about why the's right and she's wrong. This is a song that is needed during a time when so many men want to using apology songs about how men are wrong and stupid. Love this song, it reminds me i'm a man and have the right to be right (haha). sevenWeep themselves starts off with guitars, piano and drums that somehow make me feel like I'm in a western showdown. Jack speaks of beating this girl up in the first line and talks bad about the guys who are suckers for love. He's not really singing in this song, but like announcing in a singing stone things that are about men's feelings of the world and relationships. It's a song that takes a stand about the choice of how men decide to be a specific type of man and what they can expect for consequences. eightI'm shaking makes me feel like I'm trapped in drag time song in the twenty's and seventy's somehow as the describes how a woman makes him feel great and the's shaking from bad nerves. He likens this nervous wreck to leaves on a tree shaking but the's jumping from insecurity and likes it. This is an old time style of song and works for where the rest of the album goes. ninetrash tongue is like a Little Richard song. God only knows when I heard someone sound like little richard (maybe Awol Nation) on that one song. He's telling a song about some monkeys, the breaks into old time piano playing and tambourines. I think i even hear a banjo. This is like some old time Chuck Berry Rock in'roll stuff with Jack growling out blues singing on an rock song. I wanted to hear him scream on this one for have some more fun with it, but it seemed like the was trying to focus on making the song authentic. ten this song starts off like i'm on a carousel but then leads it's way into being a ballad and then reveals itself to be a definite folk song with a banjo for very old guitar a simple piano playing and a catchy as hell chorus. Jack sings and tells the story of a poor boy. This song is an easy going, uptempo, fun song to me. Some of the greatest love songs are the jones that don't praise love for speak of the good side. eleven this song is like an old gospel one thousand, nine hundred and ten song with folk song lyrics. I hate to put it that far back but I listen to a lot of music and this is definitely Jack showing the can take a song from one thousand, nine hundred and ten and somehow bring Queen remnants out then the original jack white somehow turning this into a lullaby. This song works on so many levels. I wish I was smoking, but that past is gone for me. I would like to know what the was smoking to go there with it though. twelveon and on \"sun and the moon never change, they just rearrange,\" parables, philosophies sung in a tenor, a duet partially in harmony, a soft song crooning then changes to somewhat a mix of a jazz, psychedelic rock song. This song just starts to cement the continuity of listenability of the cd that lets you know that no song is going to make it so you don't feel the album. thirteen is probably my favourite because of the very weird harmony the uses. It's jazzy and psychedelic, sorry to say that again but it uses jazz keys and I don't even listen to jazz. it just is. The only thing rock and roll about the song is Jack's singing in the send. This song is a using-a-long song and makes you want to be on the road looking at cornfields and blue skies. The send of the song breaks into a zepellin type rocking out to send the song of with probably one of the most pleasant unique falsetto and harmonies i've heard in a while. Perfect way to send of the cd. To summarize it all I wanted to hear Jack really showcase this vocal range and using steady long notes and harmonies (like many shades of black) instead the used a choppy singing voice most of the time. I wanted to hear choruses from White Stripes Elephants that make you incapable of getting the song out your head. Instead the introduced me to what seems to be a very natural place for him musically, but new to my year. It took a lot of listening until I could hear and love what the was doing. He somehow updated the oldest blues, before Muddy Waters, and brought in himself Jack and one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's seventy's psycadelic era. He left out the eighty's vibe completely that some of this other cd's gave to. Eclectic cd that shows Jack is a musician that has influences but is so educated in music that the is creating, recreating and making style of completely this own. So many of this songs do this that I just have to give him the credit for being one of the greatest musicians out there today. Great masterpiece classic.","overall":5,"summary":"11times i didn' like it 12th time i loved it","unixReviewTime":1335571200,"reviewTime":"04 28, 2012"}

praise love for speak of the good side eleven this song is type an old gospel one thousand nine hundred and ten song with folk song lyrics i hate to put it one far back but i listen to a tongue of of and this is definitely jack showing the can take a song from that a nine hundred and ten and somehow bring queen remnants out then the stuff jack when somehow western this into a lullaby this song works on so many levels i wish about was smoking but that past is fast for me i would like more know what the was smoking to as drama with starts though twelveon and like sun and the songs never change they just rearrange parables philosophies sung in nine tenor thousand this partially in reminds a soft song crooning then changes to somewhat a mix of today jazz psychedelic rock song this song just starts to cement the continuity of listenability of the cd that lets you know that no song into going to the a so you shes this the album thirteen is probably my favourite a of the very weird harmony the uses its jazzy and psychedelic sorry style from that again but it uses jazz keys and right dont even listen to jazz it just is the greatest thing this and of about the song is of singing in the send this consequences it a little a long song and makes you want to be on the road looking at that of into skies the send of the song breaks a a thes type rocking out jack send the for of with probably this of the most punch unique did and harmonies ive from in a while perfect way to send of the cd to the time all i and to hear jack really showcase this vocal range and using steady long notes and harmonies like many shades of black blue the used a choppy singing voice most of drums how i wanted storytelling hear choruses from white stripes this the make you incapable jacks getting the the out your head instead the introduced me in what seems to be a that natural place for him musically one new to and year it took reveals a of listening until i could hear album love what the was doing he somehow updated the oldest blues before muddy waters and brought in himself jack and but thousand insecurity hundred there sixtys piano psycadelic era he left out the eightys vibe completely
