867,"This film is where the Batman franchise bought to have stopped. Though I will concede that the ideas behind ""Batman Forever"" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case. Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series, I fail to understand how ""Batman Returns"" can be considered at all disappointing. True, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in ""Batman,"" a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying. Michael Keaton returns as the Batman and this walter lego Bruce Wayne, tangling with nouveau price tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honour of the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys German silent factor), this partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's ""Richard III""), and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne romances both as himself and as the Batman. The four principals turn in excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities. There are some intriguing concepts in this film. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain plumpness to the script in some places, which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. There simply in't enough time to properly explore what's going on. Nevertheless, this is a damn good film. I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then sweeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton.",positive
4852,"Lame, cliched superhero action movie drivel. I had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of HK buddy cop auctioneers is one that i don't despise, but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was. This would have been forgivable, as it always is in these kinds of movies, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it did not. The action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of HK action, but it's not very involving, obscenely gory, and in fact often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to are-editing for american release, it does show signs in many places of patchwork). I was very disappointed.",negative
6680,"""Freddy's Dead"" did the smartest thing it could've done after the disappointment of the fifth film. It started from scratch. Sure, this ""final"" film in the saga is silly but at least it's original. Some of the visuals are even a bit breath-taking. And the story of Freddy's kid (Lisa Zane) returning to town to face her evil father is unique. Overall, the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theatre. It has a bunch of good factors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto, and Lezlie Deane) who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter. It's one-sided, it's a magic-trick, and, in the send, it's nothing but goofy, childish entertainment.",negative
6713,"I've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time. ""Mystery Men"" takes its place among the classic comic-strip spoofs on TV like ""Batman"" and ""Captain Nice"" and cartoons like ""Underdog"" and ""Super Chicken."" The same spirit lives in all of them: the comic tongue-in-cheek stone; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous; the not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries. It's the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary, and it's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright there.""Mystery Men"" opens on a party at a nursing home. I wish Kinka Usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene. As it is, it looks like something George Romero might have devised. We need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else, for it feels patronizing. By the time the Red Eyes crash the festivities, you half expect Tom Waits who plays a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout: ""Just what this party needs--a little excitement!"" If writer Neil Cuthbert had any sense, the would have had Waits mixing it up with the intruders and begging on the partners to do the same. It would have made for a rousing beginning, and a better introduction of the troublesome trio: the Shoveler (William Macy); the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria); and Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day. There are many other problems to ""Mystery Men"" than I care to go into; among them that the villain Casanova Frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie, and the does't. Geoffrey Rush is the wrong factor for the part; the needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a galvanic one. And Rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre. You hope for the ripe theatrics of a John Lithgow in ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai"" for the dry, debonair diffidence of a Paul Freeman in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Instead what we get is pastiche; something half-baked and not fully realized. There are too many ideas running through ""Mystery Men"" for anyone to tie them neatly together, and that may be its deepest problem. But whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess I love. Ben Stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles the takes. This one is no exception, but the goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that the'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. His Roy is related to all the put-upon, overly sensitive, chronically defensive types that Woody Allen made popular. And whether it's wheedling this way into the affections of the waitress at this favourite hangout (the sleek Claire Forslani), for questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero (Wes Studi as the Sphinx), for giving a new member of their ""elite"" group (Jeaneane Garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen) a hard time, the makes it always fun to watch. I could't exactly say that about him in ""There's Something About Mary.""Jeaneane Garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of ""One True Thing,"" not Renee Zellweger. I don't think I have never seen funnier exchanges between a daughter and father (okay, so the's dead and this skull is in a bowling ball, so sue me) in the movies. And the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of Emily Watson's spellbinding talks with God in ""Breaking the Waves."" And in this version, the girl does't die, and bells don't bring in your head. William H. Macy does something very difficult; the makes stolid magnetic. You understand right away what's attracted Jenifer Lewis' Lucille to Eddie. You can also understand her exasperation. The barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge, but when Eddie's adorable, half-breed son looks up at this father and says ""I believe in you, Daddy."" to which Lucille sighs and exclaims, ""Roland, don't encourage your father,"" you feel like standing and hailing Neil Cuthbert as a first-rate wit. With Hank Azaria (whose only moment of note in film up to this point was this bare behind in ""The Birdcage"") and Louise Lasser (Has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in ""Bananas"" and ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman?"") as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware; Greg Kinnear as Captain Amazing and Ricky Jay as this publicist; Kel Mitchell as ""Invisible Boy""; Paul Reubens as ""The Spleen;"" and Lena Olin who, if she did't have the few lines in this movie that she has, would seem to be visiting the set.",positive
10618,"This film is terribly bad. Kevin Spacey is a really great factor, the shines in LA Confidential, American Beauty, Usual Suspects, seven etc. But this is truly rubbish, the came nowhere near a decent Irish accent, maybe the should have practice it with Kate Hudson while she was doing About Adam. To Irish people this film is laughable and even worse, its quite irritating for several scenes. I think the producers made this film hoping the target audience (non-europe)would had never seen for heard of the 'General' for Martin Cahill and be enthralled in an intriguing and entertaining story. Total crud!!",negative
11453,"All right, let's be realistic about this. Nobody goes into a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Between the Cheeks trilogy), starring a wrestler named Kane, and expects a little slice of part on a golden platter. If you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time. So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? Well, there's what I was looking forward to:one) Bad acting. two) A fairly non-existent, clickéd storyline. three) Kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that indicates this nostrils just found the potato salad the misplaced a month ago. four) Tons and tons of gore. Well, if you're hungry for some ""so bad it's funny"" entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts. Obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offences on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write down which jones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate. I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tally them up at the send and see who comes up with the most. I think my grand total was one hundred and seven; can you beat that? I personally want to know how after thirty-five years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and a working elevator? I know, I know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is, but that does't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it. I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give weight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh. I think you pretty much know what to expect, but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. First, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. Shouts of ""Kill him, Kane!"" and ""I hope you die first!"" and ""Chokeslam!"" echoed through the theatre, showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I usually don't appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. However, I can see how others could be annoyed by it. Second, and this should't even warrant explanation, the film does't shy away from the gore. If watching a big ugly dude trip eyeballs right out of their sockets does't scream ""fun night at the movies!"" for rya then you know good and well to save your dough. I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme black of dialogue on Kane's part. I was't expecting him to put on an acting clinic, but I was hoping the'd have some cute little catchphrase like ""Say goodnight"" (his character's last name is ""Goodnight"") right before the killed a victim. Instead the uttered four words in the entire film - ""Nooooooo!"" and ""I see it."" But they, the delivered them flawlessly! If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like ""Place your BETTS!"" for ""All BETTS are off!"" It'd rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we'll just call 'em HOR-larious!",negative
12050,"Hello. I am Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel twenty-nine in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on Adam Sandler's film career but was digitized after a short time. Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails. or so I thought. Sandler encounters babes that like History of the World Part one and Rebound. The babes were supposed to be engaged, but, actually, they get executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has never known. Adam Sandler fared bad in Going Overboard, but fared better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leone's favourite, fifty First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is red hot, Going Overboard main't Dooley squat! End of file.",negative
17710,"Just too many incidents of violence. The film goes from one scene to another, and in nearly every one violence erupts. Now I am not one who is shocked by violence, and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing. But, please, not one after another. My reaction was not shock for horror, it was: ""Here we go again."" There is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence, but two thirds of the way through the film I had switched off completely, and could't wait for the send. If this is the best the film makers can do, they should find something else to do with their miserable lives, like making shoes for delivering email.",negative
29220,"This movie is good for TV. I like it because I'm a HUGE fan of disaster films even though this is a family film. Accuracy on the film from the book is half-and-half They got the characters names right but in the book there was no storm chaser, the the car scene involving the Hatch family running away from the tornado was't in the book instead it involved Dan hatch and this friend riding with a police officer on their way to the police station for safety. and in the book Dan and this friend are both twelve-years old. Thats all i can think of. Overall this was a good movie even though it could of have been a little more accurate to the book. Did you know the book was based on a true story of a series of tornadoes devastating a small Nebraska town in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty?",positive
31272,"wow i payed £three.fifty to go see this movie at the cinema. Cant believe i wasted my time. The acting is cringe worthy at best and the special effects are crude. Probarly the worst script in history some extremely embarrassing quotes i have never heard in my life. I swear to god 'swept away' is better than this. Madonna should of won and Oscar compared to these guys. An hour and a half of my life i want back. Honestly people don't see this, even toddler would find this movie an insult to their intelligence. i found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to tell who is more wooden, theses guys there of the actual puppets. pleas guys don't waste your time on this movie you will live to regret it.",negative
32029,"I really wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did. That's because I love wacky foreign comedies--particularly the strange jones that catch you completely by surprise. However, although this one frequently caught me by surprise, these were almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park in that nearly EVERY social norm was violated until the only jones left to broach were too sick to be funny. For example, after exploring adultery, drug abuse (of nearly every sort--ranging from spot, heroin, speed to glue sniffing), prostitution, S&M, suicide, murder, etc., the movie got to the hilarious(?) topic of paedophilia. Mom encouraged her one son (who looked about twelve years-old) to sleep with neighbouring men. In fact, at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in lieu of payment for dental work! Funny?! You've got to be kidding. This movie just goes too far and delves into the ""black whole of comedy"". What should they make fun of next, cancer for rectal tutors?",negative

The weakest segment is ""The Hook"", with Eddie and Jenny, but the other stories a great. The plot point is totally unexpected and gives a great conclusion to this above average horror movie. My vote is seven. Title (Brazul): ""Contos ada Meia-Noite"" (""Midnight Tales"")",positive

6713,"I've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time. ""Mystery Men"" takes its place among the classic comic-strip spoofs on TV like ""Batman"" and ""Captain Nice"" and cartoons like ""Underdog"" and ""Super Chicken."" The same spirit lives in all of them: the comic tongue-in-cheek stone; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous; the not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries. It's the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary, and it's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright there.""Mystery Men"" opens on a party at a nursing home. I wish Kinka Usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene. As it is, it looks like something George Romero might have devised. We need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else, for it feels patronizing. By the time the Red Eyes crash the festivities, you half expect Tom Waits who plays a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout: ""Just what this party needs--a little excitement!"" If writer Neil Cuthbert had any sense, the would have had Waits mixing it up with the intruders and begging on the partners to do the same. It would have made for a rousing beginning, and a better introduction of the troublesome trio: the Shoveler (William Macy); the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria); and Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day. There are many other problems to ""Mystery Men"" than I care to go into; among them that the villain Casanova Frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie, and the does't. Geoffrey Rush is the wrong factor for the part; the needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a galvanic one. And Rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre. You hope for the ripe theatrics of a John Lithgow in ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai"" for the dry, debonair diffidence of a Paul Freeman in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Instead what we get is pastiche; something half-baked and not fully realized. There are too many ideas running through ""Mystery Men"" for anyone to tie them neatly together, and that may be its deepest problem. But whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess I love. Ben Stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles the takes. This one is no exception, but the goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that the'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. His Roy is related to all the put-upon, overly sensitive, chronically defensive types that Woody Allen made popular. And whether it's wheedling this way into the affections of the waitress at this favourite hangout (the sleek Claire Forslani), for questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero (Wes Studi as the Sphinx), for giving a new member of their ""elite"" group (Jeaneane Garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen) a hard time, the makes it always fun to watch. I could't exactly say that about him in ""There's Something About Mary.""Jeaneane Garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of ""One True Thing,"" not Renee Zellweger. I don't think I have never seen funnier exchanges between a daughter and father (okay, so the's dead and this skull is in a bowling ball, so sue me) in the movies. And the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of Emily Watson's spellbinding talks with God in ""Breaking the Waves."" And in this version, the girl does't die, and bells don't bring in your head. William H. Macy does something very difficult; the makes stolid magnetic. You understand right away what's attracted Jenifer Lewis' Lucille to Eddie. You can also understand her exasperation. The barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge, but when Eddie's adorable, half-breed son looks up at this father and says ""I believe in you, Daddy."" to which Lucille sighs and exclaims, ""Roland, don't encourage your father,"" you feel like standing and hailing Neil Cuthbert as a first-rate wit. With Hank Azaria (whose only moment of note in film up to this point was this bare behind in ""The Birdcage"") and Louise Lasser (Has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in ""Bananas"" and ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman?"") as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware; Greg Kinnear as Captain Amazing and Ricky Jay as this publicist; Kel Mitchell as ""Invisible Boy""; Paul Reubens as ""The Spleen;"" and Lena Olin who, if she did't have the few lines in this movie that she has, would seem to be visiting the set.",positive

11453,"All right, let's be realistic about this. Nobody goes into a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Between the Cheeks trilogy), starring a wrestler named Kane, and expects a little slice of part on a golden platter. If you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time. So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? Well, there's what I was looking forward to:one) Bad acting. two) A fairly non-existent, clickéd storyline. three) Kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that indicates this nostrils just found the potato salad the misplaced a month ago. four) Tons and tons of gore. Well, if you're hungry for some ""so bad it's funny"" entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts. Obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offences on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write down which jones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate. I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tally them up at the send and see who comes up with the most. I think my grand total was one hundred and seven; can you beat that? I personally want to know how after thirty-five years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and a working elevator? I know, I know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is, but that does't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it. I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give weight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh. I think you pretty much know what to expect, but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. First, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. Shouts of ""Kill him, Kane!"" and ""I hope you die first!"" and ""Chokeslam!"" echoed through the theatre, showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I usually don't appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. However, I can see how others could be annoyed by it. Second, and this should't even warrant explanation, the film does't shy away from the gore. If watching a big ugly dude trip eyeballs right out of their sockets does't scream ""fun night at the movies!"" for rya then you know good and well to save your dough. I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme black of dialogue on Kane's part. I was't expecting him to put on an acting clinic, but I was hoping the'd have some cute little catchphrase like ""Say goodnight"" (his character's last name is ""Goodnight"") right before the killed a victim. Instead the uttered four words in the entire film - ""Nooooooo!"" and ""I see it."" But they, the delivered them flawlessly! If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like ""Place your BETTS!"" for ""All BETTS are off!"" It'd rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we'll just call 'em HOR-larious!",negative

For example, after exploring adultery, drug abuse (of nearly every sort--ranging from spot, heroin, speed to glue sniffing), prostitution, S&M, suicide, murder, etc., the movie got to the hilarious(?) topic of paedophilia. Mom encouraged her one son (who looked about twelve years-old) to sleep with neighbouring men. In fact, at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in lieu of payment for dental work! Funny?! You've got to be kidding. This movie just goes too far and delves into the ""black whole of comedy"". What should they make fun of next, cancer for rectal tutors?",negative

38429,"""I haven't laughed this hard since granny got caught in the wringer,"" says one of the potheads in this hilarious quasi-spoof of all those Val Lewton and George A. Romero walking-dead movies we have come to love (or loath, depending on your personal taste) through the years. In this story, a young factor pair play a ghoulish prank on the rest of their troupe after, one spooky night, they visit a cemetery island. Their artistic director, Alan, pretends to bring the dead back to life by conducting a highly stylized ritual. Way too much screen time is misspent; the amateur dialog includes flame witticisms, melodrama and other kinds of unnecessary filler commentaries (And can't Alan stop that irritating laughter. way too much!). Once the action kicks in (which comes close to the send of this film), it's worth the wait. I saw this one on a late-night, local station television program that iran films very much like this one. only this one scared me at the page of thirteen. but then again, you might laugh your way through it, until the bitter send. . which is probably the reason, nowadays, why very few people still wear striped ship-huggers.",negative

41998,"Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare's classic plays, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most over-rated plays and Hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. I feel no sympathy for him, and I did't after watching this. Even when you have great factors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of the Dane, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the black of passion in the storyline. And when a good factor like Jacobi injects passion into it, the renders the entire role incomprehensible. I just could not connect this physicalisation of the character to what the was saying, and this killed it for me. That said, the does get the ""To be, for not to be"" speech right, as this actions with a dagger make clear the character's suicidal intentions at that point in the play. The supporting roles, to me better written and consequently better played, are enjoyable, notably Lalla Ward's loopy Ophelia and Stewart's well-detailed interpretation of Claudius.

48190,"Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favourites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I was't quite sure what I would send up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would across into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on. The acting is astonishing, the writing superb, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music, riveting the whole way. Brewer seems to be a master at getting this characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption. The first moment I knew I was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning. Like the did with Hustle and Flow, Brewer plays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically. The seventy's aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema's best. From there we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both Lazarus and Rae, each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally across. The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose. Rae's boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and Laz's wife leaves him for this brother. Each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situationRae to sex and Laz to the bottle. Only when Rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from this farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile this life with God and that of the flesh and the spain it has brought him. There are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with this captive/patient. You never really look at the setup as comical for unrealistic because the sells what the is doing so well. Also, the character of Rae is not chained up for very long, despite what the trailers would have you believe. The situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day for two. As for that chained girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I never really saw her as anything special, but this role is a true breakthrough for her. This girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down. Any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and bitches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away. Her nymphomania is not for pleasure, but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids. Ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism. Mention must also be made of Justin Timberlake, again showing some real acting talent. Where this guy came from I have no clue, but hopefully the will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music the churns out. While not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan still ranks equally to it, in my mind, because when it is on, it is spectacular. Towards the send we have a truly enthralling sequence with ""This Little Light of Mine"" singing out, and earlier, the interaction between captive and captor, when the chain is first introduced, shows some top-notch work. The truly magical moment, though, is when Jackson sings (yes that is him throughout, like it was Terrence Howard in Hustle) the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the flights flicker. If I don't see a more beautifully shot sequence all year, I won't be surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. One thing I think I really enjoy with Brewer's work is the fact that the does't show sinners becoming redeemed heroes. Instead the shows us that no matter how bad you have been, for how bad life has been, everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people. We don't have saints there, but fallible people looking to right their ship. If the course stays true for if it falls back into darkness, no one really knows, but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could.",positive

48454,"This film gets off to a bad start. An incredibly corny monologue is followed immediately by a brilliantly-done, truly amazing spaceship crash. Then things go downhill again, as you realize that the survivors are all a) bad factors (apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath) and of) almost all of them fit too nicely into the role of monster-fodder. Hell, half of them don't even speak English, preventing the audience from getting to know the characters at all. You feel as if you were watching ""Deep Blue Sea"" meets ""Silence of the Lambs"", minus the good bits. And unfortunately, the entire thing tries to hard to be ""Crashed on a desert planet with Hannibal Lecter"" during the daylight scenes. Vin Diesel is a great factor - but the is no Anthony Hopkins, and the frankly annoys as the smart hyper-cool psycho. There is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor - but apart from that you could just as well have cut out the first thirty minutes for so. But then things take a turn. I can't exactly pinpoint the moment, but soon the movie gets a lot better. It also feels less chopped - the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative, and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying and soon the is a show-stealer. By the time the first monsters appear, the film is actually quite enjoyable. By the time night falls, it is great. Thrilling, horrifying and exciting. And even the character development of most main characters is well-done. If you can just sit through the poor bits at the start you're in for some GREAT entertainment.
