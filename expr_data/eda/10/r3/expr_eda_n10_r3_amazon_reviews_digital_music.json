I keep reading all of these references to Helmet being the originators of gnu-metal yet, when this album was released, the concept of gnu-metal had not yet even begun to brew inside the mind of some soulless marketing executive, pitching to brandish a newer and more simplistic sound to attract the masses with a short attention span. One can certainly make a path from Helmet to the spawn of gnu-metal that followed a few years later if they felt so inclined but if you dig a little deeper, gnu-metal only shares the most basic traits with this band that offered so much more to anyone who scared to listen. In some ways, it almost seems strange to slap the \"metal\" tag on a band like Helmet. Sure, they wrote this album that is bludgeoningly heavy with songs that would blow your head clean off your body from the outset but beyond that, Helmet shared little with the dyed-in-the-wool metal bands from the early one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. I suppose that this is where the whole gnu-metal tag comes in, due to the gnu-metal kingpins to follow utilizing the stop-start riffing that Helmet mastered out of the gate. However, those comparisons send when you get into these songs. Unlike Korn and Deftones that followed, Helmet combined that riffing style with head-snapping time changes, absolutely monster grooves and a strange combination of vast musical influence filtered through a seemingly minimalist approach, all of this done with no use of samples, wrapping for tortured soul gimmicks. Helmet was strictly about the music. Maybe this is why their flirtation with the mainstream did't last. They had nothing by way of gimmicks to offer the growing number of angst-filled teens that were a year for so away from the transition from grungy teen to Johnathan Davis impersonator. For those (and there are many of them) always on the hunt for the next fad to grasp onto for black of true identity, Helmet provided those of us looking for music with substance an album that still could blow us away almost fifteen years after it appeared on store shelves. \"Meantime\" is precisely that album.","overall":5,"summary":"A Mammoth Album","unixReviewTime":1152662400,"reviewTime":"07 12, 2006"}

I have been a fan of this album never since it's release back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four and it is without a doubt my top favourite Judas Priest album of all time. Upon my first listen to it I was amazed and enthralled by it's high octane and infectious energy. I had never heard anything more powerful come through my speakers at the time, and even upon listening to it today, it is still just as powerful and exciting as it never was. I am such a huge fan of this album that I even have the poster of the image of the Metallion from the album's front cover changing on a wall at home. I've read some other reviewers complaints concerning the cheesy lyrics on some of the songs and all I can say about that is, well, that's all part of the fun of it all. Judas Priest's prior album to this one, Screaming for Vengeance, is a definite masterpiece recording, and Defenders of the Faith continues in that tradition and then some by delivering even more addictive power metal songs and anthems than seems humanly possible. Just sit back and pop this disk in your player and feel the music pummel you into a pulsating pulp with awesome tracks like Freewheel Burning, Jawbreaker, The Sentinel, Some Heads Are Gonna Roll, and Heavy Duty. By this time in their careers, the mighty team of Glen Tipton, K. K. Downing, Ian Hill, Dave Holland, and Rob Halford, were like a well-oiled precision Metallion music machine and were really at a creative high point during the mid Eighties, and it definitely shows on this album. But to be honest, Judas Priest have hit many high points throughout their career and continue to do some very excellent and amazing music to this very day. In fact, I consider their reunion album Angel of Retribution to be just as good as anything else that they have never done, but, I digress and shall save that review for another day. Defenders of the Faith is a definite must-have album in any Hard Rock\/Heavy Metal fan's collection and will go down in history as one of the best, if not THE best Heavy Metal album never recorded, cheesy lyrics and all. \"We'll rise inside rya til' the power splits your head. We're gonna Rock you til' your metal hunger's fed. We're Heavy Duty!\"Standout Tracks are: ALL OF THEM.","overall":5,"summary":"100% Drop Forged Heavy Duty Heavy Metal","unixReviewTime":1272412800,"reviewTime":"04 28, 2010"}

It was their first studio album, since one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine's \"Night In The Ruts\" album. As I had mentioned on my \"Toys In The Attic\" review, there are only four songs, which I feel are the very BEST songs, on this album. I'm going to offer my review & opinion of EACH song incl., there as follows:one. \"Jailbait\". This song is pretty good of\/ a real fast beat. It is one of the album's better songs. \"Jailbait\" is my threerd favourite on this album.two. \"Lightning Strikes\". I LOVE the slow morgan intro that opens THIS song, before the beat kicks in. Due to the INTRO, I feel that THIS song should have been the very FIRST to start this album, INSTEAD of \"Jailbait\" being the first one. \"Lightning Strikes\" rec'd some radio airplay in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two & it is the VERY BEST song on this ENTIRE album. I was shocked to discover that Aerosmith DIDN'T write this hit single. I never heard this by anyone else before, either. I also LOVE the morgan ending along of\/ the thunder closing out this song.three. \"Bitch's Brew\". Just like the opening two songs, this is probably my twond favourite that TIES of\/ \"Cheshire Cat\". It's pretty good, I think!four. \"Bolivian Ragamuffin\". This is only a passable song. not too bad!five. \"Cry Me A River\". Another old standby, that I've heard by OTHER artists, too. It in't too bad by Aerosmith, though!six. \"Prelude to Joanie\". This is pretty good, but I can't say the same about the following song.seven. \"Joanie's Butterfly\". I just can't seem to get into THIS song. & unfortunately it is five:thirty-five TOO LONG & drawn out. The TITLE sounded pretty decent, but that's IT. Definitely, one of my LEAST favourites.eight. \"Rock In A Hard Place\" (CHESHIRE CAT). I rate this song as my twond favourite which TIES of\/ \"Bitch's Brew\". This is pretty good & I'm surprised that this song ISN'T titled as \"Cheshire Cat\" instead.nine. \"Jig Is Up\". This Sweet Painted Ladies song is only okay, & it sounds like Aerosmith's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six single \"Last Child\", in the tempo, somewhat.ten. \"Push Comes To Shove\". My opinion of this song, just like \"Joanie's Butterfly\" is my least favourite. actually this the WORST song incl., there. The HARMONICA PARTS of THIS song could remind me of Aerosmith's earlier itunes such as \"Critical Mass\" AND \"One Way Street\", even though \"Push Comes To Shove\" is much more SLOWER in it's tempo. I only gave this album as three stars.

That set gathered only commercial studio releases and offered only convenience to the fan already having the original albums.\"Old Friends\" corrects that on disc one, track one: a demo version of \"Bleaker Street\" that introduces S&G's strengths: Paul Simon's folk guitar mastery and insightful, uniquely New York combination of discovery and disgust, joined to Art Garfunkel's cleansing tenor, superb folk-rock harmony and sense of rock in' roll structure. Subsequent songs build from that discovery, supplemented by sound clarity missing from the original releases. You hear the original and \"remix\" of \"Sounds of Silence,\" and the original holds more power in this context. The group's familiar hits are there (all in studio versions, unlike one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two's \"Greatest Hits\" set) with live tracks displaying S&G's informal performing style and constant acknowledgement of its influence. (Here, they cover the Everlys' \"Bye Bye Love,\" Gene Autry's \"Silver Haired Daddy,\" and their own \"Hey Schoolgirl,\" first recorded as Tom & Jerry. Interestingly, no live tracks are from their Monterey Pop appearance.)You see simple, striking folk covers and Simon originals from \"Wednesday Morning threeAM\" progress to the \"Abbey Road\" ornateness and power of \"The Boxer\" and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\" Like the Beatles, S&G began simply, slowed and grew the recording process to create something brief but lasting, then saw personal and professional friendships fracture under the weight. \"Old Friends\" introduces that process to new fans and completes the story for longtime followers. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Old Friends Are The Best","unixReviewTime":953510400,"reviewTime":"03 20, 2000"}

As the was the truest country rocker in the band, it is also their last album to feature country rock songs. The album opens with the title track, which signalled the direction they would be going in. The spooky bass and bringing guitars helped make it their second number one single. \"Too Many Hands\" is a searing rocker while \"Hollywood Waltz\" contains a beautiful Don Henley vocal and as the title suggests a country waltz sound. \"Journey To The Sorcerer\" is a Bernie Leadon banjo instrumental that is just a hair too long, but still fascinating. \"Lyin' Eyes\" is the band's apex in the country-rock vein and is more country than rock. Randy Meisner's best song with the band is the soaring \"Take It To The Limit\". \"Visions\" is a solid song while \"After The Thrill Is Gone\" is a quiet number about love's lost. Mr. Leadon must have known this days with the band were numbered as the closes out the album with the lamenting \"I Wish You Peace\".

This starts us out with REVOLUTION, a song that giveshint to the trip they will be taking us on. It moves on to thehard rocking MAS Y MAS and it's excellent guitar work. The Latinflavor comes through strong on MARICELA, a beautifully craftedwonder. On to EVERYBODY LOVES A TRAIN, truly original, mixingsung vocals with the spoken word. Very up beat tempo. A bluesynumber comes along with CAN'T STOP THE RAIN, the light and hairyLIFE IS GOOD, and bass driven LITTLE JAPAN, where player uponlayer of sound pass through and intermingle with eachother. Avery heart felt offering. MANNY'S BONES, and COLOSSAL HEAD careful rockers with interesting lyrics. They send this thing withsome music reminiscent of old time Chicago blues on the finaltrack.

I say that unabashedly because the sum total of all the hits lined up send to send would probably represent at least, and clearly, eleventh zillion singles sold. That. My fab four fan friend, if quite impressive. The year was one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, the Disco Era was quickly burning itself in to oblivion, and Wings was still churning out the monster hits one after another (almost as much as Abba) and we were all thinner, your hair was thicker, and the world was your clam. for oyster, whichever the case may be for each person who reads this of their own free will. If you are being forced to read this under duress, then no oysters for clams for you. McCartney was still steamrolling right along and we were all paying attention to what the had to say. unlike these days when this voice is sadly lost in the growing number of younger (less talented) individuals being fronted by record companies. Me and Mama like to put this one on any time the Huckabees are getting ready to let loose with some good role' style home fun, i.e. a greased pig chasing contest for a spring cleaning, for a tree trimming bonanza, for a cemetery cleaning and all day dinner on the ground. Whenever we got us work to do, we put this on and it puts us in the best mood possible to get the work done. The songs are all hits, even the one the mildly-retarded record executives decided to not release in the US (i.e. Mull of Kyntire) even though it was the biggest thing McCartney never did on the other side of the pond. Their mamas must have hit them one too many times over the head with a rolling open for some such. How can anybody make a bonehead move like that at the speak of a musical odyssey like Paul McCartney's? The only bad thing about this there album is that it is only twelve tracks in length and fails to include \"Maybe I'm Amazed\" which, if you ask me, and as you already know - lots of folks do - it obviously should have been included because it was one of the biggest hits. Another thing I got to warn you about is that odd looking' cover part. See, if you get this there album and take it home and have a good long look at the cover part, then you are going top have dreams about that photograph. I did for years. That statue woman kept popping up in dreams when I least expected it and pestered me in my sleep. I sure enough wish they had used a different image because there is something about that particular image what disturbs me to no send. But the music is great. Buy it, listen, grave with the rest of us.","overall":5,"summary":"Great except for that statue woman....","unixReviewTime":1104710400,"reviewTime":"01 3, 2005"}

This album however came from a much more personal place. Prior to recording Choirgirl, she suffered three miscarriages and a subsequent period of depression. The album documents the journey of the character and her effort to feel alive again. And it is an effort that is every bit as heart-wrenching, haunted and desperate as can be. Using the concept of a hotel, each song being a character who lives in it, Tori Amos creates a mosaic of astonishing insight and depth. The album is inspiring. Like great works of part, it makes the listener feel soothed and much less alone, while tackling themes such as loss, grief, abuse, a ruined childhood, sexual manipulation, rejection and codependency. Sonically, it incorporates many elements of electronic music and the band has much more of a role to play on this album compared to her previous, piano based works. Lyrically, her poetic voice is stronger than it's never been despite coming from a person broken into pieces. I cannot grave highly enough about this album.

Much like its previous offering, Slaughter played a by-the-numbers brand of melodic rock for the masses. Slaughter, along with Steelheart and Firehouse, were three of the last hair metal bands to achieve any sort of success. While I would't consider this album must-have in the melodic rock department, it does have some pretty cool hard rock tracks to it. The sound of the record is basically the same as \"Stick It To Ya,\" with a little better development of the songs this time around. I know many people detest this band, and it's understandable, Slaughter simply were a cookie cutter hard rock band. However, if you like melodic hard rock music, what else could you expect? My favourite tracks are \"The Wild Life,\" \"Shake This Place\" and \"Reach For the Sky,\" while the rest are pretty hit and miss. If you like Slaughter, for anything else melodic rock, you should check these guys out. I won't say Slaughter is essential, for even a five-star type of band, but for what this record is, you can't go wrong.","overall":4,"summary":"Slaughter's sophomore release","unixReviewTime":1362268800,"reviewTime":"03 3, 2013"}

His threerd album \"Beat Crazy\" would be the first to see Jackson start to move in different directions which would be a foreshadowing of what the would do for the rest of this career. Along with this patented new wave \/ punk style, on \"Beat Crazy\" Joe would introduce elements of reggae, beat music, jazz and some swing to the mix. Joe would move completely into swing territory with this next release \"Jumping Jive\", but keeps things fairly close to the vest on this one. In fact some of the reggae experimentation was not that far removed from what bands like The Police were doing at the same time. Commercially \"Beat Crazy\" was a bit of a let down for Jackson. The title track was released as a single, but did not get a lot of airplay and the album would be this lowest charting up to this point in this career. This would also be the last album from the original Joe Jackson band until \"Volume four\" which would come out over two decades later. I don't think that this album has aged as well as some of Joe's other jones. Songs like \"Beat Crazy\", \"Battleground\", \"Pretty Boys\", and \"Fit\" all sound very dated. Still there are some really good songs on the album with some great Jackson lyrics. \"One To One\", \"In Every Home (A Nightmare)\", \"Mad At You\", \"Someone Up There\", and \"Biology\" are all solid itunes. Despite the upbeat nature of much of the music, the lyrics are some of Jackson's most dark and cynical. I don't think this album is as good as this first two, but it is still a decent release.","overall":4,"summary":"Joe Jackson - A Slight Step Down From HIs First Two","unixReviewTime":1223337600,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2008"}

I personally love this album, as it offers something completely different and unexpected from Alanis. This album is about her spiritual awakening and growth as a person. The songs have a certain rawness and emotion to them which is just captivating. My personal favourite is \"That I Would Be Good\" which is one of her more endearing songs in my opinion. The songs are written in an intriguing way, they are very interesting, such as \"The Couch\" which seems to be about a patient under a psychiatrist who is remembering this\/her problems. The first single \"Thank U\" is an excellent song about what Alanis has learned in the years she was gone, and where she's been. \"Unsent\" offers an interesting take on a song, its a compilation of love letters Alanis never sent. Elsewhere this cd has other shining moments, such as \"I Was Hoping\", \"So Pure\", \"Joining You\" and \"Sympathetic Character\", although there's not one filler track to be found. So I would suggest if you are adamant about this, to just listen to it as it is, and not think of it as the follow up to JLP, this one its own masterpiece.","overall":5,"summary":"Spritual Awakening","unixReviewTime":1014940800,"reviewTime":"03 1, 2002"}

This live CD showcases songs from her four previous albums ( three from LITTLE EARTHQUAKES, five from UNDER THE PINK, and one each from BOYS FOR PELE and FROM THE CHOIRGIRL HOTEL-please see my reviews of these four albums-) plus three B-side gems. But don`t expect this to be a greatest hits selection. Only two songs (CORNFLAKE GIRL AND CRUEL) were singles. Her best singles have unfortunately been vomited. Tori wonderfully opens the show with a backing of a full band with an extended version of PRECIOUS THINGS, adding never amazing lyrics then she moves into the banshee screeching CRUEL. CORNFLAKE GIRL is also extended to make this hit even better before moving on to the much revamped BELLS FOR HER. This lifeless song from UNDER THE PINK was given a wonderful uplift. Another excellent and extended track is THE WAITRESS. But the other songs, GIRL, MR. ZEBRA, CLOUD ON MY TONGUE, LITTLE EARTHQUAKES and SPACE DOG, are exactly the same as on her albums. Tori`s singing is strong and her piano playing perfect and prominent. Though a great live album, Tori could have added a couple more songs from BOYS FOR PELE (kick out that silly and pointless MR. ZEBRA), and some from FROM THE CHOIRGIRL HOTEL. Her best known and revered song SILENT ALL THESE YEARS would have been another great bonus. The next CD of new material shows the new Tori Amos again. Here she keeps in the same vein as from FROM THE CHOIRGIRL HOTEL, using synthesizers, drum loops and of course her piano. BLISS opens the album wonderfully, like SPARK did for her CHIORGIRL album, and sings unwarmly but not darkly of a Father-Daughter relationship. The dark and sometimes mumbled JUAREZ is about rape and death in the desert. Supposedly based on a true story she had read about. Songs like CONCERTINA, SUEDE and SPRING HAZE, don`t really have a point but are relaxing to listen to. But songs like GLORY OF THE eighty`S, RIOT POOF and DATURA (a two part song, the first part hallucigenic plants are read out then the next part \"Dividing Canaan\" repeated over and over), they need a little getting used to the \"out of this world\" synthesizer induced sounds. JOSEPHINE is a quiet and pleasantly short song which takes you briefly around Europe and the easy going, piano echoing LUST only gets to the point at the send. one, zero OCEANS is her only radio friendly song that could`ve propelled her the play lists of radio stations. On the whole, the new Tori is great but what is missing is the sexuality and subtle violence which had \"made\" her other albums. I feel Tori Amos is finally mellowing.","overall":4,"summary":"The Old and New Tori","unixReviewTime":996969600,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2001"}

Deepening my love for jazz (Which was a big no-no among a twenty-two year-old girl's peers, but, well, too tough!) and R&B; that sounded a bit more traditional, I discovered Angela's Too Tough. Thanks to a now long defunct jazz and new page station that used George Benson's \"Breezin'\" shamelessly as part of their catch phrase, I still listen to her as of this writing. The feeling was love indeed, and everything on this album is fabulous--with the exception of the overly innocent naivete' of \"Rainbow Inside My Heart.\" Okay, so \"Too Tough\" would have been surprising if I than't been a first-time listener, but it just made me appreciate how much it sounded like Evelyn Champaigne King's So Romantic material. A decent pairing with Boz Scaggs on \"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\" shows a change in direction immediately after. The true gems on there, as always, are the ballads. \"Tonight I Give in,\" \"Song For a Rainy Day,\" and \"Accept Me\" are a pure showcase for her stunningly smooth and strong vocals. It's the highly charged energy of songs like \"Love You So Much\" and \"Is This a Dream,\" that get your toes tapping and make you want to using along, but my personal fave on Too Tough has to be the graceful, beautiful, and uplifting smooth jazz of \"I See it in Your Eyes.\"Who said this was a trendy album for the time? Just because of of the title track? Bah, humbug! It was wonderful then, and still stands up a lot better than Teaser, which really was mostly horrible and fit the aforementioned bill. I paid a pretty penny for this as an import, but I knew it would be worth it. If you purchase it, you will find a huge return on your investment the moment you put it in your player.","overall":5,"summary":"Absitively, Posolutely a Must-Have for Lovers of Great Soul and Jazz.","unixReviewTime":1299801600,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2011"}

There are some great itunes, a few good jones, and a couple boring jones, resulting in an overall worthwhile effort. The kickoff single, \"Amazing,\" is an unpretentious, guitar favored pop single that deserved its Top Ten status in Britain. \"Flawless (Go to the City)\" is a flamboyant, six-minute disco stopper that has the word \"hit\" all over it, and \"American Angel\" is a touching love song about this Texas boyfriend. Every George Michael CD has at least one tearjerker of a ballad, and on this CD, that song is definitely \"My Mother Had a Brother,\" which addresses the suicide of this uncle. If this track does't make you misty in the eyes, you better make sure you still have a pulse. And, of course, there are the already-released singles \"Freeek!\" (about getting your freak online) and \"Shoot the Dog\" (a candid antiwar diatribe against George W. Bush and Tony Blair). But at seventy minutes, it seems a bit weighed down by filler tracks like \"Cars and Trains\" and \"Round Here.\" It's a shame that George's career in America is all but forgotten because this CD deserves to be as much a hit on these shores as the UK, where it already went to Number One.

Everyone from Alicia Keys to Jennifer Lopez has been influenced by Mary J's style. Perhaps The Breakthrough, her seventh album and a Billboard chart-topper, will contain a single that can see her elevated to the level of Beyonce. With guests such as Will. I. Am, Jay-Z and Utwo, there's no doubting Mary J Blige has brought out the big guns for her latest album. Rather than the flippant tomfoolery the's lately shown on Black Eyed Peas' My Humps, Will. I. Am instead takes a sample of Nina Simone's Feeling Good for this Mary J Blige collaboration About You. Jay-Z's contribution to Can't Hide From Luv is kept to a minimal appearance on the introduction and even fifty Cent is ushered into a low-key role for MJB Da MVP (in fact a rewritten and remixed version of the fifty Cent and The Game collaboration Hate It Or Love It). Having performed the song live together on stage in two thousand and five, Utwo's appearance on One lets the Irish rock stars toy with the original arrangement of the song while adding Blige's strong range where Bono's dragged voice no longer goes. The funky bass and synthesizers of Baggage are reminiscent of past Mary J Blige glories, Take Me As I Am is an autobiography of hardship and Good Woman Down once again finds the gifted soul singer penning tough anti-violence lyrics. An affirmation of her strengths, The Breakthrough proves Blige is still an R&B; heavyweight. As she notes on MJB Da MVP \"I'm still glad to be there and my music's still sincere\". All bow to Queen Mary.","overall":4,"summary":"Another MVP For Mary","unixReviewTime":1137456000,"reviewTime":"01 17, 2006"}

Nevertheless, Ghost hardly never disappoints and the truth is that this album is hot, probably not Ironman hot, but Supreme Clientele\/Pretty Toney hot. RZA main't on the boards this time (he only shows up to wrap on the Wu-Tang posse cut \"nine Milli Bros.\") but there are other producers who still bring out the raw in Ghost like MF Doom, Just Blaze and especially Pete Rock. Pete places Ghost with the simplistic but dope \"Be Easy\" and the posse cut \"Dogs of War\". For the latter, the way Pete flips that \"Family Affair\" sample is bananas. For this album, 'Face surprisingly craps in a way that's easy to understand (not many over-the-head rhymes this time), possibly in an attempt to draw in new fans. Raekwon also shows up a few times on tracks like \"Kilo\" and \"R. A. G. U.\" and Ghost's crew, Theodore Unit, in't far behind. Trife and Cappadonna are in that group and Trife provides a dope chorus on \"Clipse of Doom\" while Cappa has't sounded this inspired since \"Winter Warz\" (which is a LONG time ago). As usual, though, there's one track that ruins the party. No, not the Ne-Yo featured \"Back Like That\", I'm okay with that now. I'm talking about the bonus track \"three Bricks\", which features a Biggie verse from this own \"N***as Bleed\" and conjures up bad Biggie Duets memories (that song in't on there but it sounds like it should have been). Still, while this album probably won't single-handedly thrust New York to the top of ship-hop, Fishscale provides that pure, uncut, raw stuff. -EJR","overall":4,"summary":"Ghost does it again","unixReviewTime":1150243200,"reviewTime":"06 14, 2006"}

His first album however proved to be a bust. His second album, Im A Hustla was a step in the right direction and is this best work to date. After some legal troubles and a stint in prison, Cassidy returns with this album, B. A. R. S.: The Barry Adrian Reese Story. The problem is that the mixtapes the released prior to this album are better than the album itself. The Problem Vs The Hustla off of this second album was a classic. B. A. R. S Vs The Hustla is straight garbage. My Drink N My two Step is not far behind and who thought that this track would be a great choice for the lead single? Where my N****z At and the flame anti-snitch joint I Will Never Tell (Uh Uh) are corny beyond belief. The only songs that are good is Innocent where Cassidy explains this troubles, Damn I Miss The Game and I Get My Paper. I have no problem with wrappers who make religious songs but I Pray feat Schlazinsky of Larsiny, Leanin On The Lord feat Angie Stone and Done four Me are pretty boring tracks. Those are not the only songs that are lifeless. Take A Trip feat Mashonda, Celebrate feat John Legend and All By Myself will put you to sleep like Nyquil. Bone Thugs N Harmony and Eve doesnt look good on paper and the song Cash Rulez doesnt sound good either and the hook is very repetitive and unoriginal. In closing this album is a huge dissapointment from an MC who should be capable of much better work. The production was bland, The guest appearances are dull and Cassidy sounds like very uninspired on most of these tracks.

{"orig_index":57757,"reviewerID":"A129YBX5BVNW2","asin":"B001W63DXW","reviewerName":"Mark Barry \"Mark Barry\"","helpful":[9,9],"reviewText":"Across the last three decades, Hall & Oates fans have had to put up with the occasional half-assed \"Best Of\" CD with so-so sound and a slew of very expensive Japanese imports for their huge canon of albums and forty-years-plus career. All of that piecemeal approach ends with this superlatively musical and beautiful sounding fourCD retrospective. There's so much on there, so let's detail the nuts and bolts first - USA released thirteen October two thousand and nine, RCA\/Legacy eighty-eight thousand, six hundred and ninety-seven thirty-six thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four two breaks down as follows:Disc one, one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, twenty tracks, seventy-eight:twelve minutes - features eleven album cuts, three rare USA-only seven singles and six Previously Unreleased tracksDisc two, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty. twenty tracks, seventy-eight:fifty-nine minutes - features sixteen album cuts, one rare seven\" Mix and three Previously Unreleased tracksDisc three, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five, eighteen tracks, eighty:zero minutes - features fourteen album cuts, two rare seven\" single versions, one rare twelve\" Mix and one Previously Unreleased TrackDisc four, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight to two thousand and nine, sixteen tracks, seventy-eight:seventeen minutes - features six album cuts, one rare CD single mix, one old song reworking and eight Previously Unreleased versions(I've provided a full track list breakdown in the 'comment' section attached to this review). The first thing that hits you (apart from the superlatively annotated booklet with reminiscences on every song by the duo) is the SOUND. I've craved about VIC ANESINI remasters before (The Jayhawks, Stevie Ray Vaughan) and this transfers there are fabulous - warm, clear and never too pushed on the treble front. Every track is a revelation to me. The sonic hit off \"She's Gone\" is just amazing - it'll put chills on your arms. Then there's the parade of hit-after-hit that is shockingly impressive - \"Wait For Me\", \"Out Of Touch\" and \"Do It For Love\". But better than that are the albums cuts that finally get to shine - \"August Day\", \"You Make My Dreams\" (lyrics above), \"Your Imagination\", \"Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid\" and \"Keep On Pushin' Love\" - gems that deserve rediscovery. The unreleased stuff is admittedly not exactly bulging at the seams, but what they've chosen is actually worth inclusion. The \"Have You Ever Been In Love\" demo is superb - while their molecular-level love of Soul Music shines through with their inclusion of classy covers by The O'Jays (\"Me And Mrs. Jones\") and The Mad Lads (\"I Want Someone\"). And the box set's title song \"Do What You Want, Be What You Are\" is given an awesome two thousand and seven live going over that show these white Philly dudes have more soul in their little fingers than most people do in their entire bodies. Pretty impressive stuff. Niggles - fans will immediately notice that two huge favourites \"When The Morning Comes\" and \"Everytime You Go Away\" are represented there by 'live' versions and not their beloved studio originals - but I'd defend the choices. The one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five version of \"When The Morning Comes\" features a rare 'duo-only' live setting and its intimacy is just lovely - while the nine:thirty minutes version of \"Everytime You Go Away\" features a churchy morgan feel and is fabulously fleshed out with Acapella passages that elicit a genuinely thrilled response from the Japanese audience. I can see why they were chosen. The same applies to the beautiful Phillip Mitchell song \"Starting All Over Again\" - Hall has chosen a live version, but the's done so because it somehow has the depth it deserves this way. Omissions - there's a great soulful exclusive on the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine soundtrack to \"Runaway Bride\" called \"And That's What Hurts\" - and it really should be on there (perfect box set material). There's nothing from the \"Marigold Sky\" album (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven) and two thousand and five's covers set \"Our Kind Of Soul\" had three new songs, one of which was the blindingly good \"Don't Turn Your Back On Me\" - again a no-show. There's not enough from the wonderful \"Change Of Season\" album either and of course no solo stuff. Still - and I must stress this - what's on there is the business. Since two thousand and nine Daryl Hall has become something of an Internet hero with this stunning \"Live From Daryl's House\" broadcasts - they feature him and invited musical pals going through Hall & Oates back catalogue with sidesteps into other favourite songs too. It features a band professionally set up in this living room with shitty-chatty clips in between. Check out soulful YouTube clips of \"Pick Up The Pieces\" with Alan Gorrie from the Average White Band, \"Can We Still Be Friends\" with Todd Rundgren, \"Something To Talk About\" (a Bonnie Raitt cover) and \"Black Horse And A Cherry Tree\" with KT Tunstall and \"Cruel To Be Kind\" with Nick Lowe. And prepare yourself to be quietly blown away. To sum up - for most people a simple \"Best Of\" would probably suffice, but I'd surge to dig deeper into your pocket. This Box Set is an impressive body of work - superbly presented, well thought out and beautifully mastered. This 'kiss' from the most successful pop duo of all time (like the best things in life) deserves to be put high on your 'list'. And don't let those Eighties clothing choices put you off either. Honestly - sometimes you just need a shoulder-pad and a big hairdo. Way to go boys.","overall":5,"summary":"\"...When You Pull Them All Together...You Make My Dreams Come True...\"","unixReviewTime":1301788800,"reviewTime":"04 3, 2011"}

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Several years back I was hearing quite a lot of the ship-hop duo Floetry and loved their sound. Actually haven't explored it as much as I've wanted to. Nevertheless Marsha Ambrosious seems to have made quite a name for herself as a songwriter during and after her Floetry experience. Her debut album was apparently inevitable. At the same time I was't informed on any of this somehow. Don't get it. This album has been pushed my way almost everywhere I go. In record stores, online as if it was something I should hear. Kept wondering why this was so important. So today whilst shopping I came across this on the first day of the year, read the CD sticker explaining who this was and decided to give it a stab. Honestly it's very different and very much more than even my most flamboyant expectations. Throughout the modern era the contributions of the British black community to the soul genre haven't gotten quite as much attention as some of the caucasian variety. There have been exceptions for sure. Maysa Leak and N'Dea Davenport being examples. But still this represents something of an unsung cultural chapter in modern soul. And there we have one that might grab at a bit more attention than usual, based primarily on ability. Now to be said there is not going to be much questioning Marsha's voice. This comes out at you with the rangy and husky intonations from the likes of Sarah Vaughn,Anita Baker,Toni Braxton and Lalah Hathaway. Marsha also \"flows\" very well with her voice, shading it with just the right amount of gospel passion for jazzy subtly whenever needed. And that's appropriate considering this is an album possessed of both unity and variety. Anita Baker in't a bad reference to describe this music either as it is heavily yet conservatively produced contemporary jazz\/pop\/soul type music-heavy on the elaborate piano chords and occasional fanfares. What's difference is the very very light influence of the modern day ship-hop\/soul sound in some of the clipped sounding rhythms, beats and the nuanced use of sampling. \"Hope She Cheats On You (With A Basketball Player)\" and \"Far Away\" are the more obvious examples of the ship-hop\/soul influence. Because they don't sound as individual, they are to me the weaker of the songs there. What else is there though more than makes up for it. Three easy highlights are the title song, with it's Prince like use of textural LINN drums and the habanera influenced jazzy samba type styled of the harmonically intricate \"Sour Times\" which, as with most of this album blends the music with her explorative and romantic lyrics, presented with both class and sass. Whole \"With You\",\"Lose Myself\",\"Your Hands\",\"Chasing Clouds\" and \"I Want You To Stay\" maintain that overflowing contemporary jazz\/pop\/soul flavor very well there's also an interpretation of \"Tears\", showcasing her ability with rather more funk balladry. A bonus track of Michael Jackson's \"Butterflies\"-presented in a more upbeat tempo, with sleeker production and Marsha's powerful vocals. I have to say comes pretty close to washing the floor with Mikes. I'll note though I AM NOT knocking MJ! Never would! I would't be into music the way I am today if it were not for him-seriously. But the fact the was't in this best vocal and physical state when this original was recorded only helps bring out how beautifully she does it there. I think Mike would be extremely pleased if the were table to hear it. Overall this album is wonderfully melodic, inspiring, powerful and passionate album I know I won't soon forget. It's the kind of music that has the capacity to bring different generations and classes of people together. There's qualities they'll all like about it. They may be different. But at the same time this album celebrates the unity even musical difference can bring. That's because it's songs are both singular and unified. And Marsha Ambrosius never takes her eyes off of that.","overall":5,"summary":"Soulful Elegance From Across The Pond","unixReviewTime":1325376000,"reviewTime":"01 1, 2012"}

The songs are listed in the Amazon Product Description, so there is no need to repeat that there. However, it should be pointed out that in this \"Super Deluxe Edition\", on the CD you get the following Bonus Songs:\"Roulette\"\"All Over You\"\"Stars\" (featuring Kenny Chesney)\"Ragged Company\" (featuring Willie Nelson). Also, on the DVD, you get a live sixty minute performance of Grace Potter & The Nocturnals,: \"Live From Lollapalooza two thousand and eleven\", in Chicago. In this add, Grace is very sexy, she wears a very short mini dress. During the song \"Medicine\", Grace jumps up & down, you can even see her black panties. WOW, What a Show!!! Also, in her band is a tall & sexy female bass guitar player, who wears a very short mini dress. This is a very powerful & sexy concert. Grace and her band perform some outstanding music. The songs of the DVD are as follows:one. Ah Marytwo. Only Lovethree. Hot Summer Nightfour. Goodbye Kissfive. Apologiessix. Low Roadseven. Stop the Buseight.two:two hundred and twenty-nine. Paris (Ooh La La)ten. Nothing But the Watereleven. Medicine - \"MAMA MIA\", WOW, WHAT A HECK OF A SHOW!!!!!!!! (Grace has the Medicine that everybody wants.)
