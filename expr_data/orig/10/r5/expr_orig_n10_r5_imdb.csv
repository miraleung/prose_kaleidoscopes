22105,"I gave Timecop a perfect ten, I gave this oneIt's story is very boring, and it has only little to do with the original Timecop. Lots of things from Timecop was scrapped, and they put in new stupid stuff instead. This story is taking place in two thousand and sixty (if I remember correctly), but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous :confused:And the action scenes are nothing to be happy about, well most of them karen't. only the first one is great. and there karen't many action scenes at all, and they're all pretty shortAt one point in the story, the main character travels through time about five times within a few minutes. no wait, make that two times. In short: Don't waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it",negative

I won this movie in a contest at college, and it was a waste of money even if it was free. Jack Jones stars as a truly awful singer whose trying to find some murderers for something. At least Friday the Thirteenth never bored me. I'd rather have my fingernails pulled than see this again.",negative
19882,"Pam Grier is the super soul sister of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, appearing in many blaxploitation films that have recently been discovered and appreciated by a new generation. I can safely say that BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA may be the worst Pam Grier movie I've never seen. Grier is Lee and Margaret Markov is Karen; they are two female prisoners who escaped from prison after Karen's revolutionary friends attacked the paddy wagon. Chained to each other, the film becomes THE DEFIANT ONES for women, but has three separate plots: a fat criminal (Filipino sleaze star Vic Diaz) wants Lee dead, a cowboy bounty hunter (the excellent Sid Haig) searches for the two girls; and Karen's revolutionary friends search for her. The film eventually becomes so convoluted and uninvolved with the two women that the title should have been MEN CHASING WOMEN. Grier, an action star, is not given any chance to participate in any of the many (overlong) action scenes. Markov is excellent as Karen and Grier is OK as Lee, but both are eventually forgotten in the many subplots. One interesting scene has the bounty hunter forcing a police officer and this chief to drop their pants so the can shoot the one with the smallest penis (judged by this whore), but is easily forgotten amidst all the mayhem. BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA starts out great as a women-in-prison film complete with lesbian wardens and a shower scene, then completely switches to a chase film. If director Eddie Romero (famous for directing Filipino horror films) had just stuck with the WIP theme, the would have been fine. Instead, BMWM gets real old real fast and the surprise ending just makes the audience wonder why they sat through a ninety-minute film for it to send like this! Another problem: where is the film supposed to be set? While some of the accents are Hispanic and cities have Spanish names (Los Robles, etc.), all the natives are obviously Asian! Hmmm. Recommended only for die-hard Grier fans, who even then will be disappointed.",negative
10060,"Why it's none other than Ator played hilariously bad by Miles O'Keefe. Surprisingly I had the misfortune of sitting through this turkey before Mystery Science Theater three thousand store it to pieces. I highly recommend checking out the MSTthreeK version since it's hilarious and one of their best episodes never. The movie on it's own is basically the kind of typical B-movie crud that Italian film-makers were churning out in the early to mid eighty's. This film was apparently made to cash in on the Conan craze, but it fails miserably on all counts. Keep an eye out for the scenes where Ator fights a giant rubber snake and also manages to make a complete hang-glider during a cutaway.""Thong, fish is ready!""rating: the movie itself-one The MSTthreeK version: ten",negative
49536,Some bad reviews there for this and I understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than most. I thought that this worked in a way because afterwards I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success in't it? I would say there is just the right level of sleaze there to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven. David Hess is only in this briefly so don not get your hopes up to much if you like Last House. Other than that - worth a look.,positive

Good job Sci-Fi keep the comedy movies coming. I never thought movies could get anymore retarded. If they keep it up they will have to rename the sci fie channel the comedy sci of channel for something like that. I cant wait four the next blockbuster movie from sci of. Ill be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a case of beer for a bottle of liquor and Ill be ready to laugh it up again!!!,negative
23,"First of all, let's get a few things straight there: a) I AM an anime fan- always has been as a matter of fact (I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool). of) I DO like several B-Movies because they're hilarious. pc) I like the Godzilla movies- a lot. Moving on, when the movie first comes on, it seems like it's going to be your usual B-movie, down to the crappy FX, but all a sudden- BOOM! the anime comes on! This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill. The animation is VERY bad & cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie I ""vividly"" remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school. & it's the same kids over & over again! The FX are terrible, too; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to live action to animation is unorganized, the dialogue & voices(especially the English dub that I viewed) was horrid & I was begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD/ VHS player; The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & Joel/Mike on MSTthreeK (you pick the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time. Heck, I'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B-Movie night. Because it's stupid, pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time, I'm giving this movie a three/ten, an improvement from the zero.five/ten I was originally going to give it.(According to my grading scale: three/ten means Pretty much both boring & bad. As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become as fun as counting to fifteen.)",negative
24496,"******WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**************So who are these ""Mystery Men?"" Simply put, the Mystery Men are a group of sub-Heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaves this wife and kids at home while the cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with this extraordinary and unique Shovel-fighting style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villains by night, if this from in't keeping him busy with the latest snooping. Mr. Furious works in a junk yard to learn this pay, then takes out this frustration on this friends at night, tossing will-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone to wonder, So What?). Ben Stiller breathes such life into this character, you can't help but love him. These three spend their nights trying to capture that 'moment of glory' they've dreamed about. becoming real Super Heroes. Obviously, it could happen. Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all. a flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on this costume to stop an extra bullet for two. Greg Kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture this fans attention in the twilight of this career. To bring back that 'extra magic' that might win the endorsements again, C. A. frees Casanova Frankenstein, a WAAAAAY over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by Goeffrey Rush. This lunatic genius has created a 'psychofrakulator' to warp Champion City into a reflection of this own insanities. and ends up capturing C. A. within hours of this release from prison. This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with such henchmen as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio are going to need a little help. Recruiting commences, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father; the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who CLAIMS to turn invisible when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE is looking at him; the Spleen (Paul Reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much underused Sphinx (Wes Studi), who is shown to be table to cut guns in half with this mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise. This film really is a across-genre romp. Anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a closing battle. This is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-Burton sets recycled endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up. But at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well. Both at once. While not a necessarily unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflective of D. C. Comic's short-lived Inferior Five work), it is fairly innovative for the big screen. It offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if superheroes were real, so would these guys be real. If the Big Guy with the S were flying around New York City, you'd see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis. Sure, the Shoveller fights pretty well, and the Blue Raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world. But does that make them genuine super-heroes? Only in their minds. This movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. Inevitable, when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics. One-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. Particularly marvellous is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ball/father. Yet, it in't a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter for eternally memorable jokes. It mixes in a dose of drama, of discovery and of romance, but never really ventures fully into any of it. What really makes Mystery Men a good film, in the send, is that it is very engaging. The weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and, for one shining moment, really become super-heroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that greeks of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great romp. Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani comes off as bored and directionless as Mr. Furious' love interest, in spite of having a pivotal role as this conscience. Tom Waits seems somehow confused by this own lines as the mad inventor Dr. Heller, although this opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone. And the villains are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point of which is made in the film). The cinematography is choppy and disjointed (such as happens in the average comic book, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well. Yet, overall, this film is incredible. You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest.eight/ten in my opinion.",positive
10395,"After Watergate, Vietnam and the dark days of the Nixon and Jimmy Carter eras, what the world needed was a good old-fashioned chapter-play hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the America of one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six for the jungles of South America in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures. Unfortunately what it got in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five was Doc Savage, The Man of Bronze. Perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer George Pal's final film is that this often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of Kenneth Robeson's pulp-paperback novels probably had George Lucas and Phil Kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other ""We can do better than that,"" and adding a bullwhip, a battered Fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mix. A big part of the problem is that Doc Savage is in many ways even harder to write for than Superman  explorer, adventurer, philanthropist, a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleach-blonde bulletproof muscle-bound body of a Greek God (or rather the form of TV's Tarzan, Ron Ely, a rather dull Charlton Heston clone there), there's simply nothing the can't do and, more damagingly, nothing that can charm him. The man is the virtual incarnation of Hitler's Aryan ubermensch (no surprise that the DVD is only available in Germany!), albeit with all-American values. And just in case there should never be anything the's overlooked (not that there never is) the has not one but five sidekicks in this entourage, the (less than) Fabulous Five. A chemist, an electrician and even an archaeologist I can accept, and at a stretch I could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer, but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on this adventures? In reality Doc's brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way  even Kryptonite would't put a dent in him - there needed to be someone at risk in the stories, though with the exception of Paul Gleason they're all so horribly badly cast and overplayed (as are most parts in the film) you'd happily kill them all off during the opening titles. The villains fare no better, with Paul Wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as Captain Seas, Scott Walker (no, a different one) delivering one of cinema's worst accents (is it meant to be Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Greek, Pakistani for some nationality no-one has never heard of?) while Robyn Hilton's Marilyn Monroe-ish dumb blonde moll gives Paris (no relation) a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakes. Even with those drawbacks, this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients  lost tribes, a pool of gold, a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive, all wrapped up in a quest to discover why Doc's father was murdered. Unfortunately it's a question of stone: in the sixtys and seventys pulp superheroes were't brooding figures prone to state-of-the-art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low-budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought, the films aimed purely at the matinée market: you know, for kids. There have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight-faced  and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post-production, be it the Colgate twinkle in Doc's eye, the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust-up with Captain Seas for Don Black's young-ho lyrics to John Philip Sousa's patriotic marches  but plenty was in the film to begin with. After all, it's hard to see how one of the villain's underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was never intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat, while Doc's explanation to Pamela Hensley of why the never dates girls could be a scene written for Adam West's Batman. Instead, the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional, such as Doc displaying this sixth sense by, her, bobbing this Adam's apple. Perhaps an even bigger problem is that, while promising on paper, the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion, be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of New York skyscrapers for escaping from a yacht full of bad guys. Even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director Michael Anderson: having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier, Doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on them. Still, aside from Doc's various vehicles all stamped with this logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze, the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously L. A. standing in for New York while Fred Koenekamp's cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget. And it's good to see a superhero movie that does't spend most of its running time on an origin story, though one is left with the suspicion that Doc sprang fully formed from the loins of Zeus himself. It's a film I'd really like to like more, but it just feels like one hundred minutes of lost opportunities. No wonder Doc Savage, The Arch Enemy of Evil, the sequel so optimistically promised in the send credits, never happened.",negative
43261,"You can debate Prince's acting talent, for even this choice to parody this own life in this film. There is no debate about this musical talent either then for now. He seems like a shadowy has-been twenty years later, but the music remains relevant and fantastic. Having lived through the hype of this movie (graduated high school in'eighty-five) I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time. From Tipper Gore (Al's wife) trying to censor ""Little Nikki"" and every thing else under the sun via the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) to every ""Air Band"" at the time impersonating Prince, it was the absolute hottest thing out. For a few weeks at least, Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. We all waited for the film and were soooooo excited when it premiered. It did't disappoint. EVERYONE was caught up. I was an MTV junkie at the time(they actually played music then. all the time)Prince played at least once for twice an hour. I must qualify this commentary by saying that, at that time, my favourites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls and others in the Punk/ New Wave genre' The music of Prince at the time transcended all types and styles. One of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and contrite now is that it was SOOOOOOOO big then. All the things that remind you of the eighty's were iconic then. It was mainstream and it seems like a clické' now. It got so popular that it became ridiculous. It's like the wrapping' Granny commercial for Wendy's Hamburgers. It looks stupid now because EVERYONE was caught up in it (sadly, kind of like a bizarre purple macarena for something. Anyway, I hope this gave you all a little insight.",positive
25819,"It's really unfortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only things that Canada produces are snow, mounties and hockey players. This film is the second superlative Canadian film I have seen within the past few weeks (the first was ""The Red Violin""), far better than all but the best Hollywood efforts. Gustad Noble is anything but that; the is a middle-aged Parsi bank employee in Bombay in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. This film sensitively explores various things that happen to him concerning this family, this friends and this work, and their effect on him. At the same time, it is a fascinating, and, I would assume, accurate, portrayal of middle-class, urban life in India at the time. However, I was somewhat prepared for this, having read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The film, as might be expected, cannot capture all the complexities of the book, but, if you want to read a really good book, and see a really good film, read and see ""Such a Long Journey"".",positive
48863,"I studied Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school, and it left me with a stunning impression. Here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own. Her story, which Bronte told through Jane's own eyes, was both sad and inspiring. As part of your study, we watched the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three adaptation of the story, and it blew me away. The mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to Bronte's original text and the essence of the story, but the factors who portrayed the characters were just great. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, by the name of Rochester) captured brilliantly the essence of their characters. I cannot imagine anyone else in their roles. (The other performances of Rochester in other versions such as the two thousand and six version black the passion, energy, and tenderness needed to portray Rochester accurately. I say that Timothy Dalton comes out on top because the possesses all these characteristics in this portrayal of Rochester. Zelah Clarke not only looks like Jane Eyre, but she captures Jane's quiet, but firm and passionate nature brilliantly. She holds in her emotions, like the Jane of the book, at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in Jane's passionate scenes. The chemistry that Clarke and Dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to Jane and Rochester's devoted relationship.) As well, the supporting factors also fit their roles perfectly, and the sets fit the Gothic nature of the story. I strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte tale. If you have not read the book before, then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story.",positive
43995,"This movie is stupid, made by stupid people. The plot I suppose works well enough for a Horror movie, but the actions these characters take is insanely STUPID! Like, incredibly non-sensical stupid to the Nth degree! Basically the whole movie consists of these four idiots being captured, repeatedly, despite having many, many easy ways and opportunities to overcome their captor. It does not make one click of sense and is not entertaining whatsoever. Stabbing yourself in the eye is more is more rational, and probably more fun than watching this.****SPOILERS**** The ending is hilarious!! The only good part of the movie!

47548,"I rented this one on DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious seeing Michael Madsen appearing in a movie I have never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out. Well my guess is that Mr. Blonde would very much like to forget the's never taken part in such a shame of a film. Apparently, if your script and dialog are terrible, even good factors cannot save the day. Not to mention the amateur factors that flood this film. Too many non-native-English-speakers play parts of native-English-speakers, reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie. It's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound. The music is awful and totally out of place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play. I recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other, better, movies. This is why I gave it a three instead of the one it deserves.",negative
24235,"This film is terrible. Not only is the story unbelievable, the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly, to the point where it in't shocking. I find it sad that Daisy Eagan, star of Broadway's The Secret Garden, decided that this would be a career step. The idea is interesting, two young girls coming of page very quickly. But the sex in't even arousing. The film is silly, the story is silly, the performances are silly, and the whole concept while interesting falls flat. I'm sure all fourteen year old girls make out with guys after they've had their first period and tried to flush their panties down the toilet. Better Luck next time guys.

48295,"What I found so curious about this film--I saw the full four hour roadshow version, is how oddly dispassionate it is. For a film about two very charismatic men--Castro and Che, engaged in a gargantuan political struggle, it's almost totally devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who is at best a second level factor, with a slightly high pitched voice) have no drama for depth and basically come down to Castro telling Che: go there, go there, do this and that, with no explanation as to what effect for use this action will result in. Odder still is there is an factor in the cast who has the requisite power to play Castro--Joaquim de Almeida, but the's shunted aside in a minor part in the second half. Without the tension for passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers, the film becomes a bullish epic-length film about hairy, bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose for send. Several of the reviews I've read showered praise on the work of director Steven Soderbergh while ignoring the factors almost completely. (One in fact spent more time talking about Soderbergh's new digital film camera than the plot for factors for the fact that it's entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.)This is an odd, odd thing to do since a) Soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and of) it's no more than a competent job of work, with an unremarked upon nod to Oliver Stone's JFK in the black and white cut up camera-work when Che visits New York. If you can imagine Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you'd get an idea of the dull competency of this movie.",negative
8686,"Madison is not too bad-if you like simplistic, non-offensive, ""family-friendly"" fare and, more importantly, if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing. If, like me, you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like Musson, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., prepare to be disappointed. Professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports clické in the book. I need't repeat what they've said. What I felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the ""glory years"" (which many would argue were already past in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one). Yes, it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast, though it was clear that the restored versions (hats off to the volunteers at the Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum) were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed. But where was the sound? Much of the thrill of the old hydro was the mind-numbing roar of six Allison for Rolls-Merlin aircraft engines, wound up to RPM's never imagined by their designers, hitting the starting line right in front of you. You did't hear it, you FELT it. Real hydro buffs know exactly what I'm talking about. There's none of that in Madison. Instead, every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a ""heroic"" musical score. And then there are the close-up shots of the drivers, riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines, in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home-town hero. Or, in one particularly ridiculous shot, taking time to spot Jake Lloyd giving a ""Rocky"" salute from a bridge pier. In reality, some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock-hard water at speeds above one hundred and fifty mph. As one reviewer so aptly put it, ""The sport deserves better than this.""Finally, since another user brought up anachronisms, I'll add one: the establishing shot of Seattle shows the Kingdome and Safeco Field. Neither existed in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one",negative
