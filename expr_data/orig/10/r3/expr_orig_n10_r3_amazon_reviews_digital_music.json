I keep reading all of these references to Helmet being the originators of gnu-metal yet, when this album was released, the concept of gnu-metal had not yet even begun to brew inside the mind of some soulless marketing executive, pitching to brandish a newer and more simplistic sound to attract the masses with a short attention span. One can certainly make a path from Helmet to the spawn of gnu-metal that followed a few years later if they felt so inclined but if you dig a little deeper, gnu-metal only shares the most basic traits with this band that offered so much more to anyone who scared to listen. In some ways, it almost seems strange to slap the \"metal\" tag on a band like Helmet. Sure, they wrote this album that is bludgeoningly heavy with songs that would blow your head clean off your body from the outset but beyond that, Helmet shared little with the dyed-in-the-wool metal bands from the early one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. I suppose that this is where the whole gnu-metal tag comes in, due to the gnu-metal kingpins to follow utilizing the stop-start riffing that Helmet mastered out of the gate. However, those comparisons send when you get into these songs. Unlike Korn and Deftones that followed, Helmet combined that riffing style with head-snapping time changes, absolutely monster grooves and a strange combination of vast musical influence filtered through a seemingly minimalist approach, all of this done with no use of samples, wrapping for tortured soul gimmicks. Helmet was strictly about the music. Maybe this is why their flirtation with the mainstream did't last. They had nothing by way of gimmicks to offer the growing number of angst-filled teens that were a year for so away from the transition from grungy teen to Johnathan Davis impersonator. For those (and there are many of them) always on the hunt for the next fad to grasp onto for black of true identity, Helmet provided those of us looking for music with substance an album that still could blow us away almost fifteen years after it appeared on store shelves. \"Meantime\" is precisely that album.","overall":5,"summary":"A Mammoth Album","unixReviewTime":1152662400,"reviewTime":"07 12, 2006"}

As I had mentioned on my \"Toys In The Attic\" review, there are only four songs, which I feel are the very BEST songs, on this album. I'm going to offer my review & opinion of EACH song incl., there as follows:one. \"Jailbait\". This song is pretty good of\/ a real fast beat. It is one of the album's better songs. \"Jailbait\" is my threerd favourite on this album.two. \"Lightning Strikes\". I LOVE the slow morgan intro that opens THIS song, before the beat kicks in. Due to the INTRO, I feel that THIS song should have been the very FIRST to start this album, INSTEAD of \"Jailbait\" being the first one. \"Lightning Strikes\" rec'd some radio airplay in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two & it is the VERY BEST song on this ENTIRE album. I was shocked to discover that Aerosmith DIDN'T write this hit single. I never heard this by anyone else before, either. I also LOVE the morgan ending along of\/ the thunder closing out this song.three. \"Bitch's Brew\". Just like the opening two songs, this is probably my twond favourite that TIES of\/ \"Cheshire Cat\". It's pretty good, I think!four. \"Bolivian Ragamuffin\". This is only a passable song. not too bad!five. \"Cry Me A River\". Another old standby, that I've heard by OTHER artists, too. It in't too bad by Aerosmith, though!six. \"Prelude to Joanie\". This is pretty good, but I can't say the same about the following song.seven. \"Joanie's Butterfly\". I just can't seem to get into THIS song. & unfortunately it is five:thirty-five TOO LONG & drawn out. The TITLE sounded pretty decent, but that's IT. Definitely, one of my LEAST favourites.eight. \"Rock In A Hard Place\" (CHESHIRE CAT). I rate this song as my twond favourite which TIES of\/ \"Bitch's Brew\". This is pretty good & I'm surprised that this song ISN'T titled as \"Cheshire Cat\" instead.nine. \"Jig Is Up\". This Sweet Painted Ladies song is only okay, & it sounds like Aerosmith's one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six single \"Last Child\", in the tempo, somewhat.ten. \"Push Comes To Shove\". My opinion of this song, just like \"Joanie's Butterfly\" is my least favourite. actually this the WORST song incl., there. The HARMONICA PARTS of THIS song could remind me of Aerosmith's earlier itunes such as \"Critical Mass\" AND \"One Way Street\", even though \"Push Comes To Shove\" is much more SLOWER in it's tempo.

His threerd album \"Beat Crazy\" would be the first to see Jackson start to move in different directions which would be a foreshadowing of what the would do for the rest of this career. Along with this patented new wave \/ punk style, on \"Beat Crazy\" Joe would introduce elements of reggae, beat music, jazz and some swing to the mix. Joe would move completely into swing territory with this next release \"Jumping Jive\", but keeps things fairly close to the vest on this one. In fact some of the reggae experimentation was not that far removed from what bands like The Police were doing at the same time. Commercially \"Beat Crazy\" was a bit of a let down for Jackson. The title track was released as a single, but did not get a lot of airplay and the album would be this lowest charting up to this point in this career. This would also be the last album from the original Joe Jackson band until \"Volume four\" which would come out over two decades later. I don't think that this album has aged as well as some of Joe's other jones. Songs like \"Beat Crazy\", \"Battleground\", \"Pretty Boys\", and \"Fit\" all sound very dated. Still there are some really good songs on the album with some great Jackson lyrics. \"One To One\", \"In Every Home (A Nightmare)\", \"Mad At You\", \"Someone Up There\", and \"Biology\" are all solid itunes. Despite the upbeat nature of much of the music, the lyrics are some of Jackson's most dark and cynical.

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Several years back I was hearing quite a lot of the ship-hop duo Floetry and loved their sound. Actually haven't explored it as much as I've wanted to. Nevertheless Marsha Ambrosious seems to have made quite a name for herself as a songwriter during and after her Floetry experience. Her debut album was apparently inevitable. At the same time I was't informed on any of this somehow. Don't get it. This album has been pushed my way almost everywhere I go. In record stores, online as if it was something I should hear. Kept wondering why this was so important. So today whilst shopping I came across this on the first day of the year, read the CD sticker explaining who this was and decided to give it a stab. Honestly it's very different and very much more than even my most flamboyant expectations. Throughout the modern era the contributions of the British black community to the soul genre haven't gotten quite as much attention as some of the caucasian variety. There have been exceptions for sure. Maysa Leak and N'Dea Davenport being examples. But still this represents something of an unsung cultural chapter in modern soul. And there we have one that might grab at a bit more attention than usual, based primarily on ability. Now to be said there is not going to be much questioning Marsha's voice. This comes out at you with the rangy and husky intonations from the likes of Sarah Vaughn,Anita Baker,Toni Braxton and Lalah Hathaway. Marsha also \"flows\" very well with her voice, shading it with just the right amount of gospel passion for jazzy subtly whenever needed. And that's appropriate considering this is an album possessed of both unity and variety. Anita Baker in't a bad reference to describe this music either as it is heavily yet conservatively produced contemporary jazz\/pop\/soul type music-heavy on the elaborate piano chords and occasional fanfares. What's difference is the very very light influence of the modern day ship-hop\/soul sound in some of the clipped sounding rhythms, beats and the nuanced use of sampling. \"Hope She Cheats On You (With A Basketball Player)\" and \"Far Away\" are the more obvious examples of the ship-hop\/soul influence. Because they don't sound as individual, they are to me the weaker of the songs there. What else is there though more than makes up for it. Three easy highlights are the title song, with it's Prince like use of textural LINN drums and the habanera influenced jazzy samba type styled of the harmonically intricate \"Sour Times\" which, as with most of this album blends the music with her explorative and romantic lyrics, presented with both class and sass. Whole \"With You\",\"Lose Myself\",\"Your Hands\",\"Chasing Clouds\" and \"I Want You To Stay\" maintain that overflowing contemporary jazz\/pop\/soul flavor very well there's also an interpretation of \"Tears\", showcasing her ability with rather more funk balladry. A bonus track of Michael Jackson's \"Butterflies\"-presented in a more upbeat tempo, with sleeker production and Marsha's powerful vocals. I have to say comes pretty close to washing the floor with Mikes. I'll note though I AM NOT knocking MJ! Never would! I would't be into music the way I am today if it were not for him-seriously. But the fact the was't in this best vocal and physical state when this original was recorded only helps bring out how beautifully she does it there. I think Mike would be extremely pleased if the were table to hear it. Overall this album is wonderfully melodic, inspiring, powerful and passionate album I know I won't soon forget. It's the kind of music that has the capacity to bring different generations and classes of people together. There's qualities they'll all like about it. They may be different. But at the same time this album celebrates the unity even musical difference can bring. That's because it's songs are both singular and unified. And Marsha Ambrosius never takes her eyes off of that.","overall":5,"summary":"Soulful Elegance From Across The Pond","unixReviewTime":1325376000,"reviewTime":"01 1, 2012"}

Upon my first listen to it I was amazed and enthralled by it's high octane and infectious energy. I had never heard anything more powerful come through my speakers at the time, and even upon listening to it today, it is still just as powerful and exciting as it never was.

I've read some other reviewers complaints concerning the cheesy lyrics on some of the songs and all I can say about that is, well, that's all part of the fun of it all. Judas Priest's prior album to this one, Screaming for Vengeance, is a definite masterpiece recording, and Defenders of the Faith continues in that tradition and then some by delivering even more addictive power metal songs and anthems than seems humanly possible. Just sit back and pop this disk in your player and feel the music pummel you into a pulsating pulp with awesome tracks like Freewheel Burning, Jawbreaker, The Sentinel, Some Heads Are Gonna Roll, and Heavy Duty. By this time in their careers, the mighty team of Glen Tipton, K. K. Downing, Ian Hill, Dave Holland, and Rob Halford, were like a well-oiled precision Metallion music machine and were really at a creative high point during the mid Eighties, and it definitely shows on this album. But to be honest, Judas Priest have hit many high points throughout their career and continue to do some very excellent and amazing music to this very day.

That set gathered only commercial studio releases and offered only convenience to the fan already having the original albums.\"Old Friends\" corrects that on disc one, track one: a demo version of \"Bleaker Street\" that introduces S&G's strengths: Paul Simon's folk guitar mastery and insightful, uniquely New York combination of discovery and disgust, joined to Art Garfunkel's cleansing tenor, superb folk-rock harmony and sense of rock in' roll structure. Subsequent songs build from that discovery, supplemented by sound clarity missing from the original releases. You hear the original and \"remix\" of \"Sounds of Silence,\" and the original holds more power in this context. The group's familiar hits are there (all in studio versions, unlike one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two's \"Greatest Hits\" set) with live tracks displaying S&G's informal performing style and constant acknowledgement of its influence. (Here, they cover the Everlys' \"Bye Bye Love,\" Gene Autry's \"Silver Haired Daddy,\" and their own \"Hey Schoolgirl,\" first recorded as Tom & Jerry. Interestingly, no live tracks are from their Monterey Pop appearance.)You see simple, striking folk covers and Simon originals from \"Wednesday Morning threeAM\" progress to the \"Abbey Road\" ornateness and power of \"The Boxer\" and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\" Like the Beatles, S&G began simply, slowed and grew the recording process to create something brief but lasting, then saw personal and professional friendships fracture under the weight. \"Old Friends\" introduces that process to new fans and completes the story for longtime followers.

Everyone from Alicia Keys to Jennifer Lopez has been influenced by Mary J's style. Perhaps The Breakthrough, her seventh album and a Billboard chart-topper, will contain a single that can see her elevated to the level of Beyonce. With guests such as Will. I. Am, Jay-Z and Utwo, there's no doubting Mary J Blige has brought out the big guns for her latest album. Rather than the flippant tomfoolery the's lately shown on Black Eyed Peas' My Humps, Will. I. Am instead takes a sample of Nina Simone's Feeling Good for this Mary J Blige collaboration About You. Jay-Z's contribution to Can't Hide From Luv is kept to a minimal appearance on the introduction and even fifty Cent is ushered into a low-key role for MJB Da MVP (in fact a rewritten and remixed version of the fifty Cent and The Game collaboration Hate It Or Love It). Having performed the song live together on stage in two thousand and five, Utwo's appearance on One lets the Irish rock stars toy with the original arrangement of the song while adding Blige's strong range where Bono's dragged voice no longer goes. The funky bass and synthesizers of Baggage are reminiscent of past Mary J Blige glories, Take Me As I Am is an autobiography of hardship and Good Woman Down once again finds the gifted soul singer penning tough anti-violence lyrics. An affirmation of her strengths, The Breakthrough proves Blige is still an R&B; heavyweight. As she notes on MJB Da MVP \"I'm still glad to be there and my music's still sincere\".

This live CD showcases songs from her four previous albums ( three from LITTLE EARTHQUAKES, five from UNDER THE PINK, and one each from BOYS FOR PELE and FROM THE CHOIRGIRL HOTEL-please see my reviews of these four albums-) plus three B-side gems. But don`t expect this to be a greatest hits selection. Only two songs (CORNFLAKE GIRL AND CRUEL) were singles. Her best singles have unfortunately been vomited. Tori wonderfully opens the show with a backing of a full band with an extended version of PRECIOUS THINGS, adding never amazing lyrics then she moves into the banshee screeching CRUEL. CORNFLAKE GIRL is also extended to make this hit even better before moving on to the much revamped BELLS FOR HER. This lifeless song from UNDER THE PINK was given a wonderful uplift. Another excellent and extended track is THE WAITRESS. But the other songs, GIRL, MR. ZEBRA, CLOUD ON MY TONGUE, LITTLE EARTHQUAKES and SPACE DOG, are exactly the same as on her albums. Tori`s singing is strong and her piano playing perfect and prominent. Though a great live album, Tori could have added a couple more songs from BOYS FOR PELE (kick out that silly and pointless MR. ZEBRA), and some from FROM THE CHOIRGIRL HOTEL. Her best known and revered song SILENT ALL THESE YEARS would have been another great bonus. The next CD of new material shows the new Tori Amos again. Here she keeps in the same vein as from FROM THE CHOIRGIRL HOTEL, using synthesizers, drum loops and of course her piano. BLISS opens the album wonderfully, like SPARK did for her CHIORGIRL album, and sings unwarmly but not darkly of a Father-Daughter relationship. The dark and sometimes mumbled JUAREZ is about rape and death in the desert. Supposedly based on a true story she had read about. Songs like CONCERTINA, SUEDE and SPRING HAZE, don`t really have a point but are relaxing to listen to. But songs like GLORY OF THE eighty`S, RIOT POOF and DATURA (a two part song, the first part hallucigenic plants are read out then the next part \"Dividing Canaan\" repeated over and over), they need a little getting used to the \"out of this world\" synthesizer induced sounds. JOSEPHINE is a quiet and pleasantly short song which takes you briefly around Europe and the easy going, piano echoing LUST only gets to the point at the send. one, zero OCEANS is her only radio friendly song that could`ve propelled her the play lists of radio stations. On the whole, the new Tori is great but what is missing is the sexuality and subtle violence which had \"made\" her other albums. I feel Tori Amos is finally mellowing.","overall":4,"summary":"The Old and New Tori","unixReviewTime":996969600,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2001"}

This album however came from a much more personal place. Prior to recording Choirgirl, she suffered three miscarriages and a subsequent period of depression. The album documents the journey of the character and her effort to feel alive again. And it is an effort that is every bit as heart-wrenching, haunted and desperate as can be. Using the concept of a hotel, each song being a character who lives in it, Tori Amos creates a mosaic of astonishing insight and depth. The album is inspiring. Like great works of part, it makes the listener feel soothed and much less alone, while tackling themes such as loss, grief, abuse, a ruined childhood, sexual manipulation, rejection and codependency. Sonically, it incorporates many elements of electronic music and the band has much more of a role to play on this album compared to her previous, piano based works. Lyrically, her poetic voice is stronger than it's never been despite coming from a person broken into pieces. I cannot grave highly enough about this album.

Nevertheless, Ghost hardly never disappoints and the truth is that this album is hot, probably not Ironman hot, but Supreme Clientele\/Pretty Toney hot. RZA main't on the boards this time (he only shows up to wrap on the Wu-Tang posse cut \"nine Milli Bros.\") but there are other producers who still bring out the raw in Ghost like MF Doom, Just Blaze and especially Pete Rock. Pete places Ghost with the simplistic but dope \"Be Easy\" and the posse cut \"Dogs of War\". For the latter, the way Pete flips that \"Family Affair\" sample is bananas. For this album, 'Face surprisingly craps in a way that's easy to understand (not many over-the-head rhymes this time), possibly in an attempt to draw in new fans. Raekwon also shows up a few times on tracks like \"Kilo\" and \"R. A. G. U.\" and Ghost's crew, Theodore Unit, in't far behind. Trife and Cappadonna are in that group and Trife provides a dope chorus on \"Clipse of Doom\" while Cappa has't sounded this inspired since \"Winter Warz\" (which is a LONG time ago). As usual, though, there's one track that ruins the party. No, not the Ne-Yo featured \"Back Like That\", I'm okay with that now.

The unreleased stuff is admittedly not exactly bulging at the seams, but what they've chosen is actually worth inclusion. The \"Have You Ever Been In Love\" demo is superb - while their molecular-level love of Soul Music shines through with their inclusion of classy covers by The O'Jays (\"Me And Mrs. Jones\") and The Mad Lads (\"I Want Someone\"). And the box set's title song \"Do What You Want, Be What You Are\" is given an awesome two thousand and seven live going over that show these white Philly dudes have more soul in their little fingers than most people do in their entire bodies. Pretty impressive stuff. Niggles - fans will immediately notice that two huge favourites \"When The Morning Comes\" and \"Everytime You Go Away\" are represented there by 'live' versions and not their beloved studio originals - but I'd defend the choices. The one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five version of \"When The Morning Comes\" features a rare 'duo-only' live setting and its intimacy is just lovely - while the nine:thirty minutes version of \"Everytime You Go Away\" features a churchy morgan feel and is fabulously fleshed out with Acapella passages that elicit a genuinely thrilled response from the Japanese audience. I can see why they were chosen. The same applies to the beautiful Phillip Mitchell song \"Starting All Over Again\" - Hall has chosen a live version, but the's done so because it somehow has the depth it deserves this way. Omissions - there's a great soulful exclusive on the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine soundtrack to \"Runaway Bride\" called \"And That's What Hurts\" - and it really should be on there (perfect box set material). There's nothing from the \"Marigold Sky\" album (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven) and two thousand and five's covers set \"Our Kind Of Soul\" had three new songs, one of which was the blindingly good \"Don't Turn Your Back On Me\" - again a no-show. There's not enough from the wonderful \"Change Of Season\" album either and of course no solo stuff. Still - and I must stress this - what's on there is the business. Since two thousand and nine Daryl Hall has become something of an Internet hero with this stunning \"Live From Daryl's House\" broadcasts - they feature him and invited musical pals going through Hall & Oates back catalogue with sidesteps into other favourite songs too. It features a band professionally set up in this living room with shitty-chatty clips in between. Check out soulful YouTube clips of \"Pick Up The Pieces\" with Alan Gorrie from the Average White Band, \"Can We Still Be Friends\" with Todd Rundgren, \"Something To Talk About\" (a Bonnie Raitt cover) and \"Black Horse And A Cherry Tree\" with KT Tunstall and \"Cruel To Be Kind\" with Nick Lowe. And prepare yourself to be quietly blown away. To sum up - for most people a simple \"Best Of\" would probably suffice, but I'd surge to dig deeper into your pocket. This Box Set is an impressive body of work - superbly presented, well thought out and beautifully mastered. This 'kiss' from the most successful pop duo of all time (like the best things in life) deserves to be put high on your 'list'. And don't let those Eighties clothing choices put you off either. Honestly - sometimes you just need a shoulder-pad and a big hairdo. Way to go boys.","overall":5,"summary":"\"...When You Pull Them All Together...You Make My Dreams Come True...\"","unixReviewTime":1301788800,"reviewTime":"04 3, 2011"}

There are some great itunes, a few good jones, and a couple boring jones, resulting in an overall worthwhile effort. The kickoff single, \"Amazing,\" is an unpretentious, guitar favored pop single that deserved its Top Ten status in Britain. \"Flawless (Go to the City)\" is a flamboyant, six-minute disco stopper that has the word \"hit\" all over it, and \"American Angel\" is a touching love song about this Texas boyfriend. Every George Michael CD has at least one tearjerker of a ballad, and on this CD, that song is definitely \"My Mother Had a Brother,\" which addresses the suicide of this uncle. If this track does't make you misty in the eyes, you better make sure you still have a pulse. And, of course, there are the already-released singles \"Freeek!\" (about getting your freak online) and \"Shoot the Dog\" (a candid antiwar diatribe against George W. Bush and Tony Blair). But at seventy minutes, it seems a bit weighed down by filler tracks like \"Cars and Trains\" and \"Round Here.\" It's a shame that George's career in America is all but forgotten because this CD deserves to be as much a hit on these shores as the UK, where it already went to Number One. It's not perfect, but make no mistake: this \"Patience\" is a virtue.","overall":4,"summary":"Patience is a Virtue.","unixReviewTime":1080691200,"reviewTime":"03 31, 2004"}

What grabbed me was the plain wit of \"Without Me'. I'll say frankly it is not for everyone. I disagree with some of what the says, and sometimes the way the says it. However, Em has the skills as a songwriter and plays down some solid vocal tracks. His singing-rap style is infectious. I like it. Rather than screaming out words in old patterned rhymes, the brings a new voice and rhythm to lyrics. He has more to say than thug music, and seems to be moving forward with this ideas. Maybe Eminem is on this way to becoming one of the jones who will last, and maybe this songs will be good enough to be covered by later artists. Or, will this itunes be the jones sampled, like the picks up on a Aerosmith song. I can see the potential. I recommend checking out \"The Eminem Show.\"Anthony Trendl","overall":5,"summary":"Impressed","unixReviewTime":1023408000,"reviewTime":"06 7, 2002"}
{"orig_index":30661,"reviewerID":"A35XUI9HGMAJEX","asin":"B00002ZZJF","reviewerName":"Carlisle Wheeling","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"I purchased this album on vinyl when I had grown tired of listening to Prince and all this protege's, on the hunt for something new. Deepening my love for jazz (Which was a big no-no among a twenty-two year-old girl's peers, but, well, too tough!) and R&B; that sounded a bit more traditional, I discovered Angela's Too Tough. Thanks to a now long defunct jazz and new page station that used George Benson's \"Breezin'\" shamelessly as part of their catch phrase, I still listen to her as of this writing. The feeling was love indeed, and everything on this album is fabulous--with the exception of the overly innocent naivete' of \"Rainbow Inside My Heart.\" Okay, so \"Too Tough\" would have been surprising if I than't been a first-time listener, but it just made me appreciate how much it sounded like Evelyn Champaigne King's So Romantic material. A decent pairing with Boz Scaggs on \"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\" shows a change in direction immediately after. The true gems on there, as always, are the ballads. \"Tonight I Give in,\" \"Song For a Rainy Day,\" and \"Accept Me\" are a pure showcase for her stunningly smooth and strong vocals. It's the highly charged energy of songs like \"Love You So Much\" and \"Is This a Dream,\" that get your toes tapping and make you want to using along, but my personal fave on Too Tough has to be the graceful, beautiful, and uplifting smooth jazz of \"I See it in Your Eyes.\"Who said this was a trendy album for the time? Just because of of the title track? Bah, humbug! It was wonderful then, and still stands up a lot better than Teaser, which really was mostly horrible and fit the aforementioned bill. I paid a pretty penny for this as an import, but I knew it would be worth it. If you purchase it, you will find a huge return on your investment the moment you put it in your player.","overall":5,"summary":"Absitively, Posolutely a Must-Have for Lovers of Great Soul and Jazz.","unixReviewTime":1299801600,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2011"}
