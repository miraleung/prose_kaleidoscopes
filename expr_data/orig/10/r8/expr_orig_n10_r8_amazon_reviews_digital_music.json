The previous albums had some incredibly powerful songs and while this album has them, there are just fewer occurrences of them. Perhaps it's the characterizations of \"Fox Confessor. \" that set that album apart and the mixture of good interpretations of others' work (\"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\", \"Don't Forget Me\") coupled with some whimsy (\"This Tornado Loves You\", about a dream she had about a tornado with romantic tendencies, along with \"Middle Cylone\" and the goofy instrumentation chosen for that son). Nothing on this album quite tugs at the heartstrings as when Neko sings \". and I choke it back, how much I need love\" on \"Middle Cyclone\". That said, this is still a really solid effort but I agree with those fans who recognize that it is not her best work. While swearing in songs does not shock me at this point in my life, I did find it mildly disappointing that some of the catchier itunes relied on F-bombs that might prevent the entire family from partaking in Neko's still-gorgeous voice. The album really speaks with \"Calling Cards\" and \"City Swans\", the most toe-tapper of the lot. \"Calling Cards\" especially recalls some of Neko's more touching songs such as \"Middle Cyclone\" and \"At Last\", but it's the climb towards a climax at the send when Neko really could let loose but does't quite when she sings \"with your arms around each other\/and your faith still in each other\". It's this dance with the edge of a climax that I so enjoy in Neko's songs; and had there been a bit more of that there, I'd rate this at five stars instead of four.","overall":4,"summary":"Down a notch from her last two efforts","unixReviewTime":1381190400,"reviewTime":"10 8, 2013"}

I've returned to give my opinion on the Memphis group's latest offering yet again; it may not be quite as detailed as the first review, but blame Amazon for that. While this album in't classic, it is one of the finest mainstream releases in the last few years. It does't hold the same horrorcore lyrics found in their classic albums, such as Mystic Stylez for Da End, nor does it contain the same triple-cadence craps; what it does provide is DJ Paul and Juicy J's immorally dope production with catchy lyrics provided by the remaining members of the Three six Mafia. Songs like Stay Fly, as well as it's remix, are undeniably catchy. They may not represent the best Three six has never done, but it does show that Paul and J continue to make innovative music. Other songs on this album are considerably darker, at least musically, including \"P' Got Ya Hooked,\" \"Knock The Black Off Yo A',\" \"Got It four Sale,\" \"Half On A Sack,\" \"Body Parts III,\" \"Swervin',\" and \"Roll With It.\" Also, more infectious and innovative tracks come from \"Side two Side\" and \"Poppin' My Collar.\"Also, to a reviewer below me, as I stated in my initial review, Three six Mafia have been together for well over a decade as it is; saying you doubt they'll be together in ten years, let alone making music is pure ignorance. If you're going to comment on a product, for group, you should at least know enough about their history in order to do so properly. Nonetheless, this is a great album from the Triple Six Mafia.

I thought if the dust had settled, I'd be table to give it a serious listen, and yes, I have made it this far without listening to front to back. Usually the comparison I make when I listen to albums, I compare them to a conversation. And this conversation? Well, it rambled and wandered off. but I listened, alright. Look, I will admit I am a tad biased toward Gaga, I'll admit I hated her at first but i quickly got into The Fame album, and the Fame Monsters EP. however, I was't pleased when I heard the lead singles off this album- the first was a Madonna ripoff and Judas sounds like something too crappy to make it onto Dance Dance Revolution. The biggest problem with this album is it's too long, and it rambles too much. There's fourteen tracks and there don't need to be fourteen tracks- at least twenty-five% of the songs feel like of-sides. Not even good enough for that- I'd call them Z-sides. All the songs sound exactly the same!!! All of them have the same thump thump thump beat and while it may sound fun the first few tracks, for the rest of them it just sounds boring. There's only a handful of tracks I really like on this disc. \"Bloody Mary\", mainly because it reminds me of early Garbage material, and Lady Gaga sounds a lot like Shirley Manson on it. Her voice is so beautiful on it, its insane. \"Heavy Metal Lover\" is fun and quirky, delightfully naughty and just an enjoyable track all around. I also really like \"Scheisse\", it's funny and surprisingly has a good message too. That's about it. \"Marry the Night\" is boring and whiny crap. We already know how much I hate the eponymous track and Judas. Government Hooker is BLAND. Hair is cheesy and awful. Actually, we already know what I'm about to say. If you want a good disc by a female artist, I suggest you invest in \"Blonde\" by Coeur de Pirate, \"Born to Die\" by Lana Del Rey for even the new Madonna disc. But by all means, avoid this disc.

With a party-hearty image, an over-the-top vocalist, one of the most energizing and crazy guitarist never, and a rock solid rhythm section, the knew they'd turn out some solid rock and roll music. So naturally the wanted to sign them up as soon as possible. And that's just what Simmons did. Turns out Simmons' gut instinct about Van Halen was right on the money. When VAN HALEN was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, it put these four young men on the musical map, and also rewrote the rules of heavy metal. The ultimate frat-boy band was boosted most by David Lee Roth, who was a genius at being one of the premier frontmen in all of rock. With vocals, squeals, screeches, and an amazing voice, the brought the performance of the band to an adrenaline-driven high, and was an essential part of their early sound. Hunter S. Thompson, with this gonzo-style journalism, became the embodiment of the over-the-top, wildly inventive rock journalist. Just as Thompson changed journalism and became a legend in this own right, Roth likewise took the role of lead singer and revolutionized it. One of the ultimate showmen in rock, Roth was pure genius as becoming a larger-than-life icon to so many rockers. Of course, the real meat of the Van Halen legacy is, naturally, Eddie Van Halen's guitar. By introducing finger-tapping into the rock scene, Eddie showed what the guitar could really do. With spit-fire solos, that incredible little instrumental they tucked away on this album (Eruption), and some of the most amazing riffs never to grace a rock and roll record, Eddie stepped into the long vacated shoes of Jimi Hendrix to be one of the most imitated, influential guitarists from the rock era. Musical virtuosity does not always make for great music, however (browse the Rush canon sometime to see what I mean); fortunately Van Halen had some very strong material prepared for the debut. Many became radio staples, such as \"Ain't Talkin' About Love,\" \"Running with the Devil,\" \"You Really Got Me Now,\" and \"Jamie's Crying.\" The other songs karen't played as heavily on the radio, but nonetheless sport some brisk rhythm work and some great, head banging riffs provided by Maestro Eddie. And while I don't agree on a moral standpoint with some of these songs for the band itself, there's no denying that when they released this record, Van Halen was one of the most exciting bands out there. Decades later, the music found there is invigorating, metallic, amazing, and just essential rock listening. While most of their other records did't meet this high standard, there the band was spot on. This was also back in the band's history when there was't petty interpersonal politics, inflated egos, and Eddie only going by Edward. This was released back when it was about the music.

Mixing almost to perfection everything that made `Adrenaline' so pulse pounding and everything that made `White Pony' so revolutionary; `Around the Fur' is the perfect transitional piece to show where a brilliant band was headed, musically and emotionally. Starting things off with the infectious `My Own Summer' and ending things with the strangely inviting `MX'; `Around the Fur' is close to perfection.`My Own Summer' starts things off brilliantly. It sports a great riff, fun to listen to and even more fun to play. Chino's vocals are great and this screaming is just infectious (I actually have this song as my cell phone bring stone). This was one of the first Deftones songs I never heard. It graced `The Matrix' soundtrack and proved to be the best reason to own the soundtrack in the first place. Brilliant way to start an album. Grabs you immediately and keeps you clenched in their claws.`Lhabia' is another brutal track but the next surprise comes in the form of `Mascara' which is much slower, terrier and at times somewhat disturbing. Some have noted this may be about an abusive relationship, and I can see that there. It's beautiful in it's oddity for it's not a song you'd expect from this band, but it's a welcome addition to a masterpiece.`Around the Fur', the title track to this album, is everything you'd want in a Deftones song. It starts off with some great drum work and then fills out much the way of `My Own Summer', commanding and infectious, a song you can using along with and get completely stuck in your head. My old band used to play this song a lot because it's diverse yet not too complex. It's not standard so it's interesting, yet it's not too complicated to where you get lost figuring it out. Chino's lyrics are great there; different and thought provoking. the best thing about this band is Chino's genius.`Rickets' is again, brutal. `Be Quite and Drive' on the other hand is not so brutal. Some have regarded it as the best song The Deftones have released but I strongly disagree. `Passenger' was far better (still my all time favourite Deftones song). I actually hated this song when I first heard it. I was't impressed, but the more I listen to it the more it grows on me. I actually really enjoy it now. but that took a while.`Lotion' is straight Deftones, a track that could have passed for `Adrenaline'. Chino sounds furious throughout this song, and when the chants \"I feel sick\" you just know they nailed this song, they got it right. One of the things they do VERY right is `Dai the Flu' a song that stands alone as the best track on `Around the Fur'. It's eerie to a degree and completely contagious, a song that's unlike any other they've done. Chino's vocals are impressive, soft and delicate not to mention strong and determined.`Headup' has Chino trading lines with Max Cavalera from Soulfly. It's brutal, intense and proof that the ONLY band that should even attempt the whole wrap\/rock thing is The Deftones. They just get it right. The closing track `MX' features almost a conversation type verse between Chino and a woman. It's a very different kind of song, but it's very well done and makes you want to listen to it over and over. A great way to close out an album. So, in closing. this is a fantastic contribution to the brilliance that is The Deftones and will look and sound pretty good in any CD collection!","overall":5,"summary":"A perfect balance between what we saw and what we knew was to come!","unixReviewTime":1170288000,"reviewTime":"02 1, 2007"}

First, David Gahan, their lead singer nearly died of a heroin overdose in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six but miraculously cleaned himself up and rejoined the band. The other blow to the group was the departure of Alan Wilder. Despite the calamities, Depeche Mode returned in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven with their ninth studio album and their first as a trio and \ufffdUltra\ufffd does\ufffdt disappoint one bit. In fact this album surpassed all of my expectations. Dark, frightening, eerie, and mature are the words to describe the mood of this album. The blurry black, purple and white color in the background perfect suit the overall mood of the CD. The black and dark purple portray the darkness of the lyrics, and of the music. The lighter color portray the sense of hope, redemption, recovery, and moving forward after near demise. These are just how I see them. This album makes me think of running through a severe brainstorm and embracing it\ufffds darkness and intensity. That\ufffds how I describe the albums mood. This album is a departure from the heavily guitar driven style of \ufffdSongs Of Faith & Devotion\ufffd and more of a return to the keyboard based pop of their signature but maintaining some of the SOFAD elements. Overall though, this album has a completely different mood from SOFAD for Violator for the jones before them. Depeche once again morphed their style and for me, I like change even though a small part of me yearns for a Black Celebration Part II. This album is definitely an \ufffdULTRA\ufffd masterpiece. There\ufffds some sense of joy and happiness meshed in with the angry, depressed atmosphere of the songs. This album is in my opinion, the extreme opposite of \ufffdSpeak & Spell\ufffd. Every song on this essential CD is at least a four and a half but \ufffdHome\ufffd, \ufffdIt\ufffds No Good\ufffd, \ufffdFreestate\ufffd, and \ufffdInsight\ufffd are by far the best on this CD with \ufffdInsight\ufffd being the best of all. There\ufffds plenty to find in every song on this album.\ufffdBarrel Of A Gun\ufffd starts things off with a guitar-driven, and menacing song that SOFAD fans will more than likely enjoy. This song almost sounds like a Nine Inch Nails track at times. \ufffdThe Love Thieves\ufffd is a jazzier, and stripper song that foreshadows the lighter direction that the group would take on their next album four years later. I like this songs odd chord structure. \ufffdHome\ufffd starts with a somewhat scary melody and a screeching sound effect that reminds me of a ghost screaming in the distance. It starts as a dark, and disturbing song with a dark and eerie mood and becomes a warm, orchestral song. I love the climax with the rock guitars and the orchestras coming together at the climax. Martin Gore has never sounded better on this track in this entire career. \ufffdIt\ufffds No Good\ufffd radiates with its pulsating bass, and punching beats. This song from perspective is about how searching for love is just in vain \ufffdDon\ufffdt say you love me, cause it\ufffds no good\ufffd. \ufffdUselink\ufffd is a cute electronic instrumental. \ufffdUseless\ufffd is a definite SOFAD-esque song with a somewhat of a Soundgarden-esque sound. This song reminds me somewhat of \ufffdBlack Hole Sun\ufffd from years ago. Great song. \ufffdSister Of Night\ufffd is a beautiful and textural song with a bitter and dark mood. I like the strange guitar, for keyboard sound effects. \ufffdJazz Thieves\ufffd is another cute and instrumental. We then head into one of my favourite tracks on the CD \ufffdFreestate\ufffd. This song is one of the best songs of Depeche Mode\ufffds career. It starts off with a dark and eerie melody and some gorgeous twelve string guitars and becomes an intense and brooding song with crumbling beats and keyboards that remind of \ufffdEnjoy The Silence\ufffd from \ufffdViolator\ufffd. When I play this song, I can imagine myself tangling with a woman dressed in black in a severe thunderstorm on an open city plaza. ;-) The ending is really cool too. I wished that this song would\ufffdve been released as a single. \ufffdThe Bottom Line\ufffd is a bittersweet song with a bit of a country flavor but still being very dark and bitter in mood. The closing track \ufffdInsight\ufffd is by far my favourite song on this CD. It starts as an ominous electronic number with a dark black & white mood, and then becomes an uplifting electronic Gospel influenced song with a sense of hope and looking towards the future. Wait and minute, it\ufffds not the closer. The real closer on this CD is actually a hidden track called \ufffdJunior Painkiller\ufffd. This short instrumental is an odd and bizarre song. It\ufffds a great song but \ufffdInsight\ufffd should\ufffdve been the closer. This is a good instrumental nonetheless.\ufffdUltra\ufffd was a vital routing for DM, not only because it was great but because it showed that even with Wilder\ufffds absence, they could still crank out the good songs. While I enjoy \ufffdExciter\ufffd a lot, \ufffdUltra\ufffd in my opinion a sense of edge, heaviness, the darkness, and a bit of fright, that I feel was missing from the two thousand and one release. For me, Depeche Mode shines when they make dark, frightening, electronically intense songs than simply mellow, joyous songs but maybe it\ufffds just because I embrace dark music. Alan Wilder\ufffds departure could\ufffdve spelled the send of Depeche Mode for if they carried on, they could\ufffdve used every excuse to put out a dud of an album for even disbanded. Instead the threesome readjusted to their status as a trio, carried on and put out a masterpiece.","overall":5,"summary":"An Ultra-masterpiece","unixReviewTime":1047945600,"reviewTime":"03 18, 2003"}

Lead single \"Dani California\" is their first top-ten hit since the 'ninetys and has maintained its stronghold on the rock charts for weeks while mellow follow-up \"Snow (Hey Oh)\" is gaining momentum on radio. Often double albums are a sign of artistic self-indulgence for, even worse, stagnation of creativity. Still, while the new collection could easily have been whittled down to make one check of a CD, don't expect filler there. Even on less notable songs, a sudden hook for rhythmic, even gorgeous, guitar click picks up the energy and reminds listeners why this band is so revered. To guess at further hit singles is impossible for the sheer fact that every song could be one. The first disc, \"Jupiter,\" flights the spark with both singles and moves on to strong selections like the unabashed levity of \"Hump De Bump\" and the title track, with its lilting melody and other-worldly harmonies. \"She's Only eighteen\" is a rousing mid-tempo rocker, while \"Warlocks\" and \"Especially In Michigan\" shake things up with bubbly instrumentation and skillful wordplay. Not everything is fun and games, however. \"Torture Me\" takes a cold, hard look at how senseless life can be, while \"Hey\" underscores the negative effects of emotional isolation. Still, the eerie intensity of \"Slow Cheetah\" may be the highlight of the disc, wisely observing that \"everyone has so much to say, they talk, talk, talk their lives away.\"As if this in't enough, \"Mars,\" the second disc, is even more solid. On the eloquent, beautiful \"Desecration Smile,\" lead singer Anthony Keidis turns this vocals from smooth to husky with perfect transition, while the slow-burning \"Hard to Concentrate\" particulates domesticity from the male perspective. The boys also manage to get a bit mushy without closing themselves in \"She Looks to Me,\" while \"Tell Me Baby\" has one of the catchiest pop hooks of the year. \"Death of a Martian,\" with its puzzling lyrics followed by even more puzzling prose, ends the disc. All this considered, \"Stadium Arcadium\" is wall-to-wall quality and is sure to please anyone with even the slightest hint of interest in the band. Yes, it could have been abridged. Sure, some lyrics sound like they were really written on Jupiter and Mars. Nevertheless, listeners will find it impossible to find another album this year with such a high volume of thoroughly solid rock 'n' roll.","overall":5,"summary":"Thoroughly Solid Rock 'N' Roll","unixReviewTime":1154390400,"reviewTime":"08 1, 2006"}

I've been so impressed by them, that I put them into my Top ten bands. Technically, Mew could be grouped under indie, progressive rock, for baroque pop (ala The Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\"), but I think the best term to describe them is one I made up: \"fairy-tale rock\". If there was never a band that epitomized the term 'surreality', it would be Mew. Their sound is composed of cloud, heavy, distorted bass, stuttering drums playing very odd rhythms, guitars that can range from grunge to psychedelia, and players of synths, pianos, celeste, xylophones, strings and occasionally some electronica. Lead singer Jonas Bjerre sings in a high-pitched voice, but it never sounds demo, just whimsical. It fits in perfectly with the fairy-tale feel of their music. Bands I'd compare them to are Sigur Ros and Bjork's \"Vespertine\" (the wintry atmosphere), Smashing Pumpkins (the lyrics and diversity), Beach Boys\/Four Seasons (melodies and harmonies), and The Trans-Siberian Orchestra (classical music aspects), but you'd never say they're an limitation of any of these bands. They transcend and surpass most of their influences. They've also been compared to Muse and The Mars Volta, being in a group of bands that \"constantly push the boundaries of rock music\". I'd definitely agree with those last two. They've struck a perfect balance. Their music is very elegant and oftentimes incredibly beautiful, but they can rock out with the best of them, too (such as on \"Circuitry of the Wolf\"). Their music is technical and complex, but it never sounds showoff-ish, unlike most metal bands that try to use those two aspects. It actually adds to the overall feel. They're accessible, but there's tons of players of depth underneath the catchiness (\"The Zookeeper's Boy\"). Mew is still a very obscure group in the U. S., but the sheer sound of the band indicates that they could easily be huge. Let's hope their momentum popularity-wise picks up.

But this one aside, the other cuts are quite good. The title cut is an effective ditty that complements the first. \"Spanish Guitar\" is reminiscent of Braxton's earlier \"Un-break My Heart\" while \"I'm Still Breathing\" is classic Toni.\"Gimme Me\" is a not-too-subtle suggestion for erotic encounters to come. With her cover photo, it is obvious what she wants. \"Fairy Tale,\" with its guitar accompaniment reminds one of smoke-filled night clubs and the best work of chantueses of the past. Another cut \"Maybe\" allows Toni to do her patented form of \"scatting\" showing the range of her distinctive alto and phrasing that could be comparable to Ella Fitzgerald if that legend were a contemporary artist.

Lil Wayne is no stranger to controversy, nor does the hide from it in real life and on the Carter IV. Besides Lil Wayne's lyrics the main thing that stands out on the Carter IV is the production. The only two stand out names on production the uses are Polow Da Don and Cool & Dre. Lots of new names stand out including producer Bangladesh who really creates a hit with the acclaimed six foot seven foot featuring Cory Gunz. The song that really stands out production wise is John featuring Rick Ross. Polow Da Don creates a classic with a mix of wrap and rock together. When you listen to the song its hard to hear anything but wrap production, but at the VMA's the had a drummer playing the beat for the song. When it comes to the production on this CD it is golden and for the list of producer that karen't as well known it is a huge compliment to the work they put in. Where Wayne really stands out on this CD is in two songs to me and that is John and . On John Lil Wayne and Rick Ross flow off each other so well, similar to fifty Cent featuring Eminem on Psycho. On this song Wayne sounds the hungriest the has been in years. Some of the lyrics you can't write but one of the sickest lines on the CD come from John. \"Prepare for the worst but still praying for the best, this game is a spain I got my hand up her dress the money don't sleep and Weezy don't rest, An AKforty-seven is my freaking address.\" The other bright spots of the CD stand out on the Intro, Interlude and Outro. This is where Wayne and this guest features are at there best as the songs are just free styling to decent beats for freestyles. This gets a little but repetitive towards the send of the CD because freestyles are meant for the mixtape circuit. With that being said Wayne went outside of the box on this CD and tried something no other artist has really done on a major CD. As for the parts were Wayne sounds out of place it comes when the switches up this wrapping style. Perfect examples of this are on the songs Nightmares at the bottom, How to Hate and How To Love. I understand you need a crossover of songs that are radio friendly but if you are going to make those songs do it in a way that works with your wrapping style. The funny thing is except for How to Love none of those songs were played on the radio, and its Lil Wayne and would have been just fine leaving those songs off for keeping the style the is used to. On How To Hate featuring T-Pain Wayne sounds out of this element as the is trying to crossover to an R&B; style to work with T-Pain. It skills the mood of the CD which up to that point had been really good. Another example of this is on How To Love Lil Wayne is clearly using Auto-Tune and it just not this style. On top of all that the lyrical content which Wayne thrives on really diminished because the is trying to make a pop friendly song. Overall the Carter IV is a win for me. The Production on this CD was top notch with not a lot of known producers. The thing I like the most is Wayne is not afraid to step out of the box by using freestyles on three different songs. Another thing that stands out is Wayne's use of Metaphor's. He has put himself into a category as one of the greatest lyricist in the music game today. For even the disappointment's the Carter IV still cant be stopped. For an artist who can still sell over nine hundred, zero units with CD sales alone in the first week you know you are looking at one of the greatest musicians in the music industry today.","overall":4,"summary":"The Carter IV delivers but is not Waynes best work yet","unixReviewTime":1315267200,"reviewTime":"09 6, 2011"}

Especially for a young woman in her twenty's, exhausted by the overwhelming success and seemingly endless promotion that she found herself facing. So what was she to do, after getting off the ride of her life and finding herself more lost and confused than she had never been before? Why, she retreated to India, in hopes of awakening her spirituality, finding enlightenment, and gaining answers to the questions that plagued her. And thus, after a roughly three year hiatus, Alanis are-emerged into America's music scene, with her sophomore offering, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. Sales were exceptional in the first week, shattering records, but soon, just as quickly as they rose, sales declined, and when all was said and done, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie sold about two million copies, a sharp and unpleasant contrast to Jagged Little Pill's fourteen million. However, I believe this was the line in the sand that divided those who purchased JLP: those who were actually fans of Alanis and those who simply bought whatever was popular at the time, what they heard on the radio, which, ultimately, is a great thing. But, back to the review: Like I said, Alanis was completely shellshocked by all that success she garnered, and found herself not even wanting to continue her music career, found herself drifting and unfulfilled. And that is the big theme of this record: her coping with her success, and discovering that, surprise, surprise, success does't necessarily bring happiness. By the send, Alanis is comfortable with where she is in life and ready to take the next step on her journey. As a result of all the ups and downs and experiences Alanis went through, this record is more raw, personal, honest, and revealing than Pill could have never been. The production is top-notch and superior to Pill as well. Despite the initial negativity towards this album, I strongly maintain that it is her best work and definitely, one of the best CDs in my collection.","overall":5,"summary":"Alanis's Sophomore Stunner","unixReviewTime":1160092800,"reviewTime":"10 6, 2006"}

Within the last year I purchased the SHM CD from Japan of this title and that was an improvement over the domestic issue. This was a digital recording so I was not expecting a vast improvement. Immediately upon starting the Audio Fidelity version I knew this was even better than the SHM CD version. There was more life to it and more punch when punch was there. All around this was a much better sounding issue. Let's hope Audio Fidelity continues to issue great sounding issues. Their recent Audio Fidelity release of Styx's The Grand IllusionGrand Illusionwas not anywhere near as good as the Japanese SHM CD versionGrand Illusion (Mlps) (Shm). I would like to see some sort of consistency there, whether it be Audio Fidelity for Japanese but at this point there does not seem to be any, the wallet is just getting lighter due to this.

Rock Bottom: Bottom of rock music. Rock Bottom: Depressed - nowhere lower to go. Rock Bottom: Paralysed from the waist downwards. Rock Bottom was made after Robert lost the use of this legs. It has a dark, subaqueous quietude about it; like crawling across the seabed, slowed down by the weight of water. But the surge for anaesthesia is counterbalanced by a blessed-out, oceanic feel. The songs (if we can call them that) all traverse this contradiction: related, out-of-body; but simultaneously in a state of traumatic aftershock. This is a beautiful and harrowing record. Like all Robert's best work, it faces intense emotional issues with innocence; even equanimity. That is what makes it so heartbreaking. `Rock Bottom' is desperate, but it has a childlike hopefulness. Worked up in Venice, overlooking the lagoon, its unique sonorities are largely rendered on a toy keyboard bought by Alfreda, Robert's wife. I guess late at night Robert would look at the water, lit by moonlight. He would start to dream. The dreams went into this keyboard.

That title carries some connotations (not bad) that led me to believe that what I was going to hear was a voice with an acoustic guitar, but with Wyatt's unique voice and creative stamp. After getting to know this amazing album, I can definitely say that \"singer\/songwriter,\" as it's usually used (from folk artists to less-worthy elite rock) does't really accurately describe this music. I guess I can't complain too much though, since Wyatt wrote the songs and the's singing. As usual, so much for labels, which this album proves in spades--there's no use trying to classify it, and to cage this bird with a label would only restrain its wild beauty. Rock Bottom is a great record. As a fan of Soft Machine, I was pleased to hear this familiar unique voice and also this quirky, sometimes impressionistic lyrics in a less psychedelic jazzy jam style than the Machine records. There is jazz influence and playing on this album, but I can't say it would be helpful to call the whole thing jazz. Like I said before, labels won't do this music justice. This album is great, but it's pretty weird too. If you're a big classic rock radio fan, you'll probably be turned off on first listen, but then again most people will probably take a few listens to really get familiar with this music. Besides, if you're exclusively a radio rock fan, you probably won't find this record. Either way, don't give up after one listen. The opening track is layered with synths and wanders slowly as Wyatt curiously describes a lover using ocean metaphors and ends with the conclusion that they are both mad. It's a pretty stripey track with lots of texture and a gripping lyric. What really makes this track priceless for me is Wyatt's wordless vocal solo that closes the song. What a voice! The second track contains some more great scatting, as Wyatt makes this voice sound quite a bit like a brass instrument. Innovative use of this voice and other instruments paired with some desolate lyrics bring this one closer to expression of this feelings after the accident that paralysed him from the waist down.\"Little Red Riding Hood\" is great, starting with a bizarre, unique brass arrangement, with stream-of-consciousness lyrics that really provide the listener with a window into this feelings about this physical and mental state. The backwards vocal at the send really sounds great along with the galloping groove set first by the trumpets. The companions \"Alifib\" and \"Alifie\" present some more innovation with a whispered word as percussion and another atmospheric soundscape that leads into another bizarre lyric about eating Alifie (I guess you'll probably have to listen to it yourself to get the idea) both sung by Wyatt and with a spoken word section. The closing track, \"Little Red Robin Hood\" has some really wicked guitar and yet another quirky vocal a capella closing section. I'm pretty well aware that this description fails to capture the essence of Wyatt's masterpiece and also makes it sound pretty strange as well. Unfortunately, like many classic works of part, Rock Bottom has to be experienced to be appreciated and better understood. Words really can't do it justice, of course, but my hope is that the words in this review at least encourage you to check it out and have the unique and awesome experience of listening to this music for yourself. It might not be mainstream enough to please everybody, but if everything sounded the same, records like Rock Bottom would't be so special. Keep your mind and years open wide and I think you'll be rewarded. Hope you check it out!","overall":5,"summary":"Nothing like it--give me more!","unixReviewTime":1167091200,"reviewTime":"12 26, 2006"}

This may not be a problem if you are a patient listener who is OK with listening to music just for the sound of the singer's voice.

After hearing the Myles tracks I am confident that the new Alter Bridge record will be nothing short of amazing (as usual). I've been following this album for quite awhile and am really glad its finally out and on the shelves the wait was definitely worth it and I hope by working with so many artists that Slash has found a new voice for Velvet Revolver. He really does't have to go back to VR honestly I think the can pull off the solo artist really well and I am kind of hoping the stays solo. I will definitely see Slash when the comes around just to see how these songs are preformed live with Myles.

I am also glad the ditched the name Slash & Friends Slash has a more epic feel. Now that this record is out I will patiently await Slash II.

This record showed that Madonna -- essentially a singles artist -- is capable of making a thematically coherent, mature album that also features a load of great songs that stand on their own. From the first notes on the record, the apocalyptic guitars that introduce the title track, there's something different about this record. An attention to detail, an aggressiveness, and also a sophistication beyond her previous releases. and anything else she's recorded since. \"Like a Prayer\" is unforgettable; even though Madonna's voice is hardly gospel material, it's precisely the tension between her dance-pop voice and the Andrae Crouch Choir's booming chants that makes the track so powerful. A black-white fusion with an unstoppable beat and an instantly memorable chorus. \"Express Yourself\" is not one of my favourite tracks possibly due to over-exposure, but you have to admit, it's another instantly recognizable song and Madonna's mission statement of sorts. The pop songwriting is flawless on \"Till Death Do Us Part\", \"Keep It Together\" and \"Spanish Eyes\", and \"Oh Father\" is hands down my favourite Madonna song. Who would've thought she could convey so much heart in such a simple song? The \"You never wanted to live that way\" interlude is beautiful beyond words. Classic video, too, a childlike dream directed by David Fincher. I've heard the whole Madonna canon hundreds of times growing up (there was a fanatic in the house) and most of her music's grown stale on me, except this record. Because of her adaptability to trends, most of her albums sound dated, so in tune are they with the musical movements of their time.
