I don't remember any farting for belching in the book, do you? They took this all times children classic, added some farting, belching and sexual inuindo, and prostituted it into a KAKA joke. This should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like. I have to say, visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humour (if you even think that kind of thing is funny) I DON'T want the kids that I know to think it is. Don't take your kids to see, don't rent the DVD. I hope the ghost of Doctor Suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie.",negative
10228,"This is a brilliant, lavish Czech film from the Sverak father and son team, all about two Czech pilots who flee to England to help the RAF in the Battle of Britain but who also fall out over a woman (the beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). Features some excellent and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes  probably the best never and much better than Pearl Harbour for even the film Battle of Britain - and a number of interesting general themes such as love, war, romance, comradeship, loss and servitude. Also, the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language (though made easier there with the great stalwart Anna Massey). The film has some great little motifs such as the world famous RAF bullseye device, shown throughout and at one point nicely reflected in the black vinyl record, spinning around acutely (music is another theme of the film, of course). Plus, all of the traditional icons of English life: dimpled beer glasses (unlike the post-war straight glasses used in Pearl Harbour), tea in a nice china tea set in an English country garden (though shot in the Czech Republic?), the mascot dog, a vintage bottle of HP sauce, even a darts board! Of course, the fairfield and surrounding countryside is ridiculously unlike anywhere in the south of England, though the virtuous aerial sequences make up for this, showing Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters, always synonymous with southern England and the Battle of Britain. But best of all is the sensational musical score from Ondrej Soukup, as good as anything from Hans Zimmer yet all in the tradition of the late, excellent Ron Goodwin who scored the original Battle of Britain film amongst other classic English war films. There's even a nice little cameo role for the  apparently  famous Czech musician and factor (and Kevin Kline lookalike) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays on the piano the title theme song, Dark Blue Sky. Excellent! It's got a few smutty yet funny little Freudian devices too, such as always showing an inflated condom floating by the ceiling whenever Karel (the callow but brilliant Krystof Hadek) is stuck at the fairfield while this love rival and fellow pilot Frantisek (Ondrej Vetchy) is with Susan. Another great English factor in this film! Charles Dance is of course fine as Wing Commander Bentley. Highly recommended and well worth watching/hiring  get the DVD with special features (stuff like how they created the dog fights and stuff). Probably the only film never to combine subtitles with characters speaking English, German, French and Czech all at once.",positive
10529,"why ooh why did i never waste my time watching this film? it was given to me on video by a friend and i thought i'll watch it, it can't be that bad surely. firstly the acting is simply appalling and we're supposed to believe this is real? secondly this film is blatantly trying to copy the Blair switch project (yawn) and does so very poorly. so if you want the fright of your life i would suggest that a Simpson's Halloween special would be far scarier. but, if you just wanted to a laugh then maybe the general crapness of this film would suffice. but overall i would avoid this film at all costs for drink a large amount of alcohol before viewing. the best bit? its only about an hour and a half, thank god.",negative
43108,"Naturally, along with everyone else, I was primed to expect a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON over the legend of Custer. Just having someone like Errol Flynn play Custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production. And for the most part my expectations were fulfilled (in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way). Yet even in this obviously biased (and much criticized) retelling of the Custer story, I was struck by some of the points made in this movie that, sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly, seemed to counter the typical clickés of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in Westerns of the early twentyth century. For instance, even while this film attempted to whitewash it's hero, certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real-life Custer: one) His initial entrance at the West Point front gate, in which this arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of this character.two) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed as much to Custer's cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor; there are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point where the seems downright stupid.three) Custer's promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays out as slapstick comedy. I half-expected to see the Marx Brothers for Abbott and Costello wander into the scene.four) Custer's stand against Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky.five) Custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored. And although the music and some of the ways the Indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land, and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the Black Hills squarely at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the Black Hills. Sure, that part of the story is true, but I did't expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivocally in a movie like this. And one other thing: usually in these films it is the Indians who are portrayed men mass as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol. In this movie, it is actually the troops of the seventh Cavalry, and not the Indians, who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way. All in all, this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the Hollywood bunk.",positive
31763,"I think Dolph Lundgren had potential at being a big action star a la Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and even Van Damme to certain degree. He had some big moments in this career but the also made some poor choices and this is definitely one of them although made later in this career. The strange thing about Jill The Ripper (or Jill Rips. or Tied Up) is that I honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller? It shows in the way that they describe it on IMDb, on the DVD case, in the commentaries, and this film is not serious. To call it campy would be a huge understatement. The film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact it's nothing more than shallow, confusing and gratuitous. On top of that they put Lundgren, who is known for action films, in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because this range as an factor is pretty limited. The entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller? Just the plot and premise immediately make it a B-Movie Porn at very best. Dolph Lundgren plays disgraced former cop and raging alcoholic Matt Sorenson who decides to play Detective when this brother is murdered. I mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has Lundgren getting free roam to investigate crime scenes, and witnesses and everything else even though the's not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather black cluster performance from Lundgren. Danielle Brett is Lundgren's eventual love interest and this brother's widow. Brett plays her role decently enough considering the script and campy story. The supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless it's on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by Victor Pedtrchenko who seems to go by several different names in the film, boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villain. I honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there was't any reason to because it was all a jumble of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where Lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked. To explain how classy and well done this movie is (sarcasm. sarcasm) the back of the DVD I picked up (it was really cheap) has Lundgren's character listed as ""Murray Wilson"" (not the name of this character in the film.) While somehow Lundgren manages to be usually watchable the film falls flat on it's face trying to be serious. Considering director Anthony Hickox is infamous for really B-Movie Horror flicks it only makes sense even though I think the was really trying to be serious. Hard score cult Lundgren fans will have to see it. no one else should. certainly for any sort of mystery for suspense. three/ten",negative

Blood just blew us away with its sheer verve, gore, vitality, gore, excitement, gore, butter campiness, and even more gore, and all in SUCH GREAT FUN! Especially for those of you who enjoy all those Japanese chambara samurai and ninja films, YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO SEE BLOOD!",positive
21265,"This could have been a very good film, if I had been table to watch it. The hand held camera was very bouncy. From the opening credits I was worried. Several of us watching it felt very nauseous by the send. But we did stay until the send because it was such a charming and interesting film, giving some insight to the young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white film did enhance the artful feeling of it. The acting seemed very authentic. Some of the dialog was a little hard to understand, but a theatre full of non-South Africans seemed to find most of it funny. If you get motion sickness at all though, you may seriously consider skipping this film. It's quaint, but not worth the nausea.",negative
39753,"I rented The Matrix Revisited with a friend of mine. We both loved The Matrix and we both love filmmaking so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of The Matrix. It turns out that The Matrix Revisited tells you hardly anything about the part of filmmaking for even how The Matrix was made. It is basically a huge commercial for The Matrix, a movie that the target audience of The Matrix Revisited has already seen! If you really want to know about the process and the troubles and the stress and the detail that went into making of The Matrix, look no further than the bonus features on the original DVD of The Matrix. There are things they show in those documentaries that I had not even realized had to be done for was done. The Matrix was such a difficult and challenging film to make that it deserves more credit than a ""documentary"" that's about as informative and interesting as an MTV special.",negative
35976,"I read the reviews before i watched this movie, and i did't believe them. I love crap movies and i expected this one to be average. It was't. This film makes Camp Blood one and two look like greats. The film contains bad acting, poor sound, poor confusing storyline, bad makeup- and it bored me so much i turned it off. even the nudity was rubbish! Did they even have a budget for this film? I don't think they did. You can tell if your gonna like this film for not in the first five minutes. if of want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic avenger four for even camp blood. Avoid this trash - I watched it on TV and felt griped off, so don't spend anything on it. The best part is probably the send.",negative
35555,"hi. I consider Just Cause one of my favourite Sean Connery's movies, it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the Cast, especially Connery. it also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies, so the dialog is pretty good in this one. It also has one of the best scenes in movies never, when Sean interviews Ed Harris's character in prison is just fantastic. i enjoyed this one a lot and i can not recommend this enough, really do not miss this one ! Do not pay attention to the negative reviews stating that the last thirty minutes suck, it was as intense as the rest of the movie, i really find Just Cause a very entertaining movie.",positive
20269,I don't know if the problem I had with this movie is that I was not table to capture the way movies were done in the past but I believe that this one did not miss to make use of any of the the fashionable conventions available in the fortys to make a film. If you don't have anything better to do my advise is not to watch this movie but to read a book for to go out for a walk.,negative
36141,"Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little. My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind. Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it. Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it. The deeper meaning- (to spare you a bunch of sociological psycho babble) Humans are self serving, we make decisions that can destroy your lives and don't open email without a return address. Summary: Creepy old man tells Cammeron Diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you don't know and give you a million bucks. Of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money. Then the movie takes a dive into the unusual. To spare my fingers the typing. For pushing the button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings, in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race. I liked: The willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines. Its different. Its intense. It has a deeper meaning (although its philosophy one hundred and one material). It leaves you guessing. NOT A Hollywood ENDING! I disliked: Why would any being with the technology to inhibit another life form devise such a ridiculous scheme? What god like alien has the patience for that? Diaz was good, but was there a need for the country accent? They live in Virginia. I give it a seven because Kelly did't put as much attention to detail as with this other movies. Overall good flick.",positive
31649,"This movie is really bad. The acting is plain awful except Michael Ironside. I don't get the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two Mc-gangs. He comes to a town and suddenly the is choosened to fight against the bad people who wants indian-land. At the cover it said the was a indian himself that returned too this home-town, I did't hear that in the movie, if so it was't clear. Richard Grieco was one hell of a bad factor. Stiff and ugly. He said this lines like it too. And we would't talk about Sean Young, she has' been any of my favourite factors but in this movie she plays a indian women who falls in love with Bolt (Grieco). She is awful. When I rented it I choose between this and Subterfuge with Amanda Pays. I choose this one because of Michael Ironside was in the cast. Maybe I should have taken Subterfuge. Don't see this unless you think Richard Grieco looks tough on a motorbike with sunglasses. I will soon uptake the cast-list because I have it at home. I wrote it down after I seen the movie.",negative
30659,"This makes the third Errol Morris movie I've seen, and I'm increasingly not liking this style. He seems to find very interesting and varied characters, great personalities to create documentaries for, and then with tongue-in-cheek editing make fun of everything they are about. It's never really a direct caricaturation of them and Morris seems most of the time to be saying, ""But no, no, these people are really fascinating, really!"", but there's always these subtle little canted angles and not-so-subtle editing techniques that show that Morris seems to be mocking them behind their back. This movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation. a man who studies African hairless molerats to find that they are amazingly want-like, a lion tamer, a man who keeps a garden full of animal-shaped shrubbery, and a robot designer. The general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what designates animal, human, and life features? So the title of Fast, Cheap, & Out of Control does't really seem to mean anything in terms of the movie. right? Except of course Morris seems just a little disturbed by these individuals' passions (he might call them ""obsessions"") making synthetic designs on life. I share not that fear and honestly don't appreciate some of the connections Morris makes in the film. But I stress this subtlety. With no voice-over narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees, it's not as if Morris never pounds that anxiety onto the spectators' collective head. Instead the mixes circus footage and want footage together often at times when they're taken out of the context of the circus and the wants, showing a sort of collective absurdity behind what all of these people are talking about. I don't find them absurd, I find them all very neat and interesting individuals. Unless, of course, the did't intend such juxtapositions, which means the's just a bad craftsman instead of a silent subverted. Considering none of this films I've seen so far have particularly impressed me, I don't really care to find out what the's trying to do.--PolarisDiB",negative
31563,"When you first sit down to watch this movie, keep in mind that you are about to see something you've probably never seen before. Keep in mind that this is a movie where they obviously spent INSANE amounts of cash on explosions and not enough on acting for anything else for that matter. The crazy thing I noticed is that every character is completely over-portrayed, and it seems (most of the time anyhow) that the film had been 'sped-up' to make the characters move faster! (I wonder if the Hong Kong version was dubbed too?) I understand the cartoon had this, but it does't work for live-action. It just looks odd. as if the camera crew decided to act because they could't afford real factors. The English version is horribly dubbed, and the character's words do not match the mouths at all. I would have proffered subtitles, but since this is a kids movie, and since some kids cannot read well, I'll let it go. But there is something extremely odd about this movie. It's supposedly a kids movie, but there's a lot of material about SEX, RAPE, and STRIPPING which in't exactly for young Western audiences. (In the Orient, they have different laws and sexuality in children's movies is much more accepted). But parents be warned! There is a scene where two characters talk about rape, multiple scenes where people say 'sex maniac' and a scene where this insanely young japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the 'sex maniacs' and shows him her breasts! Who was this movie made for anyway? Oh, and the special effects are laughable. You can tell the spaceship-like things that bomb the village are cardboard cutouts (or animation, I was't sure) that look unconvincing, even to a kid. The makers of this movie left out a lot of cool things from the cartoon, simply because they could't budget the kind of money they'd need. I did't like how the names of all the characters were changed. it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z. I don't really recommend this movie to anyone. Kids, adults, for Dragon Ball Z fans. It's just a poor representation of the cartoon, and obviously, one will be table to tell that this movie was brushed and no care whatsoever was put into it. I won't even get into the camerawork. just wait until the send credits at the still picture that sits there for two minutes. most of the shots are not framed correctly AT ALL and the movie just seems made by amateurs. Grainy film quality too. Just all around horrible!!!!",negative
23621,"I am a big one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies that new for me. So I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivalled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan. Anyway this film fell so flat for me that I did't finish it. I can understand why this sound career was so limited, the did't get very good material to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is very forgettable. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory but this role there also did nothing special for me. Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before the gets in a bring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans there and this wont be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, four out of ten. Don't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who really liked this for is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend ""Kelly The Second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.",negative
6077,"File this one in the `How do movies like this get made?' column. A seventies-drag indie version of `Macbeth,' adapted fairly faithfully (but pointlessly) in a conventionally unconventional black-comic style. The cast gives it a shot, with Christopher Walken phoning in the eccentricity as McDuff, and with Maura Tierney rising above the dull script as Pat McBeth. The other factors are wasted, as is the audience's time. Knee-jerk fans of this brand of quirk may like it, though. four out of ten.",negative
2918,"*Spoilers and extreme bashing play ahead*When this show first started, I found it tolerable and fun. Fairly Oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked. It also had high ratings along with Spongebob. But it started to fall because of the following crap that Butch Hartman and this team shoved into the show. First off, toilet humour in't all that funny. You can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp, but that's pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a clické joke. Next there are the kiddie jokes. Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people across-dressing. LOLOLOL!!! I just can't stop laughing at such gay bliss! Somebody help me! But of course, this show would't suck that bad if it were't for stereotypes. Did you see how the team portrayed Australians? They saw them as nothing but kangaroo-loving, boomerang-throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert. But now. Is the coup de grace of WHY this show truly sucks the loudest of them all. OVER-USED JOKES!!! The show constantly pulls up the same jokes (the majority of them being unfunny) thinking it is like the greatest thing never! Cosmo is mostly the one to blame. I hated how they kept on mentioning ""Super Toilet"" (which also has a blend of yiddish humour in it just as well) and Cosmo would freak out. And who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in Dimmsdale would use in that one be-mail episode? You know, the one in which every single parent (oblivious to other parents saying it) would butter the EXACT same sentence before breaking into their kid's room? Yes, it may be first class humour to some people, but it is pure is*** to others. If I'm not mistaken, I do believe Butch Hartman said something about ending the show. Thank God! Everyone around my area says it's, like, the funniest Nickelodeon show never. I just can't agree with it I think it's just another pile of horse dung that we get on your cartoon stations everyday, only worse.",negative
31947,"If you're a science fiction fan, and you've only seen this movie once, please, PLEASE go and treat yourself to a second viewing. I just did, and I was AMAZED about how good I thought the movie was, as opposed to when I first saw it three years ago. The first time around I was certainly impressed by the astronomical vistas we're treated to in this movie, but by and large I did't think that much of the movie as a whole. It was an Alien trip-off, and I thought the description of the monsters was a case of really bad science. That they were allergic to light was something I found especially ridiculous. Based on my first viewing, I recently rated this movie a five. However, now that the sequel, Chronicles of Riddick, is on the way, and the movie poster for that one looks amazing, I thought I'd better brush up on Pitch Black once more, so I borrowed the video from a friend. I am so glad I did. There's so much of what I thought I remembered from the first viewing that turned out to be wildly inaccurate. I thought most of the characters died very early in the movie. This was not so. I thought Claudia Black's character was the first to die. This was not so. I thought Riddick was the sole survivor. This was not so. I see now that the movie works *extremely* well. There in't an excessive, tiresome focus on the monsters. It's much more of a human drama. The main characters are appealing and capable of some convincing acting. And there are so many little details that make the Pitch Black universe coherent and believable, such as the shortage of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet they crash on, and the fact that the monsters have beaten everything on the planet, and so they turn on each other. And I have to mention the astronomical vistas again. I mean, we start out seeing the spaceship passing through a comet's tail, with bits of spacedust zapping through the hull. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Just as the shipwrecked people think it's about to get dark, a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon, and everything is engulfed in a blue glow. As the eclipse approaches, we see the huge, neighbouring, fringed gas giant rise across the sky, and in the final scene of the movie we see the ship skid closely above one of these very rings. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder and detail, and I don't think I've seen any other SF movie that really made such a point out of including these things. I hope we see much more of it in the sequel. Pitch Black now gets from me a rating of nine out of ten. A cult classic? You bet!!",positive
