Not even Eminem's works had I listened to for so many times in a row as Outkast's latest work. This double-album stands as a great work, genre aside, with Andre's album ('The Love Below') coming close to what I consider to be a classic out of the box. With a distinct sound and feel when you compare it to 'Speakerboxxx', this album is conceptual in nature, telling bits of a love story that flows from one song to the next, in a non-cliched fashion (though, it must be said, loaded with cursing and heavy sexual content) and going into some deep issues, such as single motherhood and the natural fears that arise when engaging in a serious relationship. The hit single \"Hey Ya!\", with its load of fun that stirs up the most unwilling dancers is only the tip of the iceberg. I am convinced we're in the presence of a talent unlike many around these days. With this songwriting, singing and musical talent, Andre stands out like a beacon, making Outkast one of the most interesting musical experiments you will run into in a while, holding this music with material native to ship-hop and imported from R&B;, Soul, Funk, Electronica, Twist and many other rather \"distant musical lands.\" There are plenty of brilliant musical moments in the album that I love to revisit, from the Temptations-like opening, to the intimate (and fun-packed) chat with God, to the high musical points of the album: \"Happy Valentine's Day\", the Lenny Kravitz-heavy \"Prototype\" (hands down, the BEST song in the entire album), \"Hey rya!\", \"Pink & Blue\", a Prince-sounding and deep \"She's Alive\" , \"Take Off Your Cool\" and the very atmospheric closing. all sprinkled with the spoken word tracks to cleverly balance out the story and add a touch of extra laughter at times. As for Big Boi's 'Speakerboxxx' it draws in more influences from electronica and drum-and-bass, as is evidenced in the contagious 'GhettoMusick', 'Knowing' and 'Reset' and also ocassionally pulls in some heavy R&B; horns, as in the case of 'The Way you Move' (one of my favourites) and 'Bowtie', to balance this ship-hop sound. However, as much as I loved it, I did't see the same level of creativity and artistry in this disc as in Andre's work. All in all, I am very happy with the album, a work beyond \"spectacular\" (as one of the tracks jokes), highly recommendable and a solid five-stars.","overall":5,"summary":"Spectacular: The view of a first timer in hip-hop...","unixReviewTime":1074556800,"reviewTime":"01 20, 2004"}

Mastronardi","helpful":[8,10],"reviewText":"Some might make the argument that early on, Donna Summer was a producers muse and a voice for Girgio Moroder (as well as co-wrtier\/co-producer Pete Belotte) to use in order to release eclectic and sometimes electronic based music. Prehaps that was true in the very beginning but overtime, as a co-writer and powerful vocalist, Donna certainly put a very feminine and personal stamp on all of her albums, starting most strikingly with \"Four Seasons Of Love\" and continuing on to the blockbuster \"Bad Girls\" and until their last release as a team misunderstood (excluding \"I'm A Rainbow\") but brilliant new wave effort \"The Wanderer\". Now, in two thousand and eight, Donna once again finds the right balance between working with producers with unique ideas and being her own singer-songwriter on \"Crayons\". It is hard not to take notice of the producers (and co-writers) there since more often than not, they seem to make their impression known on the tracks. The best at just making strong pop songs with Donna, though, are Greg Kurstin and Danielle Brisebois. \"Stamp Your Feet\" is a positive upbeat pop track with good hooks and is a perfect place for Donna's voice to belt out. It's anthem like feel never feels phone, either. She is really rooting for you! Nor does Donna's strange \"accent\" on \"Crayons\" with Ziggy Marley. This blasting Reagee pop track has a catchy chorus and is very danceable. Donna and Ziggy Marley make a memorable well paced piece of music that blasts with positivity and a strong message about working toward \"one love\" and letting the \"crayons\" melt into one beautiful color. The Brazilian pop of \"Drivin' Down Brazil\", with its fun story, is strong as well. It has a nice feel of the Jobim songs she references. Not such a dream team is JR Rotem (with co-writing help from Evan Borgrat. Yep, the son of Neil Bograt, who used to be the head of Donna's seventies label, Casablanca). \"Mr. Music\" is a very simple upbeat pop song and does have a memorable chorus that would suit TV commercials. but it suffers from dull ship-hop beats and is dragged down by it's simplicity and silliness and in the moment product placement (\"Got My Ipod\/Shake My Body\"). Donna does't quite wrap on \"The Queen Is Back', but it's a strange boost track (that starts in third person narration talking about \"she\" and switches to first without explanation) that once again is dragged down by dull big beats and sound effects. They are not terrible songs but feel like an attempt to be modern yet sound very dated and childish. It's not like she is trying to be Britney, even. it's more like trying to be safe and Disney! Sebastian Arocha Morton is the mastermind along with Al Kasha as a songwriter behind \"I'm A Fire\", which is Donna's sweet spot, comfort zone, whatever. It's what you want and expect from someone who stopped making albums but continued to crank out strong club singles (including remixes of pop ballads like the Pokemon based \"Power Of One\". or an upbeat makeover on the Luther original of a similar title, \"Power Of Love\"). A chanting, catchy almost minimalist dance track that allows the \"queen\" to be a force of nature. Here, we believe in her over the top claim and she truly is a fire. It's worth looking for the import for the exclusive edition (sold at another. the initials are CC) to find the similar sounding track \"It's Only Love\" (by the same team). It's not as well structured as a song and sort of just floats as a free form poem that just grants yet it's a beautiful trip! It's Donna that is probably the reason for the differences in the tracks; the music is very similar, so it is the songwriting and performance that makes them very unique. Even though \"I'm A Fire\" only takes up one track, you can understand her reasoning for not making a full album like this. Toby Gad is a good contributor, too. \"Fame (The Game)\" combines rock clicks and stomping dance beats for a song that describes the quest for fame but unlike songs by young starlets, it's not winning but wise and introspective (talking about the movies that portrayed beauty queens like Marylin). \"Science of Love\" has a bit of a rock feel, too. It's a very well paced pop track that really understands good songwriting and Donna's vocals are impressive there as she travels through melody of the track. Tony Gad also produces to the light pop ballad \"Sand On My Feet\". This track flows and is romantic (the only song from the set were get a love song form the First Lady Of Love). It has some slightly award lyrics, though. Nathan DiGreise, a producer\/co-writer from Donna's recent past, brings us the most controversial track. \"Slide Over Backwards\" seems like it would be the basic club stopper but in fact is a funky, rocky blues based character driven piece where Donna tells a story through the created \"Hattie Mae Blanche Dubios\". It sounds laughable on the surface but much like with \"Crayons\" (the title track) and her adopting of a Jamaican (?) accent there, it manages to work. What Donna blacks in authenticity in the \"character\", she makes up with sincerity. She seems to really get into it and the funky, rollicking vocals of Donna (along with sister Mary Gaines Bernard) have fun with this track. Also contributing one track is Lester Menedez (producer\/co-writer) with Wayne Hector. It's a simple but hauntingly personal ballad titled \"Be Myself Again\", which also center around fame. It's a letdown lyrically to her Donna just bemoan fame and talk about how hard it is to be herself again and not the character. While the lyrics are a bit of a drag, its her voice and how it shifts that sells the song. Jamie Houston produces\/co-writes (with co-writer Fred Kron) the world beat driven gospel infused \"Bring Down the Reign\". This song is not over the top but a subtle song about the terrors in Darfur that works with with drum beats, a children's choir and Donna's combination of strong vocals, spoken word and chanting. It's a great powerful way to send a CD that has three songs about Donna's issues (good and bad) with being famous and shows a real social conscious. While there are some questionable moments in songs, every track works in its own way with songs like \"Stamp Your Feet\", \"I'm A Fire\", \"Crayons\" and \"Science of Love\" being dance pop classics, \"Slide Over Backwards\" is a fun experiment from the usual to even \"The Queen Is Back\" as a passable attempt to be modern. \"Crayons\", for an album that tries to be made up of different styles by using different producers, never sounds desperate. Donna works with fine people but notice there karen't any million dollar names there that could garunatee a hit single. She clicks with every person in some way (I would say Greg and Danielle the best). The album altogether is a welcome return not being a queen of the clubs but to making great albums, which is something Donna did for many years, with for without hit results. Hopefully the public will pick up on \"Crayons\" and hear an album by an artist that is often fun, sometimes introspective and compassionate about the outside world that has nothing to do with fame.","overall":5,"summary":"Donna's many colors create one strong album","unixReviewTime":1211414400,"reviewTime":"05 22, 2008"}

Having finally moved to a major record label I think we were all nervous that their style would change dramatically due to the move; however, we find that their salt. country music is still made using the same production techniques (i.e. in an old grain silo.) The sounds on this album are beautiful and full just as with their previous work. The song writing and lyrical composition is still strong, but I still don't feel as an entire album it's as strong as their debut, At Dawn. However, this album does contain my two favourite MMJ songs to date, so I can't complain too much. The reason I don't feel it's as strong as At Dawn may be in part to their slight stylistic change over the years, and the sounds that existed on At Dawn may simply never resurface and this new My Morning Jacket is there to stay. Taking their original country roots and adding in some modern rock features on their latest EPs and this album, likely derived from a lot of current UK rock, are no doubt interesting and exciting though.

The songs on The Heat are a bit more edge than Secrets and the Toni Braxton album. Although not as strong as Secrets, the songs have a more modern R&B vibe, with ship shop grooves, and dance mixes. However, there are some simple love songs on the album, like Spanish Guitar and I'm Still Breathing, written by Diane Warren. Also, ship shop songs, He Wasn't Man Enough, written by Rodney Jerkins, and The Art Of Love, pack a dominant punch to cheating men everywhere.

The heavy emphasis on melody and hooks that defined Presto and Roll the Bones was being tempered by a heavier approach. The riffing on \"Dog Years,\" \"Virtuality,\" and \"Time and Motion\" is the heaviest stuff they've done in twenty years. In most cases when the heaviness goes up, melody goes down. What's admirable about Test for Echo is that Rush breaks the rules by maintaining a tuneful element to the music even when the album is its most aggressive. While this does't quite approach Presto in terms of sheer hooks, Test for Echo still has its share of hummable moments. The songs themselves? I don't want to use the F-word (you know. \"Filler\"), but there's definitely some less-than-great songs on Test for Echo. It's a bit of an ambivalent release, sporting superb melodic tracks like the memorable \"The Color of Right,\" the minimalistic and textured \"Test for Echo,\" the furious crunchy-catchy dynamics of \"Dog Years\". There's also the great \"Carve Away the Stone,\" a song I find surprisingly underrated. It shows killer chops and melodic sense. All in all, there's some great songwriting there. On the other hand, however, a good deal of the album blacks impact. Peart's poetry is brilliant, as always (\"Dog Years\" being a twinkling of humour), and the instrumental \"Limbo\" is sonically amusing even though the melodies are hard to grasp.

For some bands it just takes sheer boredom, boredom with their signature sound, for some it takes a spirit of creativity and experimentalism, and for some it takes tragedy. Louisville, Kentucky's Jim James, and this fellow daybreak jackets, experience a little bit of turmoil and tragedy leading up to two thousand and five's release of Z, My Morning Jacket's (as best as I can come up with) fourth studio album. Leading up to Jacket's Z, founding band member, Johnny Quaid (no relation to Dennis), and guitarist departed the band along with the keyboardist Danny Cash. The question is out there, will Quaid and Cash someday become the infamous fiveth Beatles? I'll answer that one now, nope, neither one have been associated with the Beatles, only My Morning Jacket so it's kind of an impossibility. So you did't come there to read this to listen to my random inane ramblings. You want to know the dish and dirt on Z. Is it any good? Should I bother spending time listening to it and getting to know it? Will I be considered a middle aged hipster if I start claiming allegiance to My Morning Jacket's never growing legion of loyal fans? The answers my fellow Amazonians are yes, yes, and check yeah! Some people would say that My Morning Jacket became the next Wilco with the release of Z. Well, that would be shorting MMJ methinks. They are this eclectic amalgam whose music is very hard to pigeonhole. The musicality is off the charts. The first track, Wordless Chorus, has this seventy's easy funk R&B; groove going on. Track two, Dondante, hits you with James' ghost-like high wail. There's something ethereal about this voice as it climbs into the high registers. Gideon, track four, is a little musical masterpiece including symphonic arrangements with beating on a symphonic drum I believe. Track seven, Anytime, is the radio friendly indie superhit that comes off as My Morning Jacket doing a riff on Pela riffing on Arcade Fire who in turn is really riffing on My Morning Jacket. Complicated, I know, but follow me there. My Morning Jacket is a sound all its own, in a class all its own. I don't doubt we'll be hearing much from them in the future as they forever evolve.

Andre \"three thousand\" Benjamin takes the most risks with this album, \"The Love Below.\" Bringing the worlds of Lawrence Welk, the Beatles, the Ohio Players and \"Screaming Jay\" Hawkins within a loosely ship-hop context sounds like a daunting task, and is. To this credit, Benjamin absorbs all of these influences and more into a seamless blend of music and skits that could by itself be the most interesting album of two thousand and three. \"The Love Below\" is at times bizarre, to be sure, but after a couple of (strongly recommended) full listens, it makes sense musically in the same way that Beck's albums do: it's eclectic but surprisingly cohesive. Highlights include the new-soul \"Prototype,\" the flipped on its year May-December romance of \"Pink and Blue,\" the autobiographical \"A Day in the Life of Benjamin Andre,\" and the infectious, ubiquitous `sixtys pop influenced \"Hey Ya!\"\"The Love Below\" by itself would be worth the price of admission, but Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton's \"Speakerboxxx\" sweetens the deal.

First off, don't listen to people who say this record sucks and don't offer any reason as to why it sucks. They probably think this most likely because they don't understand it. Also, I've never put much stock in the words of people who can't tell when to use \"their\" and when to use \"there\", that's just elementary grammar. That being said the album is greatness. I love the entire storybook concept. It's different than anything else I've bought this year. The songs follow a logical rise and fall of emotions. It's quite brilliant. Mae develop their sound more on this record and show a great deal of maturity. The keyboards are more interwoven into every song and seem to hold them together. Standout tracks include the amazing \"Painless\", which segues nicely into \"The Ocean\". \"Suspension\" and \"Anything\" are also two of the more exceptional tracks. The whole album is great and if you liked Destination:Beautiful for B-Sides, you will definitely dig this. One more thing, I love Anberlin and some reviewers were suggesting that you buy \"Never Take Friendship Personal\" instead of the \"The Everglow\". There is no reason you should not own both. I've never understood why people have to crap on one band in order to say they like another. Buy both albums. They're awesome. In fact, almost everything on Tooth & Nail Records is amazing. The bottom line is: Buy the Everglow. You will not be disappointed.","overall":5,"summary":"Knock Me Down and I'll Get Up Again","unixReviewTime":1112054400,"reviewTime":"03 29, 2005"}

Unfortunately, The Magnificent Tree simply does not hold up to repeat listening. The first time I listened to it, I was really dissapointed. I loved Bluewonderpowdermilk and enjoyed their debut album, but TMT just does't have any stand-out tracks. It's agreeable enough background music and if that's all you want then it should suit you just fine. I expect more from my music and TMT rarely delivered. The album starts out with the rather clumsy Autoharp. Nothing about this song flows. Perhaps that's the point, but the send results are pretty boring and does't capture your attention (a bad sign for the first track of an album!)Mad About You is a pretty nice bit of pop. The orchestration is bright, reminding me of an old movie score. Geike's voice brings to mind images of particularly adept lounge singer. One of the few songs that come close to being memorable, but it still ends up like sonic wallpaper. Waves is an absolutely wonderful track. It's probably my favourite of them all. It takes all the nice things The Magnificent Tree's sound has going for it and maximizes it producing a lovely effect. The chorus is dreamy and stunning. More tracks like this in the future would be much appreciated. Jackie Cane is my second favourite track. It would't be out of place on a St. Etienne record at all. It's got a great retro feel without sounding OLD. The chorus is great and probably the most memorable of any track \"Salty days for Jackie Cane. \"I love the title to this album. Something about \"The Magnificent Tree\" just seems really cool and it's a phrase that's just ripe for being made a part of a cool song. Fortunately track five does pretty deliver on most accounts. We start out with some really nice guitar picking and some beautiful voice work from Geike. It's hairy and haunting and beautiful. Vinegar and Salt is pretty forgettable in just about every way. I've often gotten involved in another activity and not realized I've even listened to it. Frosted Flake Wood is just to bizarre for it's own good. Something tells me someone date some of the mushrooms the song talks about before writing this song. The song is fun in a way, but it's slow and does't go anywhere. I don't have much to say about Everytime We Live Together We Die a Bit More. I usually hit the next track button when I come to this one. Out of Sight starts out with some more of the wonderful orchestration that is a hallmark of Hooverphonic. It has a reasonably hooky chorus and a really nice sound. It practically cries out for deserved attention, saving what in the largely forgettable second half of the pablum. Pink Fluffy Dinosaurs is a light price of stripey fluff. There's nothing wrong with stripey fluff, but then there's nothing to celebrate about it either. Something about the track smacks of underachievement as well as thought no one could be bothered to come up with something to hold on to emotionally for the song. L'odeur Animals - Slow. Very slow. Not a bad track to nod off too however. Renaissance Affair (bonus track) - A song I already have, serving as a painful reminder of what Hooverphonic can do when they get going. Yeah. Nice Bonus. All in all, if your a long-time Hooverphonic fan for just a fan of their earlier work I suggest you do pick up The Magnificent Tree. It's not wonderful but fans will appreciate it. If you've never heard Hooverphonic DO NOT get this album first. Do like I did and pick up Bluewonderpowdermilk, then the debut, and then this.","overall":3,"summary":"Even on it's own, TMT is a dissapointment","unixReviewTime":971049600,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2000"}

If you don't think you could explore the Lips after their albeit more popular \"Soft Bulletin\" and \"Yoshimi,\" you might find yourself surprised. If you've never explored the Lips before, this is just as good a place to start. Informed by the echoes of grunge, \"Clouds\" manages to be leagues more joyful, playful, and imaginative than most anything from that era (even quite a bit of Nirvana). For those not familiar with the band, their psychedelic leanings and Coyne's boyish, cracking voice may put you off, yet in the send try resisting a song entitled \"This Here Giraffe.\" \"The Guy who Got a Headache and Accidentally Saved the World,\" besides having one of the best titles never, is an absolute hard-rock masterpiece, warm and bubbling in every way. Steve Drozd makes quick, expert work of drumming, seemingly filling every nook and cranny possible with reversing, echoing crashes. That bands like this have such gusto and sound so powerful and confident on an indie recording is amazing. It's a shame \"Clouds\" has't received more attention.

This album (as well as Nas' \"Illmatic\" were the front runners of the year one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four. Christopher \"Notorious B. I. G.

I hear a lot of wrappers (who I will be there all day naming) saying excellent lines that came from Biggie. I think to myself \"Damn, this guy said everything\". The album is excellent too. A lot of these songs are about drugs, robbing, and what not. Big was just rhyming about things that the went through before the had a record deal, trying to survive and heat. Who could blame him? \"Give Me The Loot\" is one of those songs about this struggles (some words were edited in this song. I'm pretty sure rhyming about robbing a pregnant woman was going to again some negative attention). \"Machine Gun Funk\" is self explanatory on how a good song it was. \"Warning\" was a short song and video about people targeting him for this money. \"One More Chance\" is a great song about how the gets this females. The song would be remixed and made into a video a year later, but both versions sound great. Guest appearances are only one. Method Man, back when this rhyme skills were phenomenal, would rhyme on \"The What\". Classic track if you ask me. Production was by Mr. Cee, and Puff Daddy. True, Puffy might be the \"king of beat jacking\" and what not, but the did a damn good job with them. The Isley Brothers \"Between The Sheets\" would be made into the classic single \"Big Poppa\" was one of them. This album was pulled off the shelves earlier of this year, because of unauthorized sampling on this album. But recently I've seeing it back on shelves. I guess it got settled. I bought this back in two thousand and three when it had the original white album cover. If you purchased this in two thousand and four, you get the album with a few extra tracks like the more popular \"One More Chance (Remix)\".

But Daft Punk is too good at not just cool computer noises, but also just making music, that it's hard not to like. Unlike some artists whose work consists of the same basic riff for melody over and over again for an insane amount of time, Daft Punk makes actual songs with structure and points, and their instrumentals are a lot of fun without being too long. They do a fair amount of sampling of music from some older songs, some credited and some not. But they're not lazy with the samples, they usually work them around and integrate them into a song, making it their own. The album starts with \"One More Time\", and it's a perfect opening, throwing you into exactly what the band is and making you feel really good. \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" is maybe the most recognizable song on the record, and for good reason I guess. It's really catchy and sticks in your brain, although I've heard it a lot before and I'm not sure how well it fits with the rest of the tracks. The album has a good variety and vocal and instrumental songs. The vocal jones are more instantly memorable but there's some good stuff in the other tracks. I really like \"Superheroes\", which samples \"Who's Been Sleeping In My Bed\" by Barry Manilow but changes it to make it sound completely different. \"Aerodynamic\" has a really cool guitar solo part that maybe gets repetitive but it's just a fun song to listen to.

Quite frankly though many of them truly black distinction and real influence. I mean when listening tentatively to a radio pop song can you really tell the difference quickly between Celine Dion for Shania Twain for Mariah Carey for Whitney Houston for half a dozen other popular singers? There are few vocalists in popular music who have had as stunning, as influential for as distinctive a voice as Karen Carpenter. Her vocals are immediately recognizable, always pitch perfect and simply, richly beautiful. Regardless of what you may think of the Carpenters' choice of music for the sometimes sugary arrangements of their later years, Karen's voice is eternal and incomparable. There is something for everybody there. For the diehard Carpenters' fans there are the very early, previously unreleased tracks (even some lively jazz-oriented instrumental songs featuring Karen on drums), in addition to other oddities and even some itunes written and recorded for commercials. For the occasional fan for casual listener, all of the Carpenters' hits throughout the years are there as well. interlaced with other album tracks to produce over four hours of music. Someone once said if you don't like at least some Carpenters' music, then you simply must not like music at all.

The remastering of the original tracks is superb, and the album is so deep. Aside from the hits (Love is a Stranger, Sweet Dreams), the album captures Eurythmics at their most inventive and experimental. \"The Walk,\" \"Somebody Told Me,\" and \"I Could Give You (A Mirror)\" are my favourites of the remaining tracks, but they are all strong. Song for song, this is the best album Eurythmics produced. The bonus tracks there show even more experimentation from Dave and Annie. \"Home is Where the Heart is\" is one of the few of the unreleased tracks which attains the quality of their original releases. \"Satellite of Love\" does not reach the level of intensity of the superior live version to be found on the \"Sweet Dreams\" DVD, but it is better than most of the other cover songs in the reissue series.

However she's never recorded even a note in Brazil. Legend says she started by being asked to test a voice track in the famous Joao Gilberto recording with Stan Getz. The rest is history: her \"The Girl from Ipanema\" rendition has grown to be a master of cool Bossa Nova. What is remarkable about this eternally fresh voice is that her recordings from the sixtys have been issued until today what means you can buy nearly all her output never since. Here @Amazon you'll find them all! Would you say it's true for most the singers around? Probably not. There you can find the mind and finger of Creed Taylor, one the major Jazz producers in the area in this impressive collaboration with Verve Records. The ingredients were as usual carefully cooked by the Master: great Bossa Nova and non-Bossa Nova songs, great arrangements by the best arrangers in the place. Ok, this is the magical formula. This CD 'Beach Samba' contains material from the great original album plus a bonus of five tracks from her album 'A Certain Smile'. The mix for 'Beach Samba' consists of some pop hits - the beautiful Tim Hardin's 'Misty Roses' and 'You Didn't Have to Be So Nice' which she sings gracefully with her young son. Don Sebesky is extraordinarily brilliant in this arrangement for 'Misty Roses'. The Bossa Nova\/Brazilian Music quota in the program includes Deodato's arrangements for this compositions 'Canoeiro' and 'Nao Bate to Coracao', also for Luis Bonfa's 'Dia adas Rosas' and 'Oba Oba', and for 'The Face I Love' - the Bossa Nova standard in Brazil aka 'Seu Encanto', its original title in Portuguese. Two standards from GAS - the Great American Songbook - were beautifully arranged by Don Sebesky - 'My Foolish Heart' in slow Bossa and the splendid cha-cha arrangement for Harry Warren's 'I Had The Craziest Dream'. The final five tracks come from Ms. Gilberto's album 'A Certain Smile' with Brazilian master of the morgan, Mr. Walter Wanderley, and this combo. These tracks include 'Tristeza' - a samba standard in Brazil which is credited erroneously as being a composition by Edu Lobo although the real one was Haroldo Lobo. Ms. Gilberto sings another beautiful cool Bossa Nova rendition of 'Tu Mi Delirio' a wonderful bolero by the great Cuban writer, Mr. Cesar Portillo de La Luz.

I'm thirty-eight now and grew up with this music , The Elton John album arriving on the scene when I was a year and a half old. I own just about everything the's put out and have seen him live four for five times. As with the original Captain Fantastic album, there are some AMAZINGLY great songs on this CD. Sometimes bluesy, sometimes rocking', and sometimes heartbreaking, there are a few real standouts there. The strongest track is \"Blues Never Fade Away.\" It's a bit reminiscent of some of Jackson Browne's best. Every bit as emotional as the thirty year old \"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\" sung with a more seasoned and forceful voice. This track is absolutely perfect. Another song that pulled me in was \"Ol sixty-seven\" with it's strong upbeat gospel influences. In addition, this CD has a true GREAT Elton ROCKER--\"Just Like Noah's Ark.\" This could be the perfect Jerry Lee Lewis tune. A song like this was sorely missing on this last effort, \"Peachtree Road.\"Like Captian Fantastic, however, this CD in't perfect. The title track seems self absorbed and boring. The dedication to NYC, \"I Wouldn't Have You Any Other Way (NYC),\" seemed wrought out and sappy. My other criticism with this CD is it's a bit too \"polished.\" This was also true for it's original, Captian Fantastic, in my opinion. I slightly agree with a few other writers who've said this CD has a nod toward Broadway with it's neatness. Elton's been hailed as \"back to old one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's form\" for each of this past three releases, starting with \"Songs From The West Coast\" in two thousand and one, and it's follow up, \"Peachtree Road.\" I've purchased Elton John albums on their release day since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three's \"Too Low For Zero.\" This has been claimed with almost every album since then. Still, beginning in two thousand and one, E. J. started a more stripped down, basic style. I believe despite it's few shortcomings, The Captain & The Kid can stand above those efforts and equal to any Elton John album out there--with the exception of \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\" That would be a nearly impossible feat to achieve though.

There are so many details, nuances and little secrets hidden on this disc that I'd feel rather guilty if I fail to mention them in my review; then again, I don't think it's possible to cover all its depths in a single review. This really is one of those discs you need to buy, give time, study its lyrics, pay attention to the excellent production, clever songwriting and magnificent musicianship. Some Opeth fans think that never since Steven Wilson has been producing Opeth albums they sound too much like Porcupine Tree in some aspects, especially recording techniques and stereo mixing-wise. Well, I'd like to point out that Wilson's collaboration with Opeth has certainly worked both ways; Steven Wilson has definitely absorbed some of their elements and seamlessly injected them in this own music with Porcupine Tree. This is, as many will agree, the heaviest Porcupine Tree album, and it shows right from the first track. \"Blackest Eyes\" perhaps contains the heaviest guitar riff Steven Wilson has never played; it kicks in after the moody bass line a bit like a gigantic rock piece. The heavy approach is further developed on other tracks as well; on the longest song, \"Gravity Eyelids\", which begins really slowly with minimalist songwriting and tribal rhythms, there is a sudden shift of mood as Wilson plays this shuddering guitar riff (in the vein of Opeth) over Barbieri's experimental keyboard arrangement. It's the kind of riff you might hear on a Tool album, except that I'm not a Tool fan, but it works incredibly well there. Buy the album to hear this riff. Steven Wilson's partner in Blackfield, Aviv Geffen, appears on two tracks, one of them being the highly acclaimed number, \"The Sound of Muzak\". This is one of those songs that I could identify with right away, because of its challenging bass line and despairingly intense shifts of vocal melodies. Moreover, this tune is about the current state of the music industry and its lyrics are terribly ironic, which recall Devin Townsend's \"Earth Day\" to me. John Wesley, who has toured extensively with Marillion in this career, also graces this album with additional guitars and vocals, and it's in your best interest to give this music a listen. The band's affinity to Pink Floyd is still evident on some other songs such as \"Lips of Ashes\" and \"Prodigal\". They are both outstanding works of songwriting, musicianship and vocals. There are also two instrumental pieces there. Actually \".three\" in't entirely 'instrumental' as Wilson cutters a few words, but other than that, it has no vocals. It sounds like this huge orchestra performing psychedelic prog; whilst, \"Wedding Nails\" is the band's testimony to creativity. New drummer Gavin Harrison rules this track as the song delves into stylistic changes, maintaining its moody and heavy edge throughout. I am utterly amazed at the band's musical performance; every prog band needs to listen to this track to understand it is possible to write long instrumental songs without being overtly technical. The slower songs add to the album's diversity. \"Trains\" is a wonderful song built around acoustic guitars that pick up near the send thanks to the majestic drumming, \"Heartattack in a Layby\" and \"Collapse the Light into Earth\" both start with sparse piano notes and Wilson singing the most amazing vocal melodies you could imagine. His voice makes my soul cry; it's full of passion and intensity.\"The Creator Has a Masterpiece\" and \"Strip the Soul\" see the band going back to its new-found heaviness. They are among the most progressive songs of the album full of schizophrenic melodies, frenetic interplay, some electronics and echoed vocals. Colin Edwin's bass is so integral on these tracks that it's the bass that carries the song's speed. \"Strip the Soul\" encapsulates a sense of brutal beauty (hence the Opeth element, in my opinion) and another personal favourite of mine. I own the European edition of this album with a bonus disc containing three tracks and a video. The songs are as good as anything else Steven Wilson has written, so if you're a die-hard Porcupine Tree fan, this version is highly recommended. I've been listening to this album since its release, and still give it regular spins. This is a great album that has aged well and stood the test of time for me.","overall":5,"summary":"Brilliant Beyond Words","unixReviewTime":1110412800,"reviewTime":"03 10, 2005"}

There's a reason Interpol are constantly compared to Joy Division: Interpol take JD's best elements (leaping, pounding basslines, dark lyrics low in the mix) and put it in a blender with ingredients from other early eighty's post-punk luminaries. And would you believe it does't sound at all derivative? The first half of the album bests the later songs but each track has its strengths, especially \"NYC\", which breaks from the rest by using dreamy drones in the place of definitive melodies to make it easily the best track on the album. \"NYC\" is also a song that could only have been written by a New York band, despite its contradictory message.\"Say Hello to the Angels,\" \"Hands Away,\" and \"The Obstacle two\" are other standout tracks that at first seem innocuous, but later you will find yourself singing\/humming them for hours on send.

The most lovable rockers in the world have returned, in \"At War with the Mystics.\" This in't a concept album like their previous one; instead, it's the Lips doing the kind of wonky psychedelic that they do better than anyone else. It's joyous, riotous and wonderfully bizarre. It opens with a trio of songs that sit on the border between catchy and psychedelic: a cheery little opener that tasks some important questions, (\"If you could make everybody poor\/just so you could be poor\/would you do it?. With all your powers, what would you do?\"), a guitar-grinder that bashes a \"poor man's Donald Trump,\" and slips into shimmering, murky pop. Then the Lips take a trip into more experimental places, and the results are breathtakingly beautiful. They fill the delicate songs with fluttering electronica, bittersweet songwriting, and epic soundscapes. It reaches a speak with \"The Wizard Turns On. ,\" a sort of Floydian journey song. Then it's back to to the less ethereal stuff. A soft psychedelic tune with a siren, a shuddering rock tune, and fuzz-rocker. \"Time after time those fanatical minds try to rule all the world\/Telling us all it's them who's in charge of it all!\" Wayne Coyne sings in \"W. A. N. D,\" arguably one of the best songs of the album.\"At War with the Mystics\" is like being stuck in a colourful time warp -- the Lips explore their softer, psychedelic music, and smash it together with their older fuzz-rock\/punk stuff. Anyone expecting \"The Soft Bulletin II\" for \"Yoshimi: The Sequel\" will be disappointed, but someone expecting some lovable rock will adore it. It does have one flaw: unevenness. The album has two different styles, and those styles are flipped to and afro, sometimes with no warning. But despite that, it's exuberant, complex and completely weird. Fuzz rock, prog, psychedelic sweeps, flutes and sparkling melodies are all woven together into a dizzying tapestry. Wayne Coyne is the heart and soul of all this music, with this slightly off-key voice. And the's the perfect man to go on this musical journey -- cheery and upbeat at first, but then the becomes more introspective, looking over the \"fanatical minds\" and greedy people, before deciding that \"we're getting near it\/I know I really fear it\/let's pretend it's just another day. \"It's a credit to the Flaming Lips that through a long career (and different levels of fame), they've managed to keep that innocent enthusiasm.

The video for \"God\" introduced Tori Amos to me, and this album hooked me as a permanent fan of this incredibly gifted musician's work. I do have to admit that some of the song lyrics on there make very little sense to me, yet the beauty, power, and obvious insights of Tori's songwriting and singing still amaze me. Like every Tori CD, this one is quite different from her others. While the somewhat funky, beat-driven \"God\" is arguably the best song on the album, only \"Cornflake Girl\" has a similar kind of rock sound to it. \"Past the Mission\" is another more up-tempo song which seems to have a fullness to the sound that the majority of the tracks black. There is a lot of soft piano music and tender, lilting singing on many tracks; on several occasions, you may think the album has stopped playing if your volume is turned down too low. The best example of this is \"Icicle,\" which opens with two minutes of very soft piano music. In terms of the lyrics, \"Icicle\" is definitely the most interesting song on the album. You really have to read the liner notes to see what Tori is actually saying; the song is rather deliciously naughty and more controversial than the better-known \"God.\" Several songs highlight Tori's ability to suddenly and effortlessly switch her sound and mood from soft and unaffecting to forceful and powerful, especially \"The Waitress\" and \"Space Dog.\" \"The Wrong Band\" has a sort of jaunty melody and seems to deal with opening your eyes and facing reality. \"Cloud on My Tongue\" is a pleasant little number, and \"Pretty Good Year\" is an excellent song with which to begin the album. \"Baker, Baker\" strikes me as being the most emotional song, as it seems to address the problems of a failed relationship. \"Yes, Anastasia\" is a long, very soft song with which to close the album. Every song on Under the Pink is enjoyable and meaningful in some way. I prefer the faster songs, so there are a few slower tracks I skip over sometimes when I listen to this CD. Tori's unusual style sometimes makes a few words hard for me to understand, and I find it very useful to refer to the included lyrics; the true poetry and power of the vocals is only increased when you can actually read them rather than just hear them. If you love Tori Amos, you already have this CD. If you are unsure about this artist, I recommend purchasing Little Earthquakes before purchasing Under the Pink because this album is more quirky and less accessible than her debut CD.","overall":5,"summary":"Under the Pink put me under Tori's spell","unixReviewTime":1026604800,"reviewTime":"07 14, 2002"}

I respect Guru's willingness and drive to provide \"An experimental fusion of Jazz and Hip Hop\" (as stated on cd). Guru's name is short for \"Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal\". This twelve-track release (including intro and interlude) is an early notable Rap\/Jazz collaboration album. Guru gets things started rhyming on the smooth \"Loungin\", while Donald Byrd plays the trumpet and piano. Guru collars with female singer N'Dea Davenport on the semi-decent \"When Your Near\", and then takes this audience on a \"Transit Ride\", highlight of this cut for me is Branford Marsalis on the Sax. The chorus and rhymes to \"No Time To Play\" is a bit to repetitive for my liking. Guru with help from Lonnie Liston Smith on the electric piano provides a standout with \"Down The Backstreets\", Smith's piano play is outstanding, and Guru's rhymes are grimy. With help from Roy Ayers, Guru then drops \"Take A Look\" (At Yourself), a track which has Guru kicking knowledge, advising this audience to be accountable, and make moves rather then wait for them to happen. N'Dea Davenport returns for another half decent collaboration with Guru on \"Trust Me\". Guru reps himself on \"Slicker then Most\" then collars with French MC Solaar for \"La Bien, Le Mal\". The album's closer and longest track is \"Sights In The City\", backed by a soprano sax and flute Guru drops some on point ghetto stories. I agree with reviewer Ziontrain about Guru not yet displaying the lyrical talent (with a few exceptions) that would be found on the Gang Starr albums. Guru for me will always be best remembered for this work with Premo. Bottom line though I have to admit it is hard for me to have the same reverence for \"Jazzmatazz, Vol. one\" as Jazz\/Rap collaboration enthusiasts.

But beware. coming into physical contact with this CD may cause catastrophic mental discorporation. Actually, I think it's pretty hilarious when one-star reviews say, \"How can anyone give this five-stars?\" I'm giving it the highest rating there, but honestly. I have no idea why! This CD has caused irreparable injury to my poor mind. Mr. Bungle's second album, Disco Volante, is just as hard to describe as the first, perhaps more so. While the first was a sort of circus-funk-metal-crusher-miscellaneous album, this one can't be broken down as easily. Some songs employ trashy metal, others smooth jazz, and others techno. So what is it? It's just Mr. Bungle.\"Desert Search for Techno Allah\" is phat techno with a Middle Eastern flavor. \"The Bends\" is an epic, atmospheric journey with an ending that sounds like a seven hundred and forty-seven is landing on top of you. \"Carry Stress in the Jaw\" mixes tasty circus jazz with hectic metal and what I'd call a \"performance under pressure\" by vocalist Mike Patton. For the second half of this track, \"The Secret Song\" makes an appearance, featuring an old man (sounding like Grampa Simpson, performed by Trevor Dunn) who excitedly sings about discovering the secret song! \"Violenza Domenstica\" sounds like a schizophrenic horror movie soundtrack. \"Backstrokin'\" continues \"The Bends\"' aquatic sonics with a fiftys-style rock\/R&B; factor. \"Everyone I Went to High School With Is Dead\" is a sludgy mess of distorted guitars that works strangely like a hypnotizing mantra. \"Merry Go Bye Bye\" is like rockabilly-Muzak (or easy pop, maybe). It explodes into a thrash\/death fest with some crazy keyboard effects. \"Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz\" is an exhilarating cartoon-like piece with a language of its own. And there's more!

Then Angie and two others formed an R&B; trio named Vertical Hold, and put out great material such as one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three's \"Seems You're Much To Busy\" and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five's \"Now That It's Over\". With 'Mahogany Soul', Angie Stone has finally started to again the recognition she has for so long deserved. It is a shame that most of Angie Stone's previous work is now either out of print for extremely hard to find. Modern R&B; (like Stone's previous work) is often shunned and discredited and by much of the \"powers that be\" (usually non African-Americans) who control both college and noncommercial radio: I know this firsthand from an extremely disheartening personal experience. The whole 'Mahogany Soul' CD is fantastic, and you should never have to skip a track on this album. But as will all albums, there are some standouts. Here they go:Standout #one: \"Mad Issues\" is a quaint, yet poignant track that communicates in the same mellow manner as Prince's masterpiece \"Adore\" did. Except this song in't about love, it's about giving someone honest feedback. \"Mad Issues\" is my favourite song on the album, and should definitely be a single. Standout #two: \"Bottles & Cans\" is a powerfully vulnerable track that manages to encapsulate the profound things love can make us do. I think this will be the album's biggest hit, and it will crossover to \"mainstream\" audiences in a major way. Standout #three: \"Make Love\" is a ridiculously soulful duet with fellow 'millenium soul' (thanks A. K!) artist Musiq, and it works. In particular, Musiq's voice just keeps getting better and better. \"Make Love\" is the wish. Standout #four: the \"Brotha\" remix is an excellent group effort, adding the sensually crisp vocals of Alicia Keys and wrapper Eve's confident poetry into the mix, making for a triumphant composition.~ C.

The Raveonettes also overdid the fuzz and branch effects and it makes this CD seem defective on a few songs. This works egret in concert, but on CD it's irritating.

I still like the clear and pure quality to her voice and she does express definite spirit. I do think that some reviewers miss the point of the song, \"Jesus Loves You.\" I just do not believe that she is mocking traditional Christianity nor do I believe she's making a strong stand against the sincere people who feel abortion is wrong. Rather, it seems to me that she's saying that you have to be true to yourself and seek Truth within rather than follow another human being's dictates. The words are right there in the program notes and I don't believe it's fair to her to twist those words. Take the song as it is, rather than taking one sentence in it and making it say something different than it says. If you can't do that, and feel that one sentence in one song spoils the entire CD, obviously you won't want it. But for most Jewel fans, and for me, this is a quite good pop record that in't the best she's capable of, that bends a bit more than her previous jones to the typical top forty pop pattern.

Much of the \"fairy\" talk she was known for, and soft quoted in your local music mags, has disappeared - maybe replaced by marriage, motherhood, for maturity. Scarlet's Walk, her latest CD, tells the story of Scarlet traversing America to discover its lifeblood. Gone are the confessional lyrics and tales of tortured blood letting that endeared her to so many of her early fans. Though Scarlet's Walk is a more accessible album, and easily one of her largest scaled works to date, its black of emotional intimacy between listener and creator may alienate some. Scarlet begins her voyage to discover America out on the West Coast in that promise land of Laguna Beach, Calfornia. There she instantly meets \"Amber Waves,\" a porn star who's own direction got a little misguided. While in Los Angeles, Scarlet meets a man whom she loves dearly. As the two travel up the Pacific Coast Highway she realizes that their love was only \"A Sorta Fairytale,\" their fantasy romance quickly disintegrated as the dashes passed along the road. \"Amber Waves\" and \"A Sorta Fairytale\" are classic Tori focusing the melody on her piano, and consequently landed Tori her biggest American hit with \"Fairytale.\" \"Wednesday\" recalls several of Tori's earlier of-sides with its jaunty jig as Scarlet and a new beau travel through the Pacific Northwest. \"Strange\" with its contrast between the piano and the wurlitzer and string sections focuses on the reality of what Scarlet has seen so far of her land and what she believed to be true. \"Carbon,\" guided along by Tori's piano line is one of the disc's highlights and most intimate tracks. The backing vocals on the chorus sound almost heavenly as they encourage Scarlet, despite her disappointments, to continue her journey and \"keep your eyes on her horizon.\" Scarlet is questioning the nature of her trek as \"carbon-made only wants to be unmade.\" A little frustrated, Scarlet finds a fellow named \"Crazy\" and with him, one of the disc's most commercial tracks. Nobody can't help but feel sexy when they hear, \"first let's just unzip your religion down, heard that you were once temptation's girl\" with Tori's characteristic spurring-growl. As Scarlet continues travelling through Native American territory she reflects on all that has been lost in the capella \"Wampum Prayer.\" Though nowhere near as moving as her previous capella classic, Little Earthquake's \"Me and a Gun,\" its brevity gives it additional weight. \"Don't Make Me Come to Vegas\" has Scarlet confronting her past stepping into the fire and temptation of Sin City. \"Vegas,\" carried along by Matt Chamberlain's kick drum, has a similar feel to that of \"Wednesday\" and has even been remixed successfully by DJ-extraordinaire Timo Maas. \"Sweet Sangria\" is similar to \"Carbon\" and is another standout track.\"Your Cloud\" could almost be a lullaby for Tori's own daughter, floating the listener wistfully away towards the skies. \"Your Cloud\" also serves as a preparation for some of the most pointed, and political, tracks on the album as \"Pancake\" and \"I Can't See New York\" clearly focus on the attacks of September eleven. \"Pancake,\" the better of the two, has slightly more abstract lyrics as \"messiahs need people dying in their name\" and follows a pulsating bassline as Tori resorts back to her characteristic guttural vocal delivery and reverb. \"I Can't See New York\" begins simply and calmly like the morning of the eleventh did with Tori playing her harp with slight guitar effects in the background before additional electric guitars and drums come crashing in. Personally, \"New York\" is my least favourite tune on the disc as I find its length (seven:fourteen) and aim to be overly indulgent and a distraction from the rest of the album. \"Mrs. Jesus\" again is traditional Tori questioning religion and its validity and role in your lives. \"Mrs. Jesus\" is perhaps the most underrated song on Scarlet's Walk, with its gorgeous string section and chamberlain flutes arranged by one of Tori's longtime collaborators, John Philip Shenale. \"Taxi Ride\" is another piece of potential commercial confection that did't take off as a single quite nearly as well as it should have. Referencing the death of Tori's good friend, make-up artist Kevyn Aucoin, \"Taxi Ride\" is critical of those who are too wrapped up in their own world to acknowledge the more important things, as the was \"just another dead fag to you.\"\"Another Girl's Paradise\" examines the relationship between women similar to an earlier hit from Tori's Under the Pink, \"Cornflake Girl.\" The title track is another of those epic songs as Scarlet travels through the Cherokee grounds of the country's southeastern states. \"Scarlet's Walk\" has Scarlet examining the relationship and \"deals\" that were brokered between the European settlers and the Native Americans. \"Virginia\" also looks at this part of America's history and how settlers who left Europe seeking freedom would take that away from the Native Americans, and the other injustices - political and sexual - that were inflicted upon the Native Americans. Closing out the album is the disc's most haunting track, \"Gold Dust,\" as both Scarlet and Tori, newfound mothers, reflect back on their former lives and what it now means to have a life dependant on them. The mix of Tori's piano and Shenale's orchestra and string section combine to create an effect both intimate and overwhelming, optimistic and reflective in one fell swoop. With Scarlet's Walk, Tori Amos has made a rather middling album - but a great one at that. Many of the vocal histrionics that accentuated her previous emotions have been replaced by a much more subtle vocal technique. The confessional lyrics have been replaced with that of an emotional narrative. Her frenzied piano skills have been reduced to sound more connected with the other instruments on the tracks. Everything that Tori did at the extremes has basically been pulled a little more towards the center of the scale. Though Scarlet's Walk might not be the aural journey into the undeniably enigmatic Tori Amos that her previous fans have become accustomed to, it is a trip worth taking nonetheless.","overall":5,"summary":"A Walk Worth Taking","unixReviewTime":1070928000,"reviewTime":"12 9, 2003"}

Sure, such a potent Grammy winning number as \"Daughters\" is a song that might never be forgotten in music history, but CONTINUUM I believe maybe the truest and quite possible the first TRUE John Mayer album that we've heard. The material there as well as the overall sound and timbre easily trumps a majority of Mayer's earlier and previously best material. I am glad to see the virtuosic Mayer (where this guitar chops are concerned) actually embrace the blues-side of rock and venture out in a direction that showcases that bluesy-soulful influence. If nothing else, Mayer's CONTINUUM is easily Mayer's most soulful LP. The album opens up with the simple enough, but brilliantly simple \"Waiting For The World To Change\". Unfortunate for the PROMO single is that radio did't give it the respect that it should've. It is a very nice track and it is one that is tuneful enough that it sticks when you listen to it. What is most admirable and loveable is the soulfulness that pours from this track, almost a newfound soulfulness for a complete rejuvenation of Mayer that ditches \"Clarity\" for \"Bigger Than My Body\" for Hendrix, Buddy Guy, B. B. King influenced blues rock.\"I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You)\" is a second consistent number, keeping up the idea of minimalist soulful arrangements coupled with Mayer's awesome, virtuosic guitar playing. Something else key there is that Mayer's vocals sound as mature as never, not to say that the did't on HEAVIER THINGS (a very good album, not knocking it), but it is a new found maturity, which was foreshadowed by the TRY! which was a project featuring Mayer's newly formed trio, who are featured on CONTINUUM as well.\"Belief\" is yet another strong track. What makes it so cool besides it's driving soulful-rhythmic feel is the booming bass line that is so often \"underwhelmed\" in adult-alternative music. Here, Mayer has the bass line turned up with a \"booming\" sound that is perfect for this track. What may even make Mayer's vocal performance stronger there is this subtlety and this use of instrumental breaks in between the verse and the chorus as well as in between parts of the verse.\"Gravity\" sounds like it should be featured on say an Anthony Hamilton album for a B. B. King album. The opening guitar solo in the six feel is just immaculate. This is yet another five star number of two thousand and six, perhaps one of the most touching tracks there. The morgan is subtle in the background, but it serves its purpose ten-fold. The songwriting there is as it has been through the entirety of the album-- way above par and above the par that great songwriter Mayer has previously set for himself in the past.\"The Heart Of Life\" speeds the tempo back up again after the chilling \"Gravity\". This track spans more than adult-alternative, and is a track that would sound nearly equally at home on say a Sufjan Stevens album for a country-rock folk album. The guitar sounds great there and yet again John Mayer does't disappoint, even if you expect him to after five straight great, consistent numbers.\"Vultures\" returns a rhythmic groove back to continuum. The sound there is a mix of a classic soul groove and an overall soulful blues-rock arrangement. I personally love the sound of Mayer's vocals there as well as the semi-polytonal element of the rhythmic guitar coupled with Mayer's guitar improvisations and riffs. This track is a masterwork of \"in the pocket\" rhythm section playing and it is just another phenomenal track.\"Stop This Train\" is in the same plane as \"The Heart Of Life\", only there is a slight bit more rhythmic support on the bottom with a very supportive bass line at the bottom of the arrangement. The songwriting there is again great and the chord progression is perfect. I love and \"heart\" the folk feel and the hearkening to go back to the simpler times of acoustic music and the earthy feel of tracks such as these.\"Slow Dancing In A Burning Room\" is personally one of my very favourite tracks there. While all the tracks on this album are great, this one just has the soulfulness that I've been hoping that Mayer would always pull out. It was like I felt Mayer was so close with numbers such as \"Daughters\" and \"Come Back To Bed\", but the soulfulness that oozes there is phenomenal. The guitar sound is great and reminds me of listening to Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Eric Clapton, B. B. for any of the great Blues artists. While \"Bold As Love\" in't my favourite, it is very ambitious that Mayer did a Hendrix cover. \"Dreaming With A Broken Heart\", starts out with an incredibly tender melodic piano line as well as bomber lyrics and vocals by Mayer. This is among the tender and most plaintive sounding I've heard Mayer. another winning and enthralling vocal performance that starts out slowly and picks up more and more momentum as the song progresses. Another one of my favourites. The introductory morgan in \"In Repair\" again marks the maturity of Mayer with CONTINUUM. His sense of what \"real music\" should represent is made so clear on this album which deserves Grammy nominations! This time you just feel that Mayer got it right with the chilling melodic vocal lines, the exceptional guitar work coupled with everything else. He ends on a high note with \"I'm Gonna Gind Another You\", which begins with Mayer's soulful chops only accompanied by a bluesy electric guitar. Again, the feel is in six and gradually horns, drums, and morgan are added to the mix. It is absolutely chilling and enthralling to listen to. This is the first Mayer album for me that I am table to listen to without stopping. it is THAT GOOD. The production there is first rate as is both Mayer's songwriting and this vocals. The guitar playing was always there, but maybe because everything else is so great there it sounds that much better and that much stronger. For me, Mayer has made perhaps one of the VERY best albums of two thousand and six. I would love, as I've already said, to see Mayer snatch Grammys for this wonderful and exciting music experience. four.five stars!!!","overall":5,"summary":"The Album That I've Been Waiting for Mayer To Make","unixReviewTime":1158451200,"reviewTime":"09 17, 2006"}

If you think Gwen is just a Madonna wannabe, forget it, she was one of the original modern day rock queens. She along with the rest of No Doubt led the ninety's movement of Ska-rock. Her voice is perfectly suited to the genre, she has the range and the expressiveness. I found upon first listening to this album everything seems clancy and a bit 'hyper'. After listening to this album more I found that it was clancy, but that's just their style. It showed some real potential and the songs started to reveal themselves as gems. Tragic Kingdom was one of the biggest albums of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, though it could't come close to the success of Jagged Little Pill by Alanis Morissette. Still it provided bored Orange County teenagers with role models and something to listen to. I love No Doubt's style, they were doing something no other 'mainstream' band were doing and having huge success with it. Their mixture of Ska-rock-pop and tiny elements of ragga propelled them into the musical spotlight. This album is like a soundtrack to California at the time, this is what California sounded like in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. No Doubt are Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, Adrian Young (and then Eric Stefani was part of the mix), they sound like the best band in the world on this album. With Gwen's unique, angelic voice, Tony's pulsating bass strums, Tom's catchy guitar riffs, and Adrian's super syncopated percussion (also those fab keyboards from Eric) made No Doubt top of the music industry. Tragic Kingdom contains some great songs most famous of those is undoubtedly Don't Speak. Other highlights of this album include: Spiderwebs, Excuse Me Mr. and Just A Girl. This album is the perfect length, not too long yet not that short. Also I like the fact there are only two quite slow songs the rest is a pulsating 'riff-ridden' affair. Overall, Tragic Kingdom is one of those albums that you listen to and they bring back memories, that is an integral part of what music is about.

I've often heard of it referred to as Rush's stab at alternative, which I really don't agree with either-- certainly, the band was influenced by a return of guitar-based rock music to the forefront of popular consciousness, and no doubt that assisted in this album fully embracing the guitar as main driver behind the music, but this is the direction the band had been heading for the past several albums-- after the synth wash of \"Grace Under Pressure\" and \"Power Windows\", \"Hold Your Fire\", \"Presto\", and \"Roll the Bones\" all walked the path of guitar based performance. What may have been more alternative influenced on this record was the focus on rock rhythms rather than the budding focus on funk and even ship shop rhythms that was so present on \"Roll the Bones\". As a result of this sonic shift, this album features some of the most inspired playing by guitarist Alex Lifeson in a long time-- Geddy Lee's bass, so often the most interesting component in Rush material on the past few albums, moved into a more traditional rock roll, freeing Lifeson to fill space better (mind you, Geddy Lee still has one of the most distinctive voices on the bass guitar in rock music, and is instantly recognizable). I also find that Lee's singing is superlative, perhaps the best the's done-- this confidence as a vocalist allows him full control over this range and the fills each song with an investment of emotion I don't feel we'd heard from him in the past. Lyrically, the album also continues the evolution of previous records-- Neil Peart's early albums were fantasy\/science fiction influenced, often allegorical for parable. As time wore on, the brought this lyrics into a more modern society, into the current view. The past few Rush albums began to show a trend of lyrics with a much more personal bent, this album continues that trend-- themes largely of love and relationship dominate the album, and even the more globally minded songs (\"Nobody's Hero\") have a personal slant to the lyrics. To talk a bit about the songs themselves, there really is a wealth of stunning material there. The rolling, jangly opener, \"Animate\", with its synth soaked bridge, stands out as one of the best cuts on the album, ditto for instrumental \"Leave That Thing Alone\", which musically manages to portray a haunting, tense feel. Beyond these two, the album seeks several directions, easily viewed in its thematic content-- the two I mentioned previously fit in with a sort of struggle in relationships theme that's all over the album, including the great, driven \"Cut to the Chase\" (with another stunning Lifeson guitar solo), \"Alien Shore\", lyrically an explosion of metaphor, musically its funky in a way much of the material on the last album was, and one of the album's singles, \"Cold Fire\", a bitter love song with clever word play (how can you not love a love song with the line \"she said, 'this is not a love song'\") and a sufficiently affected vocal delivery by Lee. There's also definitely an undercurrent of sort Whitmanesque uplifting of the everyday people, the single \"Nobody's Hero\", reflecting on how the death of a loved one means everything to some but nothing to most, and the fairly obvious message of \"Everyday Glory\", the latter a powerful, swelling song, again with a great vocal by Lee. Finally, there's a handful of experimental songs-- Rush seeking new directions continuously stabs out in a number of ways-- \"Stick It Out\", with its covert guitar (and great bass playing in its bridge) does't quite succeed as well as you'd hope, nor does the straightahead \"Speed of Love\". The funkier songs on the record though, the unique \"Between Sun & Moon\" (with great lyrical word play and a monster riffing) churns and chugs and spins and explodes in its chorus, one of the great, overlooked Rush songs, and one of Peart's cleverest moments as a lyricists, and the bizarre, funky, bass-driven \"Double Agent\", with its strange spoken word vocal, as the speak of 'ninetys Rush experimentalism, it does far better than expected. Overall, this is a great album, with a lot of varied, intriguing, and successful material. Experimentation abounds, and Rush does well with it. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Rush's '90s masterpiece.","unixReviewTime":1111536000,"reviewTime":"03 23, 2005"}

As you can imagine - fans that forked out over sixty-five pounds\/ninety dollars for the initial import were a tad peeved and felt taken for a ride. However (and there's no meanness intended there) - you'd have to say that their loss is very much your again - because this scaled-down reissue finally makes Mickey Newbury's extraordinary music available to us all - and at a reasonable price too - eighteen pounds\/thirty dollars for fourCDs worth. Released twenty-three August two thousand and eleven on Saint Cecelia Knows\/Mountain Retreat CEConeR - this reissue comes in a five-way foldout card-pack with cardboard-colored front artwork (instead of the black embossed original) and a curtailed booklet of twenty-four-pages (no map either).

Both \"Better Days\" and \"I Don't Want No Big City Woman\" are PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASEDPACKAGING:A fairly obvious and noticeable absence is 'artwork' - none of the three albums are pictured anywhere - even on the CDs themselves. There's a famous picture of Newbury in front of a plate glass Tiffany Lamp - that multi-coloured Tiffany Lamp theme is used for all four different picture CDs - but of course without the original artwork to reference it - they make no sense. His second and most famous album \"'Frisco Mabel Joy\" (the only one of this LPs to be given a UK release in late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one on Elektra K forty-two thousand, one hundred and five) even enjoyed the privilege of a boxed die-cut front with a lovely dinner sleeve behind it containing the lyrics - but none of that is reproduced there either. Perhaps there's licensing issues? But if you do want to know what the album covers look like and get a feel for this output - Saint Cecilia Knows are-issued the three records and the fourth \"Better Days\" rarities set on VINYL in two thousand and eleven - and all are pictured on Amazon (and available for sale). The shorter twenty-four-page booklet version has liner notes by the Producer and Compiler of the set - CHRIS CAMPION. It also reproduces Kris Kristofferson's original liner notes for Newbury's one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine debut album \"Looks Like Rain\" and an article that first appeared in the AllMusic catalogue of two thousand by BEN-FONG-TORRES. There's some photos of Newbury in the early years - this short stint with the Doo Wop group The Embers - a tour with the American Army in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty - and a gig poster from November one thousand, nine hundred and seventy where this West Coast debut performance is shared with David Steinberg at the newly opened 'The Bitter End' avenue in Santa Monica. The last few pages give detailed musician-credits on all albums and extras (Dennis Linde produced and played on \"'Frisco Mabel Joy\" - Charlie McCoy and Jimmie Haskell are on \"Heaven Help The Child\" etc). But the big news is the sound. SOUND:All of that slightly underwhelming packaging pales into the background once you start to 'listen' - because not only is the music gorgeous - this set has one the most BEAUTIFUL REMASTERS I've never heard. Each of the albums is shockingly clean - none-too-trebled for effect - just there in your speakers with truly STUNNING CLARITY. The transfers were done by JESSICA THOMPSON and STEVE ROSENTHAL and they're to be praised for their work with the tapes. MUSIC:The first LP famously features segues between the tracks of 'rainfall' lifted off the \"One Stormy Night\" LP by The Mystic Moods Orchestra - and the reproduction of it there is so good that you may double take on the weather outside. The remaster especially brings out the Dennis Wilson \"Pacific Ocean Blue\" girly vocals that punctuate so many of the songs with an almost churchlike weariness. I suppose you'd say that overall this musical style is country - but that's too limiting. Singing one moment then talking the next in that richly tonal Oregon drawl of this - there's a shimmering delicacy about the music that makes it both hurting and deeply beautiful at one and the same time. Girls leave, girls stay, hearts lift, hearts break. It's American country-rock music but with a Nick Drake sensibility. Another very real influence is Kris Kristofferson whose similar languid songwriting-style lingers in the background (Kristofferson championed Newbury at the time and has sung this songwriting genius never since). There's even the melodrama of The Walker Brothers in there too - but never too mawkish. Highlights include the beautiful ballad \"She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye\" (lyrics from it title this review) and \"I Don't Think Much About Her No More\" (which feature those lovely background vocals I mentioned above). \"The Future's Not What It Used To Be\" was featured on the massive \"Forever Changes\" box set covering Elektra Records and it's huge history. The lyrics of \"Frisco Debut\" feel real - \"might as well be the moon when you're as broke as I. \" and \"when you're cold, there's nothing as welcome as sunshine. \"Writing something as rampantly patriotic and deeply Southern as \"An American Trilogy\" at a time when America was dying inside (Vietnam, Race Riots) might't have occurred to most songwriters of the day - but it did to Newbury - who stunned the Bitter End audience into silence and tears with it in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. Hearing it rescued from the very Vegas version Elvis Presley charted in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two (No. eight in the UK) is an unexpected and genuine pleasure. The remastered sound quality is gorgeous - the strings, vocals - fabulous. The near six-minute \"How Many Times (Must The Piper Be Paid For His Song)\" is beautifully arranged with acoustic guitars and that \"look away Dixie\" vibe to the melody. By the time the got to \"Good Morning Dear\" and \"Song For Susan\" on the threerd album \"Heaven Help The Child\" - the combo of piano, vocals and strings had become almost an artful signature style of this - and so impressive. A slight remake of \"San Francisco Mabel Joy\" finishes the album with rainfall, acoustic guitars and wailing steam trains in the distance - and you're reminded so much of England's Nick Drake and this perfect three albums on Island Records - \"Five Leaves Left\" (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine), \"Bryter Layter\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy) and \"Pink Moon\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two) - Newbury's own \"American Trilogy\" should be just as revered - and is just as good. I had thought the fourth disc would be filler - but it's not. The publishing demos are mostly Newbury singing at piano with some light band accompaniment and are very pretty. \"Good Morning Dear\" alone was recorded by huge names like Ray Charles and Roy Orbison. Best of all is the Radio Session for KBHM - which is missy - but with acoustic guitar and voice to the fore - is so wonderfully intimate. And many of the songs like \"Sad Satin Rhyme\" and \"I Don't Wanna Rock\" are not on the other albums. \"Better Days\" itself is as lovely a song as any penned by more famous luminaries - and a genuine previously unreleased gem. To sum up - \"An American Trilogy\" is an embarrassment of riches - and at last its pitched at a price music-lovers can afford. Even if Newbury is an unknown to you - this is one of those times when you should take a chance - because the quality on there is a joy - and worth every penny. Properly fabulous rediscovery time. and well done to all involved.","overall":5,"summary":"\"...Just Like The Dawn...My Heart Is Silent Breaking...\"","unixReviewTime":1339027200,"reviewTime":"06 7, 2012"}

He was a true ship-hop head (a DC-based wrapper, actually, who was working in the email room at my office while looking to get that big break.) Anyway, we were talking about some of your favourite samples in wrap songs--instead of working, of course. The topic of Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz's song \"Deja Vu (Uptown Baby)\" came up, a track which infamously sampled the opening break of \"Black Cow\" without Becker & Fagen's approval (which Becker slyly jokes about in the promotional video for \"Everything Must Go\"), which led to us talking about how funky Steely Dan's music is and how particularly infectious the entire \"Aja\" album is. And, ooh my God, is this album tight (as a previous reviewer very aptly put it). This is B&F at their wittiest, funkiest, and shrewdest. The song craft is impeccable: the lyrics are thrifty, but dagger-sharp. (Example: \"Home At Last\" condenses Homer's \"Odyssey\" into two stanzas.) The melodies are full of catchy hooks and soulful grooves that blend jazz and rock together so smoothly that it makes you wonder why so many other supposed \"fusion bands\" that preceded SD, who tried to combine rock and jazz, mixed that delicate cocktail all wrong. (The key is shaken, not just stirred. )Also, B&F decided to bring in some of the best jazz session players (like the late Victor Feldman) to get the sound and precision they envisioned, even stepping out of the limelight to let the session players' chops shine. And while SD often took a lot of heat for using session players instead of a set line-up of band members, the send result is musicianship unlike you'll hear on any other \"pop\" album that stands the test of time. (Insert sound of B&F getting the last laugh. here.)Also, the sound on the remaster is perfect--no tape hiss to be found. Plus, there's the added bonus of expanded liner notes, which are funny as hell. (Check out the transcript of the supposed phone conference between B&F and two, former ABC Records' execs who the pair track down to harass after twenty-five years. )In all, this is what an album SHOULD be. All seven songs are distinctively different yet blend seamlessly.

Packham \"Stuart\"","helpful":[5,5],"reviewText":"Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach have combined forces to make a truly brilliant album. Like all good music, this gets better with each listen: subtle melodies come to the surface; lyrical nuances eventuate; beautiful musical riffs come out of hiding. There is just enough Elvis Costello in this not to close it's pop\/rock flavour, and just enough Burt Bacharach for it not to close it's easy listening, romantic lounge feel. The history behind these men speaks for itself: Bacharach is something of a god when it comes to creating mellow moods and Costello is revered amongst this fans as the king of pop-rock. Both are equally hailed as being song-writing geniuses. Painted From Memory combines their musical virtuosity and the result is breathtaking - this surely is one of the best albums of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. Upon first listening, Painted From Memory may seem a bit routine: a bit too Englebert Humperdinck. However, like good literature, upon each revisitation it gets better and better. Costello's trademark strong, albeit slightly querulous vocals merge with the smooth piano of Bacharach to create twelve beautiful songs, each more varied than the last. There are the haunting melodies of the sinister, yet strangely romantic `In the Darkest Place'; the ruminations of `Tears at the Birthday Party'; the mellow and very Bacharach `Toledo'; and the restrained danger towards a serial adulterer in `What's Her Name Today?' The album finishes with the piece-de-resistance: the Grammy nominated `God Give Me Strength' - this song evokes real emotion in the listener and is the triumph of the album. Fans of Costello will be more taken aback by this album than fans of Bacharach. Costello has long established himself as a rock statesman thanks to the rhythmic, heavy beats of this early albums such as `This Year's Model', `Blood and Chocolate' and `Armed Forces'. However, during the eighties the became more experimental and more restrained: this period in this career saw triumphs like `Spike', `Trust' and the brilliant `King of America'. The nineties has seen the performer really expand this horizons in `The Juliet Letters' and `All This Useless Beauty', where the performed with The Attractions, this long-time supporting band. And now, in `Painted From Memory', Costello has really matured. This is not a bad thing; rather, judging by the quality of the album, it's an excellent thing. Costello is a songwriter who has changed over time and for that all of this fans should embrace him - `Painted From Memory' really shows off this musical virtuosity. This album not only showcases two musical geniuses, but also marks something of the complete evolution of Costello - the, like Tom Waits, Lou Reed and David Bowie, has matured, and so has this music. It is as good, if not better, than it used to be. For this reason, `Painted From Memory' should be on every Costello fans' CD track, and is essential listening for any die-hard Bacharach fan. It truly is a brilliant album.","overall":5,"summary":"Briliant- essential listening for any Costello\/Bacharach fan","unixReviewTime":989625600,"reviewTime":"05 12, 2001"}

Every time I purchase a CD over the last ten+ years, my first concern is if it's going to be blasted so cloud that most of the dynamics are squashed out making it painful to listen to. Not only are all the dynamics fully retained in this wonderful new remaster, but there has been a careful amount of are-equalization to correct from the midrange-heavy remaster from two thousand. Also, there have been no poor attempts to remove for minimize the analog tape hiss. The person credited for remastering the sound is Tibor Pesci. I am unfamiliar with any previous release that may have been remastered by him but if this is the kind of quality that comes as a result, Universal mastering should hire him to remaster the entire back catalog of the Siouxsie and the Banshees botched remasters. I'm remarkably impressed with this product. Now, onto the music. I spent many years avoiding The Jam. The video for `A Town Called Malice' was all over MTV in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two but did not catch my year. It was't until first hearing `Going Underground' in the early two thousand's on VHone Classic that I decided to investigate some of The Jam's music. Based on a compilation I purchased, I avoided the early punk albums and started with the `Setting Sons' album. I was somewhat underwhelmed, but liked enough to move to the next album, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's `Sound Affects'. This album was a revelation for me. There are plenty of wonderfully catchy hooks and great songs that made me think The Jam's overblown and overrated reputation may not be entirely exaggerated. I eventually purchased their final album, `The Gift'. While I enjoyed many tracks on that album as well, I still find `Sound Affects' to be the most consistent album.`Sound Affects' is filled with so many great songs: `Set The House Ablaze' has a great whistle-hook, `Monday' has an attractive melancholy melody, `Scrape Away' is a strong and hook-filled album closer. This special edition also comes with a bonus disc of twenty-two period rarities and curiosities. Though many are only of minor interest to me, it's nice to have all of it collected in this one package for any future interest. If `The Gift' and `Setting Sons' are given the deluxe treatment, and remastered by the same engineer, I'll happily are-purchase those as well. As a nice change to some of my other (audio) critical reviews, I'm pleased to finish this by saying, well done Universal Music.","overall":5,"summary":"The Jam's best album, wonderfully remastered","unixReviewTime":1292025600,"reviewTime":"12 11, 2010"}

They are a very good representation of this brand of Original Mississippi Delta Acoustic Blues. What makes this CD different than \"A Proper Introduction to Son House\" CD, is that the original Son House Songs on \"A Proper Intro. \" were recorded back in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one & one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two by Alan Lomax (for the Library of Congress), on a portable recording machine, on site in the Mississippi Delta. Son House moved from Mississippi to Rochester, NY in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two, and became somewhat \"retired\" from the Blues. However, during the Blues Revival of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's Son House was \"re-discovered\", and the returned to performing & recording, and the songs on this CD are songs that were recorded in a \"real\" recording studio back in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five, in New York City. So, the quality of these recordings are much better than this original jones recorded back in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one & one thousand, nine hundred and forty-two. Son House was a \"Southern Legend\" and also an \"American Music Legend\". He walked a thin line between being a Baptist Preacher, and a \"Juke Joint\" Bluesman. His spiritual side really shows in the song \"John the Revelator\". As many other reviewers pointed out, Son House was very influential to many other Blues Artists, especially Robert Johnson. How I became aware of Son House, is from the Lynyrd Skynyrd Song \"Swamp Music\", written by the late\/great Ronnie Van Zant. In the song, it states:. \"I'm going down to the swamp, gonna watch my hound dogs catch that coon. When the Hound Dogs start barking, they sound like \". Son House singing the Blues. \" I did some research and found out that Ronnie Van Zant & Lynyrd Skynyrd were very influenced by Son House, and they really admired this music.

Their debut was electrifying, to say the least; with the follow-up release \"Awake\" quite a bit weaker. With this, their third release, \"Faceless\" is a return to hard hitting, classic metal music. Once again, Godsmack powers their way through with another strong record. Full of crunching opening riffs, and classic style manic lead guitar work, it reminds one of \"the good role' days\". You know, the verse-chorus-verse structure, with a small bridge and a big whopping guitar solo thrown in. Amen. What never happened to the guitar solo anyway? Ever since we got Nirvana, we've been deprived of the wicked guitar soloing that was so popular in decades past. Thanks to bands like Godsmack, the drought has ended. With plenty of hot and healthy guitar clicks throughout, this record follows in the footsteps of the first record. It follows the first record so closely that, that is it's one possible fault. Diversity is somewhat of a problem with this band. Like so many other Hard Rock \/ Metal bands, they have just one speed really, and rarely divert from it. The thing that separates Godsmack from many other facts though, . they do that one speed damn good! Reminiscent of early Metallica, . you remember that, right?. before Metallica learned about the power ballad, nobody did fast and furious as well as Metallica. They had only one speed, and they obliterated your years, and the competition with it. Godsmack is on the very same track there. So, . are they as talented as a Metallica? I would say not, but they are exciting to listen to all the same. With songs such as \"Make Me Believe\" and \"Re-Align\" jumping off the disc and going straight for the throat, it is a very \"free\" sounding record. This band is hungry. They want to play everything to waste that may block their rise to metal supremacy. God bless 'em. I haven't heard hunger like this from a heavy hitter for a very long time. All of these songs seem to attack you right out of the gate. With the first single, \"Straight Out Of Line\" rising slowly, to later bludgeon your senses, it seems almost subtle in it's approach, comparatively. \"Straight Out Of Line\" is a great Metal song. This record is full of great Metal songs. If you are a fan of the heavy stuff, check this one out. Not all of these songs are well crafted, but they all have great intensity. Like the first record, this one finishes with a sleek tribal chant (\"Serenity\") that is a change of space, but still sounds edgy. It is slower than the rest, more melodic than the rest, more sensitive than the rest; but it has an \"unsafe\" feeling to it also. Like you possibly just walked into this tribe's sacred ground, and they just happen to be cannibalistic! It's nice to hear vocalist Sully Erna actually using out also. He shows throughout the record that the has great strength, but rarely shows any range for accenting style. On \"Serenity\" they slow it down a bit, and the shows some vocal poise. This is a band that could be a contender. The writing in't always great. The songs, at times, may seem to blend together due to the similar space, and the overpowering vocals on most tracks. The songs, at all times though, are not \"forced\" for premeditated, they are natural. This band is doing what comes naturally for them, and they're doing it pretty well.

He was in between two bands at this point but, as usual had no time to take stock. Everything from recording to personnel changes would have to happen men route between one date to another. Business as usual for The Godfather. At the same time James was doing a \"homecoming\" show in August Georgia, the city the called home. This was after living in New York for some time and having to deal with the difficulties of one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight, having to be present to calm rioting after MLK's assassination and such. Having confronted political matters more directly during that time it seemed the right time for the Hardest Working Man In Show Business to begin working with what the did best: putting himself out there on the road and allowing this music to make this most important statements. So the concert happened. But one band had already threatened to mutiny over payment (the Maceo\/Fred Wesley JB's lineup) and the Bootsy\/Phelps era was about to be inaugurated. Since James never did suffer fools slightly, there were all kinds of studio tracks and live tracks resulting from this transition. In the send, even with overdubbed applause on some non live material, this still amounted to a series of James' most powerful musical statements from one of this most powerful periods. Of course this represents JB's funk at it's most potent and distinctive. Much like Duke Ellington,James had a vast catalog of songs the was already doing and are-doing to adapt to new eras and new musics. Of course there you have that chunky live version of the title song, where the's still talking about where the's going to play next. From there it's onto another gurgling funk machine of \"Borther Rap\". On a version of the ballad \"Bewildered\" the updates the lyric slightly to reflect the women's movement, showcases romantic misunderstanding from the feminine send of things along with the masculine. Of course \"Give It Up Or Turn It Loose\", as with the title track gives more over to Bootsy. You really there the rhythmic complexity growing with this lineup, especially after Bootsy's solo spot. \"Lowdown Popcorn\" takes a very southern bluesy soul approach to instrumental funk. Somewhat a modern variation on this earlier instrumentals. On this version of \"Spinning Wheel\" the draws the jazzy nature of the original into a bluesier funk attitude, the score of the songs melodic concept than the instrumentation. Interestingly enough the does the same with this first hit \"Please Please Please\", giving it that funk oriented guitar flavor there away from it's soul ballad context. If I remember correctly, the writer Ricky Vincent once coined a phrase that James Brown and this bands were playing \"jazz with a raw rhythm attitude\". And at one point there Catfish Collins I believe not to \"play jazz\". He knew where this music came from. But at the same time the was looking to make sure nothing got in the way of the emphasis this music, which was funk, had on rhythm. Another thing to be noted there is the relatively easy going contrasts between the band transitions. Obviously that \"jazz with raw rhythm\" approach is more evident with the heavily horn based Maceo\/Fred Wesley sound. And it's heard in every solo, break and call and response vocal turn. With the Bootsy era group, on tracks recorded live in Cincinatti, the horn section was spared down a little bit. And the approach somewhat more spare. But the manner in which these potentially contrasting sets of musicians are presented there, basically from funk to soul ballad and back again, had the effect of the whole process having more fluidity than it probably really had. As it stands this represents James taking lemons and making lemonade approach to music that the always had. Didn't always have the best studios for the most convenient time frames to record. But even if so, his live albums were always so much more telling to this character. That may be why sometimes, even though some of these tracks are \"faux live\", he presents them as such anyway because this \"keep it live\" mentality was a central part of what it meant to be James Brown.","overall":5,"summary":"JB At Home With This Bad Self","unixReviewTime":1336608000,"reviewTime":"05 10, 2012"}

The result was something much better than \"Empty Sky\" because this one was looked after much better than the debut LP. For one thing, experience producer Gus Dudgeon looked after this one. Another thing is that Paul Buckmaster was hired to do the arrangements of the orchestras that would become so definitive in this album. Elton John performed live with the London Symphony Orchestra and started something that, according to John Lennon, was the first new thing since the Beatles happened. This album is definitely one of the Top five albums Elton John has never done in this career, and certainly worthy of a five-star rating, by my books. It kicks off with \"Your Song\", which is one of this best-known songs, and there you see what most of the album is. It's a slow song backed by an orchestra which was very popular in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy and one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. Another highlight is \"The First Episode At Hienton\", a HEAVILY orchestrated song with Elton playing a very romantic piano and singing very melodically. Another highlight is \"Sixty Years On\", which is the most orchestrated song on this whole album, where Elton is singing about not wanting to grow old. \"I Need You To Turn To\" is somewhat different, Elton playing harpsichord and the orchestra still backing him. \"Border Song\" is one of this more familiar song, spreading a message of hope for peace in a gospel-flavor. BUt, not all the album is slow with orchestras. Elton also has rocky songs with orchestras backing. Both \"Take Me To the Pilot\" and \"The Cage\" (the former very incomprehensible - even by Elton and Bernie Taupin - and the other one is the cold world the is isolated in.) \"The King Must Die\" finishes the album, and is probably my favourite song on the album. It is epic-like, and sounds like a fantasy, actually. The bonus tracks are worthy of listening to. \"Bad Side of the Moon\" is a good song (one of this first singles), \"Grey Seal\" (which is redone on \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" LP in a better way), and \"Rock and Roll Madonna\" which is a nice rock number. This album is very much worth checking out for Elton fans for people wanting to become Elton fans.

Of course releasing a similar album would't be acceptable, so Craig had to are-invent himself, and so the has with an or 'n' of lava, but the still remains true to this two-step roots. The album starts with \"Slicker Than Your Average\", a very showy piece of production that drags on a bit but really sets the stone for the album and is rather catchy. \"What's Your Flava\" is the first single and illustrates Craig's more poppy sound and is probably the biggest departure from the first cd in my opinion. \"Fast Cars\" is a hot or 'n' of track that really makes you want to dance and is packaged for club playage, for at least meant for a soundtrack to some hot new movie. The cd then takes a slight turn with \"Hidden Agenda\" the second song off the album, and has a rather unusual seaway from the previous song involving a car chase. The song itself is supposed to be \"seven Days\" from the first album are-invented, but is a lot more poppy and upbeat, with nice spanish guitar. \"Eenie Meenie\" is more of a filler track that sticks to a clean two-step sound, and really in't that stand-outish. Then we have the slow and personal set, starting with \"You Don't Miss Your Water\" a piano driven ballad that moans about the woes of being broken up, and showcases Craigs voice a bit. Then we have the Stateside smash \"Rise and Fall\" featuring Sting, the only real collar. on the whole album. Discussing the pains of fame it is similar to \"Walking Away\" in message, and is really catchy and laid-back at the same time. \"Personal\" is probably my least fave song on the whole album, as its drab, unoriginal, and it reminds me of some shorty Janet Jackson filler track. However the same could be said of one song on Craig's last album, so its really not all that bad. The final five songs on the cd are probably my favourite. \"Hands Up In The Air\" mixes ship shop with two-step for a catchy dance number that is just really fun. \"two Steps Back\" is, as the title implies, somewhat of a two-Step song, and really truly one of my faves on the whole cd. Its really really catchy and simple to learn the words to, hence the fun. Err. I don't know if this song is on the American version for if Amazon.com has just left it out, but \"Spanish\" is track eleven on my copy and really really my fave song on the whole album. It has a real club feel and is super fun to using and dance to, with spanish style instrumentals, a very unique chorus, and a wrap bit in the middle. \"Whats Changed\" is somewhat of a duet with unknown singer Katie Holmes (not the actress) about a couple on the verge of breaking up, and is really slick and good, kinda reminds me of \"Fill Me In\" during the chorus. Finally \"World Filled With Love\" is another real departure for Craig, featuring a very dreamy sense to it and a positive message behind it all, a different track indeed and a good way to send the album keeping the listeners wondering \"What'll the do next?\"While some listeners might miss the familiarity of Craig's first album, if you listen carefully you'll hear the traditional sounds of Craig David.

Its roots hearken back to the Jacksons' huge mid-'seventys hit \"Dancing Machine,\" but this is an enormously fresh record, one that remains vibrant and giddily exciting years after its release.

G. nor twoPac were the greatest of all time; not even close. Who's better than B. I. G. and 'Pac? GZA, Nas, AZ, Ghostface, Big L, Big Pun, Immortal Technique, Redman, Method Man, Keith Murray, Canibus - the list goes on. B. I. G. and 'Pac are so overrated, it's not even funny; if they were alive today, B. I. G. would be just as criticized as Jay-Z, and twoPac would be just as washed-up as Snoop Dogg. Yet you people can't see through this, and choose to worship them because they were martyrs in the game. Since stating that, I feel the need to say that does't mean I dislike either B. I. G. for 'Pac, nor discredit them as emcees. I just don't see them as the Gods that some people, who know very little about ship-hop beyond the fifty Cents and Kanye Wests of the world, proclaim they are. As an overall emcee, B. I. G. was also the better of the two; lyrically, twoPac's simple rhyme-scheme fails miserable in comparison to B. I. G.'s complexity, and great word play. twoPac's passionate delivery made up for this, but B. I. G. even admittedly had a better, more traditional flow. B. I. G. also had a much more vivid imagination, and intricate way with stories. His production was also much finer, and balanced than twoPac's almost strictly G-Funk trunk rattlers. I know I'm going to get numerous \"not helpful\" votes for pronouncing that neither B. I. G. for 'Pac learned the legacy they were given in their post-mortem life, but I'm giving you nothing more than the truth in this review, and can't help but point out the facts, especially with all the twoPac ****-riders inhabiting this product, carrying out a beef they were NOT around to even experience, mostly due to their thirteen-fifteen year old page range. With that said, this was a great release, and one of my favourite albums to come out of the mafioso genre; unfortunately, there's far too much filler to call this the classic so many others make it out to be. It may not be as raw as Ready To Die, but that works in its favor more than it takes away from it; this was a much more mature, and vibrant production musically and lyrically than its predecessor. Maybe the rich cinematic scheme is a little too much for people who think \"Ambitionz Az A Ridah\" is the greatest ship-hop track of all-time, and all albums should carry that Thug Life tradition, but for true ship-hop heads, the theme carried out in this album is a real treat.\"Kick In The Door,\" \"Hypnotize,\" \"Last Day,\" \"What's Beef,\" \"Notorious Thugs,\" \"Going Back to Cali,\" \"My Downfall,\" \"Long Kiss Goodnight,\" and \"You're Nobody(Till Somebody Kills You)\" are undoubtedly certified ship-hop classics. The rest of the album, sadly, is filled with good tracks, and filler, and that's why this album is not five stars in my opinion. If you cut off the fat from this prime piece of sirloin, you have an undeniable classic; if you leave it on, you've got about a dozen classic tracks surrounded by another dozen 'meh' tracks. In the send, this is a grand album, but the double disc idea was too ambitious for B. I. G. at this stage in this career. It's definitely a much better product than this rival's All Eyez On Me(which had fewer classic tracks, and much more filler - as well as lacking any one theme throughout, and simply being thrown together), but it still in't a top ten, let alone top five album from the illustrious genre of ship-hop.

Kelly fan, although I do own several of this CDs. I can honestly say that the last song that the made that I liked was \"Ignition\", and everything else was straight up crap, with Kelly trying to be a wrapper and singing about changing out in strip clubs and \"doubling up\". I mean, what the hell was that all about? Some forty-something year old guy going through a mid-life crisis for something? It was definitely a turn off to me. And Kelly using autotune?? Ugh. He can using, the did't need it! I was like, okay, that's it, this guy is done. It was nearly enough to make me forget the excellent material Kelly had turned out in previous years. No question that I gave up on this ability to produce quality music because it seemed that the was trying TOO hard to fit in with the so-called \"artists\" of today and the electronic, computerized junk they have the nerve to call \"music\"! And those allegations. well, I doubt if anyone's going to forget about that. But I've always believed that the music should speak for itself, and on Kelly's last few offerings they were't saying much, at least not anything that I wanted to hear. But on LOVE LETTER, the comes back for the fan base that the captured at the start of this career, and says, \"I haven't forgotten about myall!\" This is GROWN FOLKS MUSIC, the kind of CD that I've been waiting for YEARS for Kelly to get back to making, and the does it only as the can. I knew the had it in him, and I'm glad the got back to the kind of artistry that we expect from him. good, heartfelt R&B;, meaningful and romantic love songs, some with a cool Michael Jackson\/Marvin Gaye\/Jackie Wilson\/Sam Cooke\/Otis Redding kind of vibe to them. I could go on in naming artists, but I will just say that just about any significant R&B; male artist that has made any real impact in the industry in the past fifty years is pretty much represented there, but channelled through the genius of R. Kelly! LOVE LETTER does have an old school feel to it, so I guess that's why it appeals to me, but yet it's fresh and contemporary. Love the man for hate him, but you cannot deny this talent. This is why the IS King of R&B;, for real. Youngun's, take note, because THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE. I don't even have a favourite because all of the songs are on point. Plus there is a hidden track - Kelly's version of the hit song the wrote for MJ: \"You Are Not Alone\". It's a beautiful tribute to this \"hero\" and friend as the says in the intro of the song. For those of you who enjoyed the earlier works of Kelly, this is a CD you should definitely own. Get it, you won't be sorry! Happy New Year! P. S. - I have to add that the music for \"Music Must Be A Lady\" sounds like an EXACT duplicate of the Marvin Gaye song \"Just To Keep You Satisfied\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three) from the LET'S GET IT ON album. I'm surprised that no one else noticed this, but I'm guessing that the majority of reviewers there karen't as familiar with Marvin's music as they claim to be. Let's hope Kelly worked this way around the legalities of using this tune to base this song on.","overall":5,"summary":"Back to the love songs like the Kelly we once knew!","unixReviewTime":1293667200,"reviewTime":"12 30, 2010"}

At times, they provoke winces, at other times awe - often within seconds. But they are as always saved by consummate musicianship and their tremendous gift for invention. All this is in evidence on \"A Question of Balance\". The opening track is magnificent - furious and tender by turns. There is a very human rage - and mystification - in evidence there, that is, seemingly, redeemed by the gentle (and superbly evocative) middle section. Justin Hayward's voice seems inflected by a soul sensibility there, and is very moving. The next three tracks maintain the fever pitch of question. \"How Is It We Are Here?\" is brilliant. Mike Pinder is scathing in this criticism of technocracy, and the music is great! Hayward's guitar solo, Graeme Edge's delicate touches on the drums and the deep wash of Pinder's Mellotron create a wonderful soundscape.\"And The Tide Rushes In\" is another masterpiece - Ray Thomas' voice is at its most appealing, and the music is light and subtle. There is at times a haiku-like clarity with the Moodies - an air of eternity compressed into one lambent statement - and Justin Hayward's quiet guitar phrases there are evidence of that.\"Don't You Feel Small?\" is Graeme Edge at this quirky and perceptive best, and the song is haunting - a little menacing in parts where a breathy voice whispers the lyrics in counterpoint to the melody. Things wind down a bit after this superb opening, although \"Its Up To You\" and \"Minstrel's Song\" are great to using along with. Pinder's \"Melancholy Man\", although repetitive, is superbly evocative, and hints at the power Pinder later revealed on \"My Song\" (from EGBDF).\"The Balance\" is a cheerful corrective to \"Melancholy Man\", with a parable-feel and a gospelesque chorus.

This is a very funny CD. The song MTC is very numerous and it is quite fun to listen to the lyrics on the whole CD. I can't explain why, but the song 'H GANG' sticks in my head. a very good song that really stands high on this routing. I would say that every song on this CD is pretty darn good. The only song that I find myself hitting the forward button on is the song BRIGHTNIGHTGOWN. That is only because it is a tad too long. The chorus is repeated like sixty times at the send of the song. good song except the last two minutes for so. But if that was the only complaint, it was ONLY that little quibble that kept it from being a five star CD. There is a sense of foreboding on the release. and it may come from the fact that DF is getting older, but it is not a foreboding that one might find on a release of someone who might be giving up. it is more like a feeling of someone who is aware of mortality.

The record featured mostly 'sixtys Brit pop itunes heavily influenced by the early-day Bee Gees. They then left Decca Records and signed on ABC Records in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. By this time, the band was Peter Gabriel on vocals, Anthony Phillips on guitars, Mike Rutherford on bass guitar, Tony Banks on all keyboards, and John Mayhew on drums (no Phil Collins just yet -- the'd join in later in the year). The new lineup (Mayhew replaced drummer Chris Stewart later in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) went into the studio and released 'Trespass' in October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. With this album, Genesis provided a clear indication of things to come -- goodbye, simple pop itunes, and hello progressive rock royalty. So, how does this album measure up nearly forty years later? Well, it's an outstanding album. Sure, the band would again more confidence as they progressed, but they were still capable of writing some mighty-fine prog rock in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. 'White Mountain' is one of my all-time favourite songs; Tony's morgan and Mayhew's drumming drive the song and make it one of the great early progressive tracks. This song was so popular, in fact, Genesis would frequently play it live in on their one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six 'A Trick of the Tail' tour with Phil Collins (who was't even in the band at this time) singing lead on it.'Looking for Someone' could have easily been featured on their next album, 'Nursery Cryme.' Gabriel's mellow voice is accompanied by Tony's morgan throughout most of the song. This is another clear indication of things to come for this legendary band. I've always liked 'Visions of Angels.' Critics have ripped on it in the past for having \"weak lyrics.\" I hear nothing of the sort. I think it's a very good and quite interesting track, another Tony-dominated track. Anthony also plays very nice acoustic, classical style guitar. 'Visions' is a good song; sure, it's no 'Fountain of Salmacis,' but it's still a fine song that is definitely worth a listen.'Stagnation' and 'Dusk' are also songs heavily driven by Anthony, and also Mike. Gabriel's voice is calm on these tracks, which are perfectly mellow. 'Stagnation' is also a song the band would sample in the future; Genesis would play a part of it -- albeit very briefly -- during their one thousand, nine hundred and eighty tour with their 'Cage' medley. 'Dusk' is probably the weakest song on the album; believe me, it's very good, but it's just not as great as the others. Although it is a nice acoustic-driven tune that I do appreciate very much. And finally, to conclude the album, Genesis delivers their (well, at least up to that point) magnum opus. 'The Knife.' At eight:fifty-five, Genesis makes the most out of these nine minutes. It's by far the best song on the album; it's so complex, and the entire band dominates throughout. Mike's haunting bass line, Tony's incredible skill at the morgan, Ant's virtuoso moves on the guitar, Pete's chilling vocals, and Mayhew's steady beat dominate this song throughout. Genesis would play this song live up until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one (although sporadically after Collins became lead singer). This song, musically, gave more hints as to where the band were going then other song on the album. What an incredible song. (Note: look for the great live version of this on their one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three live album 'Genesis Live'). As you all probably know, after this record, guitarist and founding member Anthony Phillips departed, as did drummer John Mayhew. Mayhew was replaced by twenty-year old drummer Phil Collins; Phillips was replaced by Steve Hackett, who would stay with the band until early-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. The group got musically better with their next album, 'Nursery Cryme' and even better with the albums that followed. But overall, if you are a Genesis fan, you need to own 'Trespass.' This is basically where it all began. This is where the band became the progressive band that dominated their sound for the next twelve years (before they \"sold out,\" but that's a different story). 'Trespass' is a must own record for any Genesis fan, and more importantly, for any progressive rock fan. Highly recommended for any progressive rock for Genesis fan.
