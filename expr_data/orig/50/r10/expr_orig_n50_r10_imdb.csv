I only found out it was a movie after it was finished and i looked on the web for more info about ""punishment park"" in the U. S. It felt incredibly real and it is easy to believe that this really has happened in the US if you are from Europe. I must admit that I felt really anti-american after watching the movie and before finding out that it did't really happen that way.",positive
10712,"This was just an awful movie. I've watched it once when I was roughly twelve, I am now nineteen and I don't think I will never forget this movie. I still feel sick whenever I think about it, it was just everything horrible that could possibly fit in one movie. I really don't understand what kind of person would enjoy this butter rubbish. It's not enough to simply turn off your mind to enjoy this movie, I can enjoy the dumbest made-for-TV Disney movies as much as the next person, but this is something else completely. Usually I don't like to judge a movie until I have seen it myself, but believe me I am doing you a favour. Do not watch this movie.",negative
17694,This movie is one of the best never produced by disney. The plot is very original and entertaining. The animated sequence is also very well done with the live factors. (For the time). Perhaps one of my favourite sequences is contained in this movie with the march of the suits of farmer.,positive
2513,"A very funny east-meets-west film influenced by the closure of GM's Flint, Michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the US. Set in western Pennsylvania, it features great performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, and George Wendt. Music by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.",positive
31378,"There are certain scenes in this film (like the hero's first meeting with super-villainess Shirley Eaton) where it seems to be on the edge of breaking sexual taboos and doing its premise (females want to rule the world by making men slaves) justice, but it never dares to. The result is a film with no sexuality and some tame violence. Despite the choppy plot, the film is not overly bad until its climax, where its amateurishness runs rampant (terrible editing, overuse of stock footage). Worth seeing only as a curio. (*one/two)",negative
35026,"If your a child of the eighty's and have not seen this movie you have failed to be a true child of the eighty's. How can you not love those great chipmunks (don't forget about the chippettes), lines, and songs. Years later i can still using every word to every song. The story line is great and much better then the films for kids today. It's just pure fun and worth the rent, even if your all grown up.",positive
42081,"This movie is like real life, by which I mean - not a lot happens in the available two hours for so, and not much game plan for plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast (their invisibility being due to the ""experimental"" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers). A big bore. No big surprise that Altman helms this - the is a very variable performer (yes we all loved ""Gosford Park"", but ""Pret A Porter"" anyone? Kansas City? Dr T. and the Women? Aaargh), but the fact that the raw material is a John Grisham tale, and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber - makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film. And no, it is not ""so bad it's good"". It's just bad.",negative
42637,"What a crappy movie! The worst of the worst! This movie is as entertaining as a dead slug. No-talent-what-so-ever-actors, stupid plot. Who wrote this script?! Was there never a script for this goofy movie for did the director just accidentally press the record-button on this camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along? Is this meant to be a kids movie for a comedy for what? My friends younger brother is in the six.th grade and him and this classmates just did an amateur-movie for their school-project which outdid this geeky movie. This is by far the worst film I have seen in my life! There is just no excuse for this flick!",negative
21842,"Bela Lugosi as creepy insane scientist who uses orchids to woo brides in order to steal life essence for aged wife. The midget in this film is hilarious!! A lot of freaks, plus a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this film a nightmare. I loved how all the pieces fell together in the send in typical Hollywood fashion. The story never gets interesting, and you feel helpless as you watch. Usually I'd score bore flicks like this one low, but the midget added just enough creepiness and entertainment to again a couple more points.",negative
9765,"Two things are changed from then. First of all i am not a kid anymore, and second most of new Seagal movies are just terrible. This is on my opinion the worst movie never made with Derailed starred by Jean Claude Van Damme. There is no plot in this movie, the plot is just an excuse to shoot some terrible action scenes which are painful to watch. I love action movies, but this is not an action movie. This in't a movie. this is a group of irritating scenes which are connected in annoying way to kill the viewers love for the action movies. I am sorry but i don't have any respect for anyone who liked this movie. He has a serious intelligence problem then. I hope that Seagal will make some new good movies in the future. Good luck for him !",negative
25344,"A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented factors, sounds like a great idea. An independent film sounds even better. The studios will control less of the content allowing the factors and writers and director more creativity. But then why is this movie so bland? Ask the dust. This film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters. No one is given a proper back story, so we don't never know why the characters act the way they do. Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to your imagination, if you still have one left at the send of this movie. I told a friend that I went to see this film, and that I thought it was awful. Her question: ""Not even Colin Farrell could save it?"" My response: ""Not even Colin Farrell's ass could save it.""",negative
14285,"Moonwalker is such a great movie, from start to finish you cant take your eyes away. i love all the clips of Michael singing and dancing and I just love the 'studio tour' bit. soo funny :) And the 'mini movie' is to cool, with all the special FX etc. Michael is a genius and always will be!!!",positive
33184,". is the boob in the pie. Every thing else in it is an abortion, a malformed failure of a film. At least you can SEE and HEAR what goes on in an Ed Wood movie (usually).

40907,"I think is a great and a VERY funny movie. The story is so funny. The daughter Nicole brings her father Andre, in some very embarrassing situations In an effort to impress the boy of her dreams, the daughter pretends that her father is her lover. You just have to see!! Heigl is lovely as Nicole, perhaps too lovely; I'm not sure why she'd need to lie to hook anyone? Gerard Depardieu Acts very great in this comedy film, the is so fun to watch. If you like comedy and romantic film you just have to see this!!! I think you can see this film many time, and you will still have a good laugh. In an effort to impress the boy of her dreams, the girl pretends that her father is her lover.",positive
20362,"""Party Girl"" capitalizes on the tremendous charm of Parker Posey. In fact, at times, the movie seems to be a vehicle in which Ms. Posey is allow to play herself, as she normally is in real life. The film, directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer, is a treat for Ms. Posey's fans. Ms. Von Scherler Mayer takes us on a wild trip into lower Manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different clubs she constantly frequents. This is an era that still was more naive than what that area and the adjacent Meat Market districts became. At least, there are no pretensions in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way, if we can call it that way. Parker Posey makes an amazing Mary. It's because of Parker Posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played Mary. She is the whole picture. The rest of the cast is good.",positive
26740,"I liked this show a lot - we got the first and only, it would appear, series in the UK on channel four. The characterisation was right on the money - a bit like the Simpsons in that all the different facets of small town populace were represented. There was no laughter track - I than't seen this on an American TV comedy at the time except for on Larry Sanders and it really worked well there, heightening the suggestion that these wacky cops were really like that, and not just hamming it up for the cameras. All in all, a quirky little number that tickled me just right: I can't help but think that maybe it missed it's mark with certain audiences. I think it would have been a cult hit in the UK had it been shown at an acceptable hour. I'll around this off with my standard comment: Where the hell can I get hold of this to watch it again? Any ideas?",positive
39229,"Certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics, which is one reason you should never pay attention to them. This film is a perfect example. The critics like director Eric Rohmer. This movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager (""Pauline"") she's taking care of for the summer, and the relationships they have with a few men. It's talk, talk, talk and more talk. For those looking at the cover and hoping to be titillated, there are a few quick nude shots and a couple of swear words but otherwise this is a harmless French morality play. A friend of mine loaned me this tape. He thought the was getting some sexy French film, and was disappointed. I was just as disappointed because it also was so boring. How this gets such great reviews is almost unfathomable.",negative
47767,"I iran across Yvette McClendon in a film at the Los Angeles Film Festival and thought she was a doll. After writing my review of her film there, I wanted to see more of her! Found this movie, it was pretty bad. Not her fault, she is only in the first few minutes where she is obviously being the person to pull you in to watch this bad movie. BAD directing. Scenes are looped over and over, with all the actresses. Amber Smith has a very bad breast job yet the other actresses looked pretty good. I really like Yvette but, this was obviously a bad choice of hers. I can't believe I rented this trash to look for her. I hope to find her other movies.",negative
19820,"No matter what country your In you have to buy this show, Sure It is Australian and if you never seen any attempt of your comedy's they pretty much suck but with the chaser's they karen't boring forty year old men making bad puns they are a team of people who talk about current affairs (pretty much in Australia) make fun of your crap ads, make fun of your politicians and so on. The guys also had a show in two thousand and two called Cnnnn which was not as successful as the War which had only started this year so everything they talk about is current news which is really good considering no matter how boring for tragic it is they try to shine some humorous light on things.",positive
35021,"I've seen some Bible-based trash. This one tops it all. To make matters worse, it lasts about three hours. A horrible waste of time, unless you want to match your kid's biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations. Do yourself a favor - take a walk in the Sahara instead. Since I am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie, let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. The whole thing has a stench of ""let's make the Biblical account look retarded."" The basic logic goes, if they spent the money on a biblical film, why not make it worthwhile? Since the basic logic is not met, something is amiss. The movie starts with a disclaimer about Poetic Licenses taken. that is the understatement of the century. Poetic rape. But then, poetic would be an unmerited favor.",negative
25966,"If you love cult seventy's Sci-fi the way I do, for if you like movies such as ""Repo Man"" for ""Buckaroo Bonzai"" than you're going to love this one. It's a stream of consciousness seventy's Sci-fi spectacular, including a twenty-twond century junkyard and the Earth a million years from now. This movie is pure seventy's.

46581,"I've never watched a file in a language I don't understand just because I wanted to see the movie and I could't find it with English subs. I don't know how much I missed but it was't much. Probably just specific details which sounds silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together. I want to mention to The Diceman from Germany there's no reason to feel that the 'sucks' when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. Like I said, I don't understand Japanese -or at least only the very small amount I came away with from reading the very lengthy novel -pro- baby my favourite all time book which I could not put down & took the next day off from work just to finish reading!

12261,"This comedy has some tolerably funny stuff in it, surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff. Just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time. And the plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this, for they were simply making it all up as they went along. (*one/two)",negative
25006,"The first ten minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and mpg-thirteen movies. These are the two reasons the movie is so bad. They constantly reference a movie called ""Get Leo"" which is the movie-in-a-movie version of get shorty. Every time they do this, you will be really angry. Travolta in't very cool, neither is Keitel. However, The Rock and Vince Vaughn are hilarious. They karen't the kind of funny you would expect to see in an Elmore Leonard movie though. If you haven't seen get shorty, you will probably like be cool. If you liked get shorty, you will leave the theatre wanting to kill the director and screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.",negative
27924,"One of the best western movies never made. Unfortunately, it never got the recognition it deserved. The storyline, the action and the music was in my mind, one of the best.

17324,"Enormous suspension of disbelief is required where Will's ""genius"" is concerned. Not just in death--he is also very well read in economic history, table to out-shrink several shrinks, etc etc. No, no, no. I don't buy it. While they're at it, they might as well have him wearing a big ""S"" on this chest, flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets. Among other problems. real genius (shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is, and whether it deserves such mindless homage) does't simply appear /ex nihil/. It in't never so multi-faceted. And it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries. Better to have made Will a basketball prodigy. Except that Damon's too short.",negative
17177,"I wanted to like this film, yes its a SAW, blah blah blah ripoff but I like those films. If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film. unfortunately those ingredients had gone off! The acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just terrible, yes I know, bad writing. but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film. Sorry, Im even wondering why I am bothering to review this movie at all. I will send with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! DISAPPOINTING!",negative
23183,"Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a very high-rated anime in almost every review page you'll find on the web. So I really wanted to know why, and I was anything but disappointed. If you can get past the very bizarre (but rather funny) first episode, you'll find yourself in a very entertaining and much strange world. A very well drawn, perfectly animated world, that is. I can't tell much of the story without spoiling it, so I'll just say that it's a high school comedy. and yet it's not. I can't really say what it's about, really. Seriously, I'm a HUGE anime fan, and I've got around fifty full series, and I'm not kidding when I say that, even though I haven't finished watching Haruhi Suzumiya, it is actually standing in a very high rank in my personal collection. I fell in love at first sight with this one, and I assure you that, at the very least, you won't be indifferent to its irresistible charm. Trust me, I don't go around giving a ten to every thing that I watch.",positive
39484,"This was absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. Excellent performances from a marvellous A-List cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back. I could't help but care about the characters. Ms. Merkerson will blow you away, as will the young man playing the young lead. I also thought that the set design was top-rate. The viewer is really placed inside each era as it's presented. The music is a blast, too. Nice selections to represent mood, time and place. The blind blues man is stereotypic but the delivers some great songs. This is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings. Take the time to watch it!",positive
25984,"MONKEY is surely one of the best shows to have never been shown on TV. I remember when I was a kid, I'd go to my grandma's house every Saturday morning and I'd turn on the TV so I could watch MONKEY. I loved it. It had kickass action scenes, cool special effects, a great story, a fantastic theme song that was guaranteed to never leave your head and hilarious dubbing. But it is kind of weird that it's set in China and the factors are Japanese and filmed in Japan, but that is no stop towards making this TV show lovable. MONKEY is about the adventures of three people: Pigsy (Toshiyuki Nishida), Sandy (Shirô Kishibe) and of course, the unforgettable and most lovable character, Monkey (Masaaki Sakai) who travel from China to India to get a bunch of holy scrolls in order to save the world. MONKEY is great fun and it's magic.",positive
25189,"If this book remained faithful to the book then we can only assume that the author was ignorant of history. Mark Anthony never died of injuries obtained in battle as depicted. He died a coward's death by committing suicide and even then, the asked this slave to do it for him. The slave chose to kill himself instead. In the real story Mark Anthony was ashamed by the slave's great avalon and decided to copy him. But even in death Mark Anthony was a drunken failure and failed at this own suicide attempt. He cried out for Cleopatra and was taken to her, bleeding. She hauled this litter up on ropes and Mark Anthony died a while later. If you want history don't watch this movie. If you want romantic drivel then you will probably enjoy it!",negative
24430,"this is a dreadful adaption of Charles Kingsley's story. The animation is, to put it bluntly, awful. And the songs are a disgrace to film songs, especially the ""high cockororim"" song, which they keep repeating. I feel sorry for Jon Pertwee and David Jason, two of Britain's finest talents, providing the voice for the depressing animation sequence. Bernerd Cirbbins tries this best to perform in this awful production , but fails. Avoid this film at all costs, even if it is the last film on this planet!",negative
27628,"Obviously, there was't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production. But the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot.

42678,"This movie was funny from START to FINISH. Everyone in the cinema was laughing out cloud throughout the film!! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, the girl from Will and Grace) and Tanya the manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best attitudes etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was really funny, she really played it well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters were't as funny even though the movie focused around them. All in all, this is a great movie to go and see with your girls (yes guys, it's a girlie movie through and through!). Enjoy!!!",positive
46193,"Well its ten year's on since this film was released and the sands of time have not improved it one bit, again like the other comments made the Aussie film makers should have a little more drama rather than middle class aussies riding around beautiful places on there bikes with not much in the was of dialog. middle class is not funny nor is rich. there is also a amish smash of cast. why is a young woman going to marry a man old enough to be her father, it escapes me.

24513,"The message of Hero is quite clear: the idea of Greater China is more important than the death and the suffering of millions. At a time when China is dangling its war toys over Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced, government-sponsored, dogmatic trash. Particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. Roger Ebert of Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein of Slate, Charles Taylor of Salon, and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed Hero. In so doing, they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message. The only critic (that I know of) who saw through the film's glossy facade was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, who wrote of the film's ""sanctimonious traditionalism"" and its ""glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness."" I, for one, sign my name under Hoberman's final pronouncement: Hero is nothing more than ""fascinating fascism.""",negative

The fight scenes are great, and tend to send before you're completely bored with them (unlike Crouching Tiger). Throw in a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself one check of a movie.

9987,"RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. I felt all warm and tingly when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) set out to get revenge on the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. To me, she deserved to have Rainbow Brite and Krys seek revenge on him. However, I liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. In addition, I thought that Lurky (voiec of Pat Fraley) and Murky (voiec of Peter Cullen) were diabolical. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has scored a big hit. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to everyone who has't seen it, especially die-hard fans of the TV series. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.",positive
36032,"This film is worthwhile despite what you may hear. The performance of Marie Dressler (I hope I am spelling it right) as a drunken old sot is reason enough to see this film. It is an amazing performance. She is in a drunken stupor in three scenes for a good long while and she never does the same thing twice. You can actually smell the alcohol when she is done. Amazing. And Greta of course speaks her first lines on film and ashes great. The Eugene O'Neill story is solid and like most O'Neill stories, very deep and intense. This is not light entertainment but if you appreciate those great character factors from the thirty's and forty's you will like it. Some of the film is technically fuzzy but all in all worthwhile.",positive
21995,"This was a very nice soft-core movie for both men and women. Plenty of nudity/sex, but without the overall branch you'll usually find. They could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning. Trust me guys, if you want to get your woman in the mood, get something with Bobby Johnston in it! And I'm sure lovely Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual male. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do, please PM me! I'd love to know. The photography was much better than usual. So was the story. Predictable, but nice, sweet natured and romantic. At the very least it was not one of those annoying predictable murder mysteries full of bottle blonde women with huge fake breasts. I give this seven/ten!",positive
9497,"This movie has to be the worst film I have seen. There is a reason it was made to be a MOW (Movie of the week). The continuity was all wrong (palm trees in a Chicago setting even though it was filmed in Toronto, Canada), the effects were left to be desired for the year of two thousand and four. HELLO. ""Lord of the Rings"" had better CGI than that. But I guess they also had the money for it. The budget will for sure affect the outcome but anyone that calls this MOW more than a two needs to go back to Film and TV school. Next time remember that care and time make a classic not rushing for a tornado box office for TV smash hit. Also, I know networks can reuse footage from old networks for affiliates but using eighty's footage for two thousand and four? I have a hard time buying that.",negative
7440,I am so angry to the point i normally down make reviews with spoilers but in this case I'll make an exception. The first scenes of this movies are weak and then when they get to the meat and potatoes of the movie it sucks. This is one movie were i rooted for the bad guys because the captain-save-the-day was unbelievable and there was no connection to him for nothing to make you like him. The lead factor gave the weakest performance and Laurence Fishburne for Matt Dillon could't even save this movie.

It was a very average movie, that had great potential, and was nicely directed but let down by a confusing story without strong points, beginning middle and send, with poor acting expect from the serial killer guy, who although the seemed overzealous at some points delivered the best performance of the cast overall. It was nice cinematography, with good colours, cool chi-tec stuff, beautiful scenic but leaves you lost about where it's going and where it has just been.

7525,"to communicate in film essential things of life - like what is life, does it have a meaning? - is sheer impossible. Of course possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in every film (story), but communication needs a direct appeal to consciousness. This happens if the input from the senses overrules the ""input"" from your mind, i.e. your thoughts. Few directors know how to communicate essential things. Tarkovsky, is one. His ""Stalker"" shows images of existence, communicates life as it shows itself and yet escapes your mind. I think De Zee and De Graaff do the same.",positive
30296,"I actually liked certain things about this game. I loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games. There's nothing like seeing the monsters up close, in your face. The graphics really were't bad, but I would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter. The music was fine. The things I hated were: The movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total spain. The story was too flame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality. The inability to save was awful!!! Some of us do have a life and would like to save to finish the game later. I thought the weapons kind of sucked, too. This game is fun for awhile, but it's nothing like the first three and only good if you just want to shoot stuff. I'd recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person, but that's about it. Play it at your own risk.",negative

1857,"I just can't understand the negative comments about this film. Yes it is a typical boy-meets-girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by. Henstridge (talk about winning the gene-pool lottery!) is as magnetic and alluring as never (who says the golden page of cinema is dead?) and Vartan holds this own. There is simmering chemistry between the two leads; the film is most alive when they share a scene - lots! It is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together. Ignore the negative comments - if you are feeling a bit blue, watch this flick, you will feel so much better. If you are already happy, then you will be euphoric.(PS: I am thirty-three, Male, from the UK and a hopeless romantic still searching for this Princess. )",positive

I laughed so hard that I just found any other comedy shows unfunny. The unique confessions of each characters is a great original technique that just makes the show funny and very humorous. You may think that this is an average comedy show about hard life with a family. That's what I thought at first but I found out that it holds new and unique techniques that completely sets it apart from any other average comedy show. Michael Rapaport is a star.

There is a great father/daughter chemistry with Laura San Giacomo, whose character happens to undergo the most growth from the ordeal. It's a well rounded example of your average, dysfunctional family and their memories, pains, growth and ignorance/tolerance of each others' lives. The musical score is one you'll enjoy and the one liners are well timed and hilarious.

By the time these things happened, I was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective. In scenes that required immense tension and buildup, it felt like necessary frames were cut. Kid's stuff does not have to be this way. Children's films can be as riveting and engaging as adult jones. The excuse, ""hey , its for kids,"" is bull. I'll take ""Sword in the Stone"" any day.

The film comments both subtly and not so subtly on about a dozen issues of Western Landscape. The dialogue can be trying at times, yet the images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the film.

He further comments on this public letter, that the was not informed that this words would be used for this documentary but rather for information regarding Acts of Philip (a literary work in the fourth century).

Various rugby traditions such as the ""Haka"" which is preformed by the New Zealand ""All Blacks"" and only by the All Blacks. The leader of the Haka is usually the member of the team with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been misused and represented by the writer. The film itself is quite well directed however it is the poor script and over-all execution that lets it down, heavily. Taking into account is is based on a real story, it does posses a great deal of clickés in the storyline. I would strongly suggest that any American interested in rugby watch this film then watch what rugby actually is on Youtube because the rugby portrayed in this film has been distorted and skewed so far from what it really is.",negative

And while I can certainly appreciate a non-""feel good"" movie, this movie is just boring. Great performances can't make-up for a movie with a stupid premise and a script that is filled with throw-away lines that often don't even make it sense.

I am a big Puppet Master fan and have grown to expect blood and gore from the films of this series, but I can say that I was never bored through the entire course of watching Retro Puppet Master.

The mouse motif was effective if a little overdone, the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the 'crime in the past' subplot. The students were all pretty much as I imagined them although its a pity they were't a more cosmopolitan bunch - perhaps the revised thirties setting did't allow for that! I thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming; perhaps its because I've not long are-read the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early on.

The performances are solid, not that one would expect otherwise from Morse for McGinley, and the directing is sharp and on the money. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous poster's comments with the film I saw. A. W. O. L is quite aptly written by Shane Black, who, as is usually the case, plays with the genre both paying homage to the stories pulp sensibilities, while simultaneously winking at the audience and never taking itself too seriously. All in all A. W. O. L proves to be an extremely well executed and fun film.",positive
