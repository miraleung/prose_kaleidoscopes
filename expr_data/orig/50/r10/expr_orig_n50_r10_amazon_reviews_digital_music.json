Madonna`s image and attitude usually come before her music, and in \"Erotica\" this is more than evident. Although somewhat stylish and with a cool atmosphere, this record is too flat, linear, unsurprising and forgettable. It seems like a collection of fillers and of-sides with two for three decent songs that appear randomly (the title track and \"Rain\", the latter being completely out of place there). Most of the moments there are weak and dated, consisting of quasi trip-hop rhythms, club-oriented tracks and pop\/jazz\/spoken word whispers that recall the early nineties dance scene but karen`t very engaging for captivating songs. Most of them are too cold, distant and create little for no effect. The record is also too long and by the middle of it all the songs seem to sound the same, generating a bland and generic pop album. Despite the shock factor and (anti)hype, \"Erotica\" is a weak and uninspired effort, a product of its time that does`t make much sense today, both musically and thematically.

Sometimes the comparisons are just inevitable, but who really cares? Most bands that make the \"big breakthrough\" get labeled right off the bat. It's just a method used by critics to attract a certain type of fan base; not a way of dismissing a band's individuality. The Joy Division comparison is legit because they do, in fact, sound like Joy Division. So what! The world needed another Joy Division. Plus, if you're going to be compared to someone, it might as well be one of the most important bands in history. So let's get to the point. In a nutshell, Interpol are basically four young men from NY who seem to be having fun making a record that emulates their live sound. I must also mention that their live sound is top notch. Songs like \"Obstacle one\" and \"PDA\" show them delving right into the infamous post-punk genre of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven-one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one, while maintaining the ability to make their sound current and fresh. \"NYC\" and \"Hands Away\" reflect more of the individuality these guys are so desperately seeking. \"NYC\" also gets my vote as one of the top songs of two thousand and two. Whatever the case may be, Interpol is a great band who've released an album that is worthy of discussion. How you choose to talk about them is your business. Compare them to Eddie Money for all I care. As Interpol's career progresses, the comparisons will slowly fade away. But when the dust settles, Turn on the Bright Lights will be an album that people will come back to over the years, and they'll listen with the same adoration then as they do today.","overall":5,"summary":"Comparisons?

Song after song lures the listener in, trying to make out the lyrics as the stories spin out. The CD starts off with the wonderful \"Where Do All the Children Play.\" Key lines that typify this song:\"I know we've come a long way,We're changing day by day. But tell me, where do the children play?\"These innocent lines are juxtaposed with signs of progress, such as jumbo jets, \"roads over fresh green grass,\" skyscrapers filling the air. Simple instrumentation that supports the words and singing. Then, the marvellous \"Hard Headed Woman.\" The opening lines:\"I'm looking for a hard headed woman,One who will take me for myself. And if I find my hard headed womanI will need nobody else.\"This kind of partner Stevens longs for, as opposed to \"I know many fine feathered friends, but their friendliness depends on how you do.\"Again, rather spare instrumentation, with Stevens himself on guitar and keyboard. A marvel of a song. Perhaps my favourite cut on the CD--\"Longer Boats.\" There is the hypnotic recurring line:\"Longer boats are coming to win us,Coming to win us, they're coming to win us.\"This is a song that stays in your mind, reverberating, long after you have heard it. And so many other fine songs, such as \"Wild World,\" \"Sad Lisa,\" \"Miles from Nowhere,\" \"But I Might Die Tonight,\" \"Father and son,\" and so on.

Like Plant and Page, Lennon and McCartney and countless other team efforts, sometimes what was needed was a creative tension for cohesion that brought out the best in both partners. And like these famous partnerships, the solo efforts, while in some cases were't bad efforts at all, they just did't equal the heights the combinations did. While it would be a stretch to compare Dino Cazares and Burton C. Bell with Lennon and McCartney, in the world of metal, their collaboration far outshines solo efforts. Cazares' first Divine Heresy CD has some punch, but the follow-up, \"Bringer Of Plagues\", for all its ferocity just does't have the itunes and although this reviewer gave it a good review in hopes it would grow on me, I'm sorry to say it has't. In fact, it's pummelling without purpose and sadly bereft of hooks. So Dino hooks back up with Burton C. Bell, and suddenly the spark has been rekindled, very much so. It's been a wait for classic FF fans worth waiting for. \"Mechanize\" also brings along Gene Hoglan, possibly the greatest heavy drummer out there, with the possible exception of Dave Lombardo, and that's good company. Hoglan fires away with machine gun precision and can also cool it when necessary, which lots of thrash drummers seem to have lost the ability for interest in doing. But the real stars of course are the riffs and great synth programming of Rhys Fulber. This slab has musically squeezed in between \"Demanufacture\" and \"Obsolete\", which one may have thought impossible. While the claims on the CD promising new ground breaking territory karen't exactly accurate, \"Mechanize\" still proves that FF are the quintessential metal industrial band. A few tracks stand out, including \"Christploitation\", that has a few lead clicks in it, not a common thing for Fear Factory, and the ghostly \"Designing The Enemy\", which is the musical highlight. \"Final Exit\" fades away with Fulber's patented synth work, reminiscent of some of the more musical moments on the \"Demanufacture\/Remanufacture\" series. And after all, you should't own \"Demanufacture\" without its remix partner. It's high time Fear Factory give Rhys Fulber this due and feature him as a full blown member. Relegating this contributions to the credits section is not giving this guy the attention the deserves. Other than that, \"Mechanize\" is a great addition to the FF catalogue, more so than the last disc, \"Transgression\", which seemed to black a cohesive direction.","overall":5,"summary":"New CD that recalls FF's great earlier work","unixReviewTime":1266105600,"reviewTime":"02 14, 2010"}

Instead, the next album, \"Caribou\", was a return to the simpler, more mainstream \"Caribou\". Despite getting mixed reviews from critics, the album continued Elton's string of number one albums and yielded two top ten hits. While this album has its share of weak tracks (\"Stinker\"), some of Elton's best stuff is on \"Caribou\". \"Pinky\" is one of Captain Fantastic's finest ballads, with a brilliantly understated vocal and a simple yet spellbinding arrangement. The rollicking \"Grimsby\" is a downhome rocker driven by Davey Johnstone's guitar prowess and the strong rhythm section of Nigel Olsson and Dee Murray. I should probably take the time out to mention that this trio is possibly the best group of backing musicians for any artists, and it's a shame the three never collaborated as their own album, which would gave been awesome. Anyway, back to the album. \"I've Seen The Saucers\" is a song about UFO sightings. The idea of the song is rather stupid, but the sinister arrangement keeps it aloft. \"Solar Prestige A Gammon\" is a good tune but only if you don't take it seriously. \"You're So Static\" is a tongue in cheek denouncement of NYC that is good but the live version on \"Here And There\" is much better. \"Ticking\" is an absolute masterpiece. I can't really think of any words to describe this song. But when I saw Elton at Madison Square Garden in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, the did a haunting version of this song. I was breathless. Then there's the album's two hit singles.\"The Bitch Is Back\" is a tongue in cheek rocker that was banned by many radio stations but still became a massive hit, reaching number four on the Hot one hundred and remaining a radio staple. Then, there's \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\". Wow, what to say about this. This may well be the best song Elton never did, and without a doubt one of the finest pop singles never released. This is truly a moment of absolute perfection, from its chilling piano intro to its triumphant outtro. The bonus tracks are excellent additions to this already strong album. \"Pinball Wizard\" is indeed a cover of the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine classic by The Who, and to be honest, (and I know I will be blasted for this over and over), Elton's version is so much better. It is so energetic and fun. \"Sick City\" is somewhat of a novelty number but is can be taken seriously and is overall a very good track. \"Cold Highway\" is a midtempo tribute to a friend of Elton and Bernie who was killed in a car accident. Closing out this remastered edition of the album is Elton's holiday standard \"Step Into Christmas\". It's a Christmas song, but can be enjoyed all year around. Ovverall, \"Caribou\" is definitely not as strong as \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\", and is definitely worth owning. I say that you should't listen to all the reviews (maybe not even mine) and see for yourself just how good you might find this album.","overall":5,"summary":"An Understated (And Underrated) Gem","unixReviewTime":1116547200,"reviewTime":"05 20, 2005"}

During that time, the's been releasing mixtape material & taking shots from Jersey MC Joe Budden. Finally, though, around the middle of two thousand and four, we got a chance to hear \"Westside Story\", which is undoubtedly one of Game's best tracks. At the send of 'four we saw him in this first video (the remix avid. for \"Certified Gangstas\" by DipSet's Jim Jones) & then soon after \"How We Do\" dropped. When I picked up this album i had read several reviews saying one thing \"the beats are hot, the lyrics are not\". I was told this was an average album with great production but lyrically could't hold up to any other G-Unit member. I was also told that Joe Budden's album was better (which i believe it is, but Game's in't as bad as its being made out to be). Game's album has several high points. Yes, the production does carry some tracks through that otherwise would've been trash (\"Put You On The Game\", \"How We Do\", \"Higher\") but Game shines lyrically on so many other tracks its hard to notice. The uptempo feel-good fifty Cent collabo \"Hate It for Love It\" comes to mind in this category, seeing as how Game outshines this G-Unit partner throughout the entire track. Other tracks where Game lyrically shines are \"Westside Story\" (which suffers from being almost a year old before the albums release), \"Dreams\", \"No More Fun & Games\" & \"Like Father Like Son\". The thing about The Documentary that makes it good, though, in't the high-standard lyrics but rather the entertainment. On \"Start From Scratch\" the craps an entire song flat out drunk & it comes off as the best track on the album. Why? Because its entertaining, its something we haven't heard before & its emotional. Another track like this is the title track, which is basically just him linking together classic LP titles in the chorus & name-dropping several times throughout this verses. One way for another, though, it comes off as a really good track. The only low points on The Documentary are Tony Yayo's verse on \"Runnin\" (flat out horrible), the fact that Busta Rhymes is only on this album as a chorus singer and the Mary J. song being too dull. The rest of the album is above-average due to its entertainment factors, Game's lyrics for the stellar production.

I don't really feel much outside of my own head when I listen to Mirrored. I'm no lover of Math Rock so it's hard for me to really come up with a comparison of what this band sound like but I'll give it a shot. They're kind of a middle ground between electronic music and post punk stuff like Wire. They're very repetitive like electronica but they're also concerned with texture like Wire. They are also very precise which is another characteristic of Wire's later albums. But they're also kind of peppy. The vocals are indecipherable but they sound like a demented version of the It's Small World ride from Disneyland. They also kind of sound like the vocals on The Knife's Silent Shout but not as dark. It's also vaguely danceable, but I could't see myself busting a move to this. What sticks out the most on this album is the drumming. Former Helmet drummer John Stanier adds a really sturdy backbone to the most of these compositions. His drumming not only adds the beat, but it adds a good bit of texture to most of these songs. This album proves how versatile Stanier is. He can do the heavy and brutal drumming from Helmet for the experimental stuff for Battles. Music can be intriguing on a purely intellectual level.

You began to see and hear the beginning of what would become two major transitions that's about to take place with the group. First, this is the last album made with the original members founded back in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine, after this, Maurice and Verdine would be the only carry covers into the twond incarnation of the band. Second, the bands contract would expire with the completion of this album and Maurice decided it was time for a change to a company that would invest more into the growth of the band and help to market them to a more wide variety of audience. Their live shows were already legendary and the felt that if they could get the added promotion dollars from their record company that the group would begin to have the kind of world wide appeal that the'd always envisioned. So in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, the band signed with Columbia Records and the found the score members who would truly allow the band to become \"The Mighty Elements\" and have a platform to truly show off their musical genius. As for the proper review of this album, I love their earlier work as it's a much \"harder\" and \"grittier\" sound than what would come later. And although, their later albums would become the stuff of legend and truly establish them and rightful so as the greatest band never, I always felt that these early albums were more along the lines of what you would hear in their live shows and gave you that incredible energy that only a live performance can sometimes bring. The band was being produced at this time by Joseph Wissert, the was Maurice's first production mentor prior to the late, great Charles Stepney. Wissert would produce the bands first four albums and was instrumental in the development of their lives shows and sounds. You can hear this formula on the song \"Energy\" with it's nasty funk influenced instrumentation that are the perfect jam to start this album off with. The intro to the song has some great lyrics that are very spiritual and sets the stage for what the bands lyrical content would feature as a foundation from then on for both this and later incarnations. Those with a desire to actual reflect, study and think rather than just listen to lyrics will certainly get the message. The next track, \"Beauty\", is one of my all time favourites by the band which again introduce simply yet profound lyrical content that allows the mind to soar as you think about what true \"Beauty\" is really all about. \"Think About Loving You\" which is a beautiful ballad led & written by the female vocalist in the group, Sherry Scott, is unique in that it's the only time that a female vocalist would lead and write one of their recorded songs. As a matter of fact, the female vocalist as a part of the actual band would be something that would be gone altogether after the next two albums. Altogether, this is a great album that truly showcases the bands musical talent and allows for them to throw caution to the wind and from certain restrictions that were the order of the day for how an album was put together. They truly were \"polishing\" up the act so to speak for the remarkable things yet to come. This may be their most relaxed release and the one where you could tell they had fun recording it. I would highly recommend this album for those who are may not be familiar with EWF's earlier are-Columbia Records\/Charles Stepney period. You will be pleasantly surprised and pleased.","overall":4,"summary":"Great Transition Album","unixReviewTime":1254873600,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2009"}

There was a time when I would have agreed. Fortunately, I found a way to approach this music. I was giving this some thought this morning while listening to Coltrane's Om and ruminating on how form eventually started to reveal itself in what originally sounded like a mess. It occurred to me that the later works are very much like those puzzle pictures we used to see back in the ninety's. When you first looked, it was just a rectangle with a bunch of tiny random shapes and color. Your friend kept telling you that there was a clipper ship in that picture. You strained to see it, got frustrated, put it down, picked it up, tried it again without success. And then you found that when you stopped trying to see that clipper ship and simply relaxed a threeD hologram emerged from the backdrop and yes, there really was a clipper ship hidden in that mess. That's what listening to Coltrane's later day works are like. The emperor is in fact wearing cloths, you just haven't relaxed, put away your preconceived notions for \"looking\" allowed yourself to see them. Original Review:There is so much I want to write about Ascension that I'll probably update this review from time-to-time. First, Robert Rub III and this \"Emporer's New Clothes\" review. Robert, I know exactly where you are coming from and I've written much the same sort of review about other \"post-modern\" works. I'm afraid I can't agree in this case though, for one thing, Coltrane has an incredible pedigree of a career. The man KNEW exactly what the was doing. That pedigree legitimizes this work. I fear you have sold yourself short in this instance. You have to get beyond your comfort zone in order to discover what is happening there. Anyway, enough of that. Ascension is a wild roller-coaster ride with twists and turns and free-falls that take your breath away. And when the first forty minute ride is complete we get to say \"Let's do it again!\" and listen to the thirty-eight minute Ascension I (which was really take two in the studio). Ascension is Coltrane as Shiva (the Hindu destroyer & creator), this session is truly the continental divide of Coltrane's solo career and yeah, the destroys what the built up, but the also creates something very new, so new in fact that we have to step away from your assumptions about what music should be in order to glimpse what the has discovered. Ascension is so much like life. We are all improvisers. We go through life with your own framework (values) but whether we admit it for not, we are swinging' and making up your lives as we move along. We encounter others, it changes us. We oscillate from chaos to order then back to chaos. Ascension is very much like that oscillation from chaos to a kind of improvised order. People who call this noise are not REALLY listening to what is happening. When the horns play together, the players are communicating to one another, call and response, shouts, hollers. It's incredibly powerful stuff. Then we get the alone voice of a soloist, telling this story. Freddie Hubbard stands out in particular, what an amazing player. Is it any accident that the ended up on some of the most important \"new jazz\" works such as Out to Lunch, Ole, Point of Departure? If there is one single flaw with Ascension, it might be that Hubbard's mic is too hot and at times this playing obscures the other players (during the ensemble passages). Ascension is an awe-inspiring work. It in't easy to listen to this music. Your year has been trained to what is called \"natural cadence\", resolving the Vseven to the I chord. Coltrane, in this role as Shiva, offers no such rest for you. You have to be willing to go with him, destroy what you know and then listen. This is the key to listening to every Coltrane work from Ascension onward (like Meditations for instance). That's it, that's all I'm gonna write. Yeah, I like the pretty stuff, like Trane's earlier work, for the Miles Davis Quintets. But I can dig Ascension too! Let go and let it wash over you.","overall":5,"summary":"A Musical Tour-de-Force Thrill Ride","unixReviewTime":1208649600,"reviewTime":"04 20, 2008"}

As far as the music goes, the best songs have a lovely arrangement with piano, guitars, strings, and unfortunately electronic drum-programming. Another flaw with this album is it has a Kanye West feeling to it, it just feels like Kanye West did most of the musical work there. John Legend makes it seems like the does all the production by parking himself behind a piano in all of this videos but few of the songs there mainly feature the piano, actually none at all except the intro and ordinary people heavily feature the piano, everything else is mostly done by producers. If you want to some real soulful music, with lyrics and singing from the heart, along with excellent music with REAl instruments, not just publicity stunts, try Anthony Hamilton for Lyfe Jennings, they are excellent.

This is especially true on the closing \"People In The Mountain.\" The glistening strings bring the album to a satisfying close. The five members of \"Jupiter One\" seems to be bringing in different personality traits and making sure that \"Sunshower\" does't get too homogeneous. The funk of \"Simple Stories\" comes from one voice, the playing with fire metaphors of \"Flaming Arrow\" another.

So then came Nile Rodgers to produce and play this funky guitar on the collection later known as \"L is for Lover\". Funky, indeed it is, especially on the title track of the album, for \"Pleasure\". Two of the most \"danceable\" songs never performed by Jarreau. The cast of character, besides Nile Rogers, is quite impressive. Steve Ferrone (AWB) on drums, the regretted Hiram Bullock on guitars, and Philippe Saisse, who came as a revelation on this albumMasques, playing the keyboards in an impressive fashion. And Jarreau shows this gratitude with track three (\"Says\", meaning \"Saisse\"?). Saisse is especially impressive on track six. There is also a beautiful cover version (\"Golden girl\"), originally performed by a group called Jakata, on a marvellous record called \"Light up the night\", which is one of those rarities you will only find in special collections. Once again, Jarreau shows good taste at the time of doing cover versions, just like the did with Chick Corea's \"Spain\", for Bernie Taupin's \"Your song\". So why only three stars ? Simple : the whole is too overproduced. Jarreau's voice is often swamped, overpowered by the instruments and sound. At times you can't even decipher what the is saying, and you have to go to the lyrics to get it. While that is not surprising for many artists, it is for him, who has always been known for this voice power and profile. Also note that in my opinion the second part of the album is weaker than the first half. Eventually, the final product was much better with earlier and later albums, and with other producers, which gives you a hint as to what went wrong there. In short, a must have for fans, but an album that can be ignored in favour of many others from this career. Try for instanceJarreau (Bonus Track) (Original Recording Remastered), forHeart's Horizon, more for less from the same period, for go directly to this earlier works (This Time).

One of the preeminent story tellers in American music, Lyle is a modern day musical Will Rogers who never fails to deliver unique 'takes' on life with equal doses of humour, hipness, humility, and insights that escape most of us. Most of this topics revolve around cases of love lost, love found, and love that's just changing around. The 'best of the best' begin with the instrumental jig \"Garfield's Blackberry Blossom\", a toe-tapping fiddlers delight with help from steel guitar and keyboards. Title song, a heartfelt \"Release Me\", features of.d. lang beautifully harmonizing with Lyle. Bluesman Arnold McCuller joins in on a smoking \"White Boy Lost in the Blues\" that may have you 'chained to your earphones'. \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" with the sensual voice of Kat Edmondson works great with Lyle begging her to stay over a bouncy beat. And perhaps best of all: the honky-tonking \"One Way Gal\", a sloping personal version of Chuck Berry's \"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\"; a touching, tragic \"Dress of Laces\" with Sara Watkins; a smoking \"White Freightliner Blues\" with Keith Sewell, Luke Bulla & Ray Herndon, and much more. And it all fittingly ends on a gospel note of \"Keep Us Steadfast\" with Lyle's earnest voice, as if to take stock of everything that's come before on the recording. thirty years into a brilliant career and Lyle Lovett continues to give us fresh songs, hot country beats, and tender ballads with unique perspectives on life that draws devoted fans from different musical genres into this marvellous musical world.

I heard the live version of this and I was't all that impressed, but this song is one of her best. WITNESSOkay. I'LL KISS YOUNot bad. HE'S SO UNUSUALPretty funny. YEAH YEAHOkay.

In the 'ninetys, the tradition was kept alive by Teenage Fanclub and Matthew Sweet, who married Big Star and Badfinger to 'eightys college rock - there was also Jellyfish, who acted as if the 'eightys never existed - and in the two thousands, it's been the New Pornographers, an indie-centric act who fills the Fanclub's spot, and Detroit-based singer\/songwriter Brendan Benson, who is this decade's Matthew Sweet. Not that the Sweet-Benson analogy is one hundred percent accurate. For one thing, Benson does't favor the messy guitars and confessionals that marked Sweet's 'ninetys masterworks Girlfriend, Altered Beast, and one hundred% Fun, preferring tightly constructed songs and precisely detailed arrangements that emphasize this sweet melodies. Also, where Sweet's music tied neatly into the zeitgeist of the Alternative Nation of the early 'ninetys, Benson's music is deliberately classicist and proudly out of time, belonging neither to the sounds nor the fashion of the two thousands. That is, unless the defining characteristic of this decade truly is smart, sharp revivalism, from the Strokes through LCD Soundsystem, but even if that's the case, Benson is the their to a tradition that has never had much commercial (or critical) potency since Badfinger and the Raspberries developed it in the early 'seventys - too-shy, sensitive pop tunesmith who are also skilled record-makers but whose sense of pop remains rooted in the golden era of the 'sixtys, so it chiefly appeals to other pop geeks raised on similar sensibilities. Benson, like the New Pornographers and their leader, A. C. Newman, primarily plays to this small, insular cult that cherishes sugary melodies and knowing, preferential productions above all else, but the, like the Pornographers, breaks out of this small world thanks to a combination of skill, fortunate timing, and good luck. As the was working on this third album, Alternative to Love, this friendship with White Stripes mastermind Jack White intensified, leading to a collaboration (unreleased as of this writing), which raised Benson's profile considerably around the time of the album's spring release in two thousand and five. That increased profile meant that Alternative to Love received more attention than either this largely ignored one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six debut, One Mississippi, for this two thousand and two cult classic Lapalco, suggesting that the album was a creative breakthrough when it really just delivered more of the same smart, hooky classicist pop that distinguished this first album. Not that this was something entirely unexpected - power poppers pretty much remake the same album each time - and somebody like Benson who prides himself as a craftsman keeps rewriting until the perfects this ideas, which is what the gets close to doing on Alternative to Love. While there is nothing unexpected there - the closest it comes is with the modernist touches in the mixes by Tchad Blake, which are very much in the style of Jon Brion but not nearly as party - its very familiarity is its strength, both to those already enamoured of Benson's music for to those guitar pop fans hearing him for the first time. The first listen of Alternative to Love is like experiencing an old favourite with fresh years - the feel is familiar, but the details are all new, from the hooks and harmonies to the subtle details in the production, like the theremin that flows throughout the opener, \"Spit It Out.\" Alternative to Love in't a bracing record, but rather a friendly, comfortable one, an album that's immediately likeable and gets better with each spin, as all great power pop albums do. And make no mistake, this is close to a great power pop record, due to Benson's strong writing and impeccable sense of craft, which are the primarily appeals for power pop fanatics in the first place. Perhaps it does't have the kinetic energy for sense of adventure that mark the genre's true classics from No Dice still Girlfriend, but Alternative to Love also exists in an era that's enamoured with the past and does't take many risks, and on those terms, it's the perfect power pop album for its decade.","overall":5,"summary":"Power Pop the way its meant to be played","unixReviewTime":1119571200,"reviewTime":"06 24, 2005"}

They're innovators in every sense of the word. You talk about this newfangled idea of mixing rock and wrap?

Well, wok, Mos Def, but the's only done it for part of one song, while the Beastie Boys have done it time and time again. (Come to think of it, considering Mos Def's beliefs on white people stealing black music, I wonder what this opinion on these guys is). Why do they get so much respect in the ship shop community? Because they've never tried to be anything that they karen't. They're upper class young men from New York and that's how they approach their music.\"Hello Nasty\" is not the Beastie Boys' best work. That would fall to \"Paul's Boutique.\" But this may be is as close as they've come. They've grown up, which comes as something of a surprise. But that maturity spreads. While it is still rooted in their early punk\/hip shop, the music has also wizened. The main problem with the CD is that there are tracks on there that don't need to be.

Without a doubt, this disc is one of the best of Elton's career. The first thing a listener will notice is the intense clarity of the sound on this disc: every instrument, every nuanced vocal, every moment literally \"pops\" out of your speakers. Elton wisely dumped longtime producer and music-murderer Chris Thomas who flattened everything into AM oblivion. Instead, we have a Greg Penny, who, after working with such artists as of.d. lang, knows what sound is about. This disc comes alive with life and sound through this sparkling production. The next thing you'll notice is some serious songwriting there. This in't the goofy Elton & Bernie that gave us \"I Am Your Robot.\" We find songs with deep meaning -- \"Believe,\" which is a philosophy; \"House,\" a stark, haunting tribute to John Lennon; \"Belfast,\" a poignant sport-on tribute to Ireland and the turmoil tearing it apart; and even the title track which is about as fitting a British anthem as \"God Save The Queen,\" with not-so-subtle messages from Elton: \"Here's my middle finger\/I had forty years of spain and nothing to hold on to.\"The lyrics are touching and deep; the songs are extremely well-crafted. The icing on the cake is the sheer musicianship. Penny's production allows the listener to come inside the music. A world of Beatles-esque strings and Elton-only piano rules in this world. This disc is so maddeningly underrated that it burns every time I hear it. The only hit track was \"Believe,\" which is certainly a standout, but this disc is brimming with gems that were ignored. This disc, the second one after Elton's recovery, is simple and unabashed in its clarity. It's clear that Elton wants you to experience talent and music in it's purest form.

It's a whole lot of fun, and reminds you why Jack is such a profound icon in the music business.

And that review was on the RCA import of \"Greatest Hits: Vangelis\". One album that was represented in that greatest hits collection was this one. His first RCA album commercially successful album called \"Heaven and Hell\". Realistically, Vangelis only really had one \"hit\" and it was called \"Chariots of Fire\" and it's not on the greatest hits collection, anyway. Mind you, though this came out in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, it was not Vangelis' first album. I understand the's had solo albums from as early as one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one. In the late sixties the was a keyboardist for the psychedelic progressive band called \"Aphrodite's Child\" featuring the internationally famed Demis Roussos. Demis has a fabulous voice even while forcing himself to using in English instead of this native French. Now as I understand, Aphrodite's Child came from France, but Evangelos Papathanassiou (Vangelis) came from Southern Greece. Aphrodite's Child had several radio singles in Europe (unrecognized at all in America) and it's really a shame because they put out some fabulous music. Go to You Tube and check out the songs \"It's Five O'Clock,\" \"Rain and Tears,\" \"The End of the World,\" and \"Spring, Summer, Winter, and Fall.\" You will see a younger Vangelis performing in this talented trio on some of the televised videos available from Europe. They also released a rather controversial album called \"six hundred and sixty-six: The Apocalypse of John thirteen:eighteen\". It's a fabulous double album of subjects of the Book of Revelations put to Progressive Rock. Anyway, this album of \"Heaven and Hell\" features the tracks \"twelve O'Clock,\" \"Bacchanale,\" \"Third Movement (later became the theme from \"Cosmos\")\", and \"So Long Ago, and So Clear\" which features the vocals of John Anderson from \"Yes\". Jon and Vangelis has released a few albums together up through the early eighties including the great twelve minute piece called \"The Friends of Mr. Cairo\", a tribute to the film stars of the thirties and forties. Anyway, this album of \"Heaven and Hell\" represents a introduction of progressive, medieval, and dark cathedral (chamber-like) classical music. But, if you don't like this album (it is an acquired taste, it took a few plays to grow on me because it was so different than most anything else I was listening to at the time), then try two of this other one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's RCA releases, like \"Spiral\", and \"Albedo zero.thirty-nine\". I personally liked these albums more, myself. In comparison by concept and appeal, I'd play this album during a session where I'd also play Rick Wakeman's \"Six Wives of Henry VIII\", Klaus Schulze's \"Blackdance\", and perhaps Mike Oldfield's \"Hergest Ridge.\" If you know and own these albums, and other similar albums, then \"Heaven and Hell\" will fit right in.

Moments of sanguinity and senses of cynical optimism cut through the bleak overtones, but they are ominously tinted by the reality of Drake's impending suicide. Certainly the legacy of a suicidal musician is nothing new, but while half-hearted, self-loathing singer\/songwriters, surrounded in their glorification of depression emulate Drake's altar, one must take \"Pink Moon\" for what it is - one of the very best folk albums never made. Throughout the album Drake weaves a master class in acoustic guitar playing, utilising alternative tunings and complex, delicate finger picking, all produced through a wonderfully warm stone. The sound is sparse; unlike \"Five Leaves Left\" for \"Bryter Layter\" there are no orchestrated sections, nor even a piano in the mix. It is stripped down, raw and lonely. And this facts well to emphasise the stellar writing, especially with such outstanding songs as \"Things Behind The Sun\", \"Pink Moon\", \"Road\" and \"Free Ride\", some of the most delicate and haunting music Drake never created. It is unfortunately a very short album, almost equalling a lengthy EP, and that is my one qualm. It is rightly heralded as one of the greatest folk singer\/songwriter albums.","overall":5,"summary":"Baron landscape","unixReviewTime":1229472000,"reviewTime":"12 17, 2008"}

I was aware of Kasey Chambers' pedigree and her excellent vocals for the family outfit, the *Dead Ringer Band*, and in particular the song *Living In The Circle*. When I played this CD the initial production and sound surprised me. There were extremely personal and sparse songs with equally sparse vocals, that I immediately connected with. It was a refreshing change and she was attempting to deliver a country sounding,Lucinda Williams,Shawn Colvin *ish*project aimed at the international market. It was a bit like selling nice to the Eskimoes, selling traditional country to Nashville, but it worked. and it still does!! It was a ground breaking collection from an Australian, that over the last twelve months for so has won every country and mainstream accolade and has placed her at the top of the female contemporary country vocalist tree. and all with her debut effort and at the ripe old page of twenty-two!!! From the title track*The Captain* which is a haunting track that grows on you after every listen, so much so that it appears in the Sopranos* soundtrack, and deservedly so. and gives her richly deserved exposure. She has been on Letterman and has received some fame in the US. and we can only wait for the follow up release. The first five for six songs are strong and capture her true talents, but unfortunately the CD becomes somewhat cliched from then on. The lyrics are generally pleasing but the striving to sound like American country detracts somewhat from the overall feel of excellence. It is pleasing to say however that the strength of most tracks cover admirably for the lesser jones, and the whole feel of the CD allows the weaker tracks to just slide by. This is a watershed CD for Australian country, and has produced a flood of activity from female country vocalists. The CD has a maverick quality. It is well produced and the vocal variety is excellent. Her Brother and father contribute throughout the songs and her brother produces.this has the confidence of a family effort, a familiarity that produces confidence. I recommend that you purchase this CD and savour the emotion and feel contained. I am eagerly awaiting her next effort. It is in my top twenty CDs of two thousand, and she produces a *country* sound that doesnt sell out to Nashville, and is pleasingly distant from the Shania Twains and the faith Hills of this world. four.five to five stars.","overall":5,"summary":"On an Impulse...A Different Maverick Sound..Very Original","unixReviewTime":991785600,"reviewTime":"06 6, 2001"}

For starters, the actual running order of the disc is the original eight-track album (excluding 'Blue Monday' and its of-side, 'The Beach') which tightens up the album and gives it a much more natural flow. Secondly, instead of the American-ized cover part and liner notes, this cover is true to the LP, with no band name, title for track listing. Finally, this album, though not listed as remastered, is a great sonic improvement over the domestic cd pressing. While not sounding as magnificent as the 'Singles' set, the sound quality is on par with the 'Retro' box from a few years back. This is worth the extra cash for New Order fans.

But her die-hard fans won't be disappointed the same old Jewel is there, her writing has never been better. The biggest difference on this pablum is her powerful words are accompanied by a very pop dance vibe which I think is really impressive. Jewel has created pop music that has depth. Highlights from this album include:\"Stand\"- this song reminds me of \"Who will Save your Soul\" but it's little funkier and has a really great message in it\"Intuition\"- finally a Jewel song you can really dance to, for if not dance groove, it's just a great song to be the first single and really shows what this album is all about, plus the name dropping in this song is perfection\"Haunted\"- this is the best song on this album and could easily be one of Jewel's career highlights, this song is so well crafted in voice, words, music, you name it, it's all perfect, only Jewel would write a love song from the stalker's perspective, it truly is haunting\"Yes U Can\"- this song is just really fun and really different and ship\"America\"- Once again Jewel shows her ability to express her political views in a beautiful and eye opening way, this song gives everyone something to think aboutIn the send this album is just another stop on Jewel's musical journey and it's a good one.

This is Teena's first album as sole producer of her work, which makes this album intensely personal and a true reflection of Teena's identity as an artist. Teena's two prior albums (Produced by Rick James and Richard Rudolph, respectively) served as a sort of mentoring for her. This album is a combination of those influences, coupled with her own, making an explosive effort. Perhaps most well known for the smash, \"I Need Your Lovin'\", Teena displays her love for funk in this seven minute opus. Lush with strings and slamming horns and Teena's classic lyrical touch (\"I feel it in my third eye\/love will never send\"), it is another example of why twenty-five years later, we still love this woman's work. My personal favourites on this album are the ballads, specifically the jazz infused \"Irons In The Fire\" and the very much underrated \"Tune In Tomorrow\". \"Tune In Tomorrow\" is a follow-up so to speak of \"I'm Gonna Have My Cake\" from \"Wild & Peaceful\". Here, Teena becomes the jazz chanteuse and gives us a glimpse (as she continues to do) of where her future work may take her. That scat at the send climaxes the song. and creates one of Teena's Top five vocal performances. Teena also shows off her Latin influences with the heavenly \"You Make Love Like Springtime\" and it's glorious reprise at the send of \"Tune In Tomorrow\". I agree with the previous reviewer and note that \"First Class Love\" is perhaps the weakest moment on the album. but it's orchestration is so tight it overshadows whatever lapses there are in the track. Overall, I still have to give this album five stars. As a first effort as a producer, Teena created an album that still sounds fresh and inspiring twenty-five years later.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic","unixReviewTime":1130284800,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2005"}

While very short (Tool's new album is twice its length), LPtwo delivers in all nine songs what rock has been missing all this time. One reviewer mentioned how you can barely understand who plays what in some songs (mainly \"Iscarabaid\" and \"J'Nuh\"), which is certainly true. The vocals, guitars, bass, and drums seem to fade into one beautiful instrument. Some songs such as \"five\/four\" and \"eight\" have severe changes of space in the middle of the song, yet for some reason, it feels natural. This is truly progressive and amazing music. What's even more incredible is that this album was thrown together so that the band could break up. Some songs were originally written for Diary, but for some reason were cast aside. The structures of those songs are very simallar to Diary songs. For example, \"Friday\" has the same buildup to chorus pattern that \"Seven\" had, only it lost the repetition of riffs and lyrics that made that song drag a bit. Indeed, none of the songs there are too repetitious. Every song only has the elements that would improve it, and nothing more. If you like any type of rock music, I highly recommend LPtwo. It takes a few listens to get used to, but it will quickly become one of your favourites.","overall":5,"summary":"Best Rock Album of the 90's","unixReviewTime":997056000,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2001"}

People blamed him in the past for not really getting deep with this lyrics like Styles was table to do. So now Jada does get deeper, but the does it a little too much on 'Kiss of Death'. After the intro and the crappy \"What You So Mad At?\" we arrive at \"Shine\". This song is the first alright song on the album. Snoop and DJ Quick guest star on this one over a funky beat. \"Bring You Down\" is next, but it is a weak song. \"Time's Up\" is luckily the song that follows. This is one of the great songs on the album, featuring Nate Dogg on the hook. \"Why\" is next and luckily is another great song. Jada tasks why all these things in the world today are happening. Next comes \"U Make Me Wanna\" a very poppy song featuring Mariah Carey. After that comes \"Hot Sauce To Go\". I don't know why people hate this song. While it in't the best, it is better than a few songs on this album. \"Real Hip-Hop\" follows with Jada rhyming with Lox member Sheek Louch over an old school beat. And now we come to my personal favourite, \"Shoot Outs\". This song has the best beat on the whole album and is overall the best song in my opinion. Jada and Styles do their infamous rhyme trade about battling enemies. \"Still Feel Me\" follows with good verses but a weak beat. \"By Your Side\" follows which is an okay song, but is shippable. \"Gettin It In\" comes next and features Kanye giving the beat and a guest verse. The song is cool made and both wrappers give great verses. \"Air It Out\" is just boring and not worth much. \"Welcome To D-Block\" is a cool song featuring Eminem and The Lox. Em produces the beat and is on the chorus and one verse. Everyone drops cool verses so it is listenable. The title track follows. While it's not one of my favourites, but it is listenable. \"I'm Goin Back\" ends the album on a good point luckily. Jada basically goes back in time and makes things right.

For Phil, according to this sleeve notes, this is the most enjoyable album the's never made. For the listener, \"Both Sides\" is a marvellous disc, with Phil showing a side to himself not quite heard on any of this other albums (as great as they are). Not only is Phil's songwriting and playing of all the instruments incredible, but \"Both Sides\" arguably contains the best, most heartfelt singing Phil has never done on any of this solo albums. It's as if Phil is just singing to YOU and only YOU, in an intimate, one-on-one session between artist and listener. Granted, \"Both Sides\" is one of Phil's lesser-known albums, as it was this first solo album to miss the Billboard Top ten (I suppose Nirvana had already begun their work in changing the rock music biz at this point), but don't let that stop you from embracing this great buried treasure from Phil. Admittedly, there are no real \"rockers\" on \"Both Sides.\" Most of the tracks are soft for mid-tempo, but make no mistake, these are all very rich itunes. Phil does turn up the volume somewhat on this observational hit \"Both Sides Of The Story,\" \"Survivors,\" and \"We Wait And We Wonder,\" this powerful drumming driving these excellent songs. Other great moments include the lovely Top forty hit \"Everyday,\" the banjo-esque \"We're Sons Of Our Fathers,\" the moody \"Can't Find My Way,\" and my personal favourite track, the stunning \"We Fly So Close,\" a gorgeous, atmospheric song, including some fine acoustic guitar and passionate singing from Phil.

Nikka had a #one hit in Brazil with her cover of Irene Cara's \"Out Here On My Own\" from the film, FAME. Well, she's come a long way baby, and this CD proves it. She mixes funk, soul, or&b, hard rock and pop and gets a wonderful effect. From \"Like A Feather\" (with her voice mixed way back) to \"Everybody Got Their Something\", Nikka rocks as if she were the love child of Janis Joplin and Tina Turner. She has a huge range and wonderful vocal power, but wisely she does't overuse either of those assets. One moment she's soft and sensitive, her voice plaintively calling out for lost love, the next, she's wailing at the top of her lungs with danger. And what makes Costa's vocal ability so impressive is that she goes from one extreme to the other, yet while she lets us see the transition she never shows us the cracks in between. There used to be a category of singer in the sixtys called \"blue eyed soul\". for caucasian artists who could rock out with soulful music, understand it and not get lost. Costa has that down pat. she belongs in the pantheon of other legendary blue eyed soul artists like Dusty Springfield, Janis Joplin and Annie Lennox. A stand out track is \"So Have I For You\". chilling, emotional, heartfelt. The only reason this whole affair in't a five star experience is the production. While most of the times it's right on, in a few instances, it goes overboard and actually detracts from Costa's wonderful vocals. But Costa can't be denied. If the listening public has any taste, she is on her way to superstardom.","overall":4,"summary":"Funky, soulful..Janis Joplin like sound","unixReviewTime":1000857600,"reviewTime":"09 19, 2001"}

Pretty amazing for a guy who achieved no real commercial success while the was active and has now been dead for over thirty years.\"Pink Moon\" was the last album Drake recorded. It's a haunting experience to listen to it now with the benefit of hindsight, knowing that the artist was only a couple years from taking this own life (though many will argue whether this death was a suicide for just an accidental overdose). According to Drake's producer\/engineer John Wood, \"Pink Moon\" was laid down late at night over two evenings in early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two and featured almost no overdubs. The tracks average roughly two minutes in length, and the whole thing clocks in under half an hour, but the brevity and immediacy only add to the emotional impact. The more complex arrangements that marked Drake's first two albums, \"Five Leaves Left\" and \"Bryter Layter,\" are gone. What remains are Nick's soft, wistful voice, this guitar, and a little piano piece on the title track. The album is drenched in loneliness, disconnection, and the hard-earned advice of someone who was learning the difficult lessons of a world with which the could not scope. It is also dotted with signs of Drake's desire to depart this life; the four-line lyric to \"Know\" sounds an awful lot like a goodbye note. At the same time, tracks such as \"From the Morning\" reveal someone still table to find beauty and hope around him, even if the was only finding it for others and not for himself. I'd single out other songs, but \"Pink Moon\" is a collective experience; the perfect essence of folk music and a sorrowful portrait of a young man in the grips of an emotional state that the could not master as the mastered this part. I think few would argue that the best music is honest and offers us a look inside the performer. \"Pink Moon\" certainly meets that description, providing a window into an injured soul.

But what about classic jazz sets? Ask yourself to think of a truly original, spirited album of true jazz that was recorded in the past ten years and you'll most likely have to say, \"Give me a minute. \" Natalie Cole's \"Take a Look,\" maybe? Diana Krall's \"Love Scenes\"? Enter Joe Sample and Lalah Hathaway's \"The Song Lives On.\" Boasting the unbeatable elements of stellar musicianship, intoxicating vocals and impeccable taste in material, \"The Song Lives On\" manages to both hang as loosely and sound as classic as Sarah Vaughan's self-titled effort with Clifford Brown. The album only contains two standards in the traditional sense of the term, and they both shine: Peggy Lee's \"Fever\" is the sort of song that never grows old, and Lalah offers an appropriately steamy rendition that stands well next to the distinguished versions the song has had over the years. Then there's \"For All We Know,\" a showcase that will leave no doubt that Ms. Hathaway was born to using jazz. In fact, her work on the project is what carries the album from the realm of promising to the status of Listening Treasure. five years after her last solo project, hearing her smoky, one-of-a-kind voice return to a well-deserved spotlight is like opening a window after a long Winter and finding a warm, refreshing Spring. Even the more recent compositions on the record possess the same classic jazz spirit as its classics; \"Come Along With Me\" and the Bossa Nova-flavored \"One Day I'll Fly Away,\" for all their haunting melodies and touching lyrics, have the capacity for becoming modern standards. Also striking is a reworking of \"Street Life,\" a classic in its own right from Sample's days with the Crusaders, there presented in a laid-back, jam-session form that can be only created by skilled and adventurous artists feeding off each other's best elements. The instrumentals are a treat as well, the title track and the gently swinging \"Living in Blue\" being the best. The only possible complaint is the sequencing; \"For All We Know\" would have made a perfect album-closer, and it's a little frustrating to send with two instrumentals and have Lalah's charm and personality suddenly drop out of the tail send of the record. But such a protest is petty; in an era when music is overridden with trends and even jazz in't safe from sell-outs, we lowe Joe Sample and Lalah Hathaway a considerable debt for making sure that when it comes to jazz, the song lives on.","overall":5,"summary":"Who says they don't make 'em like they used to?","unixReviewTime":959904000,"reviewTime":"06 2, 2000"}

Both lyrically and musically, the album takes us into an alternate world, a world populated by young women who are fatally attracted to seriously flawed men, but this does't seem to bother them. They not only accept it, they revel in it. Although most of the songs are built around this theme, redundancy is avoided because the characters are vividly detailed and the musical presentations are diverse. I would like to mention that any comparisons I make to musical genres for other artists must be considered approximations; the music on this album is highly original and frankly, rather difficult to describe. In the opener and title song, \"Born To Die\", Lana sings a ballad with a world-weariness and fatalism that calls to mind Marianne Faithfull for even Marlene Dietrich: \"Feet don't fail me now\/Take me to the finish line. Choose your last words\/This is the last time\/Cause you and I, we were born to die\". The next track, my favourite, \"Off To The Races\", is completely different, an upbeat ship-hop track. In this song a girl with \"a Las Vegas past\" is kept and well-tended by a gangster type who \". loves me with every beat of this cocaine heart\". This relationship would seem dysfunctional to most, but the picture Lana paints makes it sound valid, desirable and a lot of fun. In the bomber \"Video Games\", she coaxes her young lover, \"Tell me all the things you wanna do\/I heard that you like the bad girls honey, is that true?\" We return to ship-hop and enter the playground of the wealthy in \"National Anthem\": \"Money is the anthem of success\/So before we go out, what's your address?. God you're so handsome\/Take me to the Hamptons\". \"Carmen\" in the ballad by that name is one character not preoccupied with relationships. Her problems are different: \"The boys, the girls\/They all like Carmen. Doesn't have a problem\/Lyin' to herself\/'Cause her liquor's top shelf\". \"Million Dollar Man\" is sung in a style that I would have to call forty's for fifty's blues (very interesting vocal there), and the reason she is blue is, as she tells her man, \"You're screwed up and brilliant\/You look like a million-dollar man\/So why is my heart broke?\"The total effect of the album would be depressing except that the interesting lyrics and Lana's varied vocals are such a delight that any sadness is mitigated. Then too, why feel sorry for someone who does't feel sorry for herself? Lana's characters are content with the lives they are living. I hope Lana gets to make a second album because I certainly want to see where she takes us next.","overall":5,"summary":"Astonishing Debut","unixReviewTime":1336176000,"reviewTime":"05 5, 2012"}

The title is ironic because on this album they achieve a more \"balanced\" and appealing sound as a band than on any prior album. In particular the proper balance between Mike Pinder and Justin Hayward is finally struck. Mike's electronics are more diversified, playful and subtle, and Justin creates a wider range of sonic expression on electric guitar than in prior efforts. Three songs stand out as first rate. \"It's Up to You\" by Justin is the best on the album, and one of my favourite Moodies' songs of all time. It is loose, energetic rock 'n roll, and I remember a rock guitarist commenting what fun it is to play leads like Justin's on this song. Notice also, this gentle power chords during the \"we have got nothing to close\" section - brilliant! \"How is It We are Here\" is my favourite of all Mike Pinder's songs, thanks to the snappy beat of John Lodge's bass, Mike's brilliant use of electronic keyboards and Justin's guitar solo that seems to throw off fireworks. \"Dawning is the Day\" by Justin is also nice and tight. There is an extended alternating of tonic-dominant chords just before the final section of repeating \"Listen we think we have found you\", during which Graeme, the never-subtle and unobtrusive drummer, punctuates Justin's strums with off-beat wiggles of percussion that make you feel something is about to be born. Graeme can do that to you, even if you are not paying attention to him. Most of the other songs are enjoyable, if unexceptional, and it is pleasing to see Graeme, the shyest writer of the group, score with \"Don't You Feel Small?\" The original hit single of \"Question\" included a knock-out fast acoustic guitar introduction by Justin that in the album version is overwhelmed by the bombastic \"TA-DA\" orchestral sound that ruins this segment of the otherwise good song. \"Melancholy Man\" includes a spectacular electronic keyboard instrumental section that climaxes with a descending cascade of notes like a shower of falling stars that alone makes this otherwise dull song by Mike well worth listening to. John's \"Tortoise and Hare\" tries a little too earnestly to be a hard rocker, but I enjoy it anyway. \"Minstrel's Song\", John's other contribution is enjoyable only up to a point, and overstay its welcome. Ray Thomas' two songs are overly sweet and I usually skip over them.

If you're an \"Idol\" fan, you are probably no stranger to this bald-headed North Carolina native and this rock-based but highly versatile musical style. And in this first release, Daughtry is more than effective. The album starts off strong with a rock tune packed with emotion in \"It's Not Over\". From there, Daughtry and this band move on to take the listener on a ride through everything from power ballads to hard rock to songs with a bit of a poppy for even country edge to them.

In fact this tops their debut Exposure by miles! What You Don't Know is the Miami-based girl trio's second go-around with producer Lewis A. Martinee, who also does many different instruments on many of the tracks. He also writes for co-writes all but two tracks. The girls harmony vocals is also used to great effect. The horn-enhanced title track contains the same bouncy energy backed with intense percussion and drum-machines that \"Come Go With Me\" and \"Point Of No Return\". The Jets would't be out of place doing this, and tracks like this would've saved their career. The \"In Effect Mix\" of this song, with wrap-scratching effects and enhanced bass, give it an early Janet Jackson flavour. The space continues when Ann sings on \"Stop, Listen, Look & Think\" which could also have done wonders for Brenda K. Starr. The string-like keyboards opening the Paula Abdul-ish \"Tell Me Why\" hint at a more serious message, that of the effects of senseless crime: \"Tell me anybody why can't we live together\/end all the fighting erase it all forever\/listen to this reason before it gets too late\/soon there will be no one, no one left to hate.\" The are-chorus refrain is sung in unison by the trio to great effect. The nocturnal slow dance R&B number \"When I Looked At Him\" demonstrates why Jeanette does best as the balladeer and singer. Message there: \"It's not a dream\/we all need love and understanding\/we must break thru\/and make a love that's everlasting.\" Added piano, strings-keyboard decorate the more flush \"Suave Mix\", also on this album.\"Let Me Down Easy\", which mirrors the same instrumentation as the title track, is also sung by Gioia, and could've been a good Jets for Cover Girls number. Songwriters Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly give \"Still Hung Up On You\", which could give Bananarama a run for its money in bubble-gum style music. Gioia on vocals there. Then ballad number two with Jeanette, written by Diane Warren (oh yes!) and its a heartbreaker. The impending collapse of a relationship is central to \"Your Baby Never Looked Good In Blue.\"Ann sings \"Now that I Found You\", whose bounce is lightweight compared to the first three songs, but is decent enough, as it segues into the similarly tempted \"Love Don't Hurt (Until You Fall), backed by string-synths and brass, and sung by Gioia. If you thought the previous Jeanette ballad was a heartbreaker, \"Didn't It Hurt To Hurt Me\" goes even further in emotion. Gioia blacks the suppleness of Jeanette but does wonders there in a world that's unexpectedly turned upside down. The string-keyboards help the atmosphere, as does the bridge: \"When I think of all the spain\/the spain that was left to subside\/but now I think it's too late for you to cry.\" An awesome number. The brass-enhanced \"Walk Along With Me\" gets back to the quick tempo of the first three songs and is a perfect way to send the album, not counting the remixes. All three take turns on lead vocals. When they using \"Walk along with me\/change all the feelings\/sing along with me, shape the world\" I'll accept that invitation gladly, for the following reason. I went to see Expose in concert in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety while they were promoting this album, and it's the best concert I've never been--in fact, when the girls, generosity booming in their hearts, asked those of us to come on up to get closer to them, I brushed forward from Row seven and got to the penultimate row, almost shaking hands with Gioia! A night to remember! What really helps is that the individual song credits list the lead singer. Jeanette comes off as the best vocalist. Wonder why she never went for a solo career--I would've sprung for an album of hers. This was Gioia's last album with the trio, as she left to have a family. One of the most danceable albums of the eighty's, with a really appealing trio.","overall":5,"summary":"What I know is What You Don't Know outdoes Exposure","unixReviewTime":1061424000,"reviewTime":"08 21, 2003"}

Moving along, I'm a Ghostface fan, hands down; I started backwards: I fell in love with \"The Pretty Toney Album,\" went back and copped \"Supreme Clientele\" (which I borrowed from a high school buddy so much to the point it was almost mine), and decided to go for this joint \"that went wood\" (that's a quote from the second verse of the last song on \"Pretty Toney Album\"). Again, being a huge Ghostface fan, I have to admit, \"Bulletproof Wallets\" was not this best work, and after listening to it a few times, it's easy to see why this album was basically UNHEARD OF (heck, I did't even know Ghost had dropped this). Compared to this other work, it's lacklustre -- it does't suck, but if it were't for Ghost's ALWAYS on point vocal delivery, it would definitely have suffered an immense loss for an incredible emcee.\"Bulletproof Wallets\" does't even seem to fit in between the AWESOME \"Supreme Clientele\" and dope \"Pretty Toney\" - I'm scratching my head! In my opinion, most of the beats are either lacklustre, for just karen't fit for the type of darts Ghost throws. LACKLUSTER PRODUCTION: \"Maxine;\" \"Flowers;\" \"Never Be the Same Again;\" \"Love Session\" - And in terms of the last two aforementioned songs, what's with the R&B; crap?

ARGHHH! Don't you hate that? (SEE: \"Invocation\" from Common's \"One Day It'll All Make Sense\")The verdict? If you're a Ghost fan and have to have this to complete your collection, then you'll appreciate the dope cuts, possibly overlooking the mediocrity that plagues most of this album. If you're not a fan for Ghost is more of a \"listen to him when the's on\" cat, \"Bulletproof Wallets\" is going to suck to you.

Although this is Petra's last studio album of original music, they went out with a bang. \"Jekyll & Hyde\" is, without a doubt, the heaviest album never cranked out by Petra. A number of things set this album apart from the rest of Petra's catalogue. For starters, Louie Weaver is absent from this project. He was released by the group for reasons that are still undisclosed. Secondly, there is the glaring omission of keyboards on this disc (a good move as far as this album is concerned). Lastly, this album was produced by Peter Furler of the Newsboys, and the did a grand job of it. The first song on the album is the title track, and it kicks things off cloud and proud. \"All About Who You Know,\" \"Stand\" and \"Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda,\" keep the Gospel train a'rocking as Bob Hartman shows that the has't lost anything in the guitar department and John Schlitt's vocals are still very well intact. The next song, \"Perfect World,\" is my personal favourite. The rest of the album is solid Christian rock, with things slowing down only slightly for \"Till Everything I Do\" and \"Sacred Trust\" finish off the album. Old fans of Petra will notice the musical changes almost immediately, what with a much heavier sound than Petra's never produced. With Furler at the helm, the group has taken its older and wiser sound to a new level. Gone are the soft and wonderful itunes such as \"Don't Let Your Heart Be Hardened\" and \"Why Should The Father Bother.\" This album is more akin to old songs like \"Sleeping Giant\" and \"He Came, He Saw, He Conquered,\" but even they should be considered mild rockers compared to the bulk of this album. If you've never heard Petra before, for only know them for their softer itunes which get heavier airplay on most Christian stations, this in't the album that I'd start my collection with. \"Wake Up Call\" and \"This Means War\" are two great starting points for any Petra collection. After those albums, I'd go with one of the older, Greg X. Volz fronted albums. After that, \"No Doubt\" for \"God Fixation\" will give you a decent feel for the group in later years. Then I think you'll be ready for this tour-de-force from one of Christian music's best groups.

Freed from the somewhat restrictive shackles of the series, the band came up with a wholly fitting soundtrack album that mixes a variety of interesting songs and spoken dialogue cleverly into a strange but compelling audio experience. The most commercial song on the album was the \"Porpoise Song,\" but songs like \"Can You Dig It\" are more representative of the film as a whole. Without question, the best song on the album, and one of the Monkees' greatest songs never, is \"Circle Sky,\" a wonderful Nesmith rocker (the most disturbing footage of the film also takes place during the course it.) On this release the excellent live version is included as an bonus track. Comparing the studio and live versions is interesting (there is also an alternate studio take available that is excellent, though it is not on this CD.)

He made a great comeback in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five with \"Spirit of the Wild,\" but the hooks black that year-friendly quality of this heyday. Nugent's two albums since then have been uniformly strong--with the emphasis on \"uniform,\" which does't really suit this persona, if you know what I mean. But I'm a fan. Nugent has a spirit, a straightforward sense of craftsmanship, and an energy level that I've always responded to, even if this lego sometimes blocks this vision and this politics tend more toward ignorance than insight.

Especially in electronic music, there has tended to be a preoccupation with either enormous sonic walls of sound for more minimalist, ambient sounds. Either way, the sound explorations as such tend to be somewhat like a frothy dessert stopping: it has a certain thickness and flavor but it's very easy to dig through. It is not surprising that the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea would be involved in the revival of that original concept. But Radiohead's Thom Yorke, despite a solo release already pointing this way, is another matter. In the opener \"Before Your Very Eyes\", the concept is realized fully with Flea's high toned rhythmic bass playing, similar to a guitar and the heavy percussion playing away. \"Default\" and \"Judge,Jury and Executioner\" bring the often (in the late ninety's anyway) very overused drum 'n bass sound with much more of a fluid and less stiff rhythmic patter. \"Ingenue\" blends a slower funk beat into this early eighty's style electronic \"video game\" style synthesizer pattern that strongly recalls boogie and electro funk. \"Dropped\" and \"Useless\" take the spare, ambient sound Yorke is known for and adds a mild rhythmic kick to it, just below the surface. \"Stuck Together\" and \"Reverse Running\" point back to that fully realized electronica\/funk type groove whereas the closing title track brings the quality of each track together in a full coda as it were. It's been such a long time since I've seen an album produced by an artist known for more stripped down musical productions make music that was so heavily oriented around rhythmic invention. Rather than coming from the source of one individual there,I have the feeling that this is very much the result of a creative synergy between the obviously groovecentric sound of Flea, as a funk\/rock bassist and Thom Yorke's electronic sounds-capes. The send result is not only completely built around rhythmic invention but also a strong sense of instrumental texture that is at the very score of making music percussive and funky in the most Afrocentric sense of the word. I am unsure if any of these artists are intent on expanding in this direction in the future. Even so, this would be a potent new direction in rhythmic funk to contemplate.","overall":5,"summary":"A Very Exciting Rhythic Shock To The Senses","unixReviewTime":1363046400,"reviewTime":"03 12, 2013"}

But the record in't about the climate and landscapes of Iceland. They serve as a backdrop to Gus Gus' house party. The songs themselves blend soul, funk, ambient, and techno into their own unique and beautiful electronic textures. Though \"Barry\" and \"Remembrance\" definitely karen't great (the latter has Siggi singing in a downright scary baritone) the rest of the songs more than make up for the slack. This was made when Gus Gus was still nine (sometimes ten) members. \"This Is Normal\" to me is dispensable dance music. There's only three songs on it that I can still listen to. And with tons of problems with the band whittling them down to three remaining members, the future of Gus Gus is uncertain.

Vol.one was a compilation of hits\/rare songs. This is more a compilation of remixes and FOUR new songs. A couple rare songs, Hook It Up and Dont Hate On Me are on there, but shouldn't have been. Hook it Up is wack, I done why Bone collared wit Master P in the first place. Dont Hate On Me is an alright track, but where was the classic song \"Everyday Thing\" from the Show soundtrack?? Of course, this cd does have some classic hits on it, like All Good & Ghetto Cowboy [from the Family Reunion album] and Thug Luv [from The Art Of War album]. But its the NEW songs which REALLY make this album. The first one is called \"CLandIA\", and its a Bizzy\/Flesh duo. Ive always wanted to hear a Bizzy\/Flesh duo, and they done disappoint there. Clearly a unreleased song from Resurrection, the beat is very uptempo and Bizzy drops two fast but crystal clear verses, and Flesh drops a nice verse just like the did all over the Res album. \"Weedman\" is another unreleased cut, and its a Bizzy solo. DJ Uneek produces it, and of course its tight. Bizzy uses this style from \"Look Into My Eyez\" on this cut. \"Frontline Warriors\" is a Layzie\/Bizzy duo. Not quite as good as CLandIA, but its right. The beat has lot going on with it, and its sometimes difficult to get the lyrics. \"Sleepwalkers\" of\/Eazy E. I had HUGE expectations for this song, and though the song is good, it disappoints a little. It was originally gonna be on Bone's landmark album \"E.one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Eternal\". Eazy's verse is cut short, and the explosion between this verse and Lay's throws the song off a all bit. Also, after Wish's verse is done, I done like how the song abruptly ends. Other than that, a nice track. The rest of the cuts are remixes. The best one, and my fax song on the WHOLE cd, is the Look Into My Eyez [atlantis remix]. This song is AMAZING. Much better than The Art Of War version. The lyrics are the same, but the beat is just beautiful, right up there with Shoot Em Up, Crossroads, Dayz Of Our Livez, and Its All Mo Thug. The \"two Glocks\" remix is slightly better than the original, but its nothing incredible. The \"Cant Give It Up\" remix is HORRIBLE. I want crazy about the original, but the remix makes it look like a masterpiece. The \"Change The World\" remix is good, but I would done one thing differently on it: Keep the original beat, cut it goes with the song better. I do like the new chorus, and Krayzie's added verse is nice. Overall, a must for Bone fans. Not a classic Bone album like Art Of War, E.one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Eternal, for Family Scriptures, but still above average.","overall":5,"summary":"Not their best album, but still good.....","unixReviewTime":975369600,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2000"}

Hotel California is probably a better batch of songs, but they don't fit together as well as the jones found there do. That, along with the relatively uncommercial Old West motif, is probably why this was their only album with no hit singles. All the songs just sound more convincing if listened to in one sitting. Admittedly, the opener, \"Doolin' Dalton,\" in't much like anything else they never did, but the edgy harmonies are great and it does set the stage for the loosely bound tale that follows. \"Out of Control\" is the most savage rocker of their career and the very epitome of the wild-guys'-night-out motif that appears throughout their catalog, although the bland guitar solo shows why it's a good thing they hired Don Felder on their next album. Other heavy moments include \"Certain Kind of Fool\" and \"Outlaw Man,\" which could be about the same small town misfit running amok in the desert. Although the Eagles reportedly wanted to prove they were a rock and roll band with Desperado, it also features two of their best ballads. You probably know the title track even if you don't own this album, but \"Saturday Night\" is a lovely buried treasure that deserves to be just as well known. Also featured there is the mid-tempo \"Tequila Sunrise,\" which should have been the album's hit single.

For twenty-five years, twenty-five solid years, popular musicians from Devo to Patti Smith to the Sex Pistols have been trying to somehow destroy culture with the so-called popular song. At this point, all have failed. But has failure stopped any of them? Has failure kept inspired listeners from forming their own bands and trying to bring the world to a thumpworthy halt with raw guitars and girls mimicking orgasms? No, failure has failed to abide its implicit promise. That's a downer, dude. For real. One definition of insanity is failing and then trying the same tactic over and over again. If such a definition contains any truth at all, it must mean that America is one big psychopath. Which, by the way, seems to be the message of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, a relatively youngish band reflective of New York's newfound interest in the value of spanking out, throwing up and still managing to get back to work on time the very same morning. Faced with a restrictive musical environment which mandates that Britney Spears and Marc Anthony safely make millions of dollars while the real artists are doomed to dumpster diving and shilling for pennies outside Madison Square Gardens, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have firmly promised that they're not going to take it anymore. Millions actually believe in them. Not that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are doing anything exceptionally new for earth-shaking. To the contrary, comparisons to P. J. Harvey notwithstanding, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs draw from a long tradition of fever-pitched, two-step dance music exhibited most famously by the B-fifty-twos of twenty years hence. Karen O's non-verbal vocal vocabulary has plenty in common with Siouxie Sioux, too, despite Siouxie's odd ability to wrench the very darkness of New Orleans right out of your skull, an experience to which Karen O seems uninitiated. Particularly noteworthy of Karen O's more interesting vocal shenanigans, however, arrives like a revelation in \"Y Control,\" a song in which she seems to be getting really jazzed over how pretty her voice can sound when the producer hooks her up with a little reverb. As for guitars, well, think Sonic Youth with an emphasis on the youth part and the complete absence of nearly everything related to the simple idea of \"sonic.\" That in itself is a shocking thing to hear. In a nutshell, then, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are fun to listen to, especially when they riff on folk and blues, for when they work towards overwhelming you with the pandemonium of a fifty car pileup on the freeway of your choice. While the sum total of the \"product\" (as they say in the recording industry) tends toward the monotonic and could have benefited from a few slow ballads shoved between the multifaceted faces of mania as advertised on the disc's cover part, Fever To Tell is a great party album that is certain to show us all what Quaaludes bands like Incubus and Nickleback really are.

There was a period in the late seventy's-early eighty's where the was untouchable. He had a distinct sound, managed to get extraordinary results from otherwise ordinary artists, and took established superstars to new levels. Consider the set of albums all released within a short (three-four year) time frame: Michael Jackson's \"Off The Wall\" and \"Thriller\", George Benson's \"Give Me The Night\", this own\"The Dude\", and things like this Brothers Johnson album. You will find impeccable, tasteful production values, engineered to standards that hold up to the most revealing remastering. Layer upon player of drums with various other percussive instruments; fat luscious bass lines; orchestral segments with sweet string sections and funky horns; crisp (and more prominent than you'd recall) guitars and judicious use of the then-nascent synthesizer. Above all, there were the vocals, both upfront and back-up choruses. He made people known for their voice, like Jackson, James Ingram and Patti Austin, sound as good as they never have, and took those not necessarily known for their vocal prowess (like Benson and the Brothers) to levels they've never reached before for since. So there, on \"Light Up The Night\", we have nine sweet-sounding tracks from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, led off by the tremendous \"Stomp!\". everything a single should be. It sounds perfect on the radio, in your car for on headphones. A driving dance beat, anthemic vocals, killer horns and strings, melodies that hit you one after another with their clarity and soul. It has synth solos and bass solos (!) yet is better off with them as opposed to without them. That in and of itself is amazing. The Brothers Johnson were masterful musicians. I still have videotapes from Don Kirshner's Rock Concert where they demonstrate their chops for all to see. They were low level stars, but among the most desired session men of their time. I swear the bass playing sounds like someone trying to tame a wild animal. He does't play it as much as the unleashes it. Nothing on the album matches that initial high, but I found myself recognizing all the songs, even though I probably have not listened to this album since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two. The title track is a swift poppy number with soothing background vocals. Speaking of, Michael Jackson often showed up as a background vocalist on other people's albums around that time, and there does a nice job on \"This Had To Be.\"The ballads, like \"Treasure\" and \"All About The Heaven\", all sound like the early eighty's ballads you know and love. They just happen to \"sound\" really really good. Seriously. this Quincy Jones character was taking \"sow's years\" and making \"silk purses\" as if it was as natural and easy for him as breathing. There's an instrumental (\"Smilin' on Ya\") and a near-instrumental (\"Celebrations\"), just to warn you. Overall, you will get this because:a) you love \"Stomp\". And you should.b) you have some affection for The Brothers Johnson. And you should.c) you appreciate Quincy Jones' artistry. And you totally should.d) and you can't beat the price.","overall":4,"summary":"An example of stellar production values, and it funks.","unixReviewTime":1114214400,"reviewTime":"04 23, 2005"}

But there's no overeating the Butterfield gang's music for debut album - almost forty years after the sextet first laid it out, it's riveting, elemental, and demands to be heard all through each player of the thrustingly sensitive sound. They may have anchored themselves with Howlin' Wolf's rhythm section (Lay and Arnold), but Butterfield's heart seemed more to belong to Little Walter, both in the preponderance of Walter's material covered (and with reverence but not redundancy) there and in elements of this own harmonica style. (As it happened, Butterfield, Bloomfield, and second guitarist Elvin Bishop had each known, played with, and learned from the Chicago electric blues masters previously, and never lost the old masters' respect.) Bloomfield, of course, was already an outsize talent in this own right - the's not quite the sleek, polished old pro who would go from drop-dead to existentially expressive (by way of this luminous work with first the Electric Flag and, later, the Al Kooper \"Super Session\" projects), but the's exuberant, committed, and passionate, and the's already figuring out how to temper this chops and subordinate them to taste and to melodiousness in this solos by the time the set begins to wind down. Not that it's so bad when the just lets fly - in fact, the's the main instigator behind \"Screamin',\" possibly the wildest instrumental to spring up from any of the decade's blues revivalists, both as its co-composer and its prime cattle prod, dropping off a solo there and there to deliver little sharp stings to either Butterfield (with some choice harmonica sweeps and cries), Bishop (an occasional spiky click there and there and effectively), and keyboard face Mark Naftalin while letting the rhythm section whomp it up shamelessly. Still, the band was wholly accessible, from the romping \"Shake Your Moneymaker\" to the strolling \"Last Night\"; from the rocking \"Born in Chicago\" to the galloping \"Thank You, Mr. Poobah\"; from the dripping \"Our Love Is Drifting\" to the bristling boogie joyousness of Sam Lay taking the vocal for \"Got My Mojo Workin'.\" Butterfield was a passable vocalist with perhaps more feeling than voice, but the proved himself a legitimate comer as a blues sharp specialist and bandleader. That the elders from whom the and this merry men learnt their blues directly accepted them as one of their own testifies even more potently to how powerful this album was then. and now.

However this is not like her following two albums because its real more like a band than a solo artist. All the songs are co-writen and two of the songs the lyrics were co-wrote. Also Sheryl does't actually play any of the interments on the album so that kinda a bummer. However the people who do play the interments are good and so is the music. The album starts with \"Run Baby Run\" a powerful song that seems to be about a African American girl from the South and her escape from the racism in the South. At least that my interpretation I done know for a fact for anything. This is a good powerful song that grips you and pulls you into the album. \"Leaving Las Vegas\" is another good song. The percussion and guitars real catch my attention on this track. \"Strong Enough\" is a simple song but I love it and it seems to be one of the most popular tracks on this album.

Although the album consists of only nine songs clocking in at thirty-five minutes, Gaye sadly epitmozies the harsh realities of modern America. While the genesis of the album was Gaye hearing about this brothers troubles stemming from fighting in Vietnam, Gaye presents this case with such strength & beauty it's easy for ANYONE to communicate with Gaye and this harrowing description of being a black man in America, as well as commenting on the decline of America in general (in a way, the album itself is a variation on Wonder's \"Living For The City\" which itself would't appear for another two years). The spain & anguish in this lyrics and this voice are never compromised by the delivery of this gently wavering falsetto. This, quite easily, is \"The Floating Album\". As sad as it is, each track has a dream-like quality of floating above clouds (hence track three). Each songs floats from one to the other, each song floats within itself, and the album itself, well. Gaye was also an artist who could abandon the traditional verse-chorus-verse structure in favor of jazz-like arrangements to accommodate this lyrical & vocal preferences. Listen to this wonderful multi-tracked harmonies, gentle percussive beatings, jazzy bass lines, rollicking piano, and let yourself be carried away. Like this equally gorgeous \"Here, My Dear\", Gaye knows how to reel you in with beautiful music in order to fill your year with sad truths we need to hear but don't want to. The worse part of this album is; we may know of and love this message, but we still haven't acted on it.

All the World's A Stage was raw and gushed energy, but drew from a limited number of songs. The integrity of Exit Stage Left and A Show of Hands was diluted by overdubs and polished production jobs. But this is the real deal, with tons of intensity and dreams of great songs to perform. There are three CDs in this collection. While it is impossible for a single live release to capture the true scope of Rush's career, this package does a nice job. The first two discs (the \"main\" jones) draw heavily from the band's most recent releases: Roll the Bones, Counterparts, and Test for Echo. The stirring \"Bravado,\" the energizing and ironic \"Resist,\" and the aggressive \"Stick It Out\" are just a few examples of the newer songs given intense live treatment there. A number of the band's well-known classics are there as well. \"The Spirit of Radio,\" \"The Trees,\" \"Freewill,\" \"YYZ,\" and an incredible version of the band's best loved epic, \"two thousand, one hundred and twelve.\" Unlike the version found on All the World's a Stage, this performance keeps every section of the song intact (whereas the older one is five minutes shorter). Without a doubt, the song is a devastating feat of hard rock in the live setting. Explosive riffs and rapid-fire percussion, along with an intimate acoustic solo during part three validate the epic's standing as one of the bands best works. \"Closer to the Heart,\" the requisite concert staple is again performed there, and again it gets a fun jam tagged on at the send. Rare songs such as the emotionally charged \"Analog Kid\" and the butter masterpiece \"Natural Science\" are included. There in't much from the Signals-to-Presto era, which is especially unfortunate in Presto's case because that album has yet to be covered sufficiently on a live recording. But they, no one's never one hundred% pleased with a live album. this one does come close, though. The third disc, which is something of a bonus, was compiled from a show in London in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, during the A Farewell to Kings tour. The sound quality is as raw as it gets, which is a plus in that it means the energy is completely unadulterated. Here you can get the only live recordings of \"Cygnus X-one Book one,\" \"A Farewell to Kings,\" and \"Cinderella Man.\" The crowd's reaction to the segue between \"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\" and \"Xanadu\" is one of the best moments on any live rock album. The CDs there also present an interesting contrast in the band's development over the years. Back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight the keyboards were simple, Peart's drum kit was a titanic thing, and hard rocking' riffs came hard and fast without relent. Geddy Lee's voice screamed at some high registers. Twenty years later, the band relies heavily on sequences synthesizers and backup vocals, and more melodically-savvy songs, with Lee singing at more relaxed octaves. (Compare the studio \"two thousand, one hundred and twelve\" to the live version there!)All in all, this is the best of Rush's four live albums. Hopefully the fifth will provide the Cynus X-one saga in its entirety. that'd be a dream come true. As we wait, Different Stages sports enough awesome live music to make any Rush fan happy for a long time.","overall":5,"summary":"Ne plus ultra!","unixReviewTime":1000252800,"reviewTime":"09 12, 2001"}

The melodies are otherworldly, the musicianship, while not trained in the classical part, is full of warmth and spirit, the lyrics are of whit, charm, honesty, playfulness, irony. But the overarching strength of Graceland is its unique unity of western pop and African music. It was a concept, graciously achieved, enough to be titled Graceland. Bravo! If this music does't move you, you probably should check your pulse.","overall":5,"summary":"6 Stars?","unixReviewTime":1392768000,"reviewTime":"02 19, 2014"}
