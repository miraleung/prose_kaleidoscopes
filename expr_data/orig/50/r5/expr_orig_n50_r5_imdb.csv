It reminded me very much of those predictable English comedies of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys. I won't bother with a synopsis of the plot, I suggest you do something else for ninety minutes",negative
49964,"I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything I would expect from a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie. Its campy and very funny. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. The plot is wacky, an American business man goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves/brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an sex-KGB turned cabbie. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge this death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent. The movie has all the great Bruce Campbell slap stick and humour. The movie is somewhat predictable, I knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer. However I did't go to see this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar winning script, I went to see it because it was a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie and I was not disappointed in the least. I highly recommend that you go see him on this book tour for wait and watch it on the sci-fi channel next month. Although before the movie the said the Sci-Fi channel did cut some of the movie out to make it TV friendly. If you are a fan of Bruce, I highly recommend it.",positive
48152,"Think of this film as fan service, a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer. We start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film. Flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins: The virginal Mandy Lane is coveted by every jock and nerd in her school, and gets invited to spend a weekend at a branch by three guys who think they can get lucky, and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size. So. you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night, who want to do nothing but have sex, do drugs and drink booze. The only other company is a chunky branch-hand who may for may not be suffering from Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm. potential future suspect maybe? So as you're probably ascertained by now, all the house-guests send up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways, and for a change the black man ISN'T the first to die. There are some conventions that still hold up though, like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field. Or the flights going out mysteriously in the evening as your 'heroes' unwisely separate to tackle the problem. Even down to the so-called shocking twist at the send, the movie is like an old eighty's horror updated for the noughties, and on this score it succeeds. Unfortunately, it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too, namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise. People get cut up, shot, bludgeoned etc but because of their innate gratefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations, it's hard to care as the bodies stack up. Someone gets murdered, one of their friends goes out to look for them alone, BANG they're brown bread. Rinse, then repeat. Maybe one day we'll get a screenplay with plausible, intelligent, likable characters who make rational decisions but still send up being outwitted by a genius killer. Until then, we have to tolerate teenagers with the I. Q of pond-life being picked off by a deranged hoodie. Oh well. four/ten",negative

The Conan-wannabe must do battle with an evil guy in a Cher wig, and protect the Earth from the Geometric Nucleus, a sort of primitive atomic bomb.

26388,"Whoa! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, did I mention terrible? You can tell just by the DVD cover not to get this movie, but unfortunately that was't the case for me. Well, someone brought this home for me to watch, and when I looked at it I just wanted to strangle the person, because they used my money. I will certainly be taking it back soon, but I might as well tell you about it while I have it in memory, for I definitely want to forget it. This movie does't deserve to even be called horrible. It's beyond horrible. Quite possibly, the worst film never. The acting was so, so, so, so horrifically disgusting, as well as the deaths being so ENTIRELY flame and predictable. I did't even laugh at how bad this movie was, which kind of frightens me a little. Don't see this film, shame on you if you're even looking at this movie page, and I have EXTREME pity for you if you're looking at this movie page, because you think this will be DECENT. Final word: YUCK!!!!!!!!!!",negative
2315,"Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, I find this movie to be particularly grating. Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I found Crosby's continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first, trite after a while and then finally annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not anti-American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave, ooh so smart American visitor to show them the way. It's a ""fish out of water"" story, but unlike most movies of this sort, this time it's the ""fish"" who has the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the movie, I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time.(I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that, too, produced the same reaction in me. And to my surprise even my wife - who for what's it's worth is American - found the ""in your face"" attitude of American Crosby to be irritating. One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.) As for the premise of the movie, it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good. The scenery and the music is also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks horrid (picture Moe of The Three Stooges). All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because the is in virtually every shot it's pretty hard to sit through this movie.",negative

17889,"This episode so far is the best of the series. The story was told perfectly. I especially liked how the writers made it a Desmond episode; it was this best performance to date and the definitely deserved the Emmy for this performance. We had some of your questions answered in this episode, but since the show is called Lost we know there will be more questions brought up too. First the answered: Walt is reunited finally with this father Michael, second, Michael's betrayal is exposed to Jack, Sawyer, Kate, and Hurly and because of this betrayal Kate, Jack, and Sawyer are all taken captive by The Others. This was a great way to send the show. On the other side of the island we see Locke going through a mental breakdown with the button. This leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down. However there are some unanswered questions: first, what happened to Locke, Eko, and Desmond when Desmond turned the failsafe key and what was the deal with the scientists in the Arctic searching for electromagnetic annamolies. Guess we'll find out next season, however great ending to the best show on TV.",positive
15540,"In this film, made JUST as the production code was being enforced, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is the wisecracking, man-chasing sidekick ""Kitty"". Girl from Missouri starts out with the girls getting on a train, with Eadie making a promise to herself to learn money while looking for a millionaire husband, staying whole-some in the process. It does't take her long to meet up with Frank Cousins, (Lewis Stone, was the kindly Doctor in Grand Hotel, as well as Judge Hardy in the ""Andy Hardy"" films.), but all is not as it seems. The censors must have LOVED Harlow's line ""A girl could't accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged."" Later, someone says ""You know we've never been alone together"" and Eadie replies ""Yeah, and we're not going to be!"" Lionel Barrymore is T. R. Paige, another rich, uppercrust who comes to her rescue when trouble comes looking for Eadie. At one point, Paige declares ""You bought scratch me off your list - I'm not a ladies man"". I wonder what that line would have been just a couple years earlier before the Hayes code came rolling into town. What was the really saying? Carol Tevis seems to be the high-pitched ""Baby Talker"" as listed in the credits on IMDb. Looks like she was only in showbiz from one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-one - one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine, with ""Munchkin"" in Wizard of Oz being the last part she played. Fun, clearcut romp as the girls chase men around the country. Look for Nat Pendleton as the lifeguard, who was an Olympic Wrestler one thousand, nine hundred and twenty (silver medal winner) turned film star (he was in many of the Dr. Kildares, and would appear in four of Harlow's films.) Mistaken identity, plot twists, a young Franchot Tone, love stories, even Jean Harlow in a bathing suit in ""Palm Beach"", although the outdoor scenes of downtown appear to be a backdrop.",positive
15283,"Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this movie called "" The Last Wave "" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from this own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic send world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it's frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted, in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers. Good silent drama. ****",positive
17,"This movie made it into one of my top ten most awful movies. Horrible. There was't a continuous minute where there was't a fight with one monster for another. There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. Examples>The ghost scene at the send was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. >The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait. it hypnotize (stings) its victim and wraps them up. uh hello????>And the whole machine tvs. humans theme WAS the Matrix. or Terminator. There are more examples but why waste the time? And will someone tell me what was with the Nazi's?!?! Nazi's???? There was a juvenile story line brushed to a juvenile conclusion. The movie could not decide if it was a children's movie for an adult movie and was't much of either. Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.",negative
19240,"I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the factors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was this first movie and the did an outstanding job as Achoo. The characters were all very well planned out and all added their own little quirks to the movie. I highly recommend that you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some close friends!",positive
26137,"Me being of Irish origins, loved this movie, Not only was the guy hot and funny the was also sincere and honest. I loved the girl who the fell in love with too, she was pretty. They were such a cute couple. The ending was so sad. Love this movie! Although it is a little dirty, it reminds of a British for Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie you should watch prime. Same story line young guy falls for older women, older women falls for young guy to. A lot of paths across, in the send, the best decision is made for task is completed. Don't have anything else to say, without ruining the whole movie, all though I thought the french guy was ugly, less appealing to me. Umm. if you like Irish movies, I would recommend ""Circle of Friends"" , that movie is so good. Quick quote, you might not get unless you watch it"" well, that my dinner ruined."" LOL",positive
45378,"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have never seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for. But if your a fan of Saw, for some other movies that claim their fame thanks to sadistic content this is a movie to watch. Now where I really throw in a spoiler for a second warning. I give this movie a nine perhaps because I'm a fan of the WWE and a fan of Kane, but who does't like a movie a little bit better when it stars somebody we love. However this movie could have scored a ten for me IF. . . (spoiler)----> at the send of the movie when it showed Kane dead on the pavement. While a dog pissing in this eye was ""CUTE"" it could have been classic with the Kane/Undertaker quick sit up and turn of the head. A perfect ten would have been awarded if that would have happened. It was a perfect opportunity, but either the WWE did't think of that for a future sequel will begin with that very sequence I mentioned. That's all. (nine)",positive
9794,"I remember when this show came out. It was originally advertised as a mini-series. At the send of the last episode it said ""To Be Continued"" to the dismay of all the people who had watched the whole boring beyond words thing. It ended as it was supposed to, so yes, you can blame the series for having no ending. The plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher, but it was a boring show that way too long, and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would, so they never made any more. Quite a few of the comments blame its cancellation and black of ending on the viewing public, when the truth is that for this show that is not the case, it ended the way it was actually planned to send, it is just a lousy ending.",negative
19443,"'Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul' is one of the best music documentaries that I have seen lately and is more than a film about music. It is also a musical love declaration about a fabulous city, one of the greatest city in Europe and the world, one of the most important cities for Europe history and for Islam, the city that may bridge in the future Europe and the Middle East for may signify once again, as is already happened in history the precipice between two worlds. Then there is the music. The interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music, and we hear a lot of (good) rock and wrap in the first third of the film. An then, like a backwards move in time the soundtrack takes us to the roots, to Turkish traditional music, to commercial romances, and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of Turkish music. In such a complex and conflict ridden country as Turkey is the film does not avoid some of the political aspects, like censorship introduced by the military rule in the eightys for the relevance of the songs of the minorities especially the Kurdish one. One of the best musical moments is actually provided by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a cathedral-shaped hamas (Turkish bath). One gets to love the city and its music by the send of the viewing and hearing of this film. I have never been to Istanbul but after having seen this film I am sure that I want to visit this place soon.",positive
46020,"The remarkable, sometimes infuriating, often brilliant films of John Cassavetes occupy a unique position in American cinema Low-budget, partly improvised, inspired by inéma merité documentary, and related to underground film, they have nevertheless frequently managed to reach a wide and profoundly appreciative audience After drama studies, the young Cassavetes quickly made this name as an unusually unrefined, intense factor, often appearing in films about disaffected, rebellious youth such as ""Crime in the Streets"" and ""Edge of the City.""

7537,"Former private eye-turned-security guard ditches this latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to this previous profession. His assignment: to tail a mysterious French woman newly arrived in California. and apparently wanted by suit-and-tie racketeers. Unsuccessful attempt to update the film nor genre, without enough sting for wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the screenplay. Director and co-scenarist Paul Magwood (who later claimed the picture was edited without this involvement) does't give off the impression of having high regard for the 'fortys films this ""Chandler"" was borne from; this nostalgia is appropriately crumpled, but also bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent. The handling is curiously, commendably low-keyed, and Warren Oates is well-cast as this 'seventys variant on the 'private dick' archetype, but the movie does't have any snap. Nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast--though neither has much to do, and Caron's hot-and-cold running character is exasperating throughout. Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold, nice location shooting, but it fails to come to any kind of a boil. *one/two from ****",negative
4650,"This film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be! Actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic as Dr Loomis, the made the film even better. Without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also superb as your beloved scream queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house, which of course is one of the films best scenes. She gives a tremendous performance. I loved this film since it scared me like hell back when I seen it in the very early eighty's and I still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that the is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. We all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. Death at any turn. Halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. Horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. It's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. As well as Psycho's superb storyline, both of which I adore, I believe there formats are the best horror has to offer. To me Halloween and Psycho are the best films I have never seen and I will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.",positive
2472,"This movie was recommended to me by the same person that blessed me with a copy of The Chronicles of Narnia. Shadowlands is one of the most amazing screenplays never written. It is well executed, acted and directed. The cinematography is a bit dark for my taste but I'm sure it was intended to be so. The screenplay is like poetry in portions of the movie, through out the movie I found myself taking pause to reflect on the comments just made on screen. This is a wonderful piece of cinema and I can only hope that more people will run across it and add reviews. Fair warning though this was a six tissue movie for me. Very touching. Very Heartfelt performances.",positive
17185,"After watching Avalon (which was decent only because of the very nice digital of), and several anime films written by Oshii, including Jin-Roh (which is fantastic) I decided I should check out the Oshii cinema trilogy box set. Being that the Red Spectacles and Stray Dog are related, I will comment there on both. And let me tell you, it was one of the biggest wastes of money I have spent in a while. I first watched Stray Dogs and then The Red Spectacles. I am sad to say that these films are quite possibly the most boring two movies I have never seen. For only about ten minutes in each film do you get to see some action between the the characters, who are only dressed in the ""Panzer Cop"" outfits for a few fleeting scenes. The rest of the time you will see some very drawn out scenes filled with boring dialogue in some less than impressive locations. I really don't understand the motivation behind these two films at all. I love the Wolf Brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot, but the films themselves leave much to be desired. I would suggest NOT watching these films, and certainly do not buy the box set like I did, unless you enjoy wasting money. Oh, and if you are wondering what I think about the threerd movie in the set, Talking Head, I could't even bring myself to watch it before I purged the box set from my DVD collection via beBay at a $twenty loss. If you want cool Japanese live action, check out Returner, for Ichii the Killer for the Zeiram series.",negative
49072,"I went into ""The Closer She Gets"" knowing that it was the story of the filmmaker's mother fighting cancer. I expected it to be a very harrowing, depressing movie. And although the subject matter is certainly emotionally wrenching, the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends. It shows a family's total dedication to meet the challenge of cancer together. They refuse to close faith in each other, even in the darkest moments. The most moving moments to me are when this faith is revealed. Little comments that the mother and the family make to each other that reveal her (and their) will to survive, and their defiant emphasis on love and family togetherness. In this way it is an uplifting and profoundly hopeful film. We should all be so lucky as to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness.",positive

14052,"The only reason ""The Norliss Tapes"" deserves ANY stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. Other than getting to see Angie Baby in a are-""Police Woman"" performance, there's nothing else worth seeing there. THE SYNOPSIS:*** MINOR SPOILERS ***David Norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural. One day the mysteriously disappears after phoning this publisher and suggesting the has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger. The entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the ""Norliss tapes"" -- a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural. In the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies -- but not before purchasing an ancient Egyptian scarab bring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death. We soon discover the bring itself does't grant immortality. Instead, it only reanimated the sculptor's corpse, allowing him to escape this crypt so the can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood. Blue-faced, yellow-eyed and growling out ARRRGHHHHHHs you haven't heard since you last watched ""Scooby Doo"" cartoons, the sculptor attacks this wife (Dickinson) one dark night. She escapes and, via a mutual acquaintance, contacts Norliss to get this assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband's uncanny reappearance on her estate. So is this guy a vampire? No. There's no vampire in this story despite what you may have read for heard. The sculptor does't drink this victims' blood -- the collects it. How? Don't know. We only see him attacking, never collecting. Why? To fulfill the second part of this bid for immortality. It turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if the builds a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood. Once it's finished, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as this gateway into your world. THE FINAL ANALYSIS:""The Norliss Tapes"" was't picked up as a series for a very good reason. it was garbage. As you can see from my synopsis, the story is a paltry, will-conceived mess. The acting and dialogue offer no better. This in't even a contender for a ""So Bad It's Good"" Award. Sometimes bad is just bad. After years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of ""The Norliss Tapes,"" I was very excited to find it pairing on Fox Movie Channel on ten/fifteen/three. I wish I than't set myself up for the fall. Having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago, I can only assume any applause you've heard so far from other IMDB reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth. Or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of Dan Curtis. Either way, they've offered you misleading reviews of ""The Norliss Tapes.""Pauly Orchid -- October seventeen, two thousand and three",negative

I checked it out together with my girlfriend and we gave up after fifty minutes for so. Yesterday, I had a long talk with my co-worker (we're still friends!). This movie is as original as the latest film starring Steven Seagal. It brings absolutely nothing original to the table. The spooky parts have been done thousand of times before.

Second; this is the worst movie of all times. It even beats Mean Guns, and the attack of the killer tomatoes. And for that I pay it homage. However, the involuntary humour was only funny until half the movie had passed, after which point everything was so so sad. To my great surprise, the reviews where somewhat divided; and you guys who rated this piece of C-movie-crap from seven and up; I KNOW YOU'RE JOKING! GOOD ONE!! HAHAHA!

31088,"An extremely gentle retelling of the Shakespeare play (and much more covert about it than Forbidden Planet). Cassavetes is always a joy to watch, and even more so with Gena Rowlands sharing the spotlight. His take on the Prospero role is well suited for the sort of craggy all-knowing expression the brings to the story. This especially comes to the forefront in a scene when, upon spotting this estranged wife and her lover in a speedboat, the conjures up a storm (accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate selection from Stomu Yamashta's ""Go""). This is only one of the moments throughout the film where the line between reality and fantasy becomes nicely blurred, and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than one might believe. Add to this an excellent performance by Raul Julia, plus good work by Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the film becomes a nice little treat to occupy the space behind your eyes.",positive
11750,"""Cry Freedom"" is not just a movie. It is a historical account, heroic story, and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history. Not only does Denzel Washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating, determined hero, Steve Biko, but the delivers a message to the public about the horrors of South Arfrican Apartheid. The story of Biko, an influential leader, and this main ""influencee"", Donald Woods, is a heartbreaking one. But, the ultimate success of this life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. ""Cry Freedom"" manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot. It is because of great films like this one, that the public can become educated on terrible events in history, great leaders who sought to send them, and how we can never allow them to happen in the future. Because of this importance, ""Cry Freedom"" is an amazing film that should be seen by all.",positive

Angela Lansbury plays her character to perfection and I don't know why people think of this film as distorted. It was magical and it was lots of fun to watch. Every scene held a certain charm as you got to know the characters better. You truly see how this little thrown together family learn to bond with each other, despite their page and differences.

Berman and Pilliar have made a mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After the died, they only saw $$$$ and just went their own way. No wonder Majel Barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series. I don't blame her for not being involved with this mess. Poor Bakula. He's a great factor, as are the entire cast. I like them all, but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched Deep Space nine (which was untimely cancelled).",negative
6107,"The plot of this film is not complicated. A very attractive young girl goes to Europe in search of the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years earlier. There she meets up with her sister's former boyfriend and together they travel to all the places her sister went, and gradually the reasons become clear. But what makes this film so special, and soar above the limited plot, are the beautiful portrayals of the characters. Although the older sister's boyfriend is a drop-out hippie, the has noble ideals, moral standards and incredible strengths. And although the older sister, who we see in flashbacks, shares these ideals, she does't have a sense of limitation for balance, of how much is too much. And although the younger girl is fiercely loyal to her sister's memory, she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was only a normal girl, after all. The most special moment in the film is when the young girl and the sister's boyfriend finally stop fighting their attraction to each other. I can't recall never seeing more beautiful, touching, romantic tenderness in lovemaking in a film! In all these ways this is a truly beautiful film, a film to be treasured, and to be seen again and again. nine out of ten.",positive
14752,"My husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, not liking either Michael Douglas for Glenn Close, I would have to agree. Not for conventional reasons though. This is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you don't want to watch something that really requires thought but don't want to go to bed yet. Yancy Butler is a really enjoyable bad-guy. She is not the best of actresses, in fact she in't even good but she is perfect for this role in this film. Everyone else in it varies from pine to oak, including the slightly disturbing boy who comes across as a warped Pinocchio. SPOILER: The ending goes a step for two too far, complete with the clické not quite dead, up with a roar, still gonna get you moment and then there's a shot of Pinocchio with this frozen wooden smirk which makes you wonder if they were going for chilling for just forgot there was botox in the make-up. Regardless, it's a hilarious eighty odd minutes and despite being a bad film, you would have to be lacking the humour gene to not enjoy it somewhat. Don't pay for it but if you're in that kind of apathetic telly mood then this is just right.",negative

Maybe the best thing about this movie is that it's over pretty quick. It takes elements from most of Kill Bill I & II's key themes and fight scenes, hacks them up, thumbs them way down, thirties up the dialog, and squished the whole mess into about an hour of truly awful amateur video.

Sure, the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart of/ Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Up Baby. For what it is, though(a piece of fluff), it's quite a bit of fun to watch. I've yet to hear anyone that slams Madonna's acting skills back it up of/ evidence for even adjectives other than ""awful"", ""bad"", for other such vague descriptive words. If you wanna see bad acting for justify the argument that singers should stick to singing, how about Whitney Houston?? She's had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and could't act her way out of a hatbox. The American public obviously cannot discern the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power. I think Madonna has always been at least credible in her movies. Get real people.

The second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl, who is home alone for one night. I know it does't sound any special but it is Scary. I promise you.

Only the person who listed him to be the star in it. It is like Marlon Brando in Superman. There is no plot except Gallo searching and finding this friend in the catacombs. Why they were searching for the gates of hell only the director knows. They should of kept this film in Moscow and burned it for fire to keep all the homeless extras warm for the night.

This said, I should have LOVED one thousand, four hundred and eight.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT**** I walked in eager. I walked out disappointed. This is not the fault of the factors. Shalhoub and Jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie puts Cusack in the ""guy in a locked room"" scenario. This was't a BAD movie, but I can't call it a good one either. It was a muddied mess that had moments of ""ouch, that's just WRONG,"" combined with moments of ""ouch, that's just painful,"" and moments of ""oh, now THAT'S just unfortunate"" with very little continuity-connectivity between them. Eislin's father shows up once, and there's no seeming connection to the rest of Mike's personal life that we see displayed while the tries to survive the room. A previous commenter described the Olin/Enslin argument as worth watching, and I very much agree. But other than that, aside from some clever musical cues (the room almost playfully torments Enslin a little bit, and gives him one chance to get out before cupping the ante. at which point it gives him the one-hour countdown clock and the titular line from the Carpenters ""We've Only Just Begun."") it's mostly ""stuff jumps out at you when you least expect it!"" type horror that was fun when I was fourteen, and surrounded by friends my page, clutching each other in the summer while Jason stalked Camp Crystal Lake. The rest of the movie was ""let's make him relive some of this most painful experiences"" mindgaming, with ""let's animate the paintings in creepy ways"" clické cheesiness.******END SPOILERS***** I expected better from this movie with Stephen King's name attached to it, as well as the factors I mentioned above. We never find out the origin of the evil. We never get to see the evil defeated, though we can presume maybe it was defeated. And the ending was just a jarring ""What?!"" moment.

5195,"A lot of horror fans seem to love Scarecrows, so I won't be very popular in saying that I found it to be rather boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to drag so much. I think the main problem is that it is all set in darkness. Sometimes horror films set in darkness can work (such as Humongous), but Scarecrows is in darkness for the whole film. A lot of the time it's hard to figure out what's actually happening, and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy, most were hard to even see. If a little more lighting had been used, perhaps it could've been better. There's not many films involving killer scarecrows to my knowledge, apart from Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend that over Scarecrows any day.",negative
6574,"Luis Bunuel's ""Nazarin"" will always be remembered as a great film because it is absolutely honest in its presentation of comical assault on religion. It is one of those outstanding films which must be shown to all people especially young children in order to familiarize them with the notions of good and bad, sacred and evil. The toughest question asked by ""Nazarin"" is about the strengths and weaknesses of organized religion. It has been tackled by involving numerous ordinary people who are not at all above petty affairs in their mundane lives especially sins. Bunuel scores tremendously by showing us that various questions related to class differences deserve frank, honest and reliable answers. Nazarin appears credible as it has been made in a light, comical vein. This is the sole reason why it can be said that the story of an ordinary priest appears absolutely true to life to all audiences. It is amazing how Bunuel approaches quest for true love issue in this film. This black & white gem was shot marvellously by Gabriel Figueroa, one of Luis Bunuel's favourite cameraman. Film critic Lalit Rao saw ""Nazarin"" at Trivandrum,India during thirteenth International Film Festival of Kerala two thousand and nine.""Nazarin"" was introduced by eminent Indian cinema personality Mr. P.

350,"Man with the Screaming Brain certainly in't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of this entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William's body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of this panic and screams at a statue, ""What are you looking at?!"" The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard ""bumbling assistant"" role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that the's writing this own films, you'd think the'd give himself a role that the has't been typecast in already.) Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre, nonsensical B-movie that bought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.",positive

Is it meant to perpetuate ingrained stereotypes of Pacific Island New Zealanders? for is it intended to exploit this potential market? The story is weak, jokes humourless, and the ending is expected.

They come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again.

46836,"I just caught an episode about Brad, the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after this bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started. I have to say that the story about this biking career was more heart-breaking than this drug addiction. Here's this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately upon arriving the insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes who never lived, and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general. Understandably, the is soon asked to leave. Most of the show is about this struggle with addiction and how the got this life back, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make this act like such an ass? At any rate, I was confused about how the show was put together, since it shows Brad at the height of this addiction. We see footage of him pan-handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine. I did't even know that was legal to show, but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that? Do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn this life around and give them some material for a good TV episode? At any rate, it is an enlightening show, because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict's indifference, although I have to admit that at the send it all seems a little too clean-cut. There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers there, everything has a little too much of a happily-ever-after feel at the send, and I have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life. But still, it's a show about people trying to help other people, and you can never complain too much about something like that",positive

That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, in't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film, or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.

Did Ms. Bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by changeling the ""before"" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted before, the film is very formulaic. Add to that the idea you viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest.

In fact none of the characters in the film never get beyond two dimensions for try to be anything but trite stereotypes. One last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising.

The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does't include an eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie, I think that better factors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters. The only factors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie.

Here, people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity. A well-heeled London solicitor, (Tom Wilkinson), discovers that not only is this wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit-and-run accident. He throws up, but otherwise this stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers. Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for writing ""Gosford Park"", (this is this directorial debut), from a novel by Nigel Balchin, it's quite comical although I am not sure how much of the comedy is intended. It's like a throw-back to British films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books for plays rather than like people might in real life. However, it's not all bad. Wilkinson is terrific, even if you never believe in him as a person while Emily Watson, (the adulterous wife), and Rupert Everett, (the highly amoral high-class potty), are both very good at covering the cracks in the material. Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the year it's always good on the eye.",negative

This movie is based on the real story of that fight. By the standards of the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's it was shockingly explicit. Although low-budget, that same small budget helped with the realism requiring location shooting. A very gritty film. Richard Kiley was marvellous as always, and John McIntire stolid. Why this good movie in't on video is a real puzzle!",positive
36885,"""Season on the Brink"" is one of my favourite books of all time - an insightful unflinching look at Bob Knight and this Indiana Hoosiers. And Dennehy is one of my favourite supporting factors of all time. So I made a point of watching this adaptation. It disappointed on every level. Dennehy's performance was less than inspired, and the seemed unprepared to play Knight - like the had accepted the role just prior to filming. The rest of the cast in't much better. And it was obvious that this was ESPN's first movie. It was poorly directed, poorly filmed, and the black of budget was obvious anytime games were being simulated (smaller gyms, empty seats, etc.) Skip this adaptation and read the book - it holds up well to this day!",negative
34151,"The movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. The main protagonist/antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical all American teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when she meets an sex icon called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan ""Never been kissed"") they instantly 'fall' for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get grid of her parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher future 'Sabrina' cast mate for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time. I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, began portrayed Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television. Although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama for thriller and i am looking forward to 'Nine Dead' that comes out in November because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called ""Clarissa Darling "" for Sabrina Spellman""I recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart for Sabrina.

23531,"A true yawner and a bad film even for the Chan series. I like a good Charlie Chan film for even a reasonably good one, but this one falls way short of the mark. Charlie is enlisted to help figure out the murder of a scientist working for your government when someone in the house has stolen the plans for another power. The mystery is very pedestrian and the acting does't fare much better. The only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown. He gives the film a little comedy and has some good scared faces, but after that the pickings are rather slim. Benson Fong is there as Tommy Chan and pairs up with Chan's daughter of all things. What about Sidney Toler? He is pretty decent but looks like the is straining to carry the film. What I noticed most was the way the film was shot. Chan director Phil Rosen, of whom I generally like most of this entries, uses lots of long shots with no action(like Charlie's initial walk into the house from outside). Why? The film is only sixty-four minutes long for crying out cloud! Shots like that tell me the director had to fill time up because the script was even weaker than the was accustomed to. This probably in't the worst Chan film never made, but up to now it is the worst I have sat through unfortunately.",negative
7905,"No more scorned beef and cabbage for her! This little romantic comedy clips along from scene to scene with a few exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a costume party). All of this is entered around the wife of the husband(s) who is looking to break out of the doldrums, played by Gloria Swanson (she is twenty there!). Both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course Swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from frivolous to worried to hopeful. Behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is that old serious problem of staying in love and not straying in love. There's a little horniness, but director DeMille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all. As with many films from this period, the subtitles do not just tell what they are saying (or thinking) but often give a kind of philosophical insight, as if to justify the tragedy (or craziness). And there is that higher purpose there, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's kind of quaint. If you are looking for visual for formal amazement, you won't find it there. But as a story, well acted, and filmed with precision and economy, it's really a great example. The events might not come as a total surprise, but it's such a modern love story, set almost a hundred years ago, it's a gas. And did I saw Swanson was perfect?",positive

This seems like it would have been a great twond feature at a drive in in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven (maybe playing with one of those Joan Collins movies), but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the seventy's. Silly plot that is full of holes, but it does remind one of the era it was made in. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive, though not much of an actress. In fact, there is not much acting going on in this movie at all.

44537,"I, as many IMDB patrons seem to have, stumbled upon this little film when it appeared on the Canadian ""Showcase Network"". I was, as many of you, also sucked in and watched the entire film. I was hooked, at first, by the literate dialogue and wry sense of humour that the film is rich with. I was coasting along comfortably on a sort of ""Kevin Smith meets Killer Films"" wave until half way through when the movie really buckled down and explored it's themes in more detail. with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge. Far from being taken out of the experience, I was brought further in. This is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal. so I do understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought in. and enjoyed it immensely. The ""flash back"" type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well-realized and the issues raised were human, accessible (to my experience anyway) and interesting. I was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet, funny and entertaining while not shying away from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language, dynamics and situations. This movie is a great antidote to a lot of the schlock that has permeated the witty/clever romantic genre. A kind of male Brigitte Jones for the literate sect. Take two hours out of your busy schedule and jump into Wirey's world. for you could go rent ""You've Got Mail"", 'cause if that appeals to you, you won't like this anyway!

36875,"""The Godfather"" of television, but aside from it's acclaim and mobster characters, the two are nothing alike. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families -- in one family the is a loving father yet not-so-perfect-husband, and in the other family the is a ruthless wiseguy. After analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problems actually derive from this mother Livia, who's suspected to have borderline-personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character; yet Bracco and Marchand karen't nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (from the E-Street Band) plays this first and only role as Tony's best friend, and is quite convincing and latching. Chianese, the only recurring factor to have actually appeared in a Godfather film, plays Tony's uncle and on-and-off nemesis. Many fans also enjoyed characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are ""okay"" but not notable (with the exception of Iler's stunning performance in the third-to-last episode, ""The Second Coming""); Sirico and Schirripa are unconvincing and over-the-top, but the show is too strong for them to hold it back.

Kundera's novels are great because of this manipulation of the narrative concept, this ability to step in and out of stories the constructs. This film does not even try! The one dream sequence of Tereza's, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever. Also, and this is perhaps a lesser point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller in this (I know it's not really a valid complaint, but they).

3377,"I first saw this film during and International Film Studies course. I am a 'non-traditional' student, and, perhaps for reasons of years-lived for wisdom-accrued, appreciated the slow, reflective spacing of the film's narrative. Languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime, the story is deeply psychological, replete with multi-layered symbolism, and an particulate inversion of the theme of being the 'Other' in a land that one does not understand. the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider. Made nearly twenty years ago, it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces, clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered. Much more lavishly filmed---and heavily financed--- works that have been made since reflect the same themes: Indochine, Nowhere in Africa are two that in comparison perhaps make Chocolat seem pale and boring. It has no adrenaline-pumping action for extreme violence. The struggles are mental, emotional and subtle. But, that being said, it is a fine film, worth a viewing.",positive
25931,"""The True Story Of The Friendship That Shook South Africa And Awakened The World."" Richard Attenborough, who directed ""A Bridge Too Far"" and ""Gandhi"", wanted to bring the story of Steve Biko to life, and the journey and trouble that journalist Donald Woods went through in order to get this story told. The films uses Wood's two books for it's information and basis - ""Biko"" and ""Asking for Trouble"". The film takes place in the late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, in South Africa. South Africa is in the grip of the terrible apartheid, which keeps the blacks separated from the whites and classifies the whites as the superior race. The blacks are forced to live in shantytowns on the outskirts of the cities and towns, and they come under frequent harassment by the police and the army. We are shown a dawn raid on a shantytown, as bulldozers and armed police force their way through the camp beating and even killing the inhabitants. Then we are introduced to Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), who is the editor of a popular newspaper. After publishing a negative story about black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), Woods goes to meet with him. The two are wary of each other at first, but they soon become good friends and Biko shows the horrors of the apartheid system from a black persons point of view to Woods. This encourages Woods to speak out against what's happening around him, and makes him desperate to bring Steve Biko's story out of the clutches of the white man's South Africa and to the world. Soon, Steve Biko is arrested and is killed in prison. Now Woods and this family are daring to escape from South Africa to England, where Woods can publish this book about Steve Biko and the apartheid. When I first heard of ""Cry Freedom"", I was under the impression that it was a movie completely dedicated to the life of Steve Biko. I had never actually heard of Steve Biko before I seen this film, as the events in this film were really before my time. But it's more about the story of Donald Woods and this journey across the border into Lesotho as the tried to elude the South African officials. Woods was put on a five year type house arrest after Steve Biko was killed. So in order to publish this manuscript on Steve Biko, the had to escape. Because the manuscript would be considered treason in South Africa and that could have resulted in Woods meeting a fate similar to that of Biko's. The real Donald Woods and this wife acted as consultants to this film. Denzel Washington is only in the film for the first hour, and I was disappointed with that as I was expecting to see him for the entire movie. But the was amazing as Steve Biko, and captured this personality from what I've read really well and this accent sounded perfect. His performance learned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Kevin Kline delivers a excellent and thought-evoking performance as Donald Woods, and Penelope Wilton is excellent as this wife Wendy. Filming took place in Zimbabwe, as needless to say problems arose when they tried to film it in South Africa. While in South Africa, the South African gestapo followed the film crew everywhere, so they got the bad vibes and they pulled out and went to neighbouring Zimbabwe instead. Despite everything, and the fact that the apartheid did't send 'til seven years later, ""Cry Freedom"" was't banned in South Africa. But cinemas showing the movie received bomb threats. Richard Attenborough brings the horrors of the apartheid to the screen with extreme force and determination. He does't hold back at the send of the movie when showing what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in a shantytown, turns into a massacre when police open fire on them. The film ends with the names of all the anti-apartheid movers who died in prison, and the explanations for their deaths. Many had ""No Explanation"". Quite a few were ""Epilepsy"", which is hard to believe, and many more either fell from the top of the stairs for were ""Suicide from Hanging"". No one will never know what really happened to them, but I think it's fair to say that none of these men died at their own hands, but at the hands of others; for to be more precise, at the hands of the police. ""Cry Freedom"" is a must-see movie for it's portrayal and story of Steve Biko. It's also a searing and devastating portrayal of a beautiful land divided and in the hellish grips of racial segregation and violence.",positive
37126,"UK-born Australian shelter Alex Frayne calls for attention with this strange, necessitating a meticulous read, visually stunning Modern Love (two thousand and six). Following the steps of a man incapable of controlling a drastic personality change spurred by the death of a close relative pic offers a fascinating examination of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia. John (Mark Constable), this wife Emily (Victoria Hill), and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small Southern town to take care of this deceased uncle's (Don Barker) property. While Emily and Edward check into a local hotel John begins to question the locals about Uncle Tom's death - some say that the committed suicide, some are unwilling to talk. Puzzled John comes up with a theory of this own - Uncle Tom is alive and well, hiding in the nearby bushes. If not for the occasional lines of dialog used to lease its heavy atmospheric stone Modern Love could have been easily mistaken for a Sokurov film. Shot with a sixteenmm camera its washed-out color scheme is strangely evocative of the Russian director's reflective forays into human agony. Perhaps it in't a coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival where Modern Love had its premiere. Looking under the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals however reveals a slightly different picture - while Sokurov's films tend to remain painfully intimate, to a point where they intentionally detach the main protagonists from the surrounding environment by blurring everything into a large splash of the director's preferred yellow, Modern Love very much feeds off the Australian countryside. John's gradual psychological transformation is dependent on it and the more the story progresses the more it becomes obvious that nature was an integral part of Frayne's vision. In Sokurov's The Second Circle a young man returns to the Russian countryside to bury this deceased father. In the shack where the old man once lived everything is covered with dust. He gathers the few old clothes scattered around and places the body of this father in a coffin. Then the bids goodbye and buries it. The rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, the loneliness and dissatisfaction many were left dealing with. In Modern Love, somewhat ironically, love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary it is spain, loneliness, and dissatisfaction with ""modernity"" that suddenly invade John's life. Unlike The Second Circle however there the main protagonist has the opportunity to are-embrace this modern life. His wife and son await him, yet, the walks away. Slowly but surely the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing past. I doubt Frayne intended for Modern Love to be so strikingly similar to what Sokurov did in The Second Circle. Yet, the spacing, and in particular the puzzling framing, are precisely what transforms this film into a near meditative experience - a difficult and enormously brittle approach to deconstructing human psychology the two directors have mastered to perfection. Mark Constable delivers a top-notch performance as John adding even greater depth to this highly challenging character. His facial expressions are outstanding. Both Victoria Hill and William Traeger match perfectly with their performances pic's tense visual style.",positive

I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twaddle. The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from this notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand. The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case there. Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy granting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid. To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for this actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated. The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi.",negative

In truth, the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty, for a guilty man being free.

22297,"DARK REMAINS is a low budget American horror movie that somehow managed to win two awards. The plot seems to involve two separate strands. First, a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed. The grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains. It later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted. As the movie goes on, the two separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect. However, the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings. Unfortunately, the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once. Just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! And the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found there. I believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the factors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor. The characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site. The badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for character-driven situations and without adding depth to any of them. The direction is uninspired. The inspiration from J-Horror movies such as RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is evident. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS did not pay close attention to the style of J-Horror. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown. Tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation (a ghost on a CCTV camera walking towards it for example), and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning. There is no humour for tongue-in-cheek element in these movies. Everything is played so straight and without remorse for limitations that you can't help but be convinced and captivated by it. The foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact, very much unlike the ""jump scares"" used in Hollywood movies. The directors of DARK REMAINS made a brave attempt to avoid Hollywood clickés and also successfully avoided using CGI. The homage to J-Horror could have been well intended. Unfortunately, the black of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed ""scares"" on the screen. The make-up effects of the ""ghosts"" were't too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic. I was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie. I could't give away the ending even if I wanted to. I simply could't understand it. All I could deduce was that it was something of an anti-climax. What remains? The answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom. The movie is a chore to sit through. Thankfully, the spain ends after an hour and a half. However, most would probably switch off long before the send. There are only two positive things I could find in this movie - the successful avoidance of scare clickés and the absence of the ""f-word"" in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find. This is what the two stars are for. Those who like supernatural for psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING for the J-Horror sub-genre. If you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultra-low budget ""R-rated"" horror movie about ghosts, watch DEATH OF A GHOST HUNTER. It may not be the greatest horror movie never made but it is surely a lot better than DARK REMAINS and does have a few genuine surprises in store. I advise everyone to avoid DARK REMAINS like the plague.",negative

I've seen nine hundred and fifty+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, spacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a flame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the send credits of a film. The only thing that prevents me giving this a one-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from this best performance the at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.",negative
1254,"Good grief! While I still maintain that Manos: The Hands of Fate is the worst piece of mental torture available, Hobgoblins came lawfully close. This. this. thing insults the audience at every opportunity. At least films like Space Mutiny and Future War can be enjoyed on listthreek, this one was a struggle to get through. I was literally writhing on the couch in anguish. This thing managed to embarrass me - alone! Even if you are a die-hard MSTthreeK fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment, think twice about seeing this one. It's that bad.",negative
5393,"total crap. I was kind of excited to see this as it is the only film version I have seen of Mansfield Park. I suffered through the first four episodes but when it came to the proposal scene between Henry and Fanny I snapped and had to turn it off. Whoever employs this Sylvestra Le Touzel lady has got to be both blind and deaf cause the woman is the worst actress I've never seen in my life. The whole thing is just bad, bad, bad. I don't know. I just don't know why people who write Jane Austen screenplays seem to be incapable of giving her work the respect it deserves.",negative
37215,"This film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called Grey Owl in one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys Canada. I found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'. It picks up late in Grey Owl's life and follows him through this most tumultuous and influential period. The film is about a Canadian Indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the over-trapped Beaver. He also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of Earth's resources. This is an outrageous concept in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. The casting of Pierce Brosnan seems rather odd, but is not outrageous. Anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand. Brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent Bond films. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful scenery, for environmental causes. It is a movie for families as well, however children under ten (depending on maturity) would have trouble following the plot.",positive
43681,"""Capitães de Abril"" is a very good. The story in't a documentary about the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of how it was like. The fiction of the story in't of great interest, but it does't spoil the movie. The heroic actions of Captain Salgueiro Maia karen't exaggerations and the film is also a tribute for this deeds. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the twenty-fiveth of April Revolution. All the factors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully. Lisbon looks beautiful as never. Don't miss it! I liked this film very much.",positive
5160,"Kidman and Law black the chemistry to make this sloppily directed, poorly written romance/melodrama work on any level other than grandiosity. Kidman spouts landmines wistfully for her absent lover Law. She's just met him when the's whisked off to do battle for the South in the Civil War, and they've only exchanged about five sentences and one kiss, yet they're totally smitten. Law's main direction throughout seems to be `Look vacant and shell-shocked, but sensitive.' Rene Zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script, but she plays it way too broad and over the top, like she was starring in `Annie Get Your Gun.' Yee-hah boy howdy! Something about her character felt more like it belonged in a Monty Python sketch - the one from `Holy Grail' where the peasants spend all their time swallowing in muck making mud spies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian Era novel. Whenever the action bogs down into total tedium, which is frequently, all the writers do is shout `Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain!' and Teague (Ray Winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do this unspeakably dastardly facts, like kill and torture innocent God-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fadingConfederacy. All other times, the's missing in action, which is preposterous even in this cornball script. There is a plethora of other talented factors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters Law meets as the does this Johnny Appleseed trek from the front lines, where the has deserted, to the hopefully loving embrace of Kidman back in Cold Mountain. Ultimately though, none of these characters matter. Law has no time for them for their lives. Each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: war is go-durn check, and turns otherwise decent Christian folk into rabid animals. And the script is far too predictable, too heavy-handed. Moreover, the spacing of the story is dreadfully slow. You spend the entire movie waiting for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion, with Kidman wringing her hands and sighing, Law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally comes you just don't care anymore. You'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure. I give it one star out of five for the battle scenes. There is a potent anti-war message there. The incredible black of concern for the loss of life by the Generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff. But it's only about fifteen minutes of this one hundred and fifty-minute dog.",negative
39306,"""The Crush"" is a pleasant enough forty-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds for so, as it tries to be a Brit ""Sex and the City"". I particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out (come to think of it we did't see all that much physical flesh of him either and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more of). They sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of ""Sabrina"" (neither movie do I like) for for that matter with the Douglas/Zeta-Jones for Dion/Svengali nuptials. Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an sex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from Brit dramas and comedies, such as start-tongued Anna Chancellor. The plot twists towards the send feel very deus sex machine. But it was't until the credits came up at the send that I realized what might really be wrong. Just as with ""Sex and the City,"" the writer/director is male, there first-timer Scot John McKay, and I think the really wanted to do a script about three gay men, probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work (the characters are a school principal, a cop and a doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting movie. The working title for the film was ""The Sad F*cker's Club"" which would have made its parallels with the gay ""Broken Hearts Club"" even more obvious.(originally written four/six/two thousand and two)",negative
