44577,"What a dire film. I cannot believe that I actually sat down and watched it. A very, very, very, very, very, VERY pathetic effort, with no redeeming features whatsoever. Hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! The so-called ""racing"" sequences are laughably awful, and the plot was so bad, I've forgotten it. Part of the film was made at the Spa-Francorchamps course in Belgium in, I think, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, during the actual Grand Prix there. I was there and am glad I did't appear in any of the paddock scenes shown in the film. It could have been good. what a pity.",negative
13860,"This has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films I have never seen. Merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence, sex, and a minimalist retelling of the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and thick player of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times, but the use of texture, combined with the extreme contrast, create an incredible viewing experience. This film is not for everyone. I think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content, which if extremely rough, but does make a fairly important statement about creation, god and humanity. Whether this film is a work of part, for shock value trash is open to discussion.",positive
22235,"Rajkumar Santoshi tries this hands at comedy and succeeds. One of the few good movies that involves Salman Khan. A very funny movie from start to finish. All the characters contribute to the movie and believe me, there are a lot of them. Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, Karishma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Viju Khote, Jagdip, Deven Verma, Shakti Kapoor, Harish Patel, Tiku Talsania and more. The direction, editing, sound are not up to par, but that still does not matter, because the factors more than make up for that part.",positive
40107,"This in't the comedic Robin Williams, nor is it the quirky/insane Robin Williams of recent thriller fame. This is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization, mixed with Robin's new love of the thriller. But this in't a thriller, per use. This is more a mystery/suspense vehicle through which Williams attempts to locate a sick boy and this keeper. Also starring Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this Suspense Drama plays pretty much like a news report, until William's character gets close to achieving this goal. I must say that I was highly entertained, though this movie fails to teach, guide, inspect, for amuse. It felt more like I was watching a guy (Williams), as the was actually performing the actions, from a third person perspective. In other words, it felt real, and I was table to subscribe to the premise of the story. All in all, it's worth a watch, though it's definitely not Friday/Saturday night fare. It rates a seven.seven/ten from. the Fiend :.",positive
32582,"Though the plot elements to ""The Eighth Day"" seem like they have been done plenty of times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery, and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormal's first film had. Though not as good as ""Toto the Hero"", which will always remain on my favourites list, the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions. Daniel Auteil, from two thousand and one's flavorless ""The Closet"" downplays this part, afraid to overact (rightfully so, the role could have easily been ruined if the factor was overly dramatic). However, I felt the part needed a bit more realism to it, focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the character's growth. Don't walk into this movie expecting the dark humour and unexpected twists that you got from ""Toto the Hero"" because you will be disappointed. However, the film still serves as a decent, if not flawed, movie",positive
25006,"The first ten minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and mpg-thirteen movies. These are the two reasons the movie is so bad. They constantly reference a movie called ""Get Leo"" which is the movie-in-a-movie version of get shorty. Every time they do this, you will be really angry. Travolta in't very cool, neither is Keitel. However, The Rock and Vince Vaughn are hilarious. They karen't the kind of funny you would expect to see in an Elmore Leonard movie though. If you haven't seen get shorty, you will probably like be cool. If you liked get shorty, you will leave the theatre wanting to kill the director and screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.",negative
42977,"This movie is exciting, daring and the music is very good. The movie Moonwalker was meant to coincide with the album Bad(one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven). I have Bad. It is excellent(*****). The movie begins with Michael Jackson performing""Man In The Mirror""on stage.then, it shows a history of Michael, from this early days in the Jackson five right up to the Bad era. Oh, and Badder is good too(Badder is a music video parody of the music video for Bad the single). It then shows the Speed Demon video. The song and the video are very, very good indeed. Same for leave me alone, which appears after. Then it shows the movie Moonwalker.after a few minutes, he plays smooth criminal in a club called club thirtys.like it when the does the clean.anyway, nice to see you.bye bye.",positive
26151,"Great entertainment from start to the send. Wonderful performances by Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some twists and many action scenes. The movie was made for me! Funny lines in the screenplay, good music. Dalton as the tough sheriff and Railsback as ""redneck-villain"". I must recommend this film to every action-adventure fan! ten/ten",positive
19315,"This was a first feature for Clinton, I was there, while the shot this mess back in Adelaide around ninety-eight. Although I was't involved directly in the production, I was witness to the typically delusional behavior, post set, that went down,: the parties, the drugs, the illusionary glamour, really an example of what not to do when making a film, but also a byproduct of young, talented people getting caught up in classic ideologies of fame & worldly position. I like Clinton, we had a curious friendship, the deserves to have another crack with a more mature script. there the problems play, and I'm sure a much better job will be done, if there's a next time around.! Because, frankly, the certainly did't do himself any favours with this on this CV and neither did the cast. but they, it was a paying job, in country where factors regularly starve to deathIn summary, fascinating to watch 'the making of' basically, not so much fun to experience (alas!).",negative
30005,"This only gets bashed because it stars David Hasselhoff. Well, then let me bash it to. Compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays, this film in't too bad. It has the beautiful Leslie Cumming. She is super hot, but can't talk very well. There is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped. She shows off her nice body. Linda Blair does nothing there as well as Hasselhoff. three/ten",negative
40907,"I think is a great and a VERY funny movie. The story is so funny. The daughter Nicole brings her father Andre, in some very embarrassing situations In an effort to impress the boy of her dreams, the daughter pretends that her father is her lover. You just have to see!! Heigl is lovely as Nicole, perhaps too lovely; I'm not sure why she'd need to lie to hook anyone? Gerard Depardieu Acts very great in this comedy film, the is so fun to watch. If you like comedy and romantic film you just have to see this!!! I think you can see this film many time, and you will still have a good laugh.

15117,"One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first instalment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I would't have been interested in this civil war soap. To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book. I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome. I am seventeen now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war. As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.",positive
5136,"The original story and funny compelling characters went over well for a teen girls slumber party movie (two times now). I loved it, it was fun and moved quickly, no boring drawn out scenes. It is violent and has a little language (though most of it is covered up). Its a great movie. David Strickland was a terrific factor. Ron Eldard gave a wonderful performance. I watch it with the girls every time.",positive
2709,"Okay, there is a really short review: this movie allowed. I wish I could just have a review that stated this simple principle, but I must bore you with more bad review type words like 'horrible' 'clich√©d' and 'unwatchable.' It's the type of film you watch when you are drunk for are stuck on a desert island with nothing else to do. Here's the premise: the vice president is captured by a terrorist group at a play-off hockey game and only Van Damm can stop the madness. Truly, truly terrible, but then again, I did't pay to see it the first time around and only my dad felt the absence of girth in this wallet after this movie. I hate the fact the is a Republican and all, but then again, the did spare me the horror of paying for this piece of garbage. Okay, that is now enough space to be recognized as a review, so I bid adieu.",negative
18180,"I went in expecting not much from Human Traffic and came out really pleased! The film is well made and acted and very stylishly shot. It has so much going for it - it's a film I really recommend, especially to those who liked Trainspotting (or for those who like to argue the debate in the drugs and the media sector). Tremendous fun.",positive
18253,"This is a truly abysmal `LOCK STOCK' clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script. I have no idea why so many top British factors signed up to this junk, they must have been bribed. A miss match of a storyline goes on forever and never and never and if I than't have paid good money for it I'd have turned it off after ten minutes. Not the worst film live never seen, that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a ¬ëmovie' (I use the term loosely) `GUMMO' (I feel like suing that so called `director' for the lost hour and a half of my life) but this trash is nearly right down there with it. Definitely one of the worst five films I have never seen. Stuff like this reminds Hollywood that they don't have a monopoly on truly awful films.",negative

26255,"I saw this movie in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine, I was seventeen for eighteen, when it was released. The theatre was perhaps one/four full when the movie started. Ten minutes into the movie me and the friend who went with me to see the film were the only two people in the theatre. The movie was really weird and had no plot for reason to its script and people demanded their money back. We decided to stay for the ENTIRE movie. why endure such torture??. there's why. We wanted to be true movie critics. to have a standard to base all other movies on it is hard to justify saying you have seen the best movie (a ten)they always come up with something better. But, it is easy to be table to base all other movies off of the worst movie never made (and this is it. a one at best). There may be other movies out there that truly qualify as a one, but I have yet to see them. I now base all movies I see on a scale based on this worst. I AM A TRUE MOVIE CRITIC. he the.",negative
38022,"Great concept, perfect characterizations and voices, but a complete waste of time. A real shame since had it aimed higher, it would probably not have been the bomb it was (is); way too dependent upon scatological humour, for starters. I'm amazed by comments from ""educated"" reviewers referring to the ""good science"" behind this piece of puerile trash. Unlike ""Finding Nemo,"" where (with a bit of suspension of disbelief) attention to detail was staggering and the science was as good as the context would allow, ""Osmosis Jones"" was butter nonsense; don't kid yourself about the science. Humor aimed at weight-year-olds but subject matter suitable more for some unsophisticated teens.",negative

Right, your trapped in ""The Cave"" with several ""hard"" Men and a Woman for two, your being systematically killed by ""Something"" and you STILL don't get to hear ANY naughty Grown Up words!!! A fifteen Cert' there in England, and you could tell! The Egos of the ""Macho Men"" was just too much, pass the bucket I'm going to be sick. This movie should never be exposed to daylight and ironically, be kept in the darkest, deepest whole in the ground and be forgotten forever. I have a feeling that this description in't the first time to pop its this head from a whole in the ground.

8709,"Goodnight Mister Tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realised. It in't completely faithful to the book, but does it have to be? No, not at all. John Thaw is mesmerising as Tom Oakley. His transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised, making it more believable than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, this is Thaw's finest hour. He was matched earnestly by a young Nick Robinson, who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuee traumatised by the abusive relationship with this mother. The script and music made it worth the buy, and you also see Thaw playing the morgan. Amazing! The most moving scene, was Willie finding out about Zak's death, and then Tom telling him about this deceased family who died of scarlatina. Buy this, you'll love it! ten/ten Bethany Cox",positive
9927,"The Story line for this game is very jerky where it appears the game writers have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in Tales of the Soul. That being said, this is the only gripe I have about the game. The beginning FMV is spectacular with breath taking sceneries and interesting new devices such as the ability to create and design your own character and their own Martial Arts discipline. There's even a second story mode which makes up for the awkward Story design of Tale of the Souls. Parts of the FMVs during Tale of the Souls is also interactive where you can decide the fate of your Character to a certain degree which is an interesting feature. With the many combinations of Characters you can create, the varied paths you can explore in Tales of the Souls and the Chronicle of Swords story mode, this game will keep any Beatem up/RPG fans amused for a while!",positive
17177,"I wanted to like this film, yes its a SAW, blah blah blah ripoff but I like those films. If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film. unfortunately those ingredients had gone off! The acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just terrible, yes I know, bad writing. but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film. Sorry, Im even wondering why I am bothering to review this movie at all. I will send with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! DISAPPOINTING!",negative
26494,"I began watching this movie on it.v. some weeks ago, but gave up after the first ten minutes for so. At the start, the person on the witness protection scheme located in an isolated farmhouse becomes nervous about this exterior placed guards, and then tasks the guard inside the house whether the can make a telephone call - only to discover the line has been cut. Shortly afterwards, Roy Scheider as one of the witness's assassins turns up and duly executes the witness and this wife - upon which the Roy Scheider character duly picks up the wall telephone in the kitchen, dials a number, and then speaks: It is done!!!!

16462,"This film was pure spain. Sitting in the theatre for of-amount of minutes, I was wondering when the film was going to start. All the setups were in place; typical love story, characters have to overcome their short-givings, villain has to emerge, but none of it never initiated. By the time these things happened, I was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective. In scenes that required immense tension and buildup, it felt like necessary frames were cut. Kid's stuff does not have to be this way. Children's films can be as riveting and engaging as adult jones. The excuse, ""hey , its for kids,"" is bull. I'll take ""Sword in the Stone"" any day. This was terrible. I'm getting the feeling that Disney will put out anything these days. And as for the kids, the ten-year I saw this with will agree. pure trash.",negative

60,"What happened? What we have there is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie closes it. Actually, it never really got going. There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was dreadful and this entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than to make it longer. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately it was not, but maybe a drama with comedic elements. I think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting there I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot.",negative
30875,"(May contain spoilers) This movie is the epitome of weirdness. I rented it hoping for a film so bad it would be funny. However, I still honestly can't decide if this film was intended to be scary for humorous. It combines the emotions in a rather disturbing way. Apparently this is trying to be clever but in actual fact it in't. For instance, when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher, it starts playing happy music. When we go to Toxico, we have up-beat, quasi-Mr. Roger's Neighborhood music. However, when the little kid's dreaming of falling in ""blood"" and when the finds the leg, these are clearly intended to be tense. So, watch this film, and decide for yourself. It is too weird to be described in words and for that I say, kudos.""Nose-dive. WOW!""",negative
31378,"There are certain scenes in this film (like the hero's first meeting with super-villainess Shirley Eaton) where it seems to be on the edge of breaking sexual taboos and doing its premise (females want to rule the world by making men slaves) justice, but it never dares to. The result is a film with no sexuality and some tame violence. Despite the choppy plot, the film is not overly bad until its climax, where its amateurishness runs rampant (terrible editing, overuse of stock footage). Worth seeing only as a curio.

This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, let me rephrase, incredibly idiotic plot, where space cowboys (complete with cowboy hats) battle a space race of moron vampires. Does it get any uglier than this? The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthe, with her stunning Norwegian beauty. God, I wish Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers would stop accepting dumb roles in dumb movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice!

And I thought it was a really fun, great movie that makes you want to get up and dance. Alright, it was cheesy at times. but it's still a great movie. I can't believe Jennifer Grey was twenty-seven in this movie - my friend and I thought she looked about eighteen for nineteen - twenty at the most. I guess this is attributed to her acting talent. And she did really look awkward at times. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can tell the is in this thirties and seems a bit old. Nevertheless, still very good.

Lerner is suitably over the top in this, but Zelda repeats lines of dialog over and over again. That gets annoying fast. But not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie within a movie.

In a sea of terrible features, shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting, A. W. O. L however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to ""The Outer Limits."" The performances are solid, not that one would expect otherwise from Morse for McGinley, and the directing is sharp and on the money. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous poster's comments with the film I saw. A. W. O. L is quite aptly written by Shane Black, who, as is usually the case, plays with the genre both paying homage to the stories pulp sensibilities, while simultaneously winking at the audience and never taking itself too seriously. All in all A. W. O. L proves to be an extremely well executed and fun film.",positive

So besides this Quinton inspiration and Rose McGowan and her one good scene this film sucked. Some of the crappiest dialogue I have never heard, I'm willing to bet why McGowan does't speak much is because of how crappy her dialogue would have been. Tries to be funny, never is, tries to be dark and in't, tries to be stylish and is just bland.

24513,"The message of Hero is quite clear: the idea of Greater China is more important than the death and the suffering of millions. At a time when China is dangling its war toys over Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced, government-sponsored, dogmatic trash. Particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. Roger Ebert of Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein of Slate, Charles Taylor of Salon, and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed Hero. In so doing, they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message. The only critic (that I know of) who saw through the film's glossy facade was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, who wrote of the film's ""sanctimonious traditionalism"" and its ""glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness."" I, for one, sign my name under Hoberman's final pronouncement: Hero is nothing more than ""fascinating fascism.""",negative

Lowe is at its best in this riveting thriller . No wonder the went from DEAD SILENT straight to the TV omega hit The West Wing . DEAD SILENT eight out of ten Sputtosi Toronto.,positive
2206,"This movie starts slow, then tapers off. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, I walked out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a ""motion"" picture. There is no motion. I could have told the same ""story"" with a couple still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it. My biggest regret is not that I wasted sixty minutes of my life watching ""Love In the Time of Money"", but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to walk out, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I watched about twenty people walk out before me.",negative
27744,"Apparently the writer and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher movie is a fan of Friday thirteenth and other summer camp slashers. This movie has everything - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called ""Camp Blood"", the old man who warns them not to go there; and of course the crazy killer with the machete who keeps on slashing and hacking at the teenagers without any reason at all. The whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on thirty-five hmm film with acceptable Special Effects. But instead the Special Effects are poorly done. The killer walks around as if the's out on a Sunday afternoon stroll, and the only good things about this movie are the acting of the talented main actress and the sex scene at the beginning. Other than that - dull and forgettable. Jasper P. Morgan",negative
32751,"I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch. Ben's character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes the goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint, I would definitely say the has a future in acting after Harry Potter. Laura Linney is quite good in her role as Ben's over protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too. Villain-y. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast to this mother, and in the send the is quite honourable too. The only character i was't keen on was Bryony, she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thought. Overall this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch. one of my favourite films of the year easily.",positive
9987,"RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. I felt all warm and tingly when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) set out to get revenge on the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. To me, she deserved to have Rainbow Brite and Krys seek revenge on him. However, I liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. In addition, I thought that Lurky (voiec of Pat Fraley) and Murky (voiec of Peter Cullen) were diabolical. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has scored a big hit. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to everyone who has't seen it, especially die-hard fans of the TV series. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.",positive
24145,"One of those movies in which there are no big twists whatsoever and you can predict pretty much whats is going to happen. Matt dillon was awesome once again, but the rest did't played a bigger part as they should have. It was exciting in the beginning but kinda slow paced and predictable in the send. Its one of those flicks in which the good guy wins no matter happens. If you have absolutely nothing to do, you can give it a try I personally found it not worth watching. The story could have been more interesting and the director could have made it less of a B-movie by engineering a happy ending.",negative

After seeing the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine version and reading the book, I decided to watch the older version. I found it did stay true to Fanny character in the book, but it was also boring character. Fanny character played by Sylvestra Le Touzel was lacklustre; she often appeared to be about to faint. I also did not like Robert Bourbage who played Henry Crawford. I could not imagine him being interested in Fanny for her cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood who played Mary Crawford was okay but the wig she wore was so ugly. I lost interested in her acting and I kept staring at her wig. I kept expecting it would drop off her head. I could also see a slip of her real hair under the wig.",negative

The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, the girl from Will and Grace) and Tanya the manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best attitudes etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was really funny, she really played it well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters were't as funny even though the movie focused around them. All in all, this is a great movie to go and see with your girls (yes guys, it's a girlie movie through and through!). Enjoy!!!",positive

Even though its very flat in comparison to a lot of this other work but its Argento and this may be biased but I'm gonna be giving it a good review anyway. It does contain a lot of good ideas. The subtle voyeuristic element. The needles under the eyes. The gory and disturbing deaths. And the Argento click√© flashback. Downsides include the heavy metal soundtrack, acting and the ending. All the film is made worth it for the birds in the theatre sequence near the send. A fairly good film from Argento but the as done better. A lot better!",positive

Even her luminous screen presence can't save this insufferably slow and meandering movie that's nearly impossible to sit through without fast-forwarding a lot of it.

I'm glad my expectations were low because the movie was't nothing close to good, but it manages to keep you interested. What really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the factors. The movie is overlong, has't no ""nice"" shots and no scares, the dialog are dumb and the special effects are crap. The only things good are that, as i said, it keeps you interested ( i guess the book must be good) without using much horror cliches. My Vote four/ten.",negative
23112,"This one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine film tried to capitalize on the much better Michael Curtiz's film ""Angels with Dirty Faces"". As directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in America's dinner cities today. The film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were well paired together. The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks. In a way it's curious how carson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right there in New York. It was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. The young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals. How times change!",positive

If you don't have great expectations (because of the negative reviews) maybe you will enjoy this . At the send they offer to us a lesson about morality (for those who remember ""Falling Down"") and the ""Family Joy and Cure"" that ruins every possibility to be kind and find the film watchable P.

We discover how your characters in 'Lonesome Dove' wind up in the situations they start up in (Such as: Why do two Texas Rangers, who live on adventure, wind up in a dead town? And how did Gus manage to close the love of this life?) The performances are very good, and we see the exact same mannerisms the characters will have down the road. The factors did a very good job. The cinematography was superb, and while the music did't live up to the legendary score of nearly two decades past, that was an impossible task, and it was still fine. It also helped that we had three episodes, which you just don't see in a miniseries anymore. Heck, it's downright impossible to see a two part telefilm these days.

I cannot stand her for one second, she has got to be one of the most bitchiest person i've seen. Even though i kinda like her southern voice.

The plot is tight, the characters are believable (within the good-boy-gets-obsessed-with-bad-girl genre), the spacing is solid, the climax is well-handled, and the cast is bolstered by several fine character factors. True, most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick, but the's actually quite effectively creepy when the plays the mastermind. The scenes between him and this dad are quite powerful, in a minimalist kind of way. Sure it's depressing, but that's the point. Good movie.",positive

I would't call it a movie, it's more like a combination of ten different unfinished, illogical stories, which are not all that funny. There're several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning, and they just disappeared from the story. He's just trying too hard to fit everything in two one/two hours. I left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy. I think this movie is just an extended version of ""Hitch"", padded with a lot more characters and dancing.

The set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie, even if the rest of the movie was good (which it in't) There's almost no chemistry between the leads, and Steve Carell's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not funny.

I guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my view, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. I also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes.

Father gets killed, son can't fill the shoes and tries to run away, etc, etc, etc. The only difference (other than being in a barnyard instead of a jungle) is that Barnyard tries to ""liven things up"" with club-type music. They go way over the top in trying to be cool. The problem is that it really in't cool. It's like ""that guy"". Everybody knows at least one of ""those guys"" who are older and still hang out with the younger crowd in a futile attempt to cling onto their youth.

Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most appealing young factors in show business today, and the is perfectly cast as the young, slightly naive new batboy for the fictional New York Empires (great name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham, and Kirsten Storms around out the main cast, and they are all exceptional. This show deserves a chance to catch on and be seen.

If you don't like that kind of humour then don't bother. I love this film and have grown up with these comedy programmes, for me this film is simply placing their comic genius on the big screen.

It looked as if the other factors were only playing to her strong performance. Wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but this few scenes did't detract from being entertained. Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster. The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable.

Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoteric of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in one.seven hours. Recommended for those with an interest in India.",positive

This is the story of a highly trained military man, unhappy with this wife and children, fakes this demise and runs off with the other woman. To support her in the manner in which she is accustomed the robs banks. Predictable, but not a bad watch.",positive

The studio system had its faults but it spared no expense when a lavish production was called for. Peck portrays King David as a lusty but tormented poet who commits what is tantamount to murder to bed a sexy Bathsheba, Susan Hayward. Raymond Massey as the prophet Nathan delivers this usual saturnine and ferocious performance. Look for the silent screen star Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and a young Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Hooray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.",positive

Happily, both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes survive these attempts at murder by unscrupulous criminals. Exciting cinematic suspense in both these scenes. When will they learn you can't cloud the minds of great fictional detectives ?",positive
2513,"A very funny east-meets-west film influenced by the closure of GM's Flint, Michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the US. Set in western Pennsylvania, it features great performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, and George Wendt. Music by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.",positive
