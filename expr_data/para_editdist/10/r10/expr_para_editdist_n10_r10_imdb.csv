11554,"I don't know what else to say about this horrible movie that has't already been said. Honestly I have only myself to be angry with. I should have know better when I saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap, but I loved War Games so I indulged my whim. I will live to regret that decision the rest of my life. From the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game I knew I was in for a ride though the land-that-good-writing-forgot. The list of very, very, very bad plot lines, dialog, and acting is so long I would crash IMDb if I tried to post it. To those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me. I am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung.",negative

24430,"this is a dreadful adaption of Charles Kingsley's story. The animation is, to put it bluntly, awful. And the songs are a disgrace to film songs, especially the ""high cockororim"" song, which they keep repeating. I feel sorry for Jon Pertwee and David Jason, two of Britain's finest talents, providing the voice for the depressing animation sequence. Bernerd Cirbbins tries this best to perform in this awful production , but fails. Avoid this film at all costs, even if it is the last film on this planet!",negative

23112,"This one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine film tried to capitalize on the much better Michael Curtiz's film ""Angels with Dirty Faces"". As directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in America's dinner cities today. The film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were well paired together. The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks. In a way it's curious how carson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right there in New York. It was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. The young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals. How times change!",positive

47767,"I iran across Yvette McClendon in a film at the Los Angeles Film Festival and thought she was a doll. After writing my review of her film there, I wanted to see more of her! Found this movie, it was pretty bad. Not her fault, she is only in the first few minutes where she is obviously being the person to pull you in to watch this bad movie. BAD directing. Scenes are looped over and over, with all the actresses. Amber Smith has a very bad breast job yet the other actresses looked pretty good. I really like Yvette but, this was obviously a bad choice of hers. I can't believe I rented this trash to look for her. I hope to find her other movies.",negative

Atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that Ron Palillo is third billed, and yet has three minutes of screen time, and even those karen't any good.

46509,"I concur with what mallicka.b has said. The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. Emotions karen't conveyed properly. I guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my view, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. I also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes. I'm a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) Can't help it; sorry for that. 'Raincoat' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed.",positive

An unruly neighbourhood catches up to him and just as they're about to torch him, the drives this van off a cliff. into the moon. Not the best ending I've seen but it was original.

I cannot stand her for one second, she has got to be one of the most bitchiest person i've seen. Even though i kinda like her southern voice.

I have rated this movie three out of ten based on the quality of the film. When one pays for a movie whether for not its at the theatre for on DVD this movie was not worth the admission price that was charged.

The movie is all about the emotions and the turmoil both them go through and how they accept the whole thing. The movie avoid any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. Though the movie is in Marathi, language is not a barrier at all. It proves that to make good movie you do not need item songs, superstars and usual marsala. Excellent performances.
