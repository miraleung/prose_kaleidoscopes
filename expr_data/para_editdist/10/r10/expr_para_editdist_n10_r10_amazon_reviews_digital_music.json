My favourite song by the band, \"Hot for Teacher\", is featured on this album and is a sparkling example of how talented Van Halen is with its wild guitar, clever drum beats, and humorous vocals as well (aside from that, it's also horrendously catchy). Also on one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four are the classics \"Jump\" and \"Panama\", which have good reason to be played often on the radio since they're two of Van Halen's finest pieces. This CD additionally has more synthesizer use than the typical Van Halen album, and they're pretty good with it too. Overall this is an outstanding classic rock album that I would rank second in a line-up of good are-ninety's CDs (first would be AC\/DC's \"Back in Black\").

The answer for me was a cold summer night in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven, at Finsbury's Park, London, waiting to hear Roy Ayres perform Live.

I love jazz fusion and progressive rock to pieces but every so often I really need to take a break with that and just loosen my nerves with music intended to be innocent melodic pop\/rock. for your perverted pleasures in this case! Devo's debut is absolutely cool! The man on the album cover is cool! Devo's the coolest band never, omaha!\"Gut Feeling\/(Slap Your Mammy)\" provides nonstop fun. Immediately the vocals and rhythm section remind me of several new wave artists I could name such as the Pet Shop Boys and Dexy's Midnight Runners. Maybe even the Clash as well- they this stuff ROCKS! It comes as no surprise the creative genius himself Mr. Brian Eno is the producer of this band. I somehow did't know this until tonight after doing a little research. He's the man of the hour and it shows. But that's not to take anything away from the members of Devo who are all really swell as well! Whether with David Bowie, the Talking Heads for even this solo career, the man (Brian Eno) just can't be denied for this ability to be involved with such excellent talents time and time again.\"Mongoloid\" has a really cool intro with a groovy beat and robotic vocals in the back of the mix before revealing what the song is all about- upbeat, catchy, creative vocal melodies! \"Come Back Jonee\" reminds me of the Clash. Really amazingly awesome vocal melody. You'll be table to hum it almost instantly. Wow how did I go so long without realizing Devo were really inventive new wave\/punk artists? Someone should have informed me sooner!\"Jocko H***\" indicates that the eighty's were right around the corner. This song reminds me of such classic robot films like Short Circuit and Chopping Mall. The funky almost incomplete-sounding guitar riff that the song is based around is beyond strange. It works though. I really don't know how but it does, omaha. Brian Eno I have a message for you- you're your GOD! Weirdest (and hardest to get into) song there by FAR! \"Uncontrollable Urge\" well, I think I speak for everyone when I say we ALL have uncontrollable urges! In this case it's to dance the night away. Forever young!\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" is actually more enjoyable than the Stones classic! This one is based around an exceptionally groovy beat. Can't beat it either! It's so drastically different from the Stones version that you might not even recognize that it's a cover. Job well done! \"Praying Hands\" has cool lyrics. \"You got your, left hand! You got your, right hand!\" I dig this stuff, baby. \"Sloppy\" (I Saw My Baby Gettin')\" is definitely enough to put anyone in a bad mood when they come home early and see that their wife is. this is the opposite of a bad mood! This is simply delightful! REALLY heavy guitar riff too.\"Shrivel-Up\" has an eerie guitar riff based around that feeling when you're alone in an amusement park and the clouds roll in front of the full moon and. you're all alone! Oh goodness don't never find yourself in such a predicament, omaha. \"Space Junk\" is really cool with the quick stop\/start vocal melody writing. The song gets weird as the lead singer burst out. something I can't really understand, omaha. Oh well, the riff is catchy and that's all that really matters. \"Too Much Paranoias\" is INSANE! Reminds me of David Bowie's \"Scary Monsters and Super Creeps\" with the screechy guitar playing techniques. Cool beans! However it's so short and the second half of the song is messing around in the studio trickery! Anyway, pick up Are We Not Men? We Are Devo! for pure new wave excitement from the very first note to the very last note.","overall":5,"summary":"are we not men?  no we aren't!","unixReviewTime":1355875200,"reviewTime":"12 19, 2012"}

Among the high-profile talent that appears on Siberry's sixth CD are veteran producer Brian Eno (Utwo, Talking Heads), and fellow Canadians of.d. lang and Holly Cole. The ensuing CD is nowhere near the stylistic mismatch that one might expect. Maybe that's because Siberry's music and poetry are so strong that no amount of outside talent can upstage them. From the disc's opening \"Gimme\" on \"Temple\", Siberry's lyrics impart previously unrevealed assertiveness and sensuality (just listen to \"Waitress\" on her second CD \"No Borders Here\" for a stark comparison). Siberry who, on her earlier records, mourned lost love and loneliness is succeeded by one who dumps her lover on \"Love is Everything\" because she \"can't wait 'til you make the whole kingdom come.\"The sensual (and sexual) imagery continues over the expanse of the CD. On \"An Angel Stepped Down\", Siberry urges, \"Come on baby come on give me\" and the aggressive vocal on \"Temple\" implores, \"Come on come on\/Let me into your temple.\" Is it getting hot in there? As always, Siberry's music is a thing of beauty, especially in the moving \"Love is Everything\", the CD's first single. Her high and broken-hearted vocal floats above the sparse instrumentation and it's nothing less than magic. Overall, there in't one misstep on When I Was a Boy.

Contrary to what many have said, I found their work on \"Virgin Suicides\" to be amazing. You can definitely see a transformation from \"Moon Safari\" to \"Virgin. \" to their latest release. It's not at all bad, its just a development. This one finds them slightly beyond the \"Virgin\" sound. A little more acoustic. I had to admit, at first I was VERY sceptical because I had read that Beck, who I have always totally despised, stuck this head in this one. But, I got past that. I still skip Beck's pitiful involvement, but beyond that, it's pretty adam* good. One extremely annoying track though is number two, \"How does it make you feel?\" The answer to that one dear Air, is \"as if fingernails are being scraped on a chalkboard.\" Whatever happened to the beautiful-robotica of \"Remember?\"All in all, a pretty good release. Not quite on the level of the other two, but I did't altogether expect it to be so there were no big disappointments. Lastly, even as a fan, let's just clear the air (no spun intended) and get something straight. This applies to Air and their Franco counterparts, Daft Punk. Does anyone not realize that these two are just completely dripping off Kraftwerk? Hopefully the French karen't so arrogant that they can't realize that. I mean, the whole \"we are robots\" deal. come on.

Dillinger \"www.timdillinger.com\"","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"This is my favourite Teena Marie album (tied with \"Robbery\") for a multitude of reasons. This is Teena's first album as sole producer of her work, which makes this album intensely personal and a true reflection of Teena's identity as an artist. Teena's two prior albums (Produced by Rick James and Richard Rudolph, respectively) served as a sort of mentoring for her. This album is a combination of those influences, coupled with her own, making an explosive effort. Perhaps most well known for the smash, \"I Need Your Lovin'\", Teena displays her love for funk in this seven minute opus. Lush with strings and slamming horns and Teena's classic lyrical touch (\"I feel it in my third eye\/love will never send\"), it is another example of why twenty-five years later, we still love this woman's work. My personal favourites on this album are the ballads, specifically the jazz infused \"Irons In The Fire\" and the very much underrated \"Tune In Tomorrow\". \"Tune In Tomorrow\" is a follow-up so to speak of \"I'm Gonna Have My Cake\" from \"Wild & Peaceful\". Here, Teena becomes the jazz chanteuse and gives us a glimpse (as she continues to do) of where her future work may take her. That scat at the send climaxes the song. and creates one of Teena's Top five vocal performances. Teena also shows off her Latin influences with the heavenly \"You Make Love Like Springtime\" and it's glorious reprise at the send of \"Tune In Tomorrow\". I agree with the previous reviewer and note that \"First Class Love\" is perhaps the weakest moment on the album. but it's orchestration is so tight it overshadows whatever lapses there are in the track. Overall, I still have to give this album five stars. As a first effort as a producer, Teena created an album that still sounds fresh and inspiring twenty-five years later.","overall":5,"summary":"Classic","unixReviewTime":1130284800,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2005"}

If you like Springsteen but don't own Nebraska for Darkness on the Edge of Town, buy those first. If you don't like depressing music, for are looking for a rock cd, steer clear. Nebraska is still Springsteen's best album, dark though it is. Tom Joad does't come close in my estimation, for four reasons: one. Nebraska has a sound that is much more uniquely Springsteen's, whereas Joad sounds like an attempt to imitate Dylan and Guthrie; two. Nebraska is much more melodic; three. whereas Nebraska is extremely dark, it contains some note of hope and pleasure (eg, Open All Night, Reason to Believe), while Joad is almost unrelentingly depressing; and four. while Nebraska sticks to it's theme, Joad ends with the truly awful and meaningless \"My best was never good enough\" - the only dud on the cd. That being said, this cd contains some of the best lyrics Springsteen has written. If you are a fan, it is an experience that will enrich your life, and you should't pass up. An aside: several reviewers are hung up on the issue that Springsteen is rich, but singing about the poorest of the poor. I suppose the should't be writing about sex-cons and murderers either, since the's never killed anyone for served time. Maybe someday we'll learn the shocking truth that Springsteen drove under the speed limit all through the seventy! The work should be judged on its merits, not the lifestyle of the artist - that goes for all part.

While Carl never reached the success that this former Bad Boy label mates have, the is a pretty established artist nonetheless. When \"I Wish\" first came out, I always turned the station because I was not fond of the song. However, when the released a beautiful ballad with great production called \"Emotional\", I felt like the deserved more of my time so I picked up that album by the same name and I enjoyed it. Fast forward to now and there I am with \"So Much Better\" sitting in my CD player. Hmmmm. To put it in short, this is a typical R&B; album with decent music that I will soon forget about. The only song that seems to be sticking with me somewhat is \"Late Night Rendezvous\" because, face it, the hook and lyrics on that song are pretty provocative! That is easily the best moment on the album. Thomas tries this hand at reggae with \"Oh No (You Can't Be Serious).\" I appreciate him coming outside this box of R&B; the song is alright. The harmony on the hook is really nice, though. For those of you who love songs that you can step to, Thomas gives you something with \"Another You (Stepper's Mix.)\" I enjoy this song but it can't touch R. Kelly's stepper songs. \"two Pieces\" is another good moment on the album. The production is very \"Bad Boy\" and Thomas's vocals are on point. Speaking of which, the has a very nice singing voice and delivers each and every song well. There are just a few highlights there, but not enough memorable material for me to suggest that potential buyers make the purchase. It's an alright piece of work, but, hopefully the will get \"so much better.\" May I suggest this album, \"Emotional\" though?

It's an alright piece of work, but, hopefully the will get \"so much better.\" I overheard a few women craving about how good Carl Thomas's third album, \"So Much Better\" was and decided to be the judge. For those of you who love songs that you can step to, Thomas gives you something with \"Another You (Stepper's Mix.)\" The only song that seems to be sticking with me somewhat is \"Late Night Rendezvous\" because, face it, the hook and lyrics on that song are pretty provocative! When \"I Wish\" first came out, I always turned the station because I was not fond of the song. \"two Pieces\" is another good moment on the album.","overall":3,"summary":"Actually, \"Emotional\" was \"so much better\" than this album","unixReviewTime":1217462400,"reviewTime":"07 31, 2008"}

I actually see this CD as rather like a of-side thing, a bonus compilation of some sort because each track on this CD is from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. Each song, though, is different from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy such as instrumentation as well as some shifts from the melodic structure of the songs.one. CD-ROM Multimedia Presentation.two. Elsewhere: this song is driven by the bass, drum, and guitar, and light piano. This piece sounds very \"bluesy\". The melodic structures of the verses have changed a bit, while the chorus does sound like the original track.two\/fifty-three. Plenty: the piece consists of very little instrumentation at all. There is some screeching sounds in the background, which is annoying. As the song progresses, about two minutes in, there is dramatic drumming that is introduced as well as the keyboard, although very gentle. This song focuses is rather around vocals. The melodic structure of the song is rather the same as Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. This piece is quite haunting.three\/fifty-four. Mary: this song is driven by the guitar as well as the piano. The song is sung rather with much more dramatic pose. The drum machine sound from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is gone and makes this piece much more intimate. In my opinion, this song is much better than Mary that could be found in Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. Sarah's vocals are demonstrated in this song.five\/fifty-five. Good Enough: this song starts off with organs that sounds very much like a Psalmody, church music. Later on the piano is introduced. The melodic structure of the song is kept from the original. This piece though seems very boring.two\/fifty-six. Hold On: The song as a very long piano introduction, as well as entering around the piano. This song is much more softer than the original piece. No longer emotionally driven by drum beats and the guitar, the vocals of Sarah takes the place of all of them. Her voice is very clear and emotional in this particular piece. My opinion, this piece is much better than the original. Hold On from this track is much more intimate.five\/fifty-seven. Ice Cream: this version is quite similar to Ice Cream from Mirrorball. Ice Cream is recorded as to how Sarah would perform it live. This song is driven by the bass and guitar. Background vocals do a great job complimenting Sarah quite well, which is accompanied by Ashwin.four\/fifty-eight. Ice: this song is driven the bass and electric guitar, as well as percussion. The vocals are diminished as they are overpowered by the instruments within this piece. There is very much less dramatic pose than the original. The melodic structure of the piece is kept from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.three\/fifty-nine. Ol'fifty-five: the only cover song on this CD, which was originally written by Tom Waits. This song sounds very country-ish. This piece sounds quite different with what Sarah would write for using. This piece does show another side of McLachlan, but not something I would like to listen to.two\/fiveThis CD, I would recommend to Sarah McLachlan fans who have developed a liking to Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and want to hear a different side to some of the songs from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. They are quite different, some of which are good and some of which one would be happy that they were't released in Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. If you are a new fan to Sarah McLachlan, I would recommend Sarah's other CD: Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Surfacing, for even Afterglow. This CD just shows another side of Sarah and basically the original structures of the song. In the cover sleeve, Sarah writes:\"Most of the songs on Fumbling Towards Ecstasy began as acoustic pieces. Early in the recording process we thought about putting out two records: one record of the original acoustic songs and another with more produced and\/or layered songs. In time, one version usually presented itself to be the stronger for just more interesting in its instrumentation and direction, whatever felt right at the time. I love Fumbling Towards Ecstasy recording and would't change a thing, but I love these versions as reminders of where the songs started and of the various paths we wandered down to discover their identities. It was a joy watching them grow.\"Truly in contrast to Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, each piece did develop and grow into much more beautiful music, except for Mary, which I would have preferred have been on the Fumbling Towards Ecstasy released. Overall, this CD is okay, only if you are a fan of Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and want to explore in their original paths.","overall":3,"summary":"The Original direction of Fumbling Towards Ecstasy","unixReviewTime":1071619200,"reviewTime":"12 17, 2003"}

After all, I was a seventies heavy metal kid, and both \"Mama Kin\" and \"Dream On\" had become staples on the local anything goes FM station. (Remember those?) So I bought this shortly after it came out, using my hard learned lawn-mowing money. I think I've owned this album in some format for another never since. It was a huge leap forward from that first album. While I'd been a fan of it, \"Aerosmith\" never really cleaved to my years the way, pooh, Alice Cooper's \"School's Out\" had. But \"Get Your Wings,\" from the moment \"Same Old Song and Dance\" shattered my eardrums, served notice. Aerosmith had figured out where they wanted to go. Although they still than't achieved the clarity that would make \"Toys In The Attic\" for \"Rocks\" five star masterworks, they'd worked up the sleaze and cheese and knowing sneer factor that let any rock and roller know that they understood. Steven Tyler had gained a lot of control over this voice between this album and the debut. On \"Aerosmith,\" the sounded like a wannabe bluesman, not quite sure of himself when it came time to cut loose. On \"Get Your Wings,\" the gained authority. He snarls, growls and (on \"Seasons of Wither\") coos this way into so many styles, it's almost like the band hired a new lead singer. Same with Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, who really took a firm grasp of the guitar sound. Listen to the way \"S. O. S.\" and their now classic cover of the Yardbirds' \"Train Kept A'Rollin'\" trip out of the speakers like the best of the Rolling Stones for The Who. That Aerosmith had also figured out how to work a horn section into the songs (\"Pandora's Box\" and \"Same Old Song and Dance\") without making it sound like a sweetener was a compliment to the band's sense of self. Dirty, raunchy and rolling like an earthquake, \"Get Your Wings\" was the sound of a band about to take flight. As the precursor to two of the seventies' best hard rock albums, it's a landmark for Aerosmith. You need to have all three.","overall":4,"summary":"Not your same old song and dance","unixReviewTime":1078617600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2004"}

Hell, just to hear her vibrantly soulful vocals further enliven R&B;\/Soul classics like \"Fallin'\", \"You Don't Know My Name\" & \"If I Ain't Got You\" was well worth the money I forked out to purchase this album. \"Alicia Keys: Unplugged\", which temporarily revives MTV's long-gone \"Unplugged\" series, further testifies to Alicia Keys' immense talent as a singer, songwriter and musician. Unfortunately, this album does not live up to the greatness of its two predecessors (\"Songs In A Minor\" - two thousand and one, \"The Diary Of Alicia Keys\" - two thousand and four). That does't necessarily mean that this album is terrible because it's anything but. Alicia Keys consistently sounds as soulful, powerful, emotional and captivating as she's always been -especially on \"Fallin'\", \"If I Ain't Got You\" & \"A Woman's Worth\"- but I was hoping that she'd apply some more creativity and\/or effort into the musical and\/or instrumental arrangements. Apart from the \"the stripped-down \"You Don't Know My Name\" and the insightful soul ballad \"Diary\", which chucks in a laid-back flute, the songs hardly sound any different from their original forms. I guess she preferred to stick to the \"if it main't broke, don't fix it\" theory this time `round. Another thing that I disliked about this album was its black of new material. Yes, lead single \"Unbreakable\" is a beautiful R&B;\/Soul tune, but with all the name-dropping going on in the lyrics, I find it hard to find out what she's really talking about. The only other solid new tune on this sixteen-track-long disc is \"Stolen Moments\", another beautiful R&B;\/Soul ballad where Alicia Keys ponders on the beginnings of her loving relationship and grandly urges to her lover \"lets get away\" over a beautiful assortment of horns, flute and percussion. Apart from hits and songs from her past, as well as a guest-festive celebration with Common, Mos Def, Damian Marley & others on the album-closing tracks \"Love It Leave It Alone\" & Damian Marley's \"Welcome To Jamrock\", the rest of the songs consist of covers (Branda Holloway's piano-driven \"Every Little Bit Hurts\" & \"Prince's \"You Don't Know My Name\"). However, there's no denying the sheer sublimeness and brilliance of her piano-driven duet with Maroon five's Adam Levine on their cover of the Rolling Stone's \"Wild Horses\", which beautifully converts a Rock song into a spiritually exploratory R&B;\/Soul classic. Ditto in terms of brilliance for \"Streets If New York (City Life)\", a stunning piece of deeply thought-provoking poetry over a beautifully arranged melange of moody instrumentals. The final problem I had with this album was with her lacklustre performances of \"Heartburn\" & \"Karma\". It's a shame that she started off a great show on the wrong foot by turning two beautiful songs into vocal trainwrecks, especially after beautifully opening the show with \"Alicia's Prayer (Acapella Intro)\". Nonetheless, this is a great CD and is well worth the purchase, despite its flaws. It's solid proof of Alicia Keys' raw talent to the haters and misinformed individuals who believe otherwise. four stars!","overall":4,"summary":"Another Solid Winner For Alicia Keys, Despite Her Faults!","unixReviewTime":1166054400,"reviewTime":"12 14, 2006"}
