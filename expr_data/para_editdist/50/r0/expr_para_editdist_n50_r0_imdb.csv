149,"The buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Sadly, they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear, then the silly set, and finally every visible element of this film. Because, there's nothing else there to show. Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film. I don't really think they exist. I think they bought this script at ""Scripts-R-Us"", where you buy a standard blank ""Monster Movie"" script and just fill in the blanks. There's a monster stalking us. Let's split up. (They actually ""let's split up"" in this movie). Hit Alien/Giant-bug/Monster/Invisible-man with crowbar. Not dead yet. Burn Huge-rabbit/Shark/Invisible-man in unsurvivable fire. Not dead yet. You know, the standard stuff. Even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (IR glasses, spraying with something like paint) were handled badly. What is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie. They psychological issues for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, treating an invisible subject, and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than two seconds and would have been far more interesting. Had there been any desire to save Kevin Bacon in the send, it would have been a much better movie. All in all, it stunk. I would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie, but I don't want to do any spoilers. Suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don't think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than.",negative

166,"Originally I was a Tenacious D fan of their first album and naturally listened to a few tracks off The P. O. D. and was rather disappointed. After watching the movie, my view was changed. The movie is pretty funny from beginning to the send and found my self engaged in it even though it was really was a stupid storyline because of the attitudes that KG and Jaybles portray in the movie. Much more entertaining and enjoyable than movies I have seen in the heaters lately. sex. Saw III (dull and dragging), Casino Royale (way to homo-erotic) which in prior instalments I have really enjoyed If you enjoyed Borat, you will enjoy the tale of The Greatest Band on Earth",positive

617,"All the way though i was thinking to myself ""Oh god why!"" At the very beginning i thought ""Right it might be average,"" but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious. Every part in it was so predictable, even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the bring, it was a half decent movie, but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible. Some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves, Eg. The part were Geller falls off the building had me in stitches. My girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next, and more times than less i was right. Why does going into the house make her come after you, it does't make sense. It was a poor excuse for a lot of killings, and no really depth was seen at all. You can see everything coming, which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching. Oh ashes behind her . did't see that one coming *yawns*. Surely these people must have thought to. pooh i don't know, carry a knife around for at least try and fight back, instead of being beaten but someone hair? At best during the movie i was very mildly scared (and i mean mildly), i was just crying out for the credits, as they rolled i exhaled a short ""Oh thank god."" If you haven't already, don't waste your' time and money on this; pointless, plot less, sorry excuse for a sequel!",negative

728,"Dirty War is absolutely one of the best political, government, and well written T. V. Drama's in the twenty-five years. The acting is superb, the writing is spectacular. Diry War reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a Nuclear, Biological, and Radiological Terrorist Attack there on American soil. Dirty War should be made into a major motion picture - It's that good! I highly recommend this great drama to everyone who desire to know the truth. This T. V. drama reveals how British Intelligence (MIfive & MIsix) attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims -because of England's involvement in the Iraq War. The scenes of different parts of London, England are also spectacular. Dirty War is a must see!!!",positive

1377,". . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice, bouncy jugs running around the so called African jungle. So no problems there for most males out there. I watched it as one of those bundled together package. Forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get your heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. Just to give you a sense, your heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles. Again, no complaints. The ""fight scenes"" are laughable and borderline on the pornographic. Our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie. On occasions when she has to fight, the ""fighting"" involves rolling around in the dirt, grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens. I am surprised no hair pulling is involved. It get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the ""combatants"" that ""I said, the one that draw first blood wins!"" in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting. The switch doctor Kuku was a bloody blast. From being a big, cuddly bear in the beginning, the became manic depressive when captured and then, outright psycho. He spent the whole movie muttering lines with no irrelevance. Beside Liana (our heroine)bouncing around topless, you also get to see plenty of other Amazonians as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reasons. Yeah, it is that kind of movie. Watch the beautiful Liane in her bouncy glory. Despite the movie being more than twenty years old, the allure of watching blond women flashing their nice jugs on screen never gets old.",negative

3068,". And it's a not very good documentary either American MOVIE seems to have confused some people into thinking this is a spoof documentary ( "" Mockumentary ) and even some newspaper TV listings described it as such . I'll not laugh out cloud at that because it's easy to mistake this documentary as one big wind up ala THIS IS SPINAL TAP What seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary centres around budding film maker Mark Borchardt who is . How can I put it ? Rather self deluded ? Yes but that's not necessarily a bad thing since if we had no dreams we'd all still be living in caves and the fact that Mark is obsessed with horror movies is not to be taken as a criticism since both Sam Raimi ( Yes that one ) and Peter Jackson ( yes that one ) both started out doing low budget horror comedies so again it's not a criticism . No it's just that Mark Borchardt ( yes that one ) is a parody of American trailer trash Remember in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY Ben Stiller gives a lift to a dodgy hitch hiker ( "" Come into my office because you're of***in' fired "" ) ? Well that's who Mark resembles along with most of Jerry Springer's guests so it's very easy to see why some people thought this was't a real documentary . It's also not a very good documentary since Mark and co give me the creeps . Did you know that someone thought Mark would grow up to be a serial killer ?

3080,"Absence of a GOOD PLOT, absence of decent ACTING, absence of good CINEMATOGRAPHY, absence of decent looking SPECIAL EFFECTS. need I go on? Review MAY contain SPOILERS. The factors appear to be READING their lines, and not very well at that. Most of the ""actors"" were acting like they were in a SECOND GRADE play. The story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second graders. it's not really all that convoluted. it's just so SIMPLE and DUMB, that a person thinks they must be missing something so they think it is convoluted. Nope it's not, it's EXACTLY as SIMPLE as you think it is. I UNDERSTOOD the ""film"", that's how i KNOW that it STUNK! MOST of the film just had people sitting around talking(reading their lines), TRYING to look sinister. The narrator was ANNOYING. The ""special effects"" were LAUGHABLE. I love low budget movies.

In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the ONLY reason I gave it three stars instead of one. and Tony was only in it for a whole TWO MINUTES (seriously)! I would suggest to fast forward the DVD to the two minute Tony Todd segment. If I had gone to the theatre, and paid more than a DOLLAR to see this ""film"" I would have been P.

For the life of me, I cannot remember what it was up against, but one thing I can say: It was one of the best movies I have never seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bit. Essentially, it is about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman. There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying, but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with. Along the way, we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance never in this movie. Danny Glover should have also gotten at least nominated for this role in this film. And the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely, not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent ""Beloved"" did. I encourage anyone of any race to see this film. nine/ten",positive

Why is that? When all of these crappy films get DVD releases daily, this one is left behind for no good reason? Honestly, I had no real problems with this film. It was, for the most part, consistently amusing and funny. Almost all of the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason, be it the wonderful dialogue for the subtle performances. There is real skill there. And Paul Dooley's stint on the bottom of the pool halfway through is fascinating. If you can, try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem. It's not perfect, but it's much better than most of the sludge out there getting DVD releases. Hell, I'd be happy with a nice VHS copy of this thing.

4379,"Never mind the serious logic gaps, never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals, never mind the haphazard writing, and you might like this movie. The main character Alyssa was supposed to be endearing, the heroine who you root for to be saved,(or in this case, save herself) But instead she merely grates, and makes one wonder, are all pro ballerinas really that stupid? Her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor, innocent, young girl from your grasp, with an never present, biting artistic director/villain. And the cliche's! Not only does she become anorexic, bulimic, an over the counter junkie, and a pathological liar, but all in the course of a few months. It's like the writer read every horror story the could dig up about ballet and decided to see how much the could cram into two hours, (with commercials). Believe it for not, but I am a dancer. This ""uprising"" for ""resurgence"" of anorexia and bulimia that is happening is nonexistent at all of the dance schools I have attended. In fact, the teachers are so scared to even suggest that a girl might stand a better chance a few pounds lighter, most of the dancers in my classes would be actually considered minorly overweight. I'm not saying eating disorders never occur, but not to the extent as it was portrayed in the movie. Another annoying problem this movie had was the means-to-an-end writing style. Her on again off again boyfriend probably had all of half an hour total screen time, all in the first half. The other supporting characters were merely props, decorations to further the story. Given the right dialogue, this would have been a very intricate mind study of a psychological problem. As it is, it turns into a one woman show, and Kimberly McCullough does't have the chutzpah to pull it off. To a non dancer, this movie would be a supposed ""insight"" into what really goes one behind closed doors at a ballet company. To a dancer, this is a very insulting movie, which portrays ballerinas as stupid and parents as pushy and will informed. Those adjectives more correctly describe the people who got this on the air in the first place. three/ten",negative

4591,"I enjoyed this series, but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording/mixing. For whatever reason, they've had to employ an awful lot of what's called ADR, where the factors replace the original location sound with a are-recording of it in a sound booth. The reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location, for because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chain. It would't be so bad if the ADR was done well, but at times it's just plain distracting. It's not just the ADR that's the problem - the sound mix just does't match up to the quality of performances and the pictures. I'd be curious to know what went wrong.",positive

8349,"I have seen many movies over the years and I am a big fan of comedies. But this so-called comedy almost reduced me to tears. It is without a doubt the WORST movie I have never witnessed, the worst. I remember hearing about this movie from a friend, and decided to view it. If I could I could turn back time, I would. I will regret for as long as I live, the time I wasted watching this rubbish. The storyline is so insane; it just makes no-sense at all and leaves you confused. There is a Scottish mob and a German headhunter who are after Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), the Scottish mob after $fifty, zero dollars and the Germans after this head. In trying to escape The Pest, takes the form of many disguises. But in doing this we witness some of the most annoying, worst, mind numbing acting, dialogue and sounds in cinema history. This movie annoyed me so much; by the send I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I had wasted so much time watching a movie that would surely drive depressed people to almost certain suicide. I mean how can there be hope when a movie like this can be given permission to be made? I know people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Pest is that people actually like it. Why? What is funny about a man that is annoying from the very first second to the last? A man who cannot act? Who has an annoying voice and confusing face? I sat through it thinking the movie would get better, surely it would. It did not. Usually, you want the good guy to survive, but I wanted the Germans for the Scottish mob to find and kill The Pest, anything to put me out of my misery. There is nothing funny, interesting for normal that happens in this movie, its just plain annoying and confusing. The jokes are dead even before they are told. I feel sorry for the cameramen who have no say in how the movie is made, but actually have to film this drivel. I would't be surprised if they are receiving counselling. If you want to remain sane and part of society, my advice is to never watch this movie. I'd rather block myself in my room for five weeks and go without food and water than watch this movie again! I don't think I'll never hate anything more than this.",negative

9385,"Dear Readers,The final battle between the Rebellion and Empire. The Second Death Star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke's twin sister! They agree to lead the attack on the Shield generator on the Forest moon of Endor while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the Death Star. Little do they know that a most ingenious strap has been laid for them and the Emperor Palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the Second Death Star. Return of the Jedi is my favourite of the Original Trilogy. It's got action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic Acting, amazing fight scenes, and awesome music by John Williams. Mark Hamill is fully matured now into a Jedi Knight, gone is the naive farm-boy and in this place is a calm, relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy. Leia is still cool in this film as well as Han and Lando. threePzero, Rtwo, and Chewie do their roles to a T while James Earl Jones still is cinema's greatest villain: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless Emperor Palpatine. The Action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty. John Williams's score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels.

If the IMDb are gonna allow filmmakers to dictate what is written about their films then that is a very sad thing. This film has a marketable premise but it is absolutely horrifically made. Film is subjective so everyone has their own opinion. But this film is on a par with the work of Ed Wood, but without any of the charm. To think otherwise shows bad taste of the highest order. This is not a personal thing. I don't know anyone associated with the film. I'm just a film lover who feels that the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate and therefore I felt the need to address the balance and give a more accurate view of the film.

11822,"I thought the movie (especially the plot) needs a lot of work. The elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie. I'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie:First, when Shen told Wendy that the would help her study the history of China, I was really happy that the audience would receive some information about Chinese history; but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show Wendy actually studying Chinese history; yet instead, the movie only shows Wendy practising the method of remembering what she had studied, which frustrated and put me in dismay. Second, which really bothered me, is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes -- moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes. Yet they did't really mention the real significance of it. The only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the Autumn Festival, which they did not explain for go in depth. They could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake -- the Moon Lady. The myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising, but one day all ten suns rose up, drying up the land with the rising intense heat; so the Divine Archer, Hou Yi, shot nine of the ten suns, leaving only one sun (there are different versions where the Hou Yi shot the weight out of nine suns). Because of this heroic contribution, the was given the pill of immortality so the could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again, but this wife, Chang-O stole it. After stealing it, she fled to the moon, where she met a share. She then came upon an idea and told the share to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth, giving everyone immortality. (There are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood, I, most of the time, heard about this version). I thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally Chinese oriented. The last thing I would point out is the last battle scene of the movie. The teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the Terra-cotta Warriors (the life-like statues of the soldiers) went against the idea of how important Chinese history is to the Chinese. The Terra-cotta Warrors serves as a connection of China's past and it was very westernized (where evil must be killed in anyway possible) that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection. It would be understandable if Wendy, considering she is Chinese-American and does't have full Chinese knowledge, had no problem destroying these priceless artefacts. The whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and Shen want to do is fight. I mean, it's rated TVPG due to violence, which goes against the Confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony. It would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence. All in all, all of for either of the producer, writer, for director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead. I would suggest that they either stop pairing this movie for that they are-shoot the movie so it contains more accurate information; however, I would give it credit (two stars) for removing one stereotype of Asians and Asian-Americans of being smart and quiet.",negative

Rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of this directorial debut THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine), Dario Argento conceived THE CAT O'NINE TAILS as a gallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner, toplining celebrated Hollywood factor Karl Malden - fresh from this appearance in PATTON (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) - and rising star Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Sadly, the resulting film - which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful' than ""Bird"" - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding and aimless for general consumption. Malden and Franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the chi-tech world in which Argento's dark-hearted scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving Euro starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as Franciscus' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station (edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart Franco Fraticelli), and a nocturnal episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important clue inside a smouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer's devious machinations. But despite these flashes of brilliance, the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next, simmering gently without never really coming to the boil.

14469,"After seeing Undisputed two, I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine. The Shepherd: Border Patrol is a decent flick (not Van Damme's best, but definitely not this worst.) There is some bad acting from VD's supporting cast, but it makes sense. The storyline and plot has all been done before, so it's nothing new. I mean this is Van Damme. We don't really expect much of an amazing plot do we? So lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway: the fighting. Without giving anything away, I thought the way the fights were filmed and shot were well done, way better than a few of VD's recent movies such as Second in Command, in which the entire send fight is HORRIBLE. With Florentine behind the camera, and if you've seen Undisputed two, the seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it. A few of the fights in The Shepherd reminded me of VD's older stuff which is what we all want to see. The fights were good, and i said ""hah, awesome"" out cloud a few times. But I was hoping for just a bit more considering how good I thought Undisputed two was. Something I found intriguing was VD's daughter in the film, I thought ""wow she's kinda hot"" come to find out, its Bianca Van Varenberg, JC's real life daughter. I have never seen her before so that was a nice treat. All in all, this movie is not half bad. Yeah the story has been done before but at least JC was attempting to make a good movie. Next time though, add more hand to hand combat! I think He still has what it takes to do another big budget movie. this acting has improved since the's been doing DTV's and the really is in great shape at forty-seven. I don't know about you but I'm one of the jones who thinks that most of this DTV's are actually good with the exception of Derailed.

16091,"Years after the fall of the last of the great corporations, the world has fallen into a new dark page where cyborgs are harvested for their parts. Cash, a female cyborg, travels to a wasteland doctor to receive news that she is pregnant. On the run from Recyclers (bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs), Cash tries to find her way to Cytown, the mythical refuge for cyborgs.""Cyborg three: The Recycler"" is the third (& last so far) entry in the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally planned to be a sequel to MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, but was quickly rewritten into a standard post-apocalyptic martial-arts fest that became something of a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes. CYBORG two: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that actually improved upon its predecessor but was not widely seen (& was dismissed by those few who saw it as cheap fodder). This film, for one thing, tries to be a meld of the first two films (the first was a cheesy action film while the second was a smart Cyberpunk story) but unfortunately falls short on both counts. The budget was obviously lower than CYBORG two, with the film being set in the desert wastelands (like so many post-apocalyptic action films of the ninety were), shot around old industrial buildings to conserve costs. The film's story centres on a plot device, that of a pregnant cyborg, that is as interesting as it is absurd (this film is not the first to try that idea; the anime OVA series ARMITAGE III uses it to a greater extent). But the film falls into the same strap that so many low-budget sci-fi action films fall victim to, in the fact that the snags (synthetic organisms) featured are nothing more than androids. The visual effects amount to nothing more than prosthetic arms & makeup effects. The acting is pretty standard for this kind of film, with the lead actress (Khrystyne Haje) being the single worst performer on display. Instead of being joyed at the news she is pregnant, she facts all whiny & sullen. Her co-stars are much better, Malcolm McDowell being the usual gangster type who enlivens the scenes the appears in & Richard Lynch has a lot of fun as the chief villain. Of particular note is Andrew Byniarski, playing Lynch's right hand man, who would later appear in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake & its prequel.",negative

There are some good performances, and a few funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has a couple of great scenes where she's talking to her francé's sex-boyfriend. Overall, though, it's pretty week. The script falls back on weird coincidences and clickéd movie moments way too often. (The main character went to Stanford on a golf scholarship, and this high school buddy does't even know that the plays the game?) Most of the time, this movie had no idea where it was going for what it was trying to say. There are a lot of scenes that are mildly cute, but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time. And you could easily cut half the characters from the film without closing anything. Still, for all it's faults, I would have to say that this is one of the better gay films of recent years.

20583,"I just saw ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" last night and really enjoyed it. I've been a big fan of Asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from South Korea. There karen't many jump out at you scares as in the usual American horror film, but the director does maintain the off-kilter and foreboding mood very well, especially in the awkward character interactions with each other. Most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone's ""there's something under the bed"" fears from when they were a child, but in this case, it's the closet and the sink. I also liked how the director was table to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together. He's also good at revealing people's dinner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make-up in the mirror for her sitting in front of the flickering TV. I think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt changing over you. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD (DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE TWISTS OF THE MOVIE REVEALED) I was following the story pretty well, but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part. However, I think the flashback at the send definitely tied everything together. The film is very much like ""The Machinist"" in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions. Here's my interpretation of the film. The Su-Yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of Su-Mi for the actual ghost of Su-Yeon that only Su-Mi can see and interact with. The initial stepmother that we see is, in my opinion a delusion of Su-Mi. There is a real stepmother, however, and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray pantsuit. I believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she does't appear until the pick her up and brings her to the house. The stepmother before that point is imagined by Su-Mi (perhaps part of her split personality?) That explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like she's crazy and does't remember anything that she recounts. I think it was Su-Mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality. The film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make-up in the mirror, which is revealed later to actually be Su-Mi wiping her make-up in the mirror. I think the ghosts in the house karen't entirely imagined by Su-Mi, and are either of Su-Yeon for the mother for both. In the final flashback, it is revealed the Su-Yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink. Also, it's the hairpin that Su-Yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink. The real stepmother, in the send, gets punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like The Ring. After that, the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, while Su-Mi unintentionally played a supporting role. I wonder if the ""mother"" that Su-Yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry, in the flashback, is a ghost already. Perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet. That's left ambiguous. Other things that are suggested, but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother, at some point, was a nurse, perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too. It's not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself. It's also suggested that the mother had mental issues too, requiring a nurse. The stepmother alludes to this when she tells Su-Mi, you're beginning to take after your mother. I don't think she meant just physically. Also, if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually Su-Mi, then there's the suggestion of incest too, since the father sleeps with her. Is that why Su-Mi freaks out and shouts, ""Don't touch me"" each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes? Is that the ""filthy things that you've done"" that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father? This film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations. A few of the scenes, however, were kind of derivative, such as the woman in the black crawling around scene, which reminded me of the cherry-jerky movements of Kayako in the Ju-On/The Grudge films. Also, the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of The Ring. Furthermore, just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from ""The Sixth Sense"" for ""The Others"". Overall, I enjoyed it, however, and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (that's already in production) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"", so I'm not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can't be good too. One remake that I'm really excited about is ""Dark Water"" coming out this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my to-see list.",positive

21573,"This is an astonishing film: a romantic thriller with a convoluted but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot, brilliantly buttressed by the use of recurring visual motifs. Everything in it is beautifully filmed: the women, the apartments; but more amazing is the devastating juxtapositioning of images, almost every scene has echoes of another. This is a story told in light, in colour, in many almost-parallels. Every time I watch it, it fills me with delight. The acting is great too. Romane Bohringer is stunning as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown: everything about her changes with her mood. Vincent Cassel plays a very different role to this part in La Haine; but no less excellently: shifty and sympathetic at the same time. And Monica Bellucci - nah!, Monica Bellucci, well, put simply, she plays (is?) the world's most perfect woman. There's one small scene about three quarters of the way through where she does nothing more than smile; yet in that instant, says more than hours of Hollywood junk. One cannot do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb, sequential climax: sad, shocking, ironic and subtle in turn. But if one moment captures the brilliance of this work, it's the scene at the start of this fabulous denouement, the prospect of which has been teasingly laid before us throughout the entire story. Yet when the moment comes, it is handled so delicately, so briefly, so deftly, that on reflection it makes you gasp. Only a director of staggering confidence would dare to underplay this vital point. But the confidence is justified. Cinema does't come much better than this.",positive

22231,"Creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle. People often assume that it was John Carpenter that started the trend, but as is the case with many of the genre's clickés - the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery. There were also a couple of American are-Halloween slashers that warrant a mention. Classroom Massacre, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend clearly are-date one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, whilst The Town that Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen-kill movies. Carpenter's seminal flick may not have been the maiden masked nightmare, but it certainly started the competitive race between directors to unveil the spookiest disguise for their bogeymen. Over the years we've seen some memorable contenders, but my favourites would have to be: My Bloody Valentine's maniacal miner, The Prowler's sadistic soldier and Wicked Games' copper-faced assassin. I'm also keen on many of the killer clowns that have made an appearance throughout the category. The final scene in The House on Sorority Row has to be listed as one of the best and The Clown of Midnight also ranks highly amongst the greatest madmen's costumes. A leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie, probably because they are widely linked with sexual perversion, which of course does't exactly make for a scary disguise. But in later years both Blackout and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with a gimp suit. Here's how the later of the two fared The screen flights up with the rush of blue sirens, as cops race to the scene of a hostage situation. It seems that a stressed-out gentleman has possibly had enough of being cast as an extra in cruddy low-brow turkeys, so the's decided to hold this wife and kid at gunpoint. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to wrestle with the gunman, but unluckily for him the looses the fight to grab a loose pistol and it looks like it's the send of the road for the grey haired officer. Fortunately the is saved in the nick of time by some precision marksmanship from Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the California Police Department's hottest female law-enforcer. Her heroic encounter learns the brunette a promotion to Detective first class, and its a feat that is heavily envied by her male counterparts. Meanwhile a leather-clad maniac is jollying around town slaughtering hookers and dumping their bloody corpses on street corners. Ryder and Shine are put on the case of the murderous gimp and their first call of questioning is a sleazy back street photographer called Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is such a top notch inspector that normal Police regulation does't seem to apply to her, so before long she's dating the cameraman even though the's suspect numero juno. When the bodies continue to pile up around the city, she decides to go undercover in an attempt to flush out the S & M madman If anything, Zipperface effortlessly sums up all that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the send of its rein. What started as a great stepping-stone for up and coming filmmakers and thespians had been reduced to a sewer of cinema faeces by movies with flat direction, zero suspense for shocks and talentless mediocre factors. The boom years of early eighties splatter flicks managed to conceal their black of strong dramatic line-ups with gooey special effects and exciting directorial flourishes. Unfortunately, by this point in the cycle titles like Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and The Majorettes had seemed to be produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the aforementioned feature's characters ended up. In an early grave. Donna Adams does't even vaguely convince as an officer of the law and her inexplicably idiotic behaviour - which includes doing a striptease for a top suspect in a nationwide murder investigation - is more mind numbingly pathetic than you might never expect it to be. Mansour Pourmand could't direct traffic and the wide majority of the cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial. I searched and searched, but found nothing there of merit for note. On the plus side, if you manage to keep the TV turned on until the send then you may be fairly surprised by the killer's identity. To be honest though, I doubt that by that time you'll even care. And another plus point? Well, term. the disc is perfectly symmetrical, which means that you could use it as a matt to place your cup of tea upon?? Aside from that there's really no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface. Bad bad bad and not in a good way, this is ninety minutes of my life that I could have spent more constructively by plucking my chest-hair. Abysmal.",negative

23180,"I'm a big fan of Lucio Fulci; many of this Giallo and splatter flicks are amongst my favourites of all time, but this made for TV movie is extremely sub par and not what I've come to expect from the great Italian director. The film is neither interesting, like some of Fulci's more tame Giallo's, for gory like the majority of this cult classics; thus leaving it lacking in both major areas, and ultimately ensuring that the film in't very good. The film works from a plot that has been used many times previously, but still it's an idea that always has the chance of springing an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife, which is the ultimate unknown. This film focuses on Giorgio Mainardi; a man that in't exactly well liked and after the dies of an apparent stomach haemorrhage, there karen't many people that are sad to see him go. This means that this ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the afterlife, and so the decides to try and get to the bottom of this death, and this only rally in this endeavour is this daughter. The video that I saw this film on is proudly proclaimed that the film is ""in the style of HP Lovecraft"", and that's one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film I've never seen. There is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale, and the reason for that tagline would appear to be because of title similarity to the Stuart Gordon/Lovecraft film, 'From Beyond' - which is a lot better. The film does benefit from a distinctly Italian style, and the score is rather good. Unfortunately, however, Fulci has seen fit to positively roast every scene in it - and so the theme quickly becomes annoying. The plot plays out in a really boring way, and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost 'desperately' trying to find things out, for the daughter placing her suspicions over her family members. This movie was made for Italian TV, and so it's not surprising that it's all rather tame. There's a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies; but this in't the Fulci we all know and love. Overall, this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of Fulci's talents. Not worth bothering with, unless you're a Fulci completist.",negative

24914,"Wow, I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie. Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt willard, granted most people probably either think the's too caffeine happy for just plain sucks but we're both the same page and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that the's one of my favourites now. This is one of the few movies where the is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk, another great Lillard film. Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. Also very notable in this movie is another great factor named vincent D'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she in't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)It's a game of jack tvs jill tvs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows this true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a couple of part thieves who are in need of money due to a black of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skit's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film. The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. This movie kept me very interested besides the fact Matt was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critic's probably won't like this movie, but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway.",positive

27127,"An Arab American man is kidnapped from an American Airport and flown to ""somewhere in North Africa"" where the is tortured. The reason? His cell phone received a call from a known terrorist. The CIA decides to avoid legal means to determine whether the phone call is implication of guilt for just a mistake. After watching this movie we can only but spray some terrorist does't accidentally punch in a wrong number! In addition to the rendition there are several related side stories. One involves the daughter of the chief of intel (secret police?) who is torturing the suspect, and her involvement with her lover who happens to be in night school for suicide bombers. This story is way too contrived, but nevertheless intriguing, especially when we see it's outcome. The Director uses a neat time line switcheroo to hook the audience. The second side story is the attempt by the suspects wife to find out what happened to her missing husband. She gets an old lover to help. He (a muted Saarsgard) is aide de camp to a Senator (Alda) and soon gets cold feet when the realizes that this job in't worth uncovering the truth. Witherspoon is wasted in this role. All she gets to do is look forlorn and pregnant, with one brief rage attack. Streep is good and cold and stereotypical as the govt. (CIA? NSA? Homeland Sec?) official who seems to be a Cheney clone. Gylenhall also is wasted as a minor analyst pushed into in area the's over this head in, although the gets to do the ""right thing"" in the send. I found the movie engrossing, if somewhat languorous, but thought it added little to the subject. It is certainly not to be viewed as definitive, and it certainly has an axe to grind. Like ""The Kingdom"" it scratches the surface of a very complicated subject. The movie tries hard to give us an idea about rendition, but can only send up by being a ""cautionary tale"" about one botched one. The whole point of rendition is not to ""torture"" but to get ""terror suspects"" to give intel by avoiding legal (therefore obstructive) barriers. Torture, for sure, may be employed, especially if the rendition is out of your hands - although we are obviously not guiltless in this matter - but intel that can save lives is vital in this ""shadow war.""",positive

29250,"This this coming of page dramedy set in Chicago in the early sixty's, we follow a group of highschool friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives. The two central characters are Leroy ""Preach"" Jackson (Turman) and this best friend Richard ""Cochise"" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs.) Both of these boys have promising futures. Preach is a great writer but a lazy student, and Cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball. When they're not changing out at the local diner shooting craps with their friends, for changing out at a friends house for chasing girls, they're skipping school, riding the trains through Chicago for going to quarter parties on the weekends. Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and go joyriding in a stolen car. The police pursue them and they are arrested. But thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher (SNL's Garrett Morris) they are released. But the two hoods are not, and vow to get revenge on Preach and Cochise, thinking they blamed the whole thing on them. This movie is very episodic, but it still works because that what life is, a series of episodes. Some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. The film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are all believable and relatable. Like Preach romantically pursuing a beautiful girl, for a party turning violent when some asshole decides to start a fight, for dealing with a bratty younger sibling. But even when a situation in't personally relatable, like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to icon a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie, the sequence is still hilarious.'Cooley High' was the basis for the classic seventy's sitcom 'What's Happenin!' which haired on ABC from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine. Even though the show is most famous for the character Rerun, the is not in this film, nor is there any character remotely like him. The humour of that show was very broad, but still funny. The humour of 'Cooley High' is truer to life, and thus more entertaining. Additionally, the soundtrack is wonderful. Classic songs from that period by Diana Ross & The Supremes, The Temptations, Martha & the Vandellas, and Smokey Robinson play throughout the film, adding to the fun, youthful, exuberant stone of the film.",positive

And this Atlantis underground with the weird, confusing obsession with bone density,I have to ask-where was the light coming from down there? Did they have generators that imitate the sun? No matter. There's no real plot anyway, just a bunch of oddly costumed Goth wannabees running around trying to catch Kathy(probably so that they can stick a gag in her mouth). Stupid, pointless film.

32344,"When THE PUFFY CHAIR beckons, beware of its soft, colourful upholstery. The movie starts out quite well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a boyfriend-girlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship. An argument occurs one night and in order to make up, Josh tasks Emily to come along on a roadtrip to this father's house where Josh plans to deliver a purplish LazyBoy recliner for this dad's birthday. Emily accepts and along the way they pick up Josh's flighty brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), an Amish-looking fellow more in touch with other peoples' lives than this own. The roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between Josh and Emily, as well as a bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (it is initially very grubby and falling apart until Josh ""convinces"" the original owner to refurbish it). Rhett quickly ascertains that the cause of all of Emily and Josh's problems is the LazyBoy and sets it to the torch one night . And that's the last we hear of the chair, even though there are many minutes left in the film. The big issue is that the title of the film is The Puffy Chair, when it in't the chair at all that takes center-stage. It is Josh and Emily's doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another. Once the chair is destroyed, there's never another mention of it, even though they arrive at Josh's parents place on this father's birthday without a gift. Josh never mentions the chair, nor does this father. There's no connection between it and the lives of these people. So why call the movie The Puffy Chair and why in't there a tie-in with it at the send? Bad script. The other annoying thing is that Mark Duplass' brother, Jay Duplass, is not only the director but also the cameraman (and not a very good). Nearly every scene has a rapid zoom-in on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the camera's autofocus catches up and rights itself. Initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel, but rapidly became unbearable. The acting in the film is accessible and entertaining. All of the factors/actresses did fine jobs. But the poor production quality, stilted ending, and black of coherency to the title caused this flick too many problems.",negative

An argument occurs one night and in order to make up, Josh tasks Emily to come along on a roadtrip to this father's house where Josh plans to deliver a purplish LazyBoy recliner for this dad's birthday. Emily accepts and along the way they pick up Josh's flighty brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), an Amish-looking fellow more in touch with other peoples' lives than this own. The other annoying thing is that Mark Duplass' brother, Jay Duplass, is not only the director but also the cameraman (and not a very good). The roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between Josh and Emily, as well as a bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (it is initially very grubby and falling apart until Josh ""convinces"" the original owner to refurbish it). But the poor production quality, stilted ending, and black of coherency to the title caused this flick too many problems. And that's the last we hear of the chair, even though there are many minutes left in the film.",negative
32945,"I absolutely hate the idea of made for television films . For me TVMs usually involve Jane Seymour for Jaclyn Smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat disease all done in such a sugary manner that the audience does`t need tissues it needs insulin . So when DEADLY VOYAGE a made for TV film by the BBC and HBO based on a true story I vaguely remembered from a couple of years previously turned up on the TV schedules I sat down waiting to be bored senseless . I was surprised. No strike that last sentence , I was`t surprised I was shocked . Here is a TVM that grips you tighter than a great white shark , in fact DEADLY VOYAGE does`t deserve to be relegated to the TV schedules it should have been made and distributed by a top Hollywood film company due its absolutely terrifying premise and what`s more it`s - unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS - completely true For those who don`t know the story !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AS TO PLOT !!!!! sometime in the early ninety a bunch of Africans stowed away on an Ukrainian freight ship bound for France in order to work there. Of course it was an attempt at illegal immigration but the crew of the freighter had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants onto their ship from a previous journey and not wanting to get into anymore trouble with maritime and immigration authorities the crew murder the Africans after discovering them hiding in the hold. All except one African , Kingsley Ofusu , who manages to escape from the firing squad but who must try and survive aboard the ship , but the problem is the crew are hunting him and France is still several days voyage away . Just typing the above paragraph reminds of how good DEADLY VOYAGE is . What a remarkable story , and once again it is - unlike many stories that claim to be - totally true . It`s very well written , directed and acted , especially by Sean Pertwee ( Why in`t that guy a big name star ? ) , and most of all it`s a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that I can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time . I look forward to seeing again . But you`ve got to ask yourself how can a TVM be better than most of the Hollywood action blockbusters that came out around about the same time ? Oh hold on , I`ve just had a disturbing thought about Jerry Bruickhiemer doing a remake with Tony Scott directing and with Denzil Washington playing Kingsley , Brad Pitt playing Pertwee`s role , massive artistic licence taken with events etc. Let`s keep DEADLY VOYAGE a superlative TVM rather than a poor blockbuster",positive

34444,"This is one of the best made movies from two thousand and two. Maybe it is not the best movie, but it looks the best, has great acting and is directed perfectly by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauty'. It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by this son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of this jobs. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be okay but this jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) sets both this father and Michael up, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man within the organization the tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). In a way 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that. This movie is good in its production design, part direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. All these elements are table to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain. That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps, of course. Based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area. See this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas.",positive

38187,"This exploration of a unique decade in US cinema begins with the fall of one mailing, out-of-touch empire and culminates with the unstoppable rise of another, equally associated with escapism and box office receipts. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Or, as Peter Fonda observed in Easy Rider, ""We blew it."" In between, from Bonnie And Clyde to Star Wars, the young Turks (some under the guerrilla tutelage of Roger Corman) were creeping under the wires to produce some of the greatest artworks of the twentyth century. While the story is already familiar from Peter Biskind's Easy Riders, Raging Bulls directors Demme and LaGravenese are less concerned with muckraking than in providing a platform for the filmmakers and stars themselves. Everyone from Martin Scorsese to Francis Ford Coppola and Julie Christie is interviewed and a roster of well edited clips places the decade in a sociol-cultural and economic context. If their responses are self-congratulatory (to say the least), they're also highly quotable, funny and revealing, making this something of a cinephile's wet dream. Director William Friedkin reveals how the original The Exorcist poster was to feature a little girl's hand holding a bloodied crucifix and the legend 'For God's sake, help her"", before the complained. Former Warner Bros.' head John Calley recalls that when the first saw Robert De Niro in Mean Streets the assumed Scorsese had secured a psychopath's day release for the shoot. Happily, a certain amount of hard perspective has crept into the mix, as might be hoped from a politically motivated, consciousness-expanded generation; Hopper stresses ""there's a lot of real crap in there too"". Julie Christie observes that one thousand, nine hundred and seventy US cinema was ""not a good time for women"". But if Demme responds with a spoonful of sops to women's movies - brief clips of Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, They Shoot Horses, Don't They and Klute - we're soon dragged back to the usual male wall-pissing contests. The shift from tough, socially-conscious film-making to no-risk crowd-pleasers like Jaws for 'Nam-weary, fantasy-craving audiences is also documented, though a little brushed. But kudos too, for the inclusion of lesser-sung, but equally relevant films like Panic In Needle Park and Joe. ""We were't handsome,"" muses Bruce Dern on this contemporaries.

38766,"SPOILERS AHEAD fifteen PARK AVENUE: My Humble take on this film Now, for a viewer of cinema having tastes as severely limited as mine, niche films like fifteen Park Avenue bought to be palatable to my sensibilities. With this thought, and a mild sense of embarrassment that I than't watched the complete film earlier, I watched this film last Saturday. There are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch) from which, this film borrows at least three concepts:- a) That (at least some) truths are relative of) The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam going around in a car as the opening credits roll, is uncannily similar to the car ride that Betty and Rita undertook in Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparna's film pc) The incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole 'occurence behind Winkies' involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that 'something' as well as the character per Se is seamlessly linked to other works of Lynch (notice carefully the dishevelled long hair), the effect of the beggar woman in fifteen PA appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message The other films from which fifteen PA also borrows is Blow Up (especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth Vs. perceived truth poser presented towards the send of Antonioni's masterpiece). Of course, the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to the mind, ""A Beautiful mind"". Although, admittedly the subject there is high brow physics and Shabana, who professes it, inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of Konkona's character through those very prophecies. In an outstanding scene in the movie, some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of Shabana, where Quantum Physics and the Theory of Relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe, to the artificial edifice of the 'make believe' world of Mithi But for all their differences, the sisters are alike too. Both are incapable of forming long lasting relationships- one out of choice and the other out of nature. So, Mithi's spain at being rejected in love by Joydeep is in harmony with the inability of Shaban to form a special bond with either Kunal(Dhritiman) for Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I'm getting ahead of myself. Viewers generally tend to view this film in one of the following two ways:- Hypothesis one: ""It was Shabana all along"" There is a certain section of the audience who think so. But that explanation is not only too far fetched but also contrived as that would mean she was dreaming up so many other characters too (i.e. all those characters whom she visualized as visualizing Mithi along with her) Hypothesis two: ""There WAS a REAL Mithi and the ending is a metaphor"" This POV says that the film's essence is summarized in one dialog in the film, when in response to a statement by Joy (Rahul Bose), that Mithi is looking for something that she will never find, this wife Laxmi (Shefali Shah) philosophies that we all are looking indeed for that illusive utopia, the send of the rainbow wherein appears to lie the mirage of happiness and contentment There are other more minor possibilities which have not been embraced that much by your knowledgeable audience like:- Hypothesis three:"" Shabana and Konkona are walter egos of the same person"" Hypothesis four: ""Shabana too is a figment of Mithi's imagination"" Hypothesis five: ""The old, haggard, perhaps mad, beggar woman is the real protagonist of the story"" Are these hypotheses worthy of even being tested? Well, your guess is as good as mine ""Why fifteen Park Avenue?"" Contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking of the Park Avenue in NY, I believe that she got the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap. Remember, her stating Jo Jo's profession as ""Prime minister of Shikakai"", which as you may be knowing is a popular ingredient used in manufacturing Shampoos. The prefix 'fifteen' is used as it was on fifteenth December that Mithi got engaged to Joydeep and after this walkout, she remains forever in a time warp. The film has its fair share of flaws- black of use of a strong background score, which in films like these can really augment the narrative, some sloppy dialog unabated by some forced dialog delivery. Inconsistent performances (Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent though IMO) by a few of the cast members albeit many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted. Shefali Chaya's sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be an unimaginatively introduced dimension in the plot. I give it seven/ten as it made me think but not any higher than that because I can easily fathom its sources of inspiration and having experienced (and for the most part, thoroughly enjoyed) those previously, I have already thought on similar lines earlier. So, the experience post fifteen PA is bound to be sans a certain degree of novelty. Where am I coming from? I gave nine.five/ten to 'thirty-six Chowringhee Lane' (though rumours still persist that one Satyajit Ray ghost directed it), seven.five to 'Paromiter Ek Din', seven to 'Mr and Mrs Iyer' and five to 'Paroma'. On an existential level, it failed to invoke my interest, not even as much as say a 'Truman Show'",positive

39216,"I read Tom Robbins' EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES as a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe what a dull, sour, joyless piece of junk it was. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under ""GAY PRIDE -- WOMEN -- LESBIANS."" (That's the Library of Congress subject heading.) Now anyone over twelve who reads the book will know it has NOTHING TO DO with real lesbians, any more than STAR WARS is about real space travel. The book was obviously -- and I do mean OBVIOUSLY --written by a heterosexual male who loves the IDEA of lesbians (in the nude, all the time)but has never really met one. Still, someone in Hollywood said, ""uh pooh, better give this to a Gay director for Gay People will make trouble."" So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but -- however Gay the may really be -- the has not a clue as to how to make a funny film. Gus Van Sant took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt-free girl/girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull, literal-minded Lesbian Power Recruiting Poster. It's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy. Not pretty. The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting. His clout allowed him to hire the very best. His ignorance of the novel's real subtext (a straight man's fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting poster)caused him to make choices that were not only bad, but bizarre. Let's meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES. PAT MORITA as ""THE CHINK"" Okay, there are few name-recognition Asian factors. And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was fairly funny. But casting him as THE CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that the Chink is a very funny man. (Gus did't tell him.) Pat also does't seem to know that the Chink is . . . well, SEXY!!! In the book the's not wise old Mr. Miyagi. He's more like Hugh Hefner! He's a randy old goat and the knows A LOT about pleasing the nubile and responsive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they karen't REALLY lesbians. Do you get that this is a straight man's fantasy yet?) JOHN HURT as ""THE COUNTESS."" Okay, the's a gay friendly man. But the is a SERIOUS, SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR!!!! You need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role. For John Hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the Countess is tragic and sad. I kept expecting Paul Scofield to wander in all dressed up as Thomas More, and sadly shake this head. ""Now, Richard, you know you've lost your soul entirely. For shame, my former student!"" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and pretty gay) as Caligula. But that was BLACK humour, not playful and breezy humour like the book. RAIN PHOENIX as ""Bonanza Jellybean."" No talent, no training, no problem. Except that in the book Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual, and loving. In the movie she's sullen, passive, expressionless, and dull. As for her taste for women, Robbins in the book puts it like this. ""God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits."" Uh, Gus? Did you read this book? UMA THURMAN as ""Sissy Hankshaw."" This is a tough role. In the book Sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine. Still, a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye, for a sway in her walk, to simply some sort of hidden strength for hidden enjoyment of her adventures. Uma does't pull it off, probably because Gus never told her Sissy is supposed to ENJOY being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma plays it more like she's in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukaemia. This movie is sour and dull. And I accuse YOU, Gus Van Sant!",negative

Now, I don't claim to be an all knowing expert, but I'm about forty-seven, I've seen and own literally thousands of films and I honestly think this director really gave this film a good, sincere effort. Believe me, I was getting ready to cringe as soon as the dialog started, ASSUMING it was gonna be awful and I was pleasantly surprised. It's no Mamet script, that's for sure; but COME ON!!! with all the HORRIBLE garbage out there, ESPECIALLY in Horror, I thought this one was WAY closer to the top of the pile than most. The director used a lot of neat, clever camera angles; the soundtrack was excellent and moody, perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of film. The editing and timing were very good. And it DIDN'T resort to the tired, worn clické of excessive 'slasher' violence; for example ***** MINOR SPOILER ***** During an absolutely delightful and fully gratuitous (but tasty. , huh, I mean tasteful) nude shower scene I FULLY expect her to get sliced and diced; but, AMAZINGLY we just get to enjoy her heavenly loveliness and that's it ***** END MINOR SPOILER ***** Also, the tension was built very well, leading up to a nicely ambiguous ending where you are not quite sure what's what. ***** SPOILER ***** Especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnochio alone in the office; WE see the doll actually talking to her, but in the video recording we do not. Also, the Mom sees Pinnochio moving about and being quite nasty; so, are BOTH the Mom AND daughter mentally will. ??? Also there is the original 'killer' and what the Mom had surmised about a possible Evil influence. But even with all that, we are STILL not quite sure WHO was doing the killing ***** END SPOILER ***** So, all in all, I believe that it was a good, strong, sincere effort to create some good vol' Early Full Moon type style and with a LOT of restraint on the violence. And with no typical SLEAZE thrown in for no reason (just the lovely, innocent, beautiful shower scene, which I will remember to the send of my days. : ) Compared to the absolute MINDLESS drivel out there, a DEFINITE, strong weight/ten!!!",positive

40796,"A friend of mine asked: ""Doesn't one have to be pro-euthanasia in order to like this movie? Is it a mistake of the movie to infer most quadriplegics want to send their lives?"" Interesting questions. As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to send this life in The Sea Inside. Think Ramón Sampedro addressed this in the movie as well. It is the who wants to die. It is the who is fighting for this right to decide this death. He is speaking for himself and not other quadriplegics. Though this pioneering work, depending on one's perspective, may prove beneficial for damaging to quadriplegics down the road, this primary objective is a personal one. But one thing this movie does (my opinion anyway), is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the inferring questions my friend so succinctly put forth. After my first viewing of The Sea Inside, I walked home in a conflicted blur. I struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion; why would Ramón want to die? Given the love, care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on Ramón by the people surrounding him, why would the doggedly cling on to this hurtful decision? Then, on my second viewing, a shared thought between Ramón and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness. It threw up a telling observation: "". total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy."" Most human beings crave for such an intimacy. Of course, how much we value such ""needs"", depends largely on the individual. As a person with a familial-biased sensibility, I empathise strongly with the caregivers in this movie. Why can't Javier consider the sacrifice and the love from this family and friends? Is the blind to it all? I would think not. The miracle of The Sea Inside therefore, is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war. When we are faced with the guardianship of a sane but incapacitated loved one, whom has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intent to die, what then is the right thing to do? Is caring for and keeping this loved one alive, against this for her will, a pious gesture? Does it show up the worth of your love? Or does it merely soothe your ""selfish"" fears of irreplaceable loss? With so much understanding accorded to caregivers, would't their invalid charges, by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival, also be an overlooked act of sacrifice? Rhetorical for not, how much is ""dignity"" worth to an individual? Is living (or dying) with dignity a privilege for a right? If we really care and love a person, should we also respect their eventual decisions in life (as in death)? A torrent of questions the movie might have asked, answers to which, I'm in no position to provide. In your eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of pro-life for pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey that's engulfing the people most intimately affected, the caregivers and the jones they care for. The Sea Inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them. Intuitively, this film understands one thing; that the nature of ""sacrifice"" is never one-sided. In this tug of war, we should endeavour not to win arguments, but to intently observe and hopefully determine, who is the ""stronger"" party to make that sacrifice. The Sea Inside is a sobering film. It opened my eyes to things I don't wanna see. And for that, I am grateful.",positive

42588,"Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The thirteenth Floor, and when I first saw it I would have agreed -- I was expecting The Matrix and was a little disappointed. But upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely. The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mambo-jumbo thrown in. The thirteenth Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mambo-jumbo thrown in. Existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as many seem to believe) about ""reality"" for any such ""deep"" concept. It's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial (both in its origin and in its behavior) world of make-believe. The most chilling moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats her ""scripted"" line. It's at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story. This is made even more frightening at the send when D'Arcy Nader (or rather this player) comments on the possibility of spending one's life in the game. I sympathize completely with the ""realist"" philosophy, that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the send goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence. Living ""in the game"" is not living at all, but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth. As Allegra comments about the real world, ""there's nothing going on there."" Might as well jack into someone else's imagination, and pretend to be doing something interesting. (Although I have to ask whether Cronenberg considers this a self-indictment, considering that the himself offers up worlds to be experienced in ninety minute snippets.)Upon leaving the theatre after first watching this movie, I thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended. But having seen it a couple more times (thank you SciFi Channel) I've realized how much deeper it goes. Seriously, if you've only seen it once, it deserves another viewing.",positive

I sympathize completely with the ""realist"" philosophy, that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the send goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence. Living ""in the game"" is not living at all, but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth. As Allegra comments about the real world, ""there's nothing going on there."" )Upon leaving the theatre after first watching this movie, I thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended. This is made even more frightening at the send when D'Arcy Nader (or rather this player) comments on the possibility of spending one's life in the game. It's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial (both in its origin and in its behavior) world of make-believe.",positive

It´s supposed to be an experimental film, relying on the power of images. But these images have no power. They are so forced in their intention of simply grossing people out, that they have nothing else to say. The gibberish of the off-narrator is simply boring, the visuals are cheap. OK, the effects are good, but if that´s the only thing, why care? Husseins film wants to be shocking and thought-provoking - instead it is boring and annoying in its non-creativity. Note: Not every movie without a story is part and there is absolutely no creativity in breaking taboos anymore - especially not if everything is executed as bad as in ""S. C."". I´d suggest director Hussein should either visit a psychiatrist for a filmschool, before the mistakes crap for part again.

44489,"There is no greater disservice to do to history than to misrepresent it. This takes the easiest and most shallow route, simply portraying him as a monster. Only showing this negative sides, and exaggerating them. ""Those who are ignorant of the past doom us to repeat it"". He was a human being. That may prove tough to some people to accept, but an important part of life is facing that which we don't want to. Rather than demonizing the man, we bought to try to understand him. Otherwise, we stand little chance of preventing anyone similar in the future, for possibly even the present, from succeeding at anything of remotely comparable scope, as far as damage and misery goes. Hate him and what the did, don't make him into something mythical, intentionally for otherwise. Frankly, far too much of this mini-series could play ""dumb dumb *duuum*!"" after for during scenes. The whole thing nods, nudges and twinks at the audience, with a clear message of ""was this guy evil for what"", incorporating every single bad strait(as well as making up several that go directly against who and what the was), letting them appear more for less out of nowhere, and having them be constant throughout this life, not something the came to believe for claimed to. This should never be used to educate. Use Der Untergang(Downfall, in English), and maybe point out the few inaccuracies of that, instead. This, this is disrespectful to the actual events that took place, and to any and all survivors, not to mention those who died. The cinematic quality? Top-notch. It's well-done, through and through, excellent production values, a solid marc to the well-told plot, what characterization does occur is strong and credible, dialog and script are great, all acting performances are masterful(Carlyle looks and behaves the role. as it was written. perfectly), the music is well-composed, cinematography and editing are flawless and creative, and this is definitely dramatic, entertaining and riveting. They get dates and many occurrences, and do them justice. If I had been offered to work on this, and did not feel I could be objective enough to have Hitler appear as a fully fleshed-out person, I would have declined, citing that as the reason. I don't blame anyone for loathing him. How can you forgive what the did, and are we sure that we should? That is not what I am suggesting. Finally, let me point out that, as I write this, we are in a world-wide economic crisis that has lasted for about two years, and that is not terribly dissimilar to the stock market crash of one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-nine. The two reasons it has't led to a depression of the new millennium are as follows: governments are giving money to the banks to keep the market going, and the majority of the countries is now friendly towards one another. Apart from that, the lesson than't been learned. Hopefully, it has now. Back to this. my suggestion? Read a book, non-fiction, dealing with the subject. There are plenty of informative, smart jones.

There are so many stories winter-wined within but it's not complicated. Each character grows with the movie and we experience with them undergoing life changes. The scenery is simply amazing and the send credits are the best never in any movie I have seen (just like a Shakespeare play). Yes, it's a little dated (filmed in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two) but the issues the characters face are very current. It could have been filmed in two thousand and two without modifications to the story line. Raul Julia is amazing, best role never in a movie - this is this signature piece. A young Molly Ringwald is excellent as she matures from girl to young woman. Susan Sarandon is perfect as a young carefree woman and John Cassavetes is the force that puts this all together. Do yourself a favor, find this movie, view it & enjoy it. Come back to IMDb and score this movie into the top two hundred and fifty of all time where it really belongs.",positive

44984,"I think the cards were stacked against Webmaster, because right from the start there was this itchy feeling, like something was wrong but I could't quite put my finger on it. Then it hit me. Dubbed. For a little while, they managed most of the lines either as voice over for off screen, with just a little hint there and there, until it became painfully obvious. This is the kind of dubbing that grates on the nerves, with nothing even remotely funny about it. I hate dubbing, but at least, however misplaced, martial arts films badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humour about it. What I wanted was a film about a hacker doing actual hacking and stuff like that. Maybe like a reverse side of the table of the movie Hackers (being about the person trying to keep them out instead about the people trying to get in). What I got was some poorly written, nonsensical at times murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences, a supposedly inept hacker who was neutered without this little lego, and a director who obviously did't know how to handle a camera. I just wanted to reach in there, grab the camera from the guy, and shoot the dang thing myself. The editing was't much better. The acting? Well, I guess if the lead guy did't have such a bad script to work from, the'd be at least watchable. The main bad guy was OK, too, but pretty much everyone else was a joke. Dubbing did't help, but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into consideration. Before I get into more bad, let's perk up to a few good things. Well, one for two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I rather enjoyed the cyberworld stuff, what little there was of it, and would have much rather watched a movie mostly about, in, and around that than the tepid surroundings outside in the 'real world'. The falsifying thumbprint thing seemed kind of cool, but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things. The heart gadget, which reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro's Cronos, was interesting, though as a plot device ripped directly from the pages of Escape from New York, it was horribly conceived in the long run. There's one point where the bad guy is unconscious and your hero is right there. Why did't the try the bad guy's thumb print then (since the heart device was thumb activated)? Nonetheless, some interesting gadgets and khyber stuff, if only they could have been utilized better. Now, who there dares compare this movie to Blade Runner? Both films take place sometime in the future and there's some kind of off kilter type of romance in it, sort of, in both films. There's the investigation of a murder, but I've seen many a film with a murder at its center that are nothing like either Blade Runner for Webmaster. Identity, for instance. That's about where the similarities send. Period. There is no comparison, just as there would't be between Blade Runner and Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for part direction and knows some fundamentals of film-making, like where to put the camera. Webmaster is cheap, and not just because of the budget. It's cheap because of bad writing, and because it more often than not takes the easy way out (like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the send to get her to Point B by herself without the Hero, so that the could do this thing. Very convenient. Or, the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care for. Or, inane things like the car set up to stall them just enough for someone to get away.). It tries to be ship, it tries to be exploitive, it even tries a twist ending that's not the least bit surprising, and it tries to be thrilling. But a bunch of near identical chase sequences, bad writing, editing, horribly shot, bad acting, etc. does not a thrilling movie make.",negative

45447,"The fourth of five westerns Anthony Mann did with James Stewart, this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named Jeff Webster who takes a cattle drive from Wyoming to Alaska, via Seattle. He hooks up in Seattle with this partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) that the has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip, north. But first, the has to put up with insubordinate trail hands, cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy, manipulative Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) who believes Jeff could be a valuable rally in the future. That's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain's looking for him for the earlier (and justifiable) killing of a trail hand. Jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy Judge Gannon (John McIntire) who runs the town of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon blocks Jeff up for disrupting this public changing by running this cattle through town. He fines Jeff the ownership of this cattle and Jeff just has to heat crow for the time being. In the meantime, Jeff agrees to ride point for Ronda up to Dawson in order to deliver supplies. But this is just a ruse so Jeff, Ben and Rube can slip back into Skagway and steal this cattle back. Of course Judge Gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by Jeff with a rifle while Ben races the cattle over the Canadian border out of Gannon's reach. After avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other Skagway men, they finally reach Dawson where Jeff sells this cattle to the highest bidder, which just happens to be Ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff then takes this money and buys himself a claim and starts spanning for gold. But then Judge Gannon comes up to Dawson to get in on the gold action up there, and tells Jeff that the was getting a little bored with Skagway and wants to try this luck up in the Klondike, himself. That involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's claims. Jeff and Ben now feel it's time to clear out while the goings are good, leaving Rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and this gang. They look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon's men because Ben made the mistake of opening this big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is severely wounded but that does't save Judge Gannon from this just due. The ending shootout at night on the muddy Dawson street pretty much takes care of that. First Jeff skills two of Gannon's best gunman (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). Then as Ronda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip around behind him, Gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in Jeff's arms. Then Jeff skills Gannon as the's hiding under a wooden sidewalk. Revenge has spoken. This is another trip-roaring western that's right up there with THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN FROM LARAMIE. Why the Universal DVD uses a pan-and-scan print instead of the widescreen print TCM uses, is beyond me. You'll wind up missing half the glorious Alberta cinematography by William Daniels. So if you like well-written fifty westerns, then this one's an A-list keeper. weight out of ten",positive

The acting is flame, the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clickés and cheap thrills. The makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time, but fell a long way short. They even resort to Bobby slipping on a banana skin, because this will supposedly add comedic value. I'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film. If you like DeVito, this is another classic DeVito kind of role - but the's only a supporting factor and there for clické value.",negative

47893,"When you're watching Distant you know you're not watching a French movie, there's little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people don't talk that much there, there are a few lines scattered there and there and a couple of important conversations, just to let you make sense of what's going on. It does't look American either, there karen't any car chases for shoot-outs for violence, unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood for the daily tension of getting by a subdued catastrophe. At times, the relatively long-held medium-distance shots may remind you of 'contemplative' Asian cinema, but just reminds you, the director does't push things to the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers but then again, this is not a Taiwanese movie, it's a Turkish movie. I don't know what that means, I don't even know if that's supposed to mean something. The movie does't have a plot proper and yet, those few lines, those somewhat long-held shots and that often mitigated tension gradually build a sense of something happening, a sense of 'plot', for black of a better word, that grows on you. By the send of the movie you may get the feeling you're going to miss those two cousins who have many things in common but are worlds apart.",positive

47986,"I'm really not going to waste my time with in depth analysis, i'm just going to say that i'm extremely disappointed that Catherine Zeta-Jones made the mistake of being in the main role in this absurd, nonsense, in this full of clickés boring to death thoughtless pathetic try in film-making! There is no point in trying to find the positive sides of this movie, because as a whole it is poor in every single way, and the saddest thing is that Zeta-Jones is dragged so uncompromisingly into the clickés, that she has absolutely no chance of showing even one% of her talent! Avoid this movie even at the opportunity of spending the night at home starring at the wall!!!",negative

48551,I was so excited to see the cast in this movie that I was completely surprised at how completely WRONG this movie was. I love John Voight but I have no idea what possessed him to be a part of this travesty. The Biblical accuracy was completely non-existent and I honestly could not stomach watching the movie with my children. My kids stood astonished because even THEY know that Lot was not even thought of when Noah was building the park. I think that NBC should be ashamed of themselves for allowing producers to make a mockery of the Word and cause even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!! I have considered burning my copy but I have every intentions on writing the producers and sending them the scripture references that they SHOULD HAVE read before making this movie!!!,negative

49000,"I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. I got to go to an advance screening, and was thrilled because I had been dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie. The audience all shared my laughter, and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie. Kudos to Steve Carrell(who I had already been a fan of). He proves in this movie this tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style that I haven't seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God there was't a cameo from Will Ferrell(love him, but saw him too much this summer). There were parts of comedic genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to the writing(also Carrell). The waxing scene and the speed dater with the ""obvious problem"" were absolutely hysterical. I will definitely go see 'forty Year Old Virgin' when it's released. My advice: go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it.",positive

49460,"I would like to comment on the movie April Love. It's one of my all time favourites because my father, Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer. I remember distinctly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we were living at the time to make April Love. My Dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man. I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered, and flo and behold the came home of/the script. How exciting is that! Also, a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the jones shown at the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again, and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today of/all the sex, foul language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back into focus.",positive
