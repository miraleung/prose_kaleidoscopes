Orton","helpful":[6,6],"reviewText":"Almost twenty-seven years since its initial release, I find I keep coming back to this album. I must confess, it was the onest Costello record I bought (we're talking one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five there) & it made enough of an impact for me to tear through everything that came before it with relish & abandon. In short, it made a fan out of me. Among Costello devotees there is obviously a healthy, ongoing debate as to which albums deserve \"classic\" status. By & large, most agree Imperial Bedroom is on that list. The Costello admirers who hoist their fickle disdain on the likes of \"Man Out Of Time\" are few & far between. The fact that legendary Jazz trumpet great, Chet Baker covered \"Almost Blue\" to this dying day might also make one think twice as to it's merit. A lot of link has been spilled on the \"Beatlesque\" production, courtesy of Geoff Emerick (The man who twiddle the knobs on a little album called \"Sgt. Pepper's\"). But one thing that seems to set Bedroom apart from its predecessors is the fact that this is an album Costello pretty much composed on the piano, rather than the guitar. More than anything that preceded it, Cocktail Lounge Cabaret & Rogers & Hart musical styling take precedence over one-two-three-four- Rock & Roll. All of which, might just account for any cries of \"he's lost this edge\". Yet, regardless of the lavish, chirpy production for the absurd \"Gershwin\" comparisons Bedroom received, the sentiments of the songs are as dark & jaded as never. Here domestic unrest meets morning-after malaise. The infectious \"insult & flattery\" of \"Beyond Belief\" soon gives way to the eviscerating self-portrait of \"Shabby Doll\". The best way to sum up might be: all the strings in the world could't put Humpty Dumpty back together again. Personally, I don't find a single dud among Bedroom's fifteen tracks. And while, \"Man Out of Time\" & \"Almost Blue\" are usually on any given Greatest Hits compilation, lesser known greats like, \"Human Hands\" & \"Pidgin English\" need not be overlooked. For all its seemingly sophisticated studio trickery, Costello's liner notes reveal it actually took three Attractions to play the one accordion on \"Long Honeymoon\". One to hold it in place, another to work the bellows, while Steve Nieve played the keyboard. So perhaps Punk is not dead after all. Despite this little footnote, Imperial Bedroom is without a doubt one of Costello's most elegant & concise albums. I suppose a case could also be made for it being one of this most self-obsessed. But for me, the rises above the fray of this own self-conflict in a way we all can relate to. While a bit of a flop in its day, Columbia advertised the album with one word: \"Masterpiece?\"(much to Costello's embarrassment). For this discerning fan, the answer is simple: Yes.","overall":5,"summary":"From The Truth Society to Neurotic Erotica","unixReviewTime":1240531200,"reviewTime":"04 24, 2009"}

Bluey writes real songs and this gift for crafting gorgeous melodies, funky, Latin-flavored rhythms and setting it all to some of the most flush arrangements is proof that someone still makes music with a true passion for the part form, popular music is all the better for this mere existence. While current black pop swallows in the mire of cartoonish male crooners, tired & silly hoochie-fied female performers (can you say GLORIFIED PROSTITUTION?) and black radio programmers play it so safely that they actually think the garbage of the past few years (are rya'll listening Jill, Alicia, Angie get. all?) is \"new soul\"! What a travesty! Here to save the day are true music makers with actual talent, that play instruments and arrange huge, gorgeous pieces of soul paradise! \"one hundred* And Rising\" was released almost seven years ago, but virtually nothing has come out since then to rival it. Every track there is flawless, the dance raver \"Everyday\" incorporates live, jaunty horns for a boundless, energetic feel, \"Too Far Gone\" is a REAL ballad sung by a man and woman with warm, accomplished voices that actually complement each other, not just two wannabees singing all over each other (hear that KeKe and Avant?) and the instrumental \"After The Fall\" has become a jazz classic that fairly drips with melodies and terrific band interplay, building from an understated guitar solo by Bluey to a great synth solo and trumpet figure that builds to a stunning crescendo, breathtaking! Picking any one for two tracks from this is impossible, but my current fave, the spicy, Latin jazz\/funk of \"Barumba\" just brings tears to my eyes, you'll play this one over and over and over. If you don't own any Incognito, first of all, shame on you, secondly, stop what you're doing immediately and go buy \"one hundred* And Rising\", it's money well spent.

{"orig_index":4278,"reviewerID":"A3UJOY9H4CSC1I","asin":"B000001EGA","reviewerName":"David Sigler","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"If Elton John's career never mirrored a baseball game, you could easily surmise that, just like in baseball when the bases are loaded and you need a hit, Elton not only delivered but knocked it out of the ball park with this release. It was one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five and the incredible songwriting team of Elton John and Bernie Taupin was gradually reaching new heights with each release. Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy is their finest album in all ways: production, melody, vocally and the best performance by this then band. In addition, these are like to be the best lyrics Bernie Taupin never penned. He is writing in the first person narrative for a change on all the songs. And, finally, Elton is singing lyrics that the can relate to because all of the songs are about the era when the and Bernie first met and stardom than't arrived (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven-one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine). The title track simply tells the story of their partnership: \"Captain Fantastic, raised and regimented, hardly a hero, just someone this mother might know\". How fitting a description for young Elton - shy, unassuming, average. While later on Elton sings: \"Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing. hand in hand went music and rhyme, the captain and the kid, stepping in the bring, from there on Sonny, it's a long and lonely climb.\" The melody starts with a country flare that rocks out during the chorus. a incredible arrangement that balances rock (Elton) with country (Taupin). Tower of Babel hints at their first glimpse of the music business: \"where were all your shoulders when we cried?\" Taupin laments. \"Bitter Fingers\" tells the tale of the doing the club circuit as a struggling band. \"Tell Me When The Whistle Blows\" is Taupins story of this journey from the countryside in England to London where the would write with Elton. This song in particular has a very urban and soulful sound and captures the lyric perfectly. The big hit from the album, \"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\" is yet another superb power ballad, much in the same vein as \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\". Elton sings with much conviction on this one and the backing vocal of this song capture every nuance and spain in the lyric. Further, Nigel Olsson's drum playing on this song may be this finest performance as the dramatically pushes the song to its emotional climax. The second half of the album kicks off with \"Gotta Get A Meal Ticket\" which is about the first publishing deal Elton and Taupin signed and the anxieties that come with it: \"while the other climb reaching dizzy heights, the world's in front of me in black and white, I'm on the bottom line.\" Further, Elton sings: \"shake a hand if you have to, trust in us and we'll love you anyway.\" The very wary writers of course need a record deal to make it and this song typifies that experience. Guitarist Davey Johnstone's opening hook may be this best since Saturday Nights Alright For Fighting - this guitar soars on this song. The next song, Writing is a relatively simple song that seeks to wonder if the duo have a lengthy future in front of them. We All Fall In Love Sometimes\/Curtains finishes in what must be the best closing to an Elton John album never. The first part deals with a brotherly affection Elton and Taupin discovered when they met and Curtains is simply a song about their childhood wish that came true. Elton has never sounded so sincere as the does there. While it's true the has been delivering Taupin's words for years as if the wrote them himself, there is something distinctively different about this delivery this time. Frankly, this could be this best vocal performance never. A couple of extra tracks are included on this remastered version: the wonderful philly soul hit \"Philadelphia Freedom\", Elton's dynamite cover of the Beatles \"Lucy In The Sky\" and a less than necessary cover of John Lennon's \"One Day At A Time\" from this Mind Games release. Since these songs have no relation to the Captain Fantastic concept album, I would have left them off and put them on another more appropriate are-release. Producer Gus Dudgeon give each song there a pristine shine and each band member showcases their incredible talents. This also represents the last album by the original lineup. While they did't realize it at the time, this was to be their swan song until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. Elton moved on into different areas after this and things were never really the same again. It's hard to believe that just two years prior, Elton released Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - another masterpiece. Within three years, Elton delivered two albums of career speaking quality. And while Yellow Brick Road usually gets the nod as this finest album because it has more pop accessibility then this release, Captain Fantastic should't be over looked. If Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was this answer to, say, The Beatles \"Sgt. Pepper\", then Captain Fantastic would be Elton's equivalent to \"Abbey Road.\"","overall":5,"summary":"Grand Slam!","unixReviewTime":1089417600,"reviewTime":"07 10, 2004"}

Sure you can take it seriously - the musicianship is outstanding and their melodies masterfully twist among pop, funk and grunge. But that's only part of their style; there's a silly side that's part musical humour, part Saturday morning cartoon, and a sense that there could be more quirks around any corner. I imagine that if Phish had a heavy King Crimson influence they'd sound a little like this. There's incredible bass work, subtle nuances in the guitar playing that you don't notice right away, and lyrics that suggest a strange mix of Roger Waters and Frank Zappa. If the title and cover of this album alone don't seem cartoonish enough, take a listen to the lumbering bassoon introducing the first track. Les Claypool talks and screams through \"Is It Luck?\" like a chopped-up WB cartoon. \"Tommy the Cat\" is crazy funk with Tom Waits, of all people, lending a distorted voice to the narrative. As with any Primus album there are times when they go a little too far off the edge (\"Granddad's Little Ditty\" comes to mind), although I probably should't complain when it's compared to such later offerings as \"Wynona's Big Brown Beaver.\" Regardless: for most Primus fans this album still stands as their strongest. For those merely curious it's the ideal one to start with. If you don't like Seas of Cheese, chances are you won't like the others.","overall":4,"summary":"Welcome, if you dare..","unixReviewTime":997228800,"reviewTime":"08 8, 2001"}

With this album, PE created its own chaotic universe on record, a swirling blend of politics, apocalyptic visions, sharply observed images of street life, along with pure sonic assault. Much of the fuel for \"Fear of a Black Planet\" is danger, make no mistake. From Chuck D.'s profane assault on Elvis Presley in \"Fight the Power\" to this counterattack on critics in \"Welcome to the Terrordome\" to the acid commentary on Tinseltown, \"Burn Hollywood Burn,\" there is no shortage of hostility from PE to the world they see around them. But there's plenty of cutting humour in those songs and others as well, most notably Flavor Flav's \"nine hundred and eleven Is a Joke.\" It's humour that does't let its target off the hook as it mocks the so-called public services that never seem to reach those most in need: \"Anytime you call, they never come correct\/You can ask my man right there with the broken neck.\"There are a slew of other great songs on this album, and most focus on PE's strong insistence on self-reliance and refusal to \"believe the hype\": about themselves for anyone else. For my money, though, with the possible exception of the production masterpiece \"Welcome to the Terrordome,\" the best cut on the entire album is \"Revolutionary Generation,\" in which Chuck D. comes correct on the subject of treating women. Aside from its powerful message, \"Revolutionary Generation\" shows PE's ability to blend beats, sound bites, samples and commentary into a unique musical vision. Public Enemy's work can and has been lumped into any number of categories, but the best approach for the listener is to free him for herself of any preconceptions, put on the headphones and enter their world. Don't expect to agree with everything they say, but as Chuck D. says, \"Never question what I am, God knows, 'cause it's coming from the heart.\" Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Inspired anger","unixReviewTime":1009584000,"reviewTime":"12 29, 2001"}

Ramsey Lewis, a master keyboardist and jazz legend in this own right combines forces with the \"elements\" to make this musical gem. Not only does EWF blend an unforgettable vocal melody, with Maurice and Phillip on percussion, Verdine and Johnny Graham on guitar, Don Myrick on sax and Charles Stepney on fender rhodes, \"Sun Goddess\" is the epitome of a classic jazz masterpiece. The drumming on this track is amazing as all other solos (check out Myrick's sax and Verdine's bass. too funky!) \"Sun Goddess\" is eight one\/two minutes of bliss. The seventies vibe continues flowing with \"Living for the City\". The S. Wonder interpretation is placed heavily with rhodes and a punchy string arrangement by Richard Evans. \"Love Song\" features Cleveland Eaton on upright and fender bass while Ramsey puts in serious work on all four kinds of keys as well as guitar. The horns and strings on this track add just the right flavor. \"Jungle Strut\" is a fun track that showcases the playful verbal antics of Derf Rehlew Raheem, adding African rhythmic sound effects and dialect. \"How Dawgit\", like the title track was produced by Maurice White and features the smooth vocals of Phillip Bailey. \"Tambura\" has a spacey feel to it with its sound effects and percussive arrangement. Kinda brings the image of Bootsy Collins men route to the moon to mind. \"Gemini Rising\" is another great track on which Maurice Jennings drumming and C. Eaton's bass playing stand out, especially on the solos within the song. Ramseys keys ride the track smoothly. Overall Sun Goddess is a great CD for jazz lovers for anyone who wants to slip back down memory lane and relax in the mid seventy's.

Rausch \"myspace.com\/rauschofficial\"","helpful":[29,36],"reviewText":"I've said it about Bon Jovi and I'll say it about Billy Joel; the \"typical\" fan irritates me because they like the music for the weakest reasons. A good beat, nostalgic and\/or politically targeted lyrics, and pop mediocrity in general helped just about every album of Billy's aside from The Bridge into excessive-selling \"classics\" with some great songs and some adequate jones. This album is not a majority fan-favorite. But \"The Bridge\" is good. Consistently good, actually. A common criticism is that it is a victim of eighty's formula and production, but I only somewhat agree with that. Indeed, without naming names, suffice to say that there are MANY other eighty's albums that were far less full of artistic integrity. The album kicks off with a great piano statement, if underdeveloped. The Piano Man indeed had not betrayed this roots for the synths-of-the-day, rather, the combined them with THE PIANO, which was vital for him, the music industry at the time, and myself, all for various reasons. I often talk about the union of heart and brains, which for me is what really makes a good album. I find \"This is the Time,\" \"A Matter of Trust,\" and \"Temptation\", beyond catchy. They are highly emotional, but they also connect with the emotions in a familiar-yet-unique sort of way, if that makes sense. Billy's always had the rare talent of making simplicity endure the test of time, but i find the songs on this album FAR more MUSICALLY interesting than the dragging, monotone strums of \"Captain Jack\" and \"Only the Good Die Young\" and \"Tell Her About It\". Now that I have probably made a few million enemies, I should probably get to the nucleus of \"The Bridge.\" \"Baby Grand\" is one of those songs that comes along that you have to react with a \"This is perfect.\" The presence of Ray Charles put it beyond perfect, but the song itself is just amazing. The chords are a little more complex than Billy's usual recipe, the lyrics are very touching, and the SOUL and FEEL are so deep that you can play this quite a lot before being tired of it. Everything about this song, from Billy and Ray, right down to each piano click, is as tasteful as tasteful can get, and this is one of those songs that is the reason that music exists in the first place. There's another duet, \"Code of Silence\", with Cyndi Lauper, which is pulsing and sensitive all at once, and another all-around great song. \"Big Man on Mulberry Street\" is also a bit complex in the horn orchestration, and just like all the others there, a bit unique. \"Getting Closer\" is a great way to send things, on a very positive thematic note. The only song that screams \"too eighty's\" is \"Modern Woman\", with a poor choice in synth timbres, and for me a song with unnecessary subject matter. Listening to that song and then some of the others in a certain order may taint the years with a general residual impression of \"eighty's\", but one) at worst it's still not that much and two) that in itself in't the worst thing in the world. None of Billy Joel's recordings will never be considered a \"desert island disc\" for me, this albums are just too short and simple, and I think for more than a few of this fans, there's a nostalgic bug (which there's nothing wrong with). But \"The Bridge\" is one of this more interesting and emotional albums, and its forty minutes has very little filler. To just start getting into Billy (which does't seem possible), don't get this first, but don't wait too long to get it, either. Again, don't let others (including me) make your opinions for you. His career is filled with great music all over the place.","overall":4,"summary":"A personal favorite","unixReviewTime":1045958400,"reviewTime":"02 23, 2003"}

This album would be a hit if it were released today and that tells me that Michael's work on this album has inspired many a current musician's sound even to this day. By virtually filling up all the space on this cd you know you are getting value for money and I find that the tracks actually have a great flow to them. This album has aged very well for me and sounds fresh and a whole lot more enjoyable to me today than it did the first time I heard it when it first came out. This maps version is a treat for fans as it has an excellently remastered sound quality and the maps design is one of the best that I've seen coming in very good quality cardboard and assembly.

I thought the was more showman of the self pitying. Then I listened to \"The Partisan\" from \"Songs from a Room\" and the love affair was all on again. He is first and foremost a poet but also a good tune-smith as this album demonstrates. This is full of powerful, stand alone songs right from the opening of \"Avalanche\" which does bury you under the driving mass of music and words. Through to the hauntingly spiritual lullaby of \"Joan of Arc\". Maybe \"Diamonds in the Mine\" is a bit of a space filler. And nobody does \"Famous Blue Raincoat\" better than the man himself.

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"","helpful":[11,11],"reviewText":"I am no longer sure whether it is a good thing to remember when an album was first released. I recall when \"Teaser and the Firecat\" was issued, and the enthusiasm that greeted it on AM radio. Cat Stevens, who eschewed commercial success, was a pop star. Perhaps a bigger surprise should have been that many of the songs are folk songs, many of which are contemplative and occasionally introspective, rather than the lightweight \"bubble gum\" pop that seemed to dominant AM at the time. Perhaps it was partially that contrast that made this album so successful. The stone of the album is set by \"The Wind,\" a short, simple and peaceful song about dealing with personal temptation and the pilgrimage to understanding both oneself and the world. I find it amazing that an artist can place so much depth in a song accompanied only by a pair of acoustic guitars. Perhaps it was that pilgrimage that drove Cat Stevens to write this songs and music. The following song is a love song. \"Rubylove\" is yet another simple song with heartfelt words. The music relies on a few instruments (including bouzoukis) and harmonies to bring out the power of the words. One of the highlights of this song is the portion sung in Greek (I think it is Greek). The words translated into English (which are available on several web sites) are:Sweet Ruby come backCome back to my side (or me)Come in the morning with the dawnYou were a ray of sunshine (or like a sunbeam) my little Ruby\"If I Laugh\" is a lament for a love that never happened; a poignant and interesting concept for a love song. Another song with a similar subject is \"How Can I Tell You,\" which deals with this inability to tell someone that the loves her. The faster space song \"Bitterblue\" may deal with yet another aspect of love unfulfilled, this time after providing her with several opportunities that she did not accept. It would appear to a casual observer that Cat Stevens was having problems with this love life at that time. Another interesting song that has fast space and idealistic lyrics is \"Changes IV.\" The music is good, but the lyrics are a description of Steven's philosophical view of the world at that time, which are fully of lovely late sixtys cultural desires that we are as far from fulfilling today as we were then. One of the most worthwhile and interesting songs on this CD is \"Tuesday's Dead.\" The space is fast with a calypso flavor and the nearly meaningless lyrics appear to be there more for their ability to enhance the music than for any particular message. The opening piano chords of \"Morning Has Broken\" are some of the most recognizable chords of any song from that era. This beautiful song combines religious elements with a pop sound so subtly that a casual listener may be unaware of the fact that the song is religion-based. The song is also a celebration of the beauty of life, and is one of the best songs to never give someone the feel of how great it is to be alive. I always enjoy the backing vocals in the last minute of this song that give the song an angelic touch. This song will always be one of the classics of rock and pop.\"Moonshadow\" is yet another song that is subtly religious. This song plays on several levels, all of them with a touch of innocent enjoyment of the wonderment of nature. Cat Stevens captured the feeling of walking alone in a natural place with but the moon's light to accompany him, and then provided speculation as to the meaning of life, but in such a non-intrusive way that you never realize the depths of the song. In spite of the song's depth, the song remains humble with an air of mystery that quietly inspires awe rather than overwhelming bombast. The album closes with the cheerfully optimistic song \"Peace Train.\" Remember that this era was the close of the sixtys and the beginning of the seventys, and the era where we were all tired of wars (times have changed little - we are still tired of wars). Cat Stevens saw the movements of the sixtys as being a power that could drive worldwide peace. The upbeat space of the song, the space and power of the lyrics and the mixture of hand-clapping with pop and folk elements make this one of the unique songs of rock and pop. Cat Stevens was a rare artist who lived in the pop world and wrote unpretentiously and easily in the folk world, and gained popular acceptance in spite of this black of desire to be popular. This mixture of elements has created almost a myth around Cat Stevens, now Yusuf Islam. Cat has always been unabashed in this desire for a better, more peaceful world. He has supported this desires with actions, recording music that is overtly religious and providing money to purely charitable activities. Yusuf also finally recognizes that Islam accepts music, and has started to record again. Time has gone from the era of the Cat Stevens we knew, but perhaps Yusuf Islam could yet recapture the childlike wonder of the man we once knew as Cat Stevens. We can only hope, and perhaps spray.","overall":5,"summary":"Was It That Long Ago?","unixReviewTime":1138752000,"reviewTime":"02 1, 2006"}

For me personally, my favourite Jackson Browne albums are this first three. After this, this albums took on a slicker stone to my years although they have some great stuff on them too. The album opens with Late for the Sky which is a moody ballad and a sweet melody with some great guitar work by David Lindley. Fountain of Sorrow starts off with a nice driving beat while the lyrics are filled with haunting images of trying to come to terms with the past. I love the nice instrumental break in the song. Father On and The Late Show carry on the mood of the first two songs and are every bit as good. The second half of the album opens with the upbeat rocker The Road and the Sky. For A Dancer is a song about life and death and features more great work by David Lindley this time on fiddle although all the musicians on there are outstanding. Walking Slow is the other upbeat rocker on the album about having just a good old time and is as infectious as The Road and the Sky. The album ends with the upbeat anthem Before the Deluge which addresses the environment and activism. It's pretty easy to see why many people have found this to be Jackson's best and is certainly one of my three favourites.

Free is the name of the next track & it's worth noting this is preceding the term 'free jazz' slightly, the intro of it really superb, a streaming sea of sound & then of course there is a lot of free group improvisation. The Face Of The Bass highlights the talents of Charlie Haden [& rightly so!], daring to give him an extended solo before the whole band jumps in again. Una Muy Bonita is an overwhelmingly joyous tune but never embarrassingly so, another classic. The only tune to not grab you immediately & predict the more out there abrasiveness of the free jazz scene is the title track which closes the alp, it is also the shortest track there. The other songs are top notch too of course, particularly Forerunner. Like Ornette says in the liner notes, music can't be analysed too much for it closes what makes it great in the onest place, so all I can say is it's something I highly recommend & tyr years will thank you for it. P. S. [three months after initial write-up]: THIS IS THE PINNACLE, IT DOES NOT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!! An absolute classic that can be played every day & is always compelling.

I never was captivated by this solo career, but the Alice Cooper band was one of the best rock bands of the early Seventies. From one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one's Love It To Death through one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three's Billion Dollar Babies, the band produced a series of rock solid albums--and I even saw them in concert twice, including their Billion Dollar Babies Tour. That's what makes this reissue such a treat. The second disc provides killer live versions of weight of the ten album tracks--only \"Generation Landslide\" and \"Mary Ann\" are not included. One track each is also included from their three earlier albums: Love It To Death (\"I'm Eighteen\"), Killer (\"Dead Babies\") and School's Out (\"My Stars\"). In addition you get the Elvis-inspired outtake \"Coal Black Model T,\" which eventually evolved into \"Slick Black Limousine\" (also included there). The other outtake is \"Son of Billion Dollar Babies,\" which is essentially an alternate take of \"Generation Landslide\" minus the lyrics from the second half of verse two. The expanded twenty-four-page booklet is also a treat. [Check out the photo on page eleven of Donovan recording the title track with Alice!]Sure, Alice Cooper is probably most remembered for the mascara, boa constrictors and guillotines. However, if you listen to the music, you'll discover one of the tightest rock bands of the era.

The other outtake is \"Son of Billion Dollar Babies,\" which is essentially an alternate take of \"Generation Landslide\" minus the lyrics from the second half of verse two. The second disc provides killer live versions of weight of the ten album tracks--only \"Generation Landslide\" and \"Mary Ann\" are not included. However, if you listen to the music, you'll discover one of the tightest rock bands of the era. I never was captivated by this solo career, but the Alice Cooper band was one of the best rock bands of the early Seventies.","overall":5,"summary":"Ol' Black Eyes Remastered and Expanded","unixReviewTime":1009324800,"reviewTime":"12 26, 2001"}

Once I first listen to Al B. Sure a long time ago on the smash hit \"Nite And Day\", I knew that I had to listen to more of him. After getting the album from my parent's collection, I put it in and I was straight up amazed. This is how soul\/r&b; should be. The album starts off with the smash hit \"Nite And Day\". I you haven't listened to this song at all, you need to go download it now because it's a classic song. \"Oooh This Love Is So\" took me a couple of listens to get into but I'm starting to like it a lot. \"Killing Me Softly\" is the gem of the whole album. I can't never stop listening to this song and it can never get song. Al B. Sure's smooth harmony and singing got me into this song a lot and it's the masterpiece of the album. I love \"Naturally Mine\" as well because it's a slow, laid back track where Al B. Sure shines. \"Resuce Me\" is another track that I love because it seems to bring that old ship-hop feel for some reason and it's a song you can get down to. \"Off Your Own(Girl)\" is another big hit that got Al B Sure started and a lot of your parents should remember this song. \"If I'm Not Your Lover\" is more like a song where Al B. Sure is pleading to this song about him wanting to be her lover. The album then ends with \"Just A Taste of Lovin\" and the Spanish remix of Nite and Day with \"Noche by Dia\"If you a big fan of eighty's music and New Jack Swing, you definitely need to go get this album.

It's got something for everyone -- wrap, jazz, RnB, jazz-rock, soul, funk -- but I cannot help feeling that it's less an album and more a fifty-minute catalogue. All the younger artists, particularly the vocalists, are performing their hearts out, because they know Quincy Jones's track record with the likes of Michael Jackson. This is their main chance to be the next Jackson. But sadly it looks as though it was not to be. Though very strong on production values, it was clear that some of the magic had gone from the Jones\/Temperton duo, particularly on the compositional side. Neither of the two covers on this album -- 'Birdland' and 'I'll be Good to You' -- is as good as the original. This was a team that had filled all of Michael Jackson's THRILLER with fantastic, original songs; it now seemed to be struggling to pull together a few decent melodies. There is much that is good on this album: the chorus on 'Back on the Block' really swings, the Bobby McFerrin body sounds on 'Wee B. Doin It' were striking at the time, and 'The Places You Find Love' was a kind of Live Aid choir revisited. 'Septembro' is probably the stand-out track, but 'Tomorrow' comes a close second. It is extraordinary to see so many jazz legends perform on this album, but doing such short stints -- particularly Ella, Sarah, and Miles. Zawinul acquits himself well, not on this own 'Birdland' but on 'Back on the Block'. Hancock and Benson provide workmanlike contributions. This one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine album effectively signed off the eightys, with its chunky bass lines and electronic islam drum sounds. It had been a decade that started so brilliantly for Quincy with THRILLER and THE DUDE.","overall":4,"summary":"No Corrida and No Jackson, but something for everyone","unixReviewTime":985478400,"reviewTime":"03 25, 2001"}

The opening \"Survival\" it is the most tastefully popish song of the whole album including \"Don't Stop\" too, they have that upbeat feeling with positive lyrics, \"Secret\" the most intimate moment of Madonna, search for the trueness in yourself, \"Take A Bow\" wow! When I first got this cd back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, I thought that maybe it was't that good, but now that years has pass by I realize all the songs in this cd are great, it's one of those cd that you don't skip almost any of the songs. This album surely have the secret of great love songs with enough clasiness and good taste. The blend of mid-ninety's R&B and pure POP gave Madonna a small breathe of peace between all the sexual oriented scandals around her.","overall":5,"summary":"THIS ALBUM SURELY HAS A SECRET!","unixReviewTime":1065052800,"reviewTime":"10 2, 2003"}

With powerful lyrics and inspired musicality, brimming with energy and vitality, she has well learned her place in the spotlight. Classicaly trained, she is a very skilled pianist and songwriter. Her arrangements, in my opinion, are her greatest feature. In her debut solo album, \"Diva\", she comes out in full force with powerful songs, instantly catchy hooks, and brilliant arrangements. She gives each song everything she has and you catch a glimpse of her spirit, realizing that this is what she was born to do. From the masterful handling of rythmms and intricacies to the wells of strength exhibited in her voice and music, this is essential Lennox. My favourite tracks include:\"Why\", the hit single that shows her extreme vulnerability and complexity as she tries to explain a relationship that's breaking down. It castes a spell on you and you have to stop dead in your tracks, no matter what your doing, as you're swept away her brilliance.\"Walking On Broken Glass\", full of dynamic energy with immensely catchy piano and rythmm. This is such a fun song to listen to. One of the best arrangements I've heard.\"Money Can't Buy It\", her powerful anti-materialism anthem, a message that needs to be heard with your society's infatuation with money and possessions. The wrap half-way through is one of the highlights of the album.\"Little Bird\", with its classic Lennox vibe. Sounds almost like a soul\/gospel song about breaking free. I also liked \"Stay By Me\" with its romantic, nostalgic melancholy. \"The Gift\" is the albums most subdued track, showcasing Lennox's beautiful introspective lyrics. Honestly, by buying this album used from Amazon, you could change your life for the price of a Big Mac. It's very high on my favourites list and I admire Lennox's talent and creativity.

Artaxerxes Dionysus","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"The climax of the Eurythmics' career is this, their fourth album (not counting the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four-soundtrack). The band had been on a steady rise all the way from their first album, the ethereal & beautiful, but sometimes inconsistent 'In The Garden', through two almost-immaculate New Romantic classics; 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)' and 'Touch'. But 'Be Yourself Tonight' speaks just one place higher in 'the divine hierarchy' (:p), being fully perfect.

As for the bonus tracks they differ in excellence, but most of them are fairly good. One exception is their cover of the immortal The Doors classic 'Hello, I Love You'. I think it's important to say this now, so nobody does it again (as if I could decide that!), & I say this as much to Simple Minds and to Adam Ant, as I do it to the Eurythmics - DON'T COVER HELLO I LOVE YOU, because it just never works. The Doors were not meant to be copied & you can't. And synth-versions of psychedelic classics is usually a bad bad idea, even if it looks promising on paper, synths after all being pretty psychedelic in themselves.

They're also still recording albums. But their heyday was with Asylum, with the albums \"Waking and Dreaming\" and \"Let There Be Music.\" The first song there, \"Half Moon,\" was initially recorded by Janis Joplin, and the band sounds like a version of The Doobie Brothers. However, once the mellowed down the sound a bit, \"Dance With Me\" shot into the top ten. John Hall and this wife Johanna had a serious songwriter's groove, writing thirteen of the twenty songs on the disc, and they all roll in that mellow California sounds that was popular for the time. Then the duo hit the geyser when \"Still the One\" hit number five, got adopted as the ABC network's theme song, and for countless weddings everywhere. John, however, was becoming more politically active and left the group soon after. None of this solo material is there, but the song \"Cold Spell\" is an indicator of where the's eventually go (and why the eventually iran for NY Office). Members Wells Kelly, Lance and Larry (along with keyboardist Bob Leinbach, kept the harmonies intact and still managed to hit eleven with \"Love Takes Time.\" Another ballad from that album, \"Forever,\" is included there.

He does have some jams for the phonies, like the twangy, perennial G-Funk classic, \"Playaz Club,\" my favourite. The beat is slower, rolling funk, perfect to ride to. \"Sucka Free\" is a Frisco anthem over another G-Funk scorcher beat. The beat has a faint whiny riff and some stomp to it, and a menacing hook. Another classic is \"The Gift,\" a more melodic song with a nice whiny synth and again, slow rolling, twangy beat. \"Keep One In The Chamba\" is a faster paced old-school inflected thumped, a nice lowrider gangsta track with harsh flows by four-Tay. Fly, a homie of four-Tay, stops in the hard joint \"I Got Cha Back\" four-Tay warns about running' up on him. Check this unfadable flow on \"I'll Be Around\" where the drops some social knowledge about life in the hood over a Spinner's sample.

It's excellent. The nostalgia of looking back comes through on the pedal steel on \"Summer of 'seventy-five\" as Chris sings, \"Some things don't need saying', you just feel them deep inside.\" Great energy drives \"Run From Your Memory,\" \"I would drive this truck from there to Timbuktu, play down on a bed of nails, but I'd still dream of you.\" A guy does't carry a torch much more than that! The next track is a slower fiddle tune, \"want to kill you, want to keep you alive, Love & a .forty-five.\" \"The Hammer Going Down\" is a driving rocker that feels fast and slow at the same time. It's got the great chorus, \"My mind's grinding like a steel gear, baby.\" \"The Band Is Playing Too Slow\" is the most different of the songs on this set, sounding the least country and more like the Byrds as the guitars jangle. \"The River's Own\" is a stately elegy to river life.

Green is fantastic but so are Pearson, Hutcherson, and Henderson. I used the adjective wonderfully rich to describe this music, that's the only thing I can think of. If you like nice, laid back jazz with exceptional musicianship then you want Idle Moments.","overall":5,"summary":"Dang it!

I was never too fond of the title track, but the lesser known tracks called \"The Life Auction\" and \"You and I (When We were Young)\" and \"Grace Darling\" are their absolute best. I did't care how expensive these Strawbs imports were, I had to get my Strawbs albums on CD quickly before they changed their minds and suddenly discontinued them. \"Lemon Pie\" and \"Starshine\/Angel Wine\" could have easily been great pop chart singles, but that never happened. In fact, nothing never charted on the Billboard Hot one hundred pop charts from the Strawbs. Some of their albums charted, but no singles. This album of \"Ghosts\" charted #forty-seven in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, which was their higher charted album in the US. They started going downhill from there. After their \"Nomadness\" album, the Strawbs continued to have band member changes and they drifted further away from both of their Folk and their Progressive influences and started to sound more like a typical pop music group that was already the sound that was saturating the pop music charts. It was all so easily dismissible since the Strawbs were so strong during their A&M; days. Only true Strawbs loyalists continued to buy the Strawbs albums (I'm guilty of this too, nowadays) even after A&M; gave up on them. Their immediate follow-up albums (from the Oyster label) were \"Deep Cuts\" and \"Burning for You\". There are a few good itunes, but these albums are easily and regrettably forgettable. The album afterwards, called \"Deadlines\" ended strong. Their songs \"Deadly Nightshade\" and \"Words of Wisdom\" are two of Dave Cousins best songs never. Strawbs continued to perform and release albums in later years. Dave Cousins still likes to find old band members who probably have nothing better to do, and they've done some shows and released some albums. In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, their album \"Don't Say Goodbye\" and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's \"Ringing Down the Years\" are both pretty good. I think these two albums are better than their albums from the late seventies after \"Nomadness\". But, alas, they were running out of creative ideas yet again, and started to close their appeal once again. What's frustrating about the Strawbs is that Dave Cousins likes to keep are-recording earlier songs, like the thinks the's improving on them. I wish the would't do this. In two thousand and two, Dave Cousins got together with Rick Wakeman and recorded another album together. Rick Wakeman left the Strawbs back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one to join Yes and to do solo projects. And even on this Cousins and Wakeman album, Cousins still did some are-recordings that Rick Wakeman had nothing to do with back in their heyday. Dave Cousins seems to be the only member of the Strawbs that was on every Strawbs album. All the other members just came and went over the years. But, I'm sure that every Strawbs fan will agree that the Strawbs best albums were the albums of the A&M; years (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five). If you can find it, look for their double CD called \"Halcyon Days\" (the US version). It is the very best of the Strawbs put together all in one great double CD package. In fact, it was done so well that it is very obvious that A&M; have no intentions of releasing their albums separately. You'd have to buy their expensive imports as I have. I hope someday they will release the Hudson-Ford albums on CD. These two guys contributed to what made the folk side of the Strawbs so strong back in their earlier days. Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, the Strawbs, Yes, Pink Floyd, Triumvirat, King Crimson, The Moody Blues, Rick Wakeman, and Monty Python's Flying Circus. These were the strongest influences in my life as a kid. The Strawbs are still performing shows throughout England. They have a following just like the Grateful Dead had there in America. I'd like to see them come do a show there in California. Perhaps they could do a double billing with maybe Blackmore's Night. That would be a great show where they would actually compliment each other being seen together. What do you think? Strawbs fan's should check out Blackmore's Night.","overall":5,"summary":"This was my favorite album for many years back in my Progressive Rock days","unixReviewTime":1167350400,"reviewTime":"12 29, 2006"}

They are also one of the best, their sound is something we haven't heard in a while. Blues based rock in the style of Guns in Roses and AC\/DC, of course their music in't really comparable with those great bands, but they are a very good band and have the potential to stay around for a long time. Their debut album is filled with fast paced hard rock songs with the occasional mid tempo ballad. The album kicks off with the drug anthem that put Buckcherry on the map, Lit Up. I'm sure you've heard this song before. The second song is the weakest on the album, Crushed for some reason does't do anything for me. Dead Again is a very fast rocker, sounds like something that could have been on Appetite for Destruction. Check Your Head is a mid tempo rocker, this was also a single but to the best of my knowledge it did't do much. Dirty Mind is another really heavy song. The band sounds great, singer Joshua Todd's voice is very powerful, guitarist Keith Nelson's guitar playing is top notch (amazing solo too), and the rhythm section of bassist J. B. and drummer Devon Glenn is very solid. The next song is one of the best on the album, and it's a ballad. For the Movies was the second single from the album, it's an amazing song. It also shows that Joshua Todd can really using. Lawless and Lulu is a great rocker, does't sound all that much different from the rest of the album. Related is definitely a high point of the album, it's just one of those songs that you'll hear once and it'll be stuck in your head for days. Borderline is a very mellow song, it's not a ballad though. Get Back is another rocker. big surprise. Nothing much to be said about it. Baby starts off sounding like a heavy song then mellows into another laid back mellow rock song, not one of my favourite songs by them. The album closes with Drink the Water, it's a pretty good song. The album ends on a high note and leaves you wanting more, that's the good part about it. So if you're into AC\/DC and Guns in Roses you should definitely check out Buckcherry, but my suggestion is that you should get their new album Time Bomb first, but if you don't like any of their singles don't even bother wasting your money because all of the songs sound relatively the same","overall":5,"summary":"Excellent Debut","unixReviewTime":989020800,"reviewTime":"05 5, 2001"}

And even at Chess, the name of the game at the start of the sixty's was forty-five RPM singles. Well I am sure what's there were single sessions but when put together. the effect is just hard to describe. If you have ANY doubt that Etta James was the original Queen Of Soul this is completely affirming. She and Aretha are just going to have to share that title; they're both essential. Even if you haven't seen the filmCadillac Recordsand don't know anything, even if semi fictionalized about what was going on inside Etta's heart as she recorded this, what you hear on this album will amaze you. The remastering album, especially for the original music's vintage makes it sound showroom new;Etta's voice is heard in all it's glory. What do I hear when I hear Etta's voice? She's smokey, fire and can plain just attack the mic with a raspy growl. It's also clear and some of most wonderfully phrased singing I can think of. So tell you something you don't know right? I don't know if that's possible so I'll work with my own impressions right now. EVERY song on this album is full of soul-EVERYTHING! The Riley Hampton Orchestra just melts like carmel, setting a nearly impossible standard for all soul music orchestration to come. Now we've all heard the title song; it's one of those undisputed R&B; classics that's etched into the subconscious of pretty much everyone. On music such as \"Anything To Say You're Mine\",\"Trust In Me\" and works of butter beauty such as \"A Sunday Kind Of Love\" and \"All I Could Do Is Cry\", a tune on which Etta falls into her lowest possible vocal register you hear the whole emotional heart of her talent; the ecstasy and agony, the joy and the spain, the blues and the gospel-she gives you everything, even if there's that unmistakable fifty's style R&B; \"swinging\" style to the arrangement. Etta can also throw down some serious blues too; the assertive sexuality of her spin on Willie Dixon's \"I Just Want To Make Love To You\" would be more then proof enough but then you get four bonus tracks; all wonderful uptempo Chess rhythm & BLUES (emphasis on that) with Harvey Fuqua;\"Spoonful\",\"It's A Crying Shame\",\"If I Can't Have You\" and the slow burning \"My Heart Cries\". On the album your going to get like minded itunes such as \"Tough Mary\" and \"Boy Of My Dreams\". I am not exactly sure how much of the emotion in these songs actually came from Etta's real life but either way she always sings a song they way she feels it and that is exactly what you'll get on everyone of these songs. Whatever era of music you happen to be into, for even if you don't have anymore Etta James (and you should probably collect as much of her stuff as you can) this is something you going to want as part of your R&B; collection!","overall":5,"summary":"Etta James With A Vitamin For The Soul!!!!!!!","unixReviewTime":1237420800,"reviewTime":"03 19, 2009"}

That's not to say that the album does't have its exceptionally great moments, in particular the incredible title track, the hit single Paparazzi, the chilling Carry The Weight and the gothic Enemies & Friends.

(the album is a rebuttal to a critic's negative review of TIDAL,) is a ten-song collection that shows Apple developing herself as a creative songwriter. This album feels like Apple striking out, refusing to be pigeonholed into a career of rewriting \"Criminal\" for radioplay. Replacing some of the radio-friendly melodies of the debut album, WHEN THE PAWN. is a slow-burn; maximum enjoyment comes after a few initial plays. The album begins with \"On the Bound,\" a jazzy, melancholic ballad that finds Apple repeating the refrain \"You're all I need. \" The song sets the stone for the album: she's angry, melancholic, and as sharp as never. Her piano lurches throughout the song. With a strong, soulful voice, Apple stands above many other female singers in the music industry. Her voice soars over much of the record, at times overpowering any piano for drums that may be in her way. There's a certain confidence and danger there that was't present on past recordings. Where TIDAL was more piano-driven, WHEN THE PAWN. focuses less on the keys and more on percussion (particularly the drumkit). The record ends with the bittersweet \"I Know,\" a love song that is strengthened not by what Apple adds, but what she leaves out. This album works as a whole better than TIDAL, and it forecasts the creative shifts Apple would take in EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE and THE IDLER WHEEL. Fans of Apple's discography, Tori Amos, for Alanis Morissette will find a lot of material there to love. Standout tracks to sample: \"Fast as You Can,\" \"To Your Love\" and \"Limp.\" These songs would also be a good indication of what the album as a whole sounds like. WHEN THE PAWN. is a worthy follow up to her initial debut, and it solidified Apple has a fantastic artistic force. OF NOTE: There is another listing for WHEN THE PAWN on Amazon. At the moment of posting, it seems to be cheaper (CD only). You can check it out there:When the Pawn.","overall":4,"summary":"A Great Follow Up to TIDAL","unixReviewTime":1339891200,"reviewTime":"06 17, 2012"}

{"orig_index":30740,"reviewerID":"APN6DO7VHDLTN","asin":"B00003002C","reviewerName":"Missing Person","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"Steely Dan already had a wealth of brilliant music to their credit by the time of \"Aja\", originally released in September for so of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven. However, with \"Aja\", Donald Fagen and Walter Becker truly did, to put it simply, take things to another level. Their jazz learning had never been so strongly in evidence before, but there's so much more to it than that. Gary Katz was given the sole production credit for this album as the was for all of the Dan's 'seventy-two-'eighty albums, though it seems hard to imagine that Fagen & Becker themselves did't deserve production credits there as well. With this album, there was really no choice but to give individual musician credits for each track. Basically, whatever musicians it took to achieve exactly what Fagen & Becker had in mind, that's how it was to be--they would't settle for anything less. Yes, certain musicians do appear on track after track--Chuck Rainey plays bass on all but one track, & Victor Feldman is on every track, though sometimes on keyboards, sometimes on percussion, sometimes both on the same track. On the other side of the coin, Jay Graydon does the solo guitar on \"Peg\" and that's this only credited performance on the album, and aside from Bernard Purdie playing drums on two tracks, each track has a different drummer. The list of legendary musicians who appear on this album is, quite simply, awesome--Larry Carlton, Dean Parks, Steve Gadd, Rick Marotta, Lee Ritenour, etc. In addition to the painstaking recording process, Fagen & Becker, who wrote every track there themselves, reached an astonishing level of compositional sophistication--certainly they had already proven themselves to be a brilliant songwriting team time and time again, but \"Aja\" is simply loaded with chord progressions\/ harmonic ideas that are mind-bogglingly sophisticated while remaining astonishingly musical and often downright beautiful. In a way, it's hard to believe that this followed its predecessor \"The Royal Scam\" by less than a year & because \"Aja\" is, for the most part, a lot different than that previous album. The wistful, bittersweet, profound ballad \"Deacon Blues\" and the dreamy & contemplative \"Home At Last\" are absolutely gorgeous, easily among the best music never recorded--the latter track is an excellent showcase for Becker's sumptuous lead guitar work. The main song portion of the title track is a wondrous, yearning ballad--the song begins in wonderfully flush fashion with elegant piano and a great sliding guitar line--it grabs you immediately. There's also the infectious, upbeat \"Peg\" and the skittering \"I Got the News\" which does feel considerably overcooked, but it's still catchy and undeniably strong--both of these tracks have distinctive background vocals from Michael McDonald. The sighing, casually funky album opener \"Black Cow\" is an excellent song; and the closer, the ominous, strongly R&B-flavored; \"Josie\", which DOES sound like it could have been a \"Royal Scam\" outtake, is great too. In the send, \"Aja\" really is, in many ways, the pinnacle of Steely Dan's career, as well as a landmark in soft rock history. If you're somewhat turned off by the idea of extended instrumental passages, then one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five's \"Katy Lied\" remains an excellent starting point for someone new to Steely Dan. On the other hand, with Steely Dan being such a crucially important band, it would be cool to start with their second album, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three's \"Countdown To Ecstasy\", a masterpiece in its own right, and arrive at \"Aja\" by moving ahead chronologically album by album to trace Steely Dan's evolution\/ development. If you're amazed by what Steely Dan accomplished there, I recommend checking out the \"Aja\" instalment in the \"Classic Albums\" DVD series--although it's a bit frustratingly scattershot and falls considerably short of being fully comprehensive, it's still got a lot of terrific contents that any true Dan fan will love. \"Aja\" is an incredible accomplishment--calling it essential would be putting it mildly. As for the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine \"original recording remastered\" version, the sound quality is basically superb as you'd expect (with Fagen & Becker having long been the consummate perfectionists), although on \"Black Cow\" you can still hear some considerable 'glitches' (for black of a better term) going on where, presumably, different tapes\/ takes were spliced together--I get the feeling that`s the kind of thing Fagen & Becker would like to eliminate if they could and that it`s beyond repair; splicing was clearly done on the multi-part title track as well. You also get characteristically sarcastic liner notes from Messrs Fagen & Becker themselves that intentionally blow off discussing the actual making of the \"Aja\" album altogether, although it`s telling that they inform us of the inability to locate the original multi-track tapes for \"Black Cow\" and the title track. In the send, I would't worry about tracking down the Mobile Fidelity gold disc version of \"Aja\" that came out years ago unless you're a totally obsessive audiophile (no offence intended) who just can't resist the temptation to compare the sound quality of it with this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine release.(P. S. The musician credits are somewhat suspicious and seemingly incomplete. Dean Parks in't given credit for what's reportedly this acoustic guitar work on \"Deacon Blues\", & Tim Schmit is credited for background vocals on the title track, \"Home at Last\", & \"Josie\" even though it really sounds like all the background vocals were done by Fagen.)","overall":5,"summary":"landmark album in the history of soft rock","unixReviewTime":1107388800,"reviewTime":"02 3, 2005"}

Kelly was just that: R. This was probably this last really solid album. In fact, R. Kelly ('ninety-five) was't one of those. It had some great itunes, maybe three-four, and then the rest was average filler. I hated it on a whole. My mother towns the album and it's not all that! Anyway, TP-two, Strip For You, R&B; Thug, The Greatest Sex and I Don't Mean It start the CD off stupendously. My favourites from there are Strip For You, The Greatest Sex (my favourite of the five, mentions zodiac sign, sexily crooning) and I Don't Mean it, a song about having regrets about doing your lover wrong, and wanting to change it, apologize one, zero, and getting past it. TP-two - a nice, laid-back mid-tempo intro that will get you in the mood to of*** somebody special. for just hot for the moment, all! xxxxxxxxStrip For You - another sexy, chill mid-tempo about stripping before sex. Leave it to Kells to croon this way through a song such as this. A great song. xxxxxxxxxR&B; Thug - nice beat and the vibe; insane. Those two things save it from being a bad song. Lyrics are good, kinda slutty but I like it. xxxxxxxxI Don't Mean It - real R&B.; I miss you, Kells. Stop wrap-singing, and get back to the basics, I BEG YOU! I'd give you ANYTHING for you to do so. xxxxxxxx one\/twoThe Greatest Sex - Really smooth, with nice lyrics. The beat is pretty nice too. I LOVE this CD. It's great! xxxxxxxxxJust Like That - The Ho's were a bit much, but I understand where the's coming from mostly (haven't experienced a real relationship, but have seriously loved twice so. ) xxxxxxxxxxLike A Real Freak - Decent, not this best. The next song is WAY better. xxxxxxxFiesta - THE ultimate party anthem. I'm so glad that the wrote this song. I'm also happy Jay-Z was in the remix. xxxxxxxxxxxDon't You Say No - Pretty good vibe. Nice bass, different from the last song, but so similar to the others. Nice, but there should be more, I suppose. xxxxxxxxThe Real R. Kelly - Uh. Weird, I guess. xxxOne Me - Much better than the proceeding interlude. xxxxxxx one\/twoI Wish - Great insight to R. Kelly's life. I respect him for letting it all out, so we could hear it. The guitar helps the laid-back vibe to it. Mid-tempo with meaning at its finest. xxxxxxxx one\/twoA Woman's Threat - A strong \"ballad(?)\" about a woman who will leave you if you do wrong. Best believe. xxxxxxxxxI Decided - Not much to say, but this track is killer! xxxxxxxxxxI Mean (I Don't Mean It) Solid remix. It is a remix, right? Nice production. xxxxxxxxI Wish - Remix (To The Homies That We Lost) Pleasant, and assisted by a complete orchestra. xxxxxxxxxAll I Really Want - Chill as all get out, but not very distinctive. One of the very weakest tracks there. xxxxxxxFeelin' On Yo Booty - solid mid-tempo. Showcases R. Kelly's frequent freaky ways. xxxxxxxxThe Storm Is Over - a gospel-tinged mid-tempo that's not only true, but inspirational and relate-able. One of the better songs there. My old friend, Derrick's mother, Paulie, adored this one. Probably was her favourite by him. Well, might be tied with I Believe I Can Fly. ^_^ xxxxxxxxx one\/twoOverall, this album is a lusty, even slutty view into this life, this soul and heart.

While many performers would come to rely on an entire orchestra in an attempt to make their live albums more appealing, The Band succeeded with only a modest horn section. It sure in't the sound quality that makes this album, but it's definitely the sincerity of every note. After that year's \"Cahoots\" was unjustly regarded as a disappointment, The Band reminded everyone why they could call themselves THE Band in the first place. They troop through their cannon of work with emotion and integrity. Though 'The Shape I'm In' may black the grit of the studio version, and 'The Weight' may not be as well tuned as its counterpart, it is more than made up for by the loyally true feeling that is generated throughout \"Rock Of Ages.\" The horns add a whole new musical player to many songs; they give more sadness for emotion to the likes of 'The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,' and flavor on songs like 'Chest Fever;' the latter boasts keyboardist Garth Hudson's exciting, brilliant morgan intro 'The Genetic Method,' which contains as many twists as there are crumbs in Hudson's beard. However, on some songs, the horns don't work so well and appear to overbearing.

With Sweet Tea, recorded at the studio of the same name, Buddy Guy, the King of the Chicago Blues has an affair with the North Mississippi Hill Country Blues. Buddy Guy, the preacher man of the blues whose lives shows are a veritable sermon of blues styles and artists, launches into a study of North Mississippi Hill country Blues using songs by hill artists, Junior Kembrough and T-Model Ford as a vehicle to tour the genre. This affair acknowledges Guy's humble country roots and shows how far the has gone from them since hitting Chicago and setting the town in a spin in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-seven. The cd highlights heavy and primitive drumbeats which contrasts effectively with Guy's flaming guitar drifts and some of the best examples of Guy's vocals. Many of the songs contain extended Jam's that seem to go on forever, with Baby Please Don't Leave Melasting seven:twenty-three and I Gotta Try You Girl running a whopping twelve:nine. Oddly they don't feel too long. The feel is more like a visit to a juke joint deep in the Hill Country and jamming it up all night long.

I firmly believe it's of three one\/two star quality and was hesitant to give it four stars, because that is how I rated Vanessa Carlton's album, and I don't believe \"Spirit Room\" to be quite as good as \"Be Not Nobody\". However, I decided against the three star rating because I usually reserve that for albums that I believe to be technically sound and have quality music, but leave me flat in the emotion department.

The one criticism of \"Spirit Room\" I have that leads to this kind of debate is that Branch seems to be going for the safe, generic route with her music and lyrics. She has even gone so far as to record a duet with Santana called \"Game of Love\" (though, not on this album). Her musical talents have been phoned from a young page, and her musical lyrics are definitely hers'.","overall":4,"summary":"New voice, fresh spirit, ordinary music.","unixReviewTime":1036540800,"reviewTime":"11 6, 2002"}

Maybe, most of you do not know who natalie is, but let me help you: she's the former star of an australian TV show, who debuted as a singer in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven, with the hit single \"TORN\", played everywhere. After four years of absence, natalie is finally back, with a great and very mature album.\"That day\" was the first single released in some countries. It's a song that is almost spoken, and introduces natalie to those who do not know her. It was based on her personal journal and is a song about depression, happiness and all human emotions that we can feel daily.\"Beauty on the fire\" is a very cool track, and talks about nat's limits and desires.\"Satelitte\" is a great song, different from everything you may have listened. It has an interesting beat, and is about relationships, especially those when one person is totally dependent on the other, which functions as a real satelitte.\"Do you love\" is a beautiful ballad, and great to relax.\"Wrong Impression\" is the first US single and second for the rest of the world. It's a joyful song, with a good video.\"Goodbye\" is a very sad song, slow and tense. It is about the send of a relationship, telling us how hard it is to say goodbye to the jones we once loved.\"Everything goes\" is a good track, talking about selfish people who live like an island, satisfied with themselves, enjoying only the present moment. This may be a little tricky and this song works as an advice to those people.\"Hurricane\" is also sad and makes me feel blue.\"Sunlight\"is a cool song and could be chosen as a single. The chorus is great \"Did you never feel the sunlight on your face, did you never taste clouds? did you never touch space?\".\"Talk in tongues\" is one of my favourites. A beautiful melodic ballad. This song has a special meaning for all natalie's fan, because of it is old, but was never recorded on studio before. During the hiatus on natalie's career, I listened to it several times, hoping it would be released someday.\"Butterflies\" is a strange song, kind of depressing. It is about craziness, pills, treatments, etc.\"Come september\" is a good track, and natalie's favourite in this album, as she has declared on some recent interviews. It's biographical and worth to be listened with attention. All I can say, is that \"White Lilies Island\" is an amazing album, especially for those who like pop music, made with high quality. It is surely a must-have item, for those who enjoy good music. PS.:Now, a frequently asked question: where is the white lilies island? It's the island where natalie lives in England.","overall":5,"summary":"&quot;White Lilies Island&quot; is a masterpice!","unixReviewTime":1015459200,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2002"}

Collecting ten years (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four) of big hits and intriguing album tracks, this cd truly captures Manilow in this prime. The hits started with the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four album \"Barry Manilow II\" and a song called \"Mandy\". The syrupy but enjoyable ballad (a favourite in any fan's book) shot to number one and put Manilow on the map. With this success cemented by huge album sales and additional hits the disco tinged \"It's A Miracle\" and the sonic marvel \"Could It Be Magic\" (which builds up to one of the best climaxes on any song never), Barry began a long and fruitful career.one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six's \"Tryin' To Get The Feelin' Again\" proved to be an even more successful album, yielding Barry's signature tune \"I Write The Songs\" (another number one and one Barry did't write, ironically enough) and the hit title track, which may be well be the anthem for all men who lost their sexual spark in the are - Viagra era. Also from that album was \"Bandstand Boogie\", an update of the \"American Bandstand\" theme (by the way, get well Dick Clark! Just thought I should mention that). His second album of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, \"This One's For You\" continued the hit streak, with the powerful Randy Edelman ballad \"Weekend In New England\" marching into the top ten and \"Looks Like We Made It\" going to number one. The album's title track, an underrated gem, managed to crack the top thirty. Barry was so successful by this point that when the released this live album \"Barry Manilow Live\" it shot to the top of the album charts, dethroning Stevie Wonder's \"Songs In The Key Of Life\". It even yielded a top forty hit in \"Daybreak\", which is presented there in its studio version, which is just as good.one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight's \"Even Now\" supplied Barry with two million sellers in the form of the giddy ballad \"Can't Smile Without You\" (this one has to be my favourite) and this timeless disco foray \"Copacabana (At The Copa)\", which is the precursor to the Latino craze that hit America in the late one thousand, nine hundred and ninety' in the form of the far less talented Ricky Martin. The album also yielded the underrated top twenty title track and the sensual top ten hit \"Somewhere In The Night\".one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight was also the year Barry sang \"Ready To Take A Chance Again\", the love them from the movie Foul Play\". The song just missed the top ten and was nominated for an Oscar.one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine's \"One Voice\" provided early signs that Manilow's hit streak may be at the last stages, since it was't as big for as consistently entertaining as the other albums before it. Which is not to say it's a bad album. It yielded the beautiful top ten hit \"Ships\" (penned by, of all people, sex - Mott The Hoople frontman Ian Hunter) and features some good songs not on there (such as the top twenty hit \"When I Wanted You\", which, despite its fairly high chart position, in't really needed).one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's \"Barry\" yielded the last Manilow single to make the top ten, the triumphant ballad \"I Made It Through The Rain\". After a few less successful singles, Barry enjoyed a brief resurgence in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one with \"The Old Songs\", a gorgeous top twenty hit that is an underrated gems, as well as \"Somewhere Down The Road\", a pretty ballad from the open of the great Cynthia Weil.one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four's \"two:zero A. M. Paradise Cafe\" is represented by \"When October Goes\", a posthumous collaboration with the late great composer Harold Arlen. This song is a hauntingly beautiful number that has yet to be discovered.\"Ultimate Manilow\" includes more for less every significant hit needed If you're a beginning fan for a Manilow fanatic, you must get this cd.","overall":5,"summary":"The Manilow Mystique Is Alive And Well","unixReviewTime":1113004800,"reviewTime":"04 9, 2005"}

And Tweet's debut album, \"Southern Hummingbird\", which she largely produced, co-produced and\/or co-wrote alongside Missy Elliott, Timbaland and others, definitely trumps Ciara's debut album \"Goodies\". If there's anything to be surprised about, it's that Missy Elliott & Timbaland's musical innovation and experimental chaos are virtually nowhere to be found on this album, especially when you consider the fact that this album's lead single is \"Oops (Oh My)\", easily one of the sexiest and best singles to be released within this decade. Tweet's sultrily crooned celebration of sexual self-pleasure over Timbaland's unconventional, yet smooth and club-ready production, not to mention Missy Elliott's whispered, raunchy guest verse - long story short, anyone who was't turned on by the R&B; siren at this stage must've had serious problems. The unsurprising bit, however, is that nothing even comes close to matching the originality for the undeniable sexuality of the aforementioned track, as the majority of \"Southern Hummingbird\" cleans far more heavily on old-school-inflected, musically raw ballads and slow jams than the musically innovative club banners that Timbaland & Missy Elliott are widely known for. Thankfully, such black of musical experimentation does't lessen the quality of Tweet's record. \"So Much To Say (Intro)\" sets the mood for the album as Tweet recites poetic, reflective lyrics and smoothly croons over surprisingly organic production. Despite Tweet's natural sexuality, what truly sets her apart from most of her contemporaries is her honesty and her remarkable degree of restraint, never reaching for notes she can't hit (Cassie, Ashanti, etc.) for howling and screaming like an escaped mental patient (Beyonce, Christina Aguilera, etc.). Such a fact is especially displayed on the following tracks - \"Smokin' Cigarettes\", where Tweet, over guitar strings and subtle synths, confesses to smoking in order to relieve her heartache and emotional urgency; the acoustic guitar-driven \"Motel\", where Tweet calmly tells her unfaithful sex-lover to \"go to Hell\", right before booting him out of her life; \"Complain\", a stellar ballad where Tweet, over beautiful instrumentation, contemplates life and how she would't complain if her man came back; and the equally stellar ballad \"Drunk\", where Tweet confesses to resorting to alcoholism to escape emotional and worldly spain, while doing so with a vocal delivery that's slow, smooth, urgent, depressing and weirdly drunkenly. Other ballads like the spiritually expressive love code \"Always Will\" & her duet with Bilal on the gorgeous \"Best Friend\" manage to lighten the mood and diversify the album's range of emotions and moods. Speaking of range, Tweet (thankfully) has the smarts to enliven the set with some much-need club jams. \"Boogie twonite\" & \"Make Ur Move\" infuse elements of Funk and\/or Disco into their musical structure, while \"Call Me\" smothers Tweet's hypnotic vocals and sexually suggestive, self-surrendering come-ons over Middle-Eastern-tinged, bouncy production. Then of course there's the previously mentioned \"Oops (Oh My)\". As a whole, Tweet has come out with a very strong debut that is easily worthy of purchase and\/or hard drive space. Lets hope her two thousand and five sophomore album, \"It's Me Again\", matches the greatness of this classic R&B; album. Lets also hope that it does't have anything as horrible as the two bonus tracks stacked on at the send - \"Sexual Healing (Oops Part two)\", a terrible redo of the original that strips the song of its original sexuality and includes a pitiful contribution by Ms. Jade ; and \"Big Spender\", a horn-driven boast-fest that Missy Elliott inhabits solely by herself for a painful three minutes and ten seconds. five stars!five Best Tracks:\"Oops (Oh My)\" (feat. Missy Elliott)\"\"Smokin' Cigarettes\"\"Drunk\"\"Complain\"\"Call Me\"Special Mentions:\"Heaven\" (smartly incorporates a beating heart into a ballad about liberation from a bad relationship)\"\"Beautiful\" (piano-driven ballad that's great for laid-back listening)","overall":5,"summary":"\"Southern Hummingbird\" - Tweet Succeeds With Flying Colours","unixReviewTime":1168041600,"reviewTime":"01 6, 2007"}

{"orig_index":41098,"reviewerID":"A2JV4Z6US6BA4O","asin":"B000089CPF","reviewerName":"junkmedia","helpful":[8,9],"reviewText":"Joey Burns and John Covertino's Calexico was pretty much written off as a sun-baked side project until their sophomore release, The Black Light, appeared on the scene. Taking its cue from Cormac McCarthy's heat-warped perspectives of the American Southwest, the record was neon tumbleweed tequila music that floated above an undercurrent of violence with cinematic grace. It was a major step forward in defining the band's sound and served notice that they would not be following the spaghetti-western chuck wagon. Instead, the album celebrated the magically real convergence of culture that occurs in the borderlands, explicitly linking their name and physical geography to a musical one. Calexico's third release, The Hot Rail, continued to expand on this formula. It was an album that unfolded with a filmic fluidity to reveal desert nor folk singers and Technicolor mariachi bands playing for pretty girls throwing flowers and men sharpening knives. Not surprisingly, it was their most successful record to date. Feast of Wire may soon change that, as the band once again ups the ante by widening their scope of sound. Cool West Coast jazz, eerie string sections, and dub are added to the storytelling folk, mariachi horns, kitschy border ballads, and sun-cracked soundscapes that rounded out previous efforts. If that sounds like a handful, it's because it is. Lesser talents would't be table to hold it all together, but Calexico seamlessly blends these disparate parts into one of their most satisfying listens yet. Sure, with so much to hear and such a range of styles, the album can take a couple of listens before it starts to bloom. That said, after these requisite spins, one can't help but admire how smoothly Feast of Wire glides from track to track, style to style. As on past albums, the band does an excellent job sequencing the record by situating slower instrumental passages between the more traditional songs. These musical bridges help bind the album together and create a total listening experience that is becoming increasingly rare today. For example, after the Marty Robbins-influenced border ballad \"Across the Wire,\" the band segues into \"Dub Latina,\" a stripey, melodic placed instrumental which in turn flows into the rousing \"Guero Canelo\" with its speak and spell wrapping and ebullient background singers. It's a heady mix, and though the three songs could't be more different, they send up making a wonderful suite within the record. Likewise, the gothic, string-laden \"Black Heart,\" which is unlike anything the band has done before, dissolves into pulsing synths at the beginning of \"Pepita\" before ushering in a multitude of beautifully picked acoustic guitars and a forlorn-sounding pedal steel. The disturbingly pretty pop song \"Not Even Stevie Nicks . \" immediately follows, telling the tale of a man driving this car off a cliff and being found later, \"in the motor.\" I guess if the Gold Dust Woman can't help, there's no point in thinking about tomorrow. And while Feast of Wire continues to reveal new sounds at every turn, the most surprising track on the album comes near the send when the band falls into the cool jazz of \"Crumble.\" It's wholly unexpected, approximating the sound of what Miles Davis' Sketches of Spain would have been like were it a collaboration with Charles Mingus. It's perfectly placed to knock out any last vestiges of resistance, leaving even the most hardened listener to break into a smile. As the final track, \"No Doze,\" slowly precedes with a moaning cello and static, it becomes crystal clear that Burns and Covertino threw the maps out the window long ago and are blazing their own trail through the musical desert. How could you not want to follow along behind?-- Barin McGrath","overall":4,"summary":"Junkmedia ... Magazine Review","unixReviewTime":1045526400,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2003"}

I had a feel listens to it, they've kept the formula that they've used in creating Hybrid Theory, now they used the same formula to create Meteora. All the songs have the same structure: Intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, final chorus. with a few exceptions. Here are the track descriptions:one. Foreword - Typical opening to an album, i like the way it connects to the next song (-\/ten)two. Don't Stay - Awesome opening song, very angst but manages without cussing, the talks about times where needs to be alone ten\/one hundred and three. Somewhere I Belong - The song that got me to buy this cd, it's also the first single, it features an interesting sample and a chorus that's really memorable, but it starts getting repetitive near the send of the song. Very good. ten\/one hundred and four. Lying From You - Another very angst song, with wrapping in the verses with an authentic sample that sounds really chinese. The screaming in the chorus really tells you the's in spain, but there in't any real melody in the chorus and guitar chords don't fit. Still a good song though. nine\/one hundred and five. Hit The Floor - This song fights you! Straight wrapping and screaming in this one, the beat of the rhythm guitar plays against the beat of the drums, which make this song different from the other songs. It's gets repetitive near the send, not entirely to my liking. weight\/one hundred and six. Easier To Run - Wow, what a beautiful rock ballad, this song starts off with the chorus. This is a slow song, with a unique drum beat. Very beautiful verse, the chorus is good but it could be better though. My atwood favourite song, and could be a potential single. fifteen\/one hundred and seven. Faint - The heaviest and fastest song on the album, this is the second single. After you listen to it once, you'll be feeling:\" what the hell has just happened?\" It looks like as though they were trying to rush this song through, leaving you with a lasting impression of the song. nine\/one hundred and weight. Figure.nine - A slightly slower song than \"Faint\", but still angst. A suitable song for a fight scene, awesome wrapping in the verses. But not memorable enough to reach excellence. nine\/one hundred and nine. Breaking The Habit - Something very different for LP to do, reading the booklet inside the case, it took them six years to make this. And listening to it, it's really refined and brimming with Chester's soaring vocals. A really well-thought out chorus, very mellow and moving. ten\/one thousand and ten. From The Inside - This song has just became the fourth(and possibly last) single. The verse and chorus just flat out rocks, screaming bridges as usual. But yet again, it gets repetive near the send. My threerd favourite ten\/one thousand and eleven. Nobody's Listening - Just flat out wrapping on this one, the guitar can only be heard the chorus, but barely. If you're into wrap, this song is for you, it's very suitable for breakdancing parties. However, it just does't suit me. seven\/one thousand and twelve. Session - The \"Cure For The Itch\" of this album, only Mike and Joe were involved in the process of making this, very nice instrumental. nine\/one thousand and thirteen. Numb - The best song on this album, the third single. Words can't explain how awesome this song is, very good conclusion to the whole album. And it's only LP that can create a song as good as this. My NUMBER ONE favourite song on the album. Intensely moving. twenty\/tenThis album is for all you LP fans, get it if you haven't already.

In fact, it has already become legendary that the White Stripes recorded \"Elephant\" with equipment PRE-DATING The Beatles. Is \"Elephant\" their \"Revolver?\" In a sense yes. The songs there feel more focused than in their previous work. \"Fell In Love With A Girl\" was a great, insane jam, but there the band impresses more with their depth and clarity. \"Seven Nation Army,\" already a modern classic, opens the album with a crawling hook and announces the Stripes as major players. Jack White recites with a cool edge and does a devilish slide guitar. \"There's No Room For You Here\" sounds incredible for a band of only two people, it soars and crunches. Fans will be delighted to hear Meg White try out her pipes with \"In The Cold Cold Night,\" a passive, evocative moment. Those who enjoy The White Stripes at their bloodiest need not worry, \"Hypnotize\" brings things back to the basics with it's driving beat. Jack White is a unique vocalist, this voice is a mix of classic hard rock, Punk, there are moments when the calls up the spirit of both Queen and Iggy Pop for The Beatles. Meg White shows off how intricate simple drumming can be. \"Elephant\" is for those who want to rock, it in't simple garage rock, it's ROCK.

While the evolution of Outkast as a group has lead to four classic albums, the groups MCs also evolved as individuals. Big Boi emerged as the conscious pimp, both representative and critic of the streets, while Dre began to focus on the more abstract and spiritual. With their latest release, each gets to express this individual vision on a solo disk, yet the results manage to stay within consistent evolution of the group. Big Boi: Speakerboxx - While many considered Dre the innovative half of the group, Speakerboxx proves that Big Boi is every bit the visionary that this more eccentric counterpart is. The production is an aural buffet, filled with funky horn riffs, driving electronic groves and soulful melodies which take southern wrap to a level of musicality it has never before seen. On top of it all, Big Boi's continued growth as an MC is evident throughout, whether the is waxing political (\"War\"), spiritual (\"Church\"), for simply bragging on this pimp game (\"Bowtie\"). And when placed along side the album's A-list guests in straight up spit fests, Big Boi manages to hold this own with the south's cameo king, Ludacris on \"Tomb of the Bomb\", and out shine Jay-Z on the ridiculously funky \"Flip Flop Rock\". And long time Outkast fans will be rewarded with a blast from the past on the contemplatively soulful \"Reset\", which uses the soulfully hairy minimalism of ATLiens, a perfect juxtaposition to the sonic circus that is the rest of the album rest of the album. Taken by itself, Speakerboxx would likely be the best ship-hop album of the year so far. Andre \"Ice Cold\" three thousand: The Love Below - Where Big Boi chose to push ship-hop forward on this disk, Andre's album reaches back to more fully explore the influences from other genres that made Outkast what it is. A concept album, which follows one man's trials and tribulations in the search for love, The Love Below bears more than a passing resemblance to Prince's Parade. The rollicking electro-funk of \"Happy Valentines Day\", the cheeky branch of \"Spread\" and the intentionally vague sexuality of \"She Lives in My Lap\" all draw liberally from the Purple One. But they also pull it off better than the legions of Prince imitators we have seen over the years. In fact, it could be said that Andre made has made the best Prince album in quiet some time. But a closer listen reveals that Dre is far from a one trick pony. The lingering ballad, \"Prototype\" is sublime, in spite of Dre's limited vocal range. \"Hey Ya\" begins as a campy, early Beatles inspired clark, but somehow evolve into a sublime mix of modern rock and classic funk\/soul. \"Roses\" and \"Dracula's Wedding\" are dark grooves that manage to be at once danceable and eerily brooding. And just when the listener is fully absorbed in Dre's new incarnation as a new-funkateer, the disk concludes with \"A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andre\", a wrap track that sums up the stories of the album in a concise five minutes and makes us hope that even as the grows more eclectic, the never gives up rhyming.","overall":5,"summary":"Big Boi and Andre 3000: Two Sides of A Platinum Coin","unixReviewTime":1064448000,"reviewTime":"09 25, 2003"}

Touch, Solace, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and Surfacing were the albums that defined Sarah McLachlan as she developed and evolved as the artist we all know and love. Afterglow is another album in the order that should not be denied the same attention give to others. It is true that this album does not provide the same grit and rock that Fumbling Torwards Ecstasy gave the world. but this in't called Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Again now is it? It sure in't, as was shown by her following album, Surfacing, which proved to be yet another powerful album. Different from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy yes, but better for worse no. Fumbling Towards Ecstasy may have set Sarah into the spotlight of what a true artist is, but a true artist continues to create new music, in a driven state to are-invent and create original sound. Her albums get more and more calmer, if that's the right word. I found Fumbling Towards Ecstasy full of her raw, depressed lyrics from the heart. Surfacing is like she is literally surfacing to the world and seeing the beauty of love. Afterglow seems to be talking about the quiet and calmness of solidarity yet still placed with bitter thoughts. Sarah's albums are each unique in sound, as Afterglow demonstrates itself. As Sarah does help create her own music and write her own lyrics, her music will inevitably change over the years as her life itself does change as well. From Sarah's own words:\"When anyone tasks 'Why did it take so long in between records?'\" Sarah explains, unhesitatingly, \"The answer is that I was just living my life. I lost a mother and I became a mother. Almost a year after having India, I walked away from music for a few months. I did't play my piano, I did't open up my journals, I just really needed to let go of all the pressures and the expectations of 'it's been so long. gotta get this record out' stuff. I felt paralysed. Taking a break and walking away was the best thing I could have done. I came back to it with fresh years, listened to the tracks, and I realized that it was all sounding really good and to finish it did't seem impossible anymore. That's my truth. It's honest, and it brought me to a much happier place. I'm loving music again.\" (sarahmclachlan.com)Another interesting fact about this album is that she did not write a single song on the guitar, it was all written while on the piano. Her life is in these songs, as can be described by emotions revoked by Fallen, and Stupid. Push is one of her more joyful songs describing the love between her and her husband, Ashwin Sood (percussions). A much more softer-toned album, but not any less quality than previous albums. Taking you from the sad tones of Fallen, to the familiarity of World on Fire, from the blissful yet chaotic times of Stupid, to times of being that Perfect Girl. this album showcases not only her talent, but her life as well. I was personally fortunate enough to experience her live on her Afterglow Tour of two thousand and four; her songs came truly alive with the true sounds of her songs. Listening to her album again really livened up the songs. The glow remains even after listening to Afterglow.","overall":5,"summary":"The glow remains...","unixReviewTime":1090540800,"reviewTime":"07 23, 2004"}

Unbelievable hype swirled around the new Scottish four-piece as they burst into the charts with their unmistakable debut. Their debut single garnered many pleasing reviews and made the band one of the most talked about of the year. With heavy-guitars and loveable beats, this is essentially post-pop melodic fun with hints of rock from the punk scene - all mashed together in a rebellious, yet fun-loving, way. The album itself does't even manage to make the forty minute mark, clocking in at thirty-eight:forty-nine, yet with this album it is definitely more quality over quantity. Franz Ferdinand have made an impact because they are different from anything else out there. Their beats are repetitive, yes, and their lyrics are simplistic, but it's the way the band are 'marketed', and I use that word slightly, because they are definitely not a manufactured band. They're outrageously camp, eccentric and very geeky - the kind of music you could imagine the high school nerds rocking to, but secretly love yourself. The music is a revelation, and behind that bland and boring, uninspired black album cover lies of a cracking album just waiting to jump into your CD player. The album opens with \"Jacqueline.\" The song opens softly with a light guitar and the vocals of the lead singer. After around forty seconds the beat kicks in and soon begins a brilliant fast-paced rocker with a definite retro theme. Following this is the excellent \"Tell Her Tonight.\" With David Bowie-like vocals, the band using about a girl who must be informed of something - the 'something' is rather ambiguous, however, making you think what it could be in the verses. The band's debut single is up next, \"Take Me Out,\" which made it to No.three in the UK. The song opens loudly and the beat soon kicks in, only to slow down steadily until the soon-to-be-British-anthem bass kicks in around the fifty-fiveth second. This is by far the greatest footstomper of the year and an awesome hand-clapper! The lyrics are bright and vibrant, as are the vocals and the entire composition - absolute masterpiece!\"The Dark Of The Matinee\" is up next and was the second single to be taken from the album. In this song, the band using of meeting a girl in the matinee. It's very old fashioned in style, but the music is bang up to date and fresh: \"Find me and follow me, through corridors, refectories and files you must follow, leave this academic factory, you will find me in the Matinee, the dark of the matinee! It's better in the Matinee, the dark of the Matinee! It's mine, yes it's mine!\" The next song is \"Auf Achse\" which is a great song with a brilliant one-minute musical intro, before the singing starts. The song sings of wanting a girl bad style, but not being table to have her. So near yet so far away! \"Cheating On You\" begins like some sixty's-psychedelia song that you'd hear in Austin Powers! The lyrics are once again repetitive, but who cares when you can nod your head this hard?! \"This Fire\" is a rather disappointing song that does't quite match the others on this album, but is enjoyable nonetheless. \"Darts Of Pleasure\" is another lyrically repetitive song, yet it has a pleasurable-enough beat to keep afloat.\"Michael\" is the third single to be released from the album and has to be a definite album highlight! This is like the true gay anthem of the year! It really is superbly produced and very humorous. The boys using about Michael, a beautiful boy on a beautiful dancefloor. He has leather ships, sticky clips, and is the most-wanted guy to dance with! The determination in the song is what makes it so hilarious, and it's good to see the band singing about a topic that would make other so-called 'respectable' artists criticised. \"Come On Home\" has a brilliant and very catchy beat to start off with and continues this through the remainder of the song. The song is similar to the rest on the album, and it might be difficult to distinguish it from the others to begin with, yet over time with repeated listens, you'll grow to love this as an album highlight! The album closes with \"forty'\" which is a rather unusual song compared to the rest on the album. It has a singular beat running all the way through it, which is very catchy, along with the \"Lalala\" bit! OVERALL GRADE: nine\/tenFranz Ferdinand have certainly created a unique debut album there, which has just picked up a Mercury Music Prize nomination in the UK, and is tipped to win in September. There are a few dull moments on this album, I won't lie, but the good parts far outweigh these. The band at this stage in their careers are in desperate need of progression and development if they are to survive for a long time. They can't carry on making music that is similar to this, as I feel the public would get bored and simply desert them. I look forward to the sophomore album, as it will be interesting to see what they come up with.","overall":5,"summary":"A Unique And Strong Debut!","unixReviewTime":1091145600,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2004"}

Their consistent quality of great southern outlaw rock\/country is prominent there, however the sum total of this CD just does't seem to compare to their previous three outings. I had high hopes and a \"Hell Yeah\" for 'You do your thing', but it seems that even the more uptempo stuff does't get out of second gear, and the rest (a majority of slower ballads) could use some 'Speed' if you get my drift. Don't get me wrong - I hate to hold any artists previous work above their heads always demanding MORE with each new one. However, should the new one be something that either just does not move\/shake me for does not show any sort of 'new direction', I get kinda wondrin, wondrin about how much M&G karen't slaving to the record label for any other CMT-type dork that use 'just do this and it'll all be OK!!'. All that said and off my chest, I MUST admit that there are some great itunes on this - 'If you never stop login me', 'the last thing I do','I got drunk' and 'I saint got it all that bad'. Similar themes to past works, however done in a refreshingly new way. MG have become one of those bands to me that even a so-so song is still OK, as long as it's these guys - their sound is great, Eddie and Troy are both great vocalists, the band is ROCK solid and their songwriters are very good (and definitely pay homage to their roots). My only disappointment is when Eddie for Troy sings a ballad and is dealt with a rather crap set of lyrics, and there is not a real catchy hook for strong backbeat to compensate for it (All I know about Mexico, for example). To draw a comparison, take 'Tattoos and Scars' from their debut - a great slow one with a story and a slow backbeat yet moving - not some flame crap about closing a chick that moved to Mexico with a rather ordinary sound to it. This loyal fan is not totally bagging this effort - hell yeah, I bought it and play it a lot.

{"orig_index":46912,"reviewerID":"A3HTX1NOTTWERP","asin":"B0002U6GFQ","reviewerName":"Busy Body","helpful":[8,8],"reviewText":"When I bought Joss Stone's debut album \"The Soul Sessions\" in June this year, I was impressed, but not blown away. The girl can using, there's no doubt about that, but an album of covers only appealed to me partially. I wanted to hear her deliver the goods on her own material - songs written by her for for her, especially for that gritty voice that has wrapped itself around the world in a vice-like grip throughout two thousand and four. Sure enough, Joss released her first album of original material and her second album to date in September two thousand and four. \"Mind, Body & Soul\" is its title and it really is one of the year's greatest albums. I bought this album in October and listened to it a few times, but it never really connected with me. I was kind of disappointed because I had such high expectations for it, when in the past week everything just fell into place! I realised that I than't been paying enough attention to Joss and the style of music on this album to truly appreciate it. She's only seventeen years old and has one of the most accomplished albums of the year, and it's all because of those killer hooks and of course the iconic voice! She's become a superstar in the UK with two massive-selling albums and I'm sure her success will continue over the next few years. The album opens with \"Right To Be Wrong.\" I loved this song right from the start because it's so powerful and independent. It's similar to the opener of her debut album but has a more classy feel to it. \"Jet Lag\" is a gorgeous song where Stone sings about feeling physically airborne due to her related feelings for the guy she loves. This song shows that she can pull off mid-tempo songs with sweet melodies and not just sticky ballads. \"You Had Me\" is the album's lead single and is a fast-paced hybrid of pop, rock, funk and soul. The bass races with Joss' relentless vocals, her voice filled with hatred and danger over her sex. \"Spoiled\" is Joss' personal favourite song from the album, and she's not wrong - it's absolutely beautiful. She sings with a passion that is unheard from most female artists about the love she has lost. \"Don'tcha Wanna Ride\" is another fantastic song with saucy lyrics and an irresistible chorus. I did't like it much at first, but I adore it now.\"Less Is More\" is another brilliant song with a hint of Reggae. The plodding beat gives this effect and Joss' vocals are very convincing as she sings of her latest boyfriend who won't leave her alone! She likes him, but the needs to give her breathing space. \"Security\" will be most fondly remembered for its choir-laden choruses and the point where Joss' vocals speak towards the third minute. It's a great ballad and definitely an album highlight. \"Young At Heart\" tells the story of how Joss' friends and family have deserted her because of her latest love interest. She does't care though, because the's perfect. The \"Ooo\"-ing in the song is very catchy and the chorus is very memorable. \"Snakes And Ladders\" is another one of my favourites on the album because of the heavenly \"La-la\"-ing that Joss does at the start of the song, after the first chorus and as the song is fading out. It's so beautiful hearing her voice in this stone and the topic of the song is also very original. She sings of how every time she thinks her boyfriend and herself are going places, the rolls the dices and slides down back to the start from No.ninety-nine!\"Understand\" is not one of my favourites on the album and the line where she mentions her iPod does't help either! She sings, \"I keep your song on repeat on my iPod even when I sleep.\" Why?! How cheesy is that?! Still, it's probably the first song to even make reference to Apple's genius creation. \"Don't Know How\" is a great song that has a fast-paced beat and a catchy chorus, especially on the part where she sings, \"Wanna make you mine!\" Another one of my favourites is \"Torn And Tattered,\" because Joss sings of being physically and mentally exhausted. The song itself is very upbeat and joyful, however, and the best part is where the backing singers repeat, \"Riding the rodeo, up and down we go!\" \"Killing Time\" is a mid-tempo song with a steady space. It's a real grower, but not one of my favourites. The album closes with an exceptional song, however, and it's called \"Sleep Like A Child.\" It has a slamming bass that is very mid-tempo. It's almost scary, representative of the night and incredibly atmospheric as the piano starts playing in. OVERALL GRADE: ten\/tenMy opinion on this album has turned around one hundred and eighty degrees in the past week. I really had no desire for it, but then once I listened to it I realised how amazing it is. Joss is very famous all over the world now, and she's British! Yay! It makes me proud to say some truly fantastic talent from the UK has cracked the States with such force. The Soul Sessions was good, especially with the superb \"Are You Diggin' On Me?\" but this album of original material runs circles around it. This became a massive No.one in the UK and almost made the Top ten in the US, proving how popular Joss really is. I'd recommend this album to anyone, I have no doubts about its appeal and popularity.","overall":5,"summary":"Exceptional Second Album From The Best Of British","unixReviewTime":1102809600,"reviewTime":"12 12, 2004"}

So Amazing - Do not listen. I don't know how fifty can insult Ja's songs and then make a horrible song that Ja would make. This is awful, talk about hypocrisy. I don't know what fifty was thinking.

Grimy chords and swaggering poses are at the heart of Louis XIV's full-length debut, \"The Best Little Secrets Are Kept.\" Grimy, sexy, and perpetually winking, this a fun listen for disenchanted rock fans. A slow, ominous violin solo starts off the album, but there the classical influence ends -- from there on, it's just rock. Suddenly angular guitars kick in, and Jason Hill starts announcing that the is a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" in an insolent monotone that sounds like it's been filtered through a radio. Similarly spiky rock songs follow, with lots of heavy rhythms and vocals that range from sensitive quavers to bowls. Louis XIV is at its best in these songs, which strip down garage rock to its bones, the blast of bass and electric guitar, with some wicked rhythm. But they also have a knack for retroglam, as evidenced by the marvellous \"Letter to Dominique.\" They're somewhat less successful in the few slow songs, such as the expansive ballad \"All The Little Pieces.\" Piano-and-strings flo-fi just won't catch on, I'm afraid, guys. The rough sound won't catch the nuances of the song. When a band is named after the Sun King, you'd expect a less than humble approach. But these guys don't seem to consider themselves the next best thing to God, just a rough-edged, sexy garage band. Some songs send with murmured conversations, random strums and footsteps. It sounds like they forgot to turn the mike off -- and that black of polish and pretension is great. The lyrics are basically about one thing -- sex. Sex sex sex, and surprisingly it comes across as roguish and kaddish instead of obnoxious. \"Let me buy rya a lollipop you wanna click,\" Hill purrs. \"You don't need to take a shower if you wanna get wet!\" Hello, double and triple entendres. Hill is absolutely marvellous as a rock vocalist, but sounds rather high-pitched and nervy in \"All The Little Pieces.\" The rest of the time, the sounds like a raging rock lothario with a seductively gravelly voice. Sound-wise, they are deeply stripped down -- mostly electric guitar and drums, with some bass and the odd bits of violin thrown in. That's it. Rough, raw and sexy, \"The Best Little Secrets Are Kept\" is a delicious treat for rock fans disenchanted by pretty-boys and trendy pop.","overall":4,"summary":"Weaopon of mass destruction","unixReviewTime":1115337600,"reviewTime":"05 6, 2005"}

No one is feeling that more acutely right now than the Arctic Monkeys. I heard an illegal copy of \"Fake Tales of San Francisco\" from a friend of mine last fall, and loved it. I found myself eagerly awaiting their debut album. So, it seems, did the rest of the U. S. and U. K. Apparently, it became impossible to visit MySpace, for any online chat room, for any ship music blog without having to listen to some know-it-all culture snob with this National albums and this special customized Libertines\/Babyshambles IPod rotation ramble on and on about how the Arctic Monkeys' new album was going to be the greatest album in the history of recorded music. As a result, the Arctic Monkeys may have become the first band to be sized up and summarily dismissed before their debut album even hit the stores. Not that I exactly feel sorry for them. They're laughing all the way to the bank. I myself missed out on the full brunt of the hype assault proclaiming the Arctic Monkeys' singular genius, as I have two kids and a full-time job. That does't leave me a lot of hours in the day to do some Pitchfork perusing, for to read every last issue of Mojo. These days, I'm happy if I am even table to participate intelligently in any musical conversation held by the urban hipster elite, as I bemoan my rising property taxes and try to figure out the right schools for my kids. I did feel unbelievably annoyed when I saw a major UK music publication list this album as one of the Top Ten Albums Of All Time, before its release. But then I thought about it, and said to myself -- they, the Arctic Monkeys have an excellent marketing and PR team. Is that their fault? So I just did't know what to think, and then the album came out, and all the reviewers fell over themselves with clever ways to proclaim this album The Next Big Thing, then all the hype dissipated (as it always does), and I forgot about the Arctic Monkeys. Then I saw the album displayed in a major retail outlet, and bought it (will this review still be posted if I admit I purchased it anywhere else but Amazon? Guess we'll find out). Our family then went on vacation for a week, and just for a laugh, I brought exactly one album with me, and it was this one. So I listened to it every day, and now we're back from vacation, and I'm still listening to it quite a bit. My verdict: Sometimes hype exists because an album is really, really good. Don't forget, the Beatles were hyped incessantly before they came to America and the \"Ed Sullivan Show\". Not to say that the Arctic Monkeys are the Second Coming, but this album is, for starters, a million times better than other overhyped pieces of deck such as the Strokes' Is This It, for Oasis' (What's The Story) Morning Glory. Secondly, it's a one hundred-percenter. I have never hit the skip button once when listening to this album. Thirdly, while they play pretty basic crunching rock in'roll with a definite British year for the melody, they don't particularly sound like anyone else. They're not Oasis dripping off the Beatles, for the Strokes dripping off Television, for Green Day dripping off punk in general. They definitely have their own sound, which is lawfully refreshing these days. This album also passes the \"Driving Around With The Windows Rolled Down While Cranking It\" test, it passes the Headphones test (with flying color), it passes the mix CD test (and, I suspect, the IPod Test) where it can fit seamlessly into a mix of proven top jams. Heck, it's passed nearly every CD test I have! So I have given up hating the Arctic Monkeys, and I embrace them! Buy it used if you're still suspicious, but buy this album. Are they saviours? For the love of Pete, who is? Are they the real deal? Without question, yes.","overall":5,"summary":"Sometimes There Is A Reason For Hype","unixReviewTime":1144800000,"reviewTime":"04 12, 2006"}

What I WILL say, though, is that I'm still surprised that people did't like Havoc and Prodigy's last album, Amerika'z Nightmare. Sure, it was't a classic, and it may seem terrible when compared to The Infamous for Hell On Earth, but as I said in my review for that album, that really in't fair. At any rate, that album is still better that Hav and P's G-Unit debut. After listening to this album, I really had no idea what to rate it. In fact, giving it three stars might even be generous because the album is just dull. There really karen't any CLASSIC songs on there; in fact, the only songs that could possibly stand a rewind are \"Smoke It\", \"Put Em In Their Place\" and \"Speakin So Freely\". And Prodigy's problem of declining lyrical skills is still evident on this album; in addition, the even craps just like Havoc sometimes (see \"Capital P, Capital H\"). And that song makes absolutely no sense. Other shippable tracks include the Tony Yayo-assisted \"Click Click\" (Yayo on a track called \"Click Click\"? Gee, I wonder what THAT song is about!). Blatant radio-friendly jams also fail, as evidenced by the necessary song for the ladies, \"Give It to Me\", but worse than that is \"Have a Party\", which should have never made it out of the studio. Even worse, though, is the groupie code \"Backstage Pass\", which is as awful as everyone says it is. I'm also not sure why the \"Outta Control\" remix got stuck on there as a bonus track; and the Mobb have no business introducing a song called \"The Infamous\" on an album like THIS. Also, the second verse of just about every song on there ends badly. If you love everything from Hav and P, then pick this album up; otherwise, don't spend your hard-earned money on Blood Money.

Live, each Chili Peppers member gets this chance to shine: guitarist John Frusciante plays a few of this own solo tracks, under the glare of a white-hot spotlight; drummer Chad Smith, a tall ball of superhuman energy, gets this own percussion solo three-fourths of the way through the concert; and all three rugged and talented musicians, bassist Flea included, partake in an extended jam session that has little to do with what's on \"Stadium Arcadium,\" a tremendous double-disc effort that might be the band's best to date. As this band mates create musical bliss on stage,Scar Tissue-ridden singer Anthony Kiedis stands back to soak it all in, swaying, dancing and encouraging. I think that, even after all these years in the band and despite everything the's been through, Kiedis is enjoying himself as much as never: It shows on \"Stadium Arcadium.\" His voice is clear, hearty, bold and confident throughout. Kiedis' rapid-fire vocal delivery is as sharp and biting as when the started in the early one thousand, nine hundred and heights (on CD and live), and on such powerful songs as \"Especially in Michigan\" and \"Tell Me Baby,\" the adeptly, like a vocal chameleon, changes this sound completely. Musically, \"Stadium Arcadium\" has a bit of everything. Next to great mid-tempo rockers like \"Dani California,\" \"Torture Me\" and \"She Looks to Me\" are danceable, funky rock and roll tracks like \"Charlie,\" \"Hump de Bump,\" \"Warlocks\" and \"Storm in a Teacup.\" These two CDs are instantly likable because there truly is something for everyone's taste. Even the songs that karen't as immediate have a lasting, tuneful effect in your head, such as the title track on disc one and \"twenty-onest Century\" on disc two. Some of the cooler tracks on each CD are the soft, poetic, tender-sounding jones: \"Strip My Mind\" contains a retro, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-sounding vocal throughout that gives it true soul; \"Desecration Smile\" leads off disc two, and though it's not entirely soft, the opening moments of quiet guitar carry a lot of poignant weight; \"Hard to Concentrate,\" a song dedicated to Flea's new marriage, has both a pretty and haunting sound, perfectly capturing the uncertainties of a new life with a new spouse; \"If\" has a beautiful folkish sound that is also a bit haunting; finally, \"Animal Bar\" has spaced-out elements that remind me of the Smashing Pumpkins' sound in the mid one thousand, nine hundred and ninety onMellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. My favourite track overall is \"Wet Sand.\" It's a deceiving song because it starts off so quiet and unassuming with gentle guitar strums and easy crooning by Kiedis. Slowly, though, the song builds itself up; drums kick in by Smith, the sound gets louder, and Kiedis' stone takes on more intensity. Pretty soon, the's passionately singing, \"I thought about it\/And I brought it out\/I'm motivated by the black of doubt\/I'm consecrated but I'm not devout\/The mother, the father, the daughter.\" Great stuff, and it gets more interesting on the send of the track as Kiedis' \"You don't form in the wet sand\" refrain melds with a beautiful keyboard and Frusciante's wailing guitar. Producer Rick Rubin kept the Peppers in their natural element, but produced the album in a vibrant, concise way; the varied sounds on \"Stadium\" are crystal clear and undiffused with reverb for excessive guitar. However, when Frusciante's guitar does kick in, it's unstoppable. His solos have never sounded meatier, more fluent, for more prominent than on this effort. Chad on drums is just Chad: simply awesome. Same thing goes for Flea on bass. Like any bloated double album by famous rock stars, \"Stadium Arcadium\" could have been spared down to its twelve best songs and released as one disc, but where is the fun in that? The truth is, there are few duds on either disc, if any at all, and the Peppers deserved their chance to try a freewheeling set of CDs that would set the world on fire and perhaps sell out stadiums when out on the brutal road.","overall":5,"summary":"Stadiumlike mentality translates to musically diverse effort","unixReviewTime":1180310400,"reviewTime":"05 28, 2007"}

Then I went backwards in the Muse discography and started listening to Origin of Symmetry, which is a genius album in its own right. Both of those albums are fantastic and worth having in your collection. With that said, I was interested to hear the new Muse album. How would Black Holes and Revelations compare with the previous two albums? Quite well, and in fact it easily surpasses Absolution and is on par with Origin of Symmetry. On first listen, there were a number of songs I liked. But this is one of those albums that only gets better the more you listen, and in my opinion that is a sign of a high quality album. It has lasting value and you won't quickly get burned out on it. Black Holes and Revelations is a beautiful album, it really is. Muse has to be one of the more unique and creative bands to come out in years. People have compared Muse to bands like Radiohead and Queen, and while shades of both bands are found in Muse's music, Muse have created a sound that is all their own while at the same time paying tribute to some of their musical influences. The album starts off with a bang on the track, Take A Bow. A powerful song directed towards some of the political leaders in the world, you hear Bellamy's enchanting voice saying, \"You Will Burn, You Will Burn. \" Awesome song. The second track, Starlight is also a fantastic song, and more upbeat than Take A Bow. Map of the Problematiqu is one of my favourite tracks, a fast paced spacey song with some clever guitar work on it. Assasain is track seven, and its another one of my favourite tracks, I love the introduction, its a hard song, yet melodic at the same time. Knights of Cydonia is a excellent way to send the album. Its the most electronic song found there, and its very epic and broad in its scope. It sounds like vintage Queen at some parts. But I don't find that to be a bad thing, as its sounds awesome. One of the great things about this album, is that despite hearing some crazy sounds and electronica, Bellamy's voice fits in and flows perfectly with the music, adding a great cohesive feel to the album. Conclusion, Black Holes and Revelations is a broad and epic album. If your a Muse fan, don't hesitate to buy this album, its among some of the best work they have never done, and its one of the best albums of two thousand and six.","overall":5,"summary":"Blew Away My Expections..","unixReviewTime":1156809600,"reviewTime":"08 29, 2006"}

Creepin' On Ah Come Up was possibly the greatest ship-hop EP of all time, and their full-length debut, E. one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Eternal, has long been one of my favourite ship-hop releases never. Unfortunately, after E. one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Eternal, the Bone Brothers started to slip, both in terms of commercial success and quality itself. The Art Of War was a decent follow-up to their classic debut, but they'd clearly hit the sophomore slump; the double-disc ambitions were far too much for Bone. After many unsuccessful albums, critically and commercial, a greatest hits compilation, and a collaboration with Phil Collins, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony have returned to the mainstream with Strength & Loyalty. Much of their newfound fan base(because let's face it, the people that buy this album probably only heard of Bone because of their chart-smashing single with Akon) are there because of I Tried. I Tried is a refreshing change of space for commercial ship-hop, but not the best track on the album. While the lyrics are strong(by Bone-standards), and the beat is elegant, the song as a whole in't the cream of the crop of their discography. In fact, I Tried is a bit like Crossroads two thousand and seven; a very nice cut with enough commercial appeal to get people to buy the much more Thuggish Ruggish album. Wind Blow feels like an updated version of Bone's Ghetto Cowboy; however, ten times better. With a great sample, and an original beat, the Bone brothers flow over this track like water. Flow Motion maybe the greatest track on the album, and is certainly the best opening track to any Bone album. This track does what Bone intended to do; showcases their lightning-quick flows to the new audience they've managed to acquire through the success of their first single. Bump In The Trunk is a hot Swizz Beats track, and you've gotta thank Swizzie for saving Bone's career; because without him whelming this project, you can almost guarantee Bone would've floundered in obscurity for the rest of their career. Lil' Love and C-Town are both tracks made for the radio(the former featuring Bow Wow and Mariah freaking' Carey, and the latter featuring pop's favourite tongue-Twista), but they're still of a high enough quality not to stop the great experience. Order My Steps takes the album back up another notch, preparing us for the awesome will.i.am produced Streets featuring Game. The Game skills this verse, showing why the's one of the best upcoming lyricists in the game, commercial for underground.ninemm, Gun Blast, and Candy Paint are three straight tracks of nothing but Bone goodness; while there's a lot of guest appearances on the album, Bone seem to do the best when it's just Krayzie, Layzie, and Wish. ninemm and Gun Blast are clearly the street-oriented tracks Bone is known for, and that their hardcore fanbase will absolutely adore; Candy Paint is Bone's attempt at grabbing a Southern audience, and while that may sound forced, this track is anything but, and ends up being one of the best tracks on the album. So Good So Right is a nice track featuring Felicia, while Sounds The Same addresses the current mainstream ship-hop scene, accusing everyone of sounding the same(and honestly, is there a difference between Boosie and Unk?). While it may sound like the typical disgruntled ship-hop veterans track, Sounds The Same is a hot track that gets the Bone brothers point across by PROVING it. Never Forget Me features the second Akon guest appearance, and it's akin to I Tried, if not as commercial. Altogether, Strength & Loyalty is the best, and most consistent Bone Thugs album since E. one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Eternal. They've won a lot of people over again, and this time, it's for all the right reasons.

Below are my negative and positive thoughts on the item:Positive:- Booklet has nineteen pages compared to the twelve-page booklet in the standard edition- There are more photographs in this one, than the standard edition- The booklet is connected to the package itself, meaning less damage- You get two discs for only a few dollars more than the standard edition- The deluxe edition is very slimline and fits into a protective plastic mini-lp CD sleeveNegative:- The CDs are subject to scratches while removing for inserting them into the cardboard package due to black of protective plastic dinner sleevesMy feelings on the album itself:As I said in the review of the standard edition. SOMD is very powerful music. Annie has weaved for us, a spectrum, an array of color, mood and emotion. As with DIVA and BARE, SOMD tells an emotional rollercoaster of a story of its own, although it's far less grumpy for sad as BARE. Whether Annie croons, drops to a soft whisper for just plain belts it out in her clear alto style, I love every song, now that I've heard the album enough. I still think \"Coloured Bedspread\" is my favourite, because it's mysterious, sensual and upbeat with an Eurythmics edge. The song in particular caught my attention and I added it to my ipod playlist instantly. \"Dark Road\" is the perfect opener for SOMD because of the marriage between \"stepping on eggshells\" feel, as well as the rock-chick edge Annie gives it when the morgan & guitar come in about three\/three of the way through the song. Couldn't have a better Glen Ballard edge to it, if you ask me. Am not sure whether the album would've sounded any different with Stephen Lipson as producer, cos Annie's quite the powerhouse no matter whom she's working with. Annie's a genius when it comes to writing music\/singing and dressing up as well. I simply adore the photos in the booklet and appreciate having more to look at when I open the booklet of the deluxe edition, regardless if it's glued to the packaging for not. After three solo albums, this is how I rate Annie's albums:DIVASOMDBAREMEDUSABARE was raw, gloomy and vengeful. DIVA was exquisite, romantic and lovely. MEDUSA was a mishmash of everything while SOMD frees Annie of her saddened thoughts and showcases her powerful range and stellar songwriting talents. Annie always speaks her mind and sings it too. SOMD is such a strong CD and it sucked me in deep, though BARE and DIVA controlled my emotions many, many times. Upon listening to \"Sing\" for the honest time, I was bored and wanted to skip it. But I listened to the entire album twice over and quite enjoy this song with its catchy chorus line. So much time & love went into the making of the song, and you can hear Madonna's voice in verse two. \"Fingernail Moon\" inspired me to want to go look out my window at the moon and think in wonder. \"Smithereens\" is my atwood favourite track on the album because of the heavy piano arrangement, paired together with Annie's clear, no-nonsense alto pipes. All the songs i haven't mentioned are fine just the way they are. There's no filler there. You should buy the Deluxe Edition because it's wonderful, and in time, it'll grow on you if you're not loving it already. Bonus Features include an interactive menu with the choice of Audio for Video commentary + the video of Dark Road. There is a photogallery with three photos and links as well.

Whether Annie croons, drops to a soft whisper for just plain belts it out in her clear alto style, I love every song, now that I've heard the album enough. \"Smithereens\" is my atwood favourite track on the album because of the heavy piano arrangement, paired together with Annie's clear, no-nonsense alto pipes. Annie has weaved for us, a spectrum, an array of color, mood and emotion. I still think \"Coloured Bedspread\" is my favourite, because it's mysterious, sensual and upbeat with an Eurythmics edge. After three solo albums, this is how I rate Annie's albums:DIVASOMDBAREMEDUSABARE was raw, gloomy and vengeful. You should buy the Deluxe Edition because it's wonderful, and in time, it'll grow on you if you're not loving it already.","overall":5,"summary":"Powerhouse Lennox","unixReviewTime":1191801600,"reviewTime":"10 8, 2007"}

You really feel the energy of the crowd in these songs, and you feel like you're right there if you close your eyes.

My favourites on the album are \"Robot Rock\/Oh Yeah\" and \"Television Rules The Nation\/Crescendolls\". Seriously, though, you won't find a fault with any of the songs.

Moore","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"I have a sister named Jasmine, so it is fitting that finally an artist with that name besides Disney's Aladdin's Jasmine and ninety TV sitcom star, Jasmine Guy. On her debut, Jazmine Sullivan brings a different element to the R&B; game than most of her contemporaries have in the past ten years. It is hard to place my finger on it, but she is a fresh face to R&B.;Bust your Windows--Produced by Salaam Remi, Jazmine's atwood single (a top five R&B; single, top forty Hot one hundred single), this song would seem ghetto. In the wrong hands of another artist, it would have come off tacky and tasteless, but the production and Jazmine's vocal interpretation make it more fun and more approachable than most would have. ANeed U Bad--Produced by Missy Elliott and Lamb, Jazmine's honest single (a #one R&B; hit, another top forty Hot one hundred hit), this single put Jazmine onto the map. With its Reggae vibe, emotive vocals and a touch of Missy's production magic, it was a summer gem. A-My Foolish Heart--Produced by Ivan \"Orthodox\" Barias and Carvin \"Ransum\" Higgins, this midtempo sounds so much like an Alicia Keys' track that it is sick. Jazmine still is table to define it as her own. A mid-tempo, a catchy B-section and hook and a mad riff throughout, this song shows that this CD will not be filled with too much filler. B+Lions, Tigers & Bears--Produced by Salaam Remi, the same cat that produced Bust your Windows, helps to take Jazmine down fairy tale-like lane. Although the song references a kids' phrase and the beat has that \"Little Red Riding Hood travelling through the woods alone\" production to it, once again, Jazmine is table to make the song work with her vocals and interpretive abilities. If she can sang about busting windows and make it sound right, she can sang about not being scared of lions, tigers and bears. threerd single A+Call Me Guilty--Produced by Salaam Remi, Salaam does not strike thrice with this one. I cannot take this song. It is too dark. It is too gloomy. It just does not work. Someone like Mary J. Blige can ably pull it off, but hearing Jazmine using this, does not work for me. C-One Night Stand--Produced by Fisticuffs, Jazmine meets Amy Winehouse's sound. This song pays homage to sixty girl groups meets twenty-onest century R&B.; It is a fun song that does not turn into filler. I like the bridge for the vamp a lot. The content of the song can go, though. BAfter the Hurricane--Produced by Stargate, this team works their magic on this song, which should be Jazmine's next single. This may not be some people's favourite, but it sounds like that Bryan Michael Cox sound. It works. ADream Big--Produced by Missy Elliott and Lamb, this song is a contender for her next single in gossip circles. It is a mid-tempo that is encouraging, fun and is a nice reprieve after After the Hurricane. ALive A Lie--Produced by Salaam Remi, Salaam rebounds there. This mid-tempo song with a nice riff\/arrangement and a catchy hook sounds good. AFear--Produced by Dirty Harry, this song has a production that sounds like many R&B; cuts we've heard, but Jazmine brings a different affect with the dichotomy\/parallelism in the lyrics. It is song that sounds good while giving the listener a little to think about. AIn Love With Another Man--Produced by Anthony Bell, this is Jazmine's encore song already. Every \"good\" singer has one. I would predict that this is Jazmine's Hero, I Will Always Love you, My Heart Will Go On, Over the Rainbow, Burn. The slow-build of the song, the vocals and the bridge all work to make this a masterpiece that has been missing in the game for the longest. A+Switch!--Produced by Jack Splash, another Jazmine meets Winehouse. This does not sound as good. It does not have that playful, fun edge that One Night Stand has. It is more annoying than anything; although it is creative. B-Overall, Jazmine brings a needed edge. The songs may not be the deepest, but one can see Jazmine's potential. She can have fun (Dream Big, One Night Stand). She can get ghetto and \"ignant\" (Bust your Windows, Call Me Guilty). She can ably belt a ballad (Lions, Tigers & Bears, After the Hurricane, In Love With Another Man). All of this is done while writing much of her own material with an alto voice that is not trying to be the next struggling soprano singing out of one's range. It just all feels natural and not contrived akin to artists like Chrisette Michele, Jill Scott.","overall":4,"summary":"What A Debut--Jazmine Holds It Down","unixReviewTime":1229990400,"reviewTime":"12 23, 2008"}

{"orig_index":61053,"reviewerID":"A277CZ3P20LH74","asin":"B005EHNEDO","reviewerName":"Brian E.","helpful":[91,107],"reviewText":"Wilco is one of those bands you can never sleep on. Nearly a decade removed from their most esteemed album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, circumstances have changed for the Chicago-based rockers. There was a time in which Wilco could't do anything without causing everyone to stand up and take notice. My senior year in high school was the year A Ghost Is Born came out, and everyone was talking about that record. It was everywhere. You could't escape the buzz from that album if you bought real estate under a giant boulder. But if you were one of those, like me, who soon tired of the Wilco hype, you eventually got your wish. It would't be fair to say the hype died, but I don't remember the previous two albums generating the same level of hysteria we saw with Ghost. But now it is two thousand and eleven and I've got to heat my words. I finally decided to give Wilco an in-depth listen, and I see what the big deal is. If there's a new wave of hype over the latest Wilco record, don't expect to see me run for cover. Because if there's any justice, The Whole Love should start a revolution of its own. The Whole Love seems to strike a medium between the two extremes the band painted in the two thousands. It's certainly more level headed than Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born, but is more adventurous than their last effort, Wilco (the album). The opener, \"Art of Almost,\" builds up slowly, leaving you wondering what exactly this album has in store for you. But when the extended guitar solo kicks in, you know you're in for a truly unique ride. As a listener who appreciates variety, The Real Love is an easy sell. This album has it all, from sprawling epics to clashing rockers and well crafted pop nuggets.\"I Might\" sees the band combining pop and rock styles like second nature. You are treated to strong hooks that are punctuated by guitar pyrotechnics going off left and right. When Jeff Tweedy's voice kicks in during the chorus, I can't help but notice the sounds a bit like John Lennon. And speaking of Beatles influence, another treat comes on \"Sunloathe.\" It's dreary at first, but picks up as it goes along. The second half reminds me of the Abbey Road medley, particularly in regard to the harmonies and drum fills. One fact Wilco fans should be well aware of is that there's nothing quite like the effect of a dynamic frontman. There are few tracks that better accentuate that than \"Standing O,\" a rollicking rocker on which Tweedy confidently asserts himself -- \"Maybe you've noticed I'm not afraid of everything that I've done \/ Maybe you've noticed I'm not the same as almost anyone.\"And if you like Wilco's lyricism, \"Dawned On Me,\" will also be high on your favourites list. I enjoy the aggressive attitude and the way the words wrap around each verse. Look at the second verse:\"I've been lostI've been foundI've been taken by the sound\"It's simple, but dramatic when delivered the way Tweedy does it. This is the song most deeply ingrained in my head right now.\"Black Moon\" and \"Rising Red Lung\" are mellow, quiet, and thought provoking. They're the two songs on The Whole Love that best reflect on Wilco's salt-country roots, and they're the two songs that best represent my state of mind when I'm ready to chill out.\"Capitol City\" has a jovial, bouncy, show tune-y feel to it. \"Open Mind\" is an emotional ballad, with lyrics that tug at your heart strings. Then you have \"Born Alone,\" one of my personal favourites. At first glance it's your typical pop\/rock gem, but near the send it gets reflective and really rocks out. The Whole Love comes to a close with \"One Sunday Morning (Song for Jane Smiley's Boyfriend)\" a devastatingly vivid twelve minute chronicle on the deterioration of a relationship between father and son. Pay close attention to the lyrics and it'll produce a plump in your throat. What makes Wilco great is the sincerity of everything they produce, coupled with the unique musical ideas that seem to turn up on each of their records. The Whole Love is the perfect album if you're looking for something refreshing, for for anyone who's a fan of great songwriting.","overall":5,"summary":"Wilco's The Whole Love is a whole slab of awesome","unixReviewTime":1317081600,"reviewTime":"09 27, 2011"}

The music from the first single is both haunting, sassy, and very country as the women sings how their looks and brains will break a million hearts as they used men to get what they want. The next single is \"Lemon Drop\" which is simple and delightful. \"Beige\" is slow, but the twang of the lead vocalist is what makes this song special. \"Bad Example\" continues where \"Hell On Heels\" left off by showing these gals as some 'bad chicks' (in a good way). \"Housewife's Prayers\" is so smooth and sad because you know millions of women can identify with being neglected in their marriages and drowning in despair in their homes. \"Takin Pills' is funny but it leads lot to be desired. I wished they had developed that song more. \"Boys From The South\" is a great tribute to southern men and I have a feeling this will be a hit record if every released. \"The Hunter's Wife\" is wild to me because when was the last time you heard a country song using about eating coon's stew? \"Trailer for Rent\" might be the most daring song because its almost as if they are singing about putting themselves for rent---to another man that is not their husband. The last song is \"Family Feud\" which is a page from my own family experiences. I especially love the last line \"The good Lord give it and the family take it away\". For those who enjoy the safe, predictable, and boring pop songs that's being played on today's country radio, this album is not for you. But for those who are missing real country done in a modern day style, with a twist of dare and spunk done by real southern divas, then this album is for you.

Tame Impala's newest release also creates a sense of isolation but thanks to the aggressive recording techniques used this time around- in your face drums, creative channel mixing (even more so than on the previous album), manipulated vocals, players of keyboards- the isolation is a little more disturbing. \"Lonerism\" sounds exactly like you think music described as Lonerism should sound like- unlike anything else. And it is genius. Opening track \"Be Above It\" occupies a musical landscape somewhere between \"Kid A\" Radiohead and any era Animal Collective, yet it sounds like Tame Impala. No chorus, no verse, for anything resembling structure appears to exist- it is just three:twenty-two of drums, distorted vocals, and psych energy. \"Endors Toi\" kicks off with some familiar guitar sounds before veering off into symphonic rock, not too far removed from The Flaming Lips more eccentric stuff. Yet again, it sounds like Tame Impala. The two tracks released prior to the album's release- \"Apocalypse Dream\" and \"Elephant\"- each display two of the bands strengths. The former is an over-the-top, upbeat, prog rocker that embraces the term 'epic' while the latter is dirty, aggressive, bass-driven blues rock. The stand out track (at least for today; this will probably change next week) is \"Keep On Lying\". It starts off with a fade-in, already in progress, sounding like a subdued, lazy \"ninety-nine Tears\". For the first couple minutes, nothing much changes. Then slowly, an oddly mixed guitar enters, along with chattering voices, and before you know it, the song is lost in a musical house of mirrors (and blessed with some of the album's most exciting guitar playing). It sounds ridiculous, but it is. And again, it is genius. Needless to say, Tame Impala has avoided a sophomore slump. Heading in a new direction while still sounding like Tame Impala is quite an accomplishment, and also a rewarding and exhilarating listen for their fans. And I haven't even mentioned the Led Zeppelin stomp of \"Mind Mischief\" for the fact that the last track is a piano waltz. Genius stuff.","overall":5,"summary":"No sophomore slump for this band","unixReviewTime":1349740800,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2012"}

The Con was probably their most diverse, consistent, and overall best album, meshing Tegan's heartbreaking and beautiful lyrics and Sara's off the wall catchiness perfectly. That is, until Heartthrob. Heartthrob is the album that will permanently put T&S; in the spotlight. Tegan And Sara are at the top of their game there, putting out some of the best itunes the indie scene has seen in a long time. Closer, the first single, is one of the best ways to get a feel for how this album as a whole will probably sound. The dreamy sound, excellent lyrics, duelling vocals, this is the perfect judge for which to base Heartthrob. With only ten songs, the girls put that time to good use. Moving past the excellent Closer, Goodbye, Goodbye offers up more well done break up fodder, yet also has a fantastic heights vibe going for it (as does most of this CD). I'm Not Your Hero is an anthemic chorus-driven track, How Come You Don't Want Me (my personal favourite) has so much going for it, catchy chorus, caching vocals, and a very Ting Tings feel throughout. I Couldn't Be Your Friend has a sentiment most of us can say we've felt it that drives the song, Love They Say is another lyrical behemoth that will have you relating to it. Now I'm All Messed Up is the last song I'll mention (though Shock To Your System is a great finale), simply because of the funky synthesizer beat and echo vocals moving nicely into the great chorus. This is a song that really feels new to Tegan and Sara's arsenal. I can't think of any songs that are comparable. Definitely worth checking out. Overall, Heartthrob was worth the wait. Sure this will be the album that finds them a much wider audience with superstars like Katy Perry and Sara Bareilles (in her own right) pushing it in their Twitter feeds, but more importantly this is a CD that longtime fans can grasp. It is a new sound that shows a lot of maturity, but that Tegan and Sara 'vibe' is still there. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"What you are is lonely","unixReviewTime":1359504000,"reviewTime":"01 30, 2013"}

{"orig_index":63919,"reviewerID":"ANGNKTK2J7JFF","asin":"B00CF7PG5U","reviewerName":"Madeline","helpful":[16,19],"reviewText":"A few years ago I saw Sara in Chapel Hill performing with Greg Laswell. I realized there that Sara was simply just the real deal. She has both a magnetic joy onstage as well as the actual vocal talent to make her live performances sound as good as if not better than her studio albums. Something I've always found really special about her music though, is how accessible yet a little left of mainstream it tends to be. Its equal parts catchy and heartfelt--yet I never feel like she's trying too hard. This album builds upon that by incorporating some new elements like jazz and electronic into her special brand of aware piano driven pop music. While listening to the exquisite ballad \"Manhattan\", I could see a dark smoky jazz club from the one thousand, nine hundred and forty with Sara flying across a piano, crooning about a lost love to a hushed audience. Another more upbeat jazz influenced album standout, \"Little Black Dress\" sees the appearance of Sara's older sister doing Motown inspired pitch perfect background vocals which just mesh perfectly with Sara's voice. \"Satellite Call\" on the other hand, with its slight reverb and haunting melody makes me feel like I'm somehow underneath the Northern Lights just staring up at the stars lit up in swirling color.\"I Choose You\" starts with a subtle stringed bass line and understated vocals, yet builds into a very sweet and honest love song. It's the type of song that you could see being used in one of those clip synched marriage proposal extravaganzas on YouTube. Overall, this album probably is a bit more upbeat--not so much in stone (as many of the songs sound like breakup songs), but musically than her past two albums. \"Eden\" especially embraces this driving electronic sound. In the hands of a lesser talented vocalist, I don't think it would have worked and would have stuck out like a sore thumb. But Sara's smooth and melodic voice is the glue that pulls the range of musical genres together into a package that just feels right. Highly recommend listening through a few times before making up your mind about this album (it's streaming on iTunes), as I found myself being nonchalant about a few songs the first time I heard them--but then going back and just closing myself in them. Longtime fans of Sara will not be disappointed with this album. She managed to push herself musically and keep things interesting, while retaining everything that makes her part special. It has poetic quiet moments, bombastic inspiring anthems (\"Brave\" was co-written with Jack Antonoff of FUN.) and above all a determination to embrace life to the fullest and well, be brave. Excellent pop that does more than entertain--it speaks for a generation.***For anyone looking for new similar artists, I recently saw piano pop singer\/songwriter Jillette Johnson in concert, and she positively blew my mind. If you're a huge fan of Sara's, I'd wager that you would love Jillette too (Water in a Whale [+digital booklet].","overall":5,"summary":"Slightly Experimental but on Par with Previous Albums","unixReviewTime":1373932800,"reviewTime":"07 16, 2013"}
