39374,"This film simply has no redeeming features. The story is incomprehensible, and the script is gross, sadistic, and stupid. The sex scenes are a joke, as is the inevitable car chase. The music is awful. The acting is limited largely to growling and smirking. A half star dud. Shame on DirecTV for putting it on pay-per-view. In a theatre, people might well have thrown soda at the screen.",negative

42678,"This movie was funny from START to FINISH. Everyone in the cinema was laughing out cloud throughout the film!! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, the girl from Will and Grace) and Tanya the manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best attitudes etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was really funny, she really played it well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters were't as funny even though the movie focused around them. All in all, this is a great movie to go and see with your girls (yes guys, it's a girlie movie through and through!). Enjoy!!!",positive

25344,"A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented factors, sounds like a great idea. An independent film sounds even better. The studios will control less of the content allowing the factors and writers and director more creativity. But then why is this movie so bland? Ask the dust. This film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters. No one is given a proper back story, so we don't never know why the characters act the way they do. Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to your imagination, if you still have one left at the send of this movie. I told a friend that I went to see this film, and that I thought it was awful. Her question: ""Not even Colin Farrell could save it?"" My response: ""Not even Colin Farrell's ass could save it.""",negative

40827,"I have never commented on IMDb before, but I feel I have to after watching The Batman animation. Its absolute rubbish! Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early ninety so what the hell are they doing trying to mess with the winning formula? I feel like writing a complaint letter to WB. The original animation was dark and brooding, exactly the way Batman was intended to be. WB had to mess this up with some stripe Batman of the Future. Now they produce this drivel. The Joker does't remotely resemble the Joker from DC comics. DC should sue. I surge everyone who agrees with me to email for write to WB and use people power to get back the original formula",negative

22940,"Where to begin? This film is very entertaining if you are new to the wonderful game of rugby, however, if you live outside the US and do follow the game, it is laughable. Various rugby traditions such as the ""Haka"" which is preformed by the New Zealand ""All Blacks"" and only by the All Blacks. The leader of the Haka is usually the member of the team with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been misused and represented by the writer. The film itself is quite well directed however it is the poor script and over-all execution that lets it down, heavily. Taking into account is is based on a real story, it does posses a great deal of clickés in the storyline. I would strongly suggest that any American interested in rugby watch this film then watch what rugby actually is on Youtube because the rugby portrayed in this film has been distorted and skewed so far from what it really is.",negative

21995,"This was a very nice soft-core movie for both men and women. Plenty of nudity/sex, but without the overall branch you'll usually find. They could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning. Trust me guys, if you want to get your woman in the mood, get something with Bobby Johnston in it! And I'm sure lovely Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual male. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do, please PM me! I'd love to know. The photography was much better than usual. So was the story. Predictable, but nice, sweet natured and romantic. At the very least it was not one of those annoying predictable murder mysteries full of bottle blonde women with huge fake breasts. I give this seven/ten!",positive

The result is a film with no sexuality and some tame violence. Despite the choppy plot, the film is not overly bad until its climax, where its amateurishness runs rampant (terrible editing, overuse of stock footage). Worth seeing only as a curio.

I laughed so hard that I just found any other comedy shows unfunny. The unique confessions of each characters is a great original technique that just makes the show funny and very humorous. You may think that this is an average comedy show about hard life with a family.

If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film. unfortunately those ingredients had gone off! The acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just terrible, yes I know, bad writing. but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film.

We all at times wish that we could relive your lives as children with the wisdom/knowledge of adults. Wouldn't it be nice to have all your friends/parents be young again? To not have to worry about your job, being a parent etc. ??? I know that I would like to jump into a De Lorean and go back in time.

23183,"Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a very high-rated anime in almost every review page you'll find on the web. So I really wanted to know why, and I was anything but disappointed. If you can get past the very bizarre (but rather funny) first episode, you'll find yourself in a very entertaining and much strange world. A very well drawn, perfectly animated world, that is. I can't tell much of the story without spoiling it, so I'll just say that it's a high school comedy. and yet it's not. I can't really say what it's about, really. Seriously, I'm a HUGE anime fan, and I've got around fifty full series, and I'm not kidding when I say that, even though I haven't finished watching Haruhi Suzumiya, it is actually standing in a very high rank in my personal collection. I fell in love at first sight with this one, and I assure you that, at the very least, you won't be indifferent to its irresistible charm.

42039,"Okay, just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started out good but became so boring after the first half hour. *spoiler*It tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's friend is the girl in the way. She always wins the competitions, therefore pushing the mother further towards ""eliminating"" her.

42039,"*spoiler*It tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants. After talking to a ""hitman"", the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit. She always wins the competitions, therefore pushing the mother further towards ""eliminating"" her.

Stuff like this reminds Hollywood that they don't have a monopoly on truly awful films. I have no idea why so many top British factors signed up to this junk, they must have been bribed.",negative

16462,"This film was pure spain. Sitting in the theatre for of-amount of minutes, I was wondering when the film was going to start. All the setups were in place; typical love story, characters have to overcome their short-givings, villain has to emerge, but none of it never initiated. By the time these things happened, I was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective. In scenes that required immense tension and buildup, it felt like necessary frames were cut. Kid's stuff does not have to be this way. Children's films can be as riveting and engaging as adult jones. The excuse, ""hey , its for kids,"" is bull. I'll take ""Sword in the Stone"" any day. This was terrible. I'm getting the feeling that Disney will put out anything these days. And as for the kids, the ten-year I saw this with will agree. pure trash.",negative

30296,"I actually liked certain things about this game. I loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games. There's nothing like seeing the monsters up close, in your face. The graphics really were't bad, but I would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter. The music was fine. The things I hated were: The movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total spain. The story was too flame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality. The inability to save was awful!!! Some of us do have a life and would like to save to finish the game later. I thought the weapons kind of sucked, too. This game is fun for awhile, but it's nothing like the first three and only good if you just want to shoot stuff. I'd recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person, but that's about it. Play it at your own risk.",negative

5922,"This story was never among my favourites in Christie's works so I was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation. The mouse motif was effective if a little overdone, the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the 'crime in the past' subplot. The students were all pretty much as I imagined them although its a pity they were't a more cosmopolitan bunch - perhaps the revised thirties setting did't allow for that! I thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming; perhaps its because I've not long are-read the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early on. Humour was much more prevalent in these early Poirots. Sometimes it works but I found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode (though I did smile at the 'Lemon sole' throwaway line). Altogether though, a solid entry in the series though not one of the best.",positive

9987,"RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. I felt all warm and tingly when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) set out to get revenge on the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. To me, she deserved to have Rainbow Brite and Krys seek revenge on him.

16017,"I laughed a lot while watching this. It's an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness. The characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to the humour stylization. The dialog is funny and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully. There's Max, who has apparently led a horrible life. And there's Edward, who in't sure what life the wants to lead. My favourite character was Tom, Edward's insane boss. Tom has a short role but a memorable one. Highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humour. And you can find it online now, which is a bonus! I am a fan of all of Jason's cartoons and can't wait to see what the comes out with next.",positive

Henstridge (talk about winning the gene-pool lottery!) is as magnetic and alluring as never (who says the golden page of cinema is dead?) and Vartan holds this own. There is simmering chemistry between the two leads; the film is most alive when they share a scene - lots! It is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together. Ignore the negative comments - if you are feeling a bit blue, watch this flick, you will feel so much better.

Being made on a low budget, one can comprehend why the special effects and acting were not spectacular, but they were not completely horrible. Greg Sestero brought a lot of charisma to the role of Andre Toulon. He has a lot of potential, and I hope to see more of him soon. And though the cinematography was not excellent, and there was minimal violence and gore, this film was a lot of fun. I am a big Puppet Master fan and have grown to expect blood and gore from the films of this series, but I can say that I was never bored through the entire course of watching Retro Puppet Master. So, if you never get an opportunity to see this movie, don't automatically regard it as unworthy of your time. Give it a chance. You might like it.",positive

In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I would't have been interested in this civil war soap. To be honest, this story stole the hearts of every one in my class, and this is just the first book. I bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome. I am seventeen now and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war. As a movie director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.",positive

This is the story of a highly trained military man, unhappy with this wife and children, fakes this demise and runs off with the other woman. To support her in the manner in which she is accustomed the robs banks. Predictable, but not a bad watch.",positive

Probably just specific details which sounds silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together. I want to mention to The Diceman from Germany there's no reason to feel that the 'sucks' when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. Like I said, I don't understand Japanese -or at least only the very small amount I came away with from reading the very lengthy novel -pro- baby my favourite all time book which I could not put down & took the next day off from work just to finish reading! I don't know if there's an English dubbed for subbed version but if the film but if there is I'd love to see it. The film was incredible in Japanese anything better is icing of the cake!! Slainte', Maegi",positive
