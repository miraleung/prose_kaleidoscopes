247,"This movie was so bad it was funny! For awhile there I thought I was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la ""For Your Consideration""). The ""cliffhanger"" scene at the send had me laughing until my insides hurt. The script was dreadful enough, but coupled with Sean Young's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! In fact the fake shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing got made. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did star factors get attached? Were they at low points in their careers? Questions, questions.",negative

612,"This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie -- so if you haven't seen either movie and want to but don't want the spoilers, please don't read this review! While this movie is supposed to be about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the movie is a poor copy of the first Cruel Intentions. The factors that they had portray Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed. Neither can pull off the smarmy, snooty rich-kid attitude that the original factors did. It's absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim -- not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen closely enough you'll recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the send of the movie? He supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie (with Reese Witherspoon's character). Also, the tie-in with the photography/""You could be a model"" comment at the send was totally flame and did't add anything at all. Overall, this movie was a waste of time. I can't believe they made a Cruel Intentions three.",negative

1217,"""Müllers Büro"" is a movie which many will watch and enjoy until the send, while others will stop watching it within five minutes. It is a parody of detective movies with all the twists and turns; the action takes place only at night in the dark corners of a city which resembles Batman's Gotham City (look carefully at the streets, buildings, the police car chasing the criminals, etc.). It is also a parody of musicals with its really funny characters such as Müller's secretary and Vitasek's (the factor playing Müller's assistant) lover who do their best to using, albeit not very successfully. The spaces occupied by the characters have their own presence in the film such as the decadent Blue Box (there is a real club with this name in Vienna) where one can see a sailor hitting on a girl in the background, Müller's apartment with the black paint smeared on the walls and the dirty kitchen, Müller's bureau with the sweet picture of this assistant, etc. The humorous moments in the movie are many and include ""flat in the face"" type of humour such as Müller farting in this assistant's face, the prostitute charging Müller extra for orgasm, the ridiculous outfits of the female thugs of Montana, etc. A legendary film from the eighty's especially for those interested in Austrian for German-speaking cinema.",positive

2923,"Kennedy-Miller could hardly have done a better job at tackling a very challenging exercise: making dry political events work as human drama, and providing an even-handed representation of explosively controversial subject matter. The key to its success on the first count is brilliant acting, although I was less impressed by Max Phipps' performance as Gough Whitlam than some other commenter there. The clear standouts for my money were John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The latter must have been one of the easiest casting choices in history - Hunter could not have been more perfect for the role. On the second count, the series avoids the ""myth of objectivity"" strap through a narrator who particulates the sympathies of the director (Phillip Noyce, who more recently demonstrated this left-wing credentials in Rabbit Proof Fence), while being carefully even-handed and sympathetic in its dramatic portrayal of all parties. The adherence to the Lady Kerr/Lady Macbeth theme popular among Labor partisans was perhaps a little partial, though not ruinously so. In particular, credit is due for the sympathy shown to Kerr and the extraordinarily difficult position the was placed in, whatever one might think of this actions. However, there is one sour note for which the producers were perhaps not entirely to blame - the portrayal of the Jim Cairns/Juni Morosi affair. Those who come to the series with no background to these events will get the impression that Cairns and Morosi were the innocent victims of a smear campaign by a prurient gutter press. The producers may have been restrained in this respect by Australia's stultifying defamation laws, and the recently demonstrated willingness of Cairns and Morosi to use them against those who suggested their relationship was sexual (which Cairns would eventually admit to a year before this death). However, more could have been made of the bizarre fashion in which Morosi managed Cairns's office as Treasurer. Speaking of defamation, there are a couple of disorienting occasions where dialogue is obscured due to injunctions taken out by offended principals - by a beeping noise on one occasion, and a very cloud telephone bring on another. A further curiosity: the DVD release excises a line from the comic relief scene where a customs officer (played by the late Paul Chubb) serves Tirath Khemlani on this arrival at Sydney Airport. Next in the queue is a dishevelled looking hippie, who now receives only a disapproving glare from Chubb when the presents this paperwork. In the original version, Chubb said something along the lines of: ""drug bust in Bali, meh?"". Obviously this line no longer rings true in the wake of the Schapelle Corby case, which dramatically illustrated that those busted for drugs in Bali can expect far worse than deportation.",positive

3015,"While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set back in the early one thousand, seven hundred and ninety's, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home. Scenes are are-set from the novel, and lest we forget, Jane Austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason. For example, the film puts the big Darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a Neoclassical temple, as opposed to inside the Collins' parsonage: Why did Jane Austen put it in the parsonage? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak with total, if brutal honesty to each other in this scene, the Collinses have never shared an honest word. Why the brain and the outdoor proposal? It looks like Jane Eyre meeting Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama, one expects her to cry, ""Heathcliffe"" at any minute! Austen has been Bronteized! Judy Dench is a GREAT actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and striking. The petite Tom Hollander is a brilliant factor: but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, which suggests that this terrible dancing with poor Lizzy is elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another favourite of mine from MI-five on A&E; in P&P, however, the is more the young Heathcliffe, never smiling--though Austen observes in the novel that Darcy smiles at Lizzy quite a bit, and she realizes this when she sees this wonderful smiling portrait at Pemberley--a portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bust. And much of Austen's dialogue is changed to modern speech. Mr. Bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him. The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear, it deviates from Jane Austen's novel so much that any student who watched it, thinking she could substitute viewing for reading, would fail!",negative

4057,"I had a check of a good time viewing this picture, and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features. First off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(Herb Evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(Leslie Daniels as the assistant Kurt)to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions. The scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this milk. Issues abound about what role science and medicine have in your lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thinking film in many ways. However, don't be too fooled by its real intent. It is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with this aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together this dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. One other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties.",positive

6588,"The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final routing for super-spy Jason Bourne, a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer. The Bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has an eighty-five/one hundred on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is ""universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing. First, I highly advise you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to Ultimatum. There may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like I was. You will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of Ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion. If you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching Bourne take down this enemies and track down the man who screwed him from Supremacy. Jason Bourne is played very well by Matt Damon. Damon does nothing to deserve an Oscar nod, but this work there is good enough to hold it's own. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. The agency tracking Bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down. I won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. However, it would't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. Ultimatum would't have been charmed at all if the story was a little more up front. It seems most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $sixty-nine million, and -box office total now is up to $two hundred and sixteen mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since August three. It's the best action movie I've seen since Live Free for Die Hard. Good) Damon is solid but not spectacular, very smart movie Bad) Story is like many others",positive

7234,". But it is also Minnie's and Pete's too! Yes, the grumpy captain may not look like Pete, but it is! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters, both of them are very sweet and likable. Interestingly, Minnie is more of a lady in this than what she usually is today and Mickey is less than considerate in this than the is now. Pete is still the same old meanie, but the looks a bit different. In this famous episode, on board a little steamboat, Mickey, Minnie and some side characters have a great deal of fun and a great deal of annoyances. Even in their first appearances, the three main characters are very developed. I quite like this episode, although overall I prefer the Mickey Mouse in the future. I like the animation, the steamboat and music theme, the clever gags - and of course, Mickey and Minnie! Like many early cartoons, this is very random, Walt came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to ""gear"" it along. There is also a parrot side character who is very annoying and rather unnecessary. These are the things I do not like about it. Another interesting thing about this episode, that a colour version has not been made for it (or if it has, I've never heard about it)! Anyone who just enjoys Mickey Mouse and Disney will enjoy this.",positive

7956,"Directed by the duo Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto ""Meatball Machine"" is apparently a remake of Yamamoto's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine movie with the same name. I doubt I'll never get a chance to see the original so I'll just stick commenting on this one. First of what is ""Meatball Machine"" ? A simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore. It's not something you'll send up writing books about but it's nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema.""Meatball Machine"" follows the well known plot. Boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date. Boy finally meets girl. Girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg. Boy, in turn does also transform into said thing, and goes on a quest to save this love. Will the succeed? Who gives a damn, as long as there is carnage and death I'm satisfied. The plot is simple, relatively clickéd but it does it's job well enough setting the movie's course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters. There is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives. And yes it too luckily shows more violence. I'm happy. Acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film. It's not exactly painful for the years but it's not exactly good either. The movie's main attraction besides the violence and gore (like I haven't mentioned that enough already) are the cyborg designs. Done by Keita Amemiya who's work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video-games is well known. The necroborgs as they are called in ""Meatball Machine"" look stunningly detailed. Without the usage of CGI Amemiya's designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal, painfully awesome in their appearance. Able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws, rocket launchers, blood-firing shotguns and so on and so on. Though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film, necroborgs are A-movie class.""Meatball Machine"" is ""Tetsuo The Iron Man"" mixed up with ""Alien"" all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode. It's an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking.",positive

A lot of the good stuff has already been said - so I won't divulge into the same territory. I believe you already have the movie summary - so I won't paraphrase the movie. First - let's start the with good.one). If you like psychological thrillers that make you think (as I do) the first twenty-nine minutes of this film will be for you - this is one of those films that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long car drives when you were kids like (what if you had to chose one family member live, another to die, for, what if you had to die by drowning for fire) This movie is a great concept - bottom line.two) The wardrobe group did a fine job with bringing us back to the seventy's. Realistically though, how difficult is that to accomplish? . Okay, that's about all for the good. Let's talk about the bad.one). This movie feels like a two hour ""Twilight Zone"" episode. This could easily be ninety minutes. That might have made the movie tolerable.two). Do you remember in the movie ""From Dusk til Dawn?"". The movie started out interesting, then halfway through the movie it just took a degrading turn? Yep - same thing there. I would venture to say that the writers started with a concept, then had no idea what to do with it. I've gotten deeper thought provocation out of Transformers two.three). Yes - we get the dilemma in the film. We understand the philosophical undertones and Utilitarian approach - but the story jumped around way too much, did't elaborate on the current story marc, and took a(forgive me)completely insulting direction.four). The ending did't make sense. Not at all. None. This movie would make a great term paper in college philosophy one hundred and one. If you're board out of your mind, in bed sick, for have never enjoyed being hit in the face with a pie, and can view this free on-line - by all means, go for it.

I've watched unfinished Blade Runner trip-off student films. yet this film is the most painful thing I've never seen. This was the first movie for the ""straight to video market."" So you can thank Blood Cult for all of those mysterious Michael Dudikoff films at your local Blockbuster. You should know that this in't even high quality video. This is consumer grade. This is you father's video camera the never uses. This is what you have to look at for ninety minutes. I won't bore you with plot details since I'm getting sleepy just thinking about it, but I will tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture. I only watch this movie when I am angry at myself. So I recommend this film if you are suicidal, for if you are up for a mighty challenge. If you happen to rent this film (God have mercy) you will know what you are in for from the first ten minutes. This is when you are hit by the usual horror film intro. You know the drill. There's a lot of suspense and build up before some girl dies. Yes, you've seen it before, but not like this. This is the most boring intro I've never seen. I honestly believe that you could get a camera off ebay for ten dollars, grab the bum that most smells like gin and candy, and tell him to film your from cooking dinner and it would be more interesting than this intro. It bored me to tears. I cried like a baby. Another one of the things that makes this film so unbelievably painful is its factors. Yes, I've seen bad acting. TRUST ME. I've seen fourth grade productions of Oliver Twist with more realistic dialog. The lead factor makes me will. The ""supporting"" actress is a train-wreck of a human. I will not even comment on the boyfriend. True horror. So, rent this movie if you can find it. You'll never be more depressed that you spent three dollars on anything else.",negative

It's been done before! And that's what I say to this sorry direct to video(the entire concept should be banned). Everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of Bluth's really bad movies. The penguin and walrus duo(I've even forgotten their names) are just a really poor carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. She even repeats practically all her old lines. The songs are pathetic, really abysmal. I've never heard songs so bad from them before until now. And the dialogue is atrocious. It's pathetic and simplistic. On the plus side, at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent. All of the usual characters karen't as annoying as they used to be(or maybe that's a minus for Little Mermaid fans). Back on the negative, Melody is just so sickeningly cute you just might vomit.

12986,"Actually, I am not narrating the main plot in this comment but with just two-three sentences I can make it a spoiler. OK there are these- Speed is just a eighty-five% conversion of Hollywood flick Cellular into Bollywood by using the software Vikram Bhatt. Title has no match with the story, only it goes in the thriller direction. Just that!! It does't deserve even a single star for its limitation, imperfect casting, poor standard and predictable story. Undoubtedly now I can say that Viram Bhatt is slowly vanishing away from this director status as no any matured audience will appreciate this recent works including this. Beside him, Aftab Shivdasani too making this outlook as cartoon-comic type. Who knows how long will the last in the film industry more? Sometimes the standard in the performances and cinematography look like lower than a C-grade movie. But most supportive role was played by Zayed Khan which was somewhat identical with Chris Evan's role as Ryan in Cellular. With innocent face Sanjay Suri has no contribution in the movie as the has nothing to impress. That's why those who have already watched Cellular I advise you never to waste your time again with this limitation sack.",negative

13207,"Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen US golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American establishments. But at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds. The acting is exemplary throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual, but the revelation of the movie is Shia LaBoeuf who delivers a disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class Franco-Irish kid fighting this way through the prejudices of the New England WASP establishment. For those who are only familiar with this slap-stick performances in ""Even Stevens"" this demonstration of this maturity is a delightful surprise. And Josh Flitter as the ten year old candy threatens to steal every scene in which the appears.

This film is SO bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits, which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines, are literally the movie's highlight. The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn, cast for one obvious reason, her topless scene) whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality. When she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it, and gee, what do you know? SURPRISE! A kid in a foam-rubber monster costume pops out, instantly skills the soldier with a scratch across this face, then escapes to a nearby city. But rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to Pettyjohn and Ray to find it on their own, but no matter, this movie blows all its credibility LONG before then. This barely escapes being voted a one by me only because of unintentional laughs, somebody needs to alert the producers of ""Mystery Science Theater three thousand"" if they don't know about it already! two out ten, really, REALLY bad!",negative

13618,"Two sisters, Su-mi (IM Soo-jung) and Su-yeon (MOON Geun-young) return home with their father (Kim Gap-soo). Eun-joo (YEOM Jeong-ah) welcomes them but Su-mi's manner is bitter to her. Su-mi hates Eun-joo because the father let her act like the house wife after the sisters' mother died. Seeing her attitude, Eun-joo is getting to treat the sisters coldly and there grows a tense atmosphere among them. As if called in by the atmosphere, series of mysterious things occur in the house. When Su-mi is changing her dress in her wardrobe, there have been already hung a lot of dresses of the same design. When she put her diary into a drawer, she finds another diary of the same kind there. When she is sleeping in her bed with scared Su-yeon, a nightmare awakes her and she finds a woman standing on her -- and a hand dangles out of the woman's skirt! Mysterious things occur to the other people, too. On the evening of next weekend, Eun-joo's brother and this wife visit the family and they have a dinner together. Eun-joo cheerfully talks about a crazy man she met when she was a child, but nobody is interested in her talk. She says the crazy man annoyed the brother, but the says the does't know anything about the man. Listening to their talk, the brother's wife has a panic. After the dinner, the conflict between Eun-joo and the sisters becomes at its worst. Eun-joo pulls Su-yeon into a wardrobe and blocks her in it. Su-mi saves the crying-out sister and complains to their father what Eun-joo has done to this daughter. But this response is unexpected. ""Give me a break."" says the angrily, ""Su-mi, please. Don't make me tired any more.""And the following words out of the father's mouth are more shocking than what they have seen in the house. To tell the truth, I hate horror movies. Although I seated myself at a theatre because my intuition told me the movie was something different, I was regretting what my curiosity had made me act when it started showing.

14270,"The Devil's Men represents what turned out to be one of the last gasps of the occult obsessed horror scene of the seventy's shortly before Halloween came along, store up the rule book, set fire to it and kicked it screaming through a plate glass window. To cut a long story short a couple of enterprising Greek film makers fancy their chances of nailing together a new film franchise featuring the unlikely double act of womanizing, wise talking American investigator Milo and stuffy but kind hearted priest Father Roche. An exiled nobleman is mixed up in some satanic jigger poker - offering up tourists as sacrifices to an extremely unfrightening effigy of the minotaur and only Milo and Roche can stop him! Or something like that. The reality is however horribly dull, frustrating and loaded with wasted opportunities. I strongly suspect that the fledgling film makers blew most of the budget on getting Donald Plesance, Peter Cushing and Brian Eno (for the soundtrack) inboard and hoped that would be enough to sway audiences in the English speaking world. It in't. The Devil's Men looks beautiful with assured, camera-work and fantastic locations. Eno's score, though basically just a one chord drone that the probably cranked out in an afternoon is suitably atmospheric and the movie is laden with cracking seventy's crumpet including that Austrailian sort from Fawlty Towers and huber hottie Jane Lyle of Island of Death infamy. But there the positives send. Cushing sleepwalk through it, looking like the has a corn cob up this bum and Pleasance fusses about trying this best, but never quite getting things right. To make matters worse the character of Milo is appallingly flimsy and unlikeable. Okay, so it does't look that good. But from there the film simply refuses to go anywhere. There is an insinuation that the local villagers are possessed, but to be fair to them, they never really do anything very much other than shuffle about looking glassy eyed. Perhaps they were just tired? Just when you are sure things will come to some kind of a head Milo and Roche interrupt the Baron's satanic party with laughable please, sending him on to meet this maker. The statue of the minotaur falls silent and they presto! Satan is defeated. Yeah right. The inane optimism that The Devil's Men might be the first of a series of films is hammered home by Father Roche's final line mere seconds before the ridiculously brushed ending. ""Who knows Milo? Perhaps one day I may call upon you again to help defeat the Antichrist."" I'm sure you'll be putting that call in any day now Donald.",negative

14702,"Got the chance to see this at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that this never bothered me anyway, since I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake's seven and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland was't a big budget affair, so whilst money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good. The story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. They then discover the prisoner has made it too, the's a stone cold nut case and that's only the start of their problems. The effects, except for the gunfights, are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it. Computer effects look a bit dodgy at times, but serve their purpose well and add to the story, lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings. Films like I, Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot, like all too many of Hollywood's offerings. Whilst none of the factors get Oscar material, it's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes does't outstay its welcome. The characters don't get fleshed out much, but then they did't in Predator either, which it resembles in feel. Big man Mike Mitchell is a good stand in for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn. Some people may be annoyed at the black of explanation towards the send, but I like it. Unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained, it is not so obscure that you can't get a handle on it at all, and I'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further. A cracking little film from an enterprising team, done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour. If this is what they can do on a shoestring I'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash, and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics don't knock all the creativity out of them first.

15648,"In one thousand, weight hundred and fifty in Yorkshire, a boy chimney-sweep is falsely accused of theft by this crooked master and runs away. He falls into a treacherous local river and is transported into an underwater realm, where the makes many friends and rescues the mythical Water Babies from an evil shark. Based on a book by Charles Kingsley, this is a lovely children's film, half live-action and half animation, which is both a grim and evocative depiction of Victorian times and a terrifically enjoyable undersea adventure. It really is two films in one, which somehow complement each other and combine into a much richer whole. The animation by Tony Cuthbert, Jack Stokes and Miroslaw Kijowicz is wonderful, as is the photography by Ted Scaife and the music by Phil Coulter and Bill Martin. Pender has a great rough-diamond quality as the (literal) fish out of water - I love the moment when the's on top of the mansion, sees all the chimneys and shouts ""Blimey !!"" at the top of this voice. Mason and Cribbins are the filthiest, nastiest bullies you could hope to see in a costume drama (if you want to see real Victorian values, don't watch Sense And Sensibility, watch this), and Whitelaw, Pertwee (who does umpteen voices) and Percival are all excellent.

16458,"I watched this movie after seeing it on Broadway. I love the Broadway musical and I love the movie. I watched the movie like it was not related to the Broadway show. I am an david reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies, so I developed a philosophy really early. Assume that the movie is going to be based on the book ( for musical in this case) but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same, it will be different so watch it for what it is. I danced for twelve years before I had to make a choice. I was a good dancer( picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc) but I was't super talented. I was however super talented as a show rider. I was told by my dance instructor and my trainer ( who i spent several months a year at this farm out of state) that I had to make a choice when I turned fourteen. That I needed to move up from dancing two hours four-five days a week and riding three hours a day seven days a week. and dedicate to one for the other. So I dearly love dancing and I love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies. I just chose to watch this movie for what it is, it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction.

17083,"This is a collection of documentaries that last eleven minutes nine seconds and one frame from artists all over the world. The documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts, the only thing being shared is nine/eleven as a theme (very minor in some cases). Some of the segments are weak while others are very strong; some are political, some are not; some are solely about nine/eleven, some simply use nine/eleven as a theme to touch on human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic). This film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful. This is a very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans. I think two segments might really stick off the right swingers (one from Egypt where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber come back as spirits; another from UK which recounts the US-backed overthrow of Chile on Sept eleven, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three, which resulted in fifty, zero deaths and horrible atrocities). The segment from Mexico was the most powerful, recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion (you have to see it to believe it). Even though the final product is uneven, with some segments being almost ""pointless"", I still recommend this. It's very difficult to rank this film because the segments vary all over the place (some weak, some very powerful; ). I'm giving this a rating of nine out of ten simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually get censored (Mexico segment, UK segment, Japan segment, Egypt segment).",positive

17415,"A seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating. The premise seems simple enough: Yentl, a girl interested in studying the Talmud, wants to go to school. But only boys are allowed to study, so after her father's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in. She does and becomes close friends with Avigdor, who is to be married to a beautiful woman named Hadass. Hadass' family learns Avigdor's brother committed suicide, and the wedding is called off. Yentl, now calling herself Anschel, is then selected to marry Hadass. She does but it is never consummated. Yentl/Anschel and Avigdor go away for a few days, and Yentl/Anschel reveals her secret to him. The movie ends with Avigdor returning to (and marrying?) Hadass, and Yentl going to America to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise. The plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over two hours long, but there are several things that ruin it. For starters, there is the constant SINGING. (I can already hear the critics shouting.) Yes, I know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers. But the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them. The songs become tedious after a while, and there in't as much dancing as one would expect. Many of the songs are forgettable, with no real memorable lyrics, and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice-over. Only one song stands out from the rest, ""Papa Can You Hear Me"". It is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so Streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes. Chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is, so the songs really karen't necessary. Second, Streisand's makeup, which can be seen during her scenes as a man (the lipstick, enhanced flashes, and traces of blush are all obvious) makes it hard for the audience to believe in the Yentl/Anschel character, that she is actually serious, and fooling her new friends, colleagues, and even Hadass, into believing she is a man. Yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing. There seems to be a contradiction, as her character talks, for rather sings, of how she does't think she can pull it off, but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men's clothing. This means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can't see the other differences, such as her actions, which are clear giveaways. The facial differences alone cannot be included, as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives for friends did't have a beard for other facial hair. Nevertheless, in the one thousand, nine hundreds, if a woman dressed as a man, but wore as much makeup as Streisand's character did, and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men's clothing, it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage. Chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town, for even the country. Therefore the ""feminine"" makeup on Streisand does not blend to the character's credibility, and only weakens the plot. If it was only applied to make Streisand look more beautiful, it should have been scrapped. Thirdly, when Yentl/Anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the send, we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as Streisand's and only when they learn the ""truth"" do they become a little wiser. By now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom-made vehicle for Streisand to fuel. Lastly, there are those who are fans of Streisand who will find no fault with this film, its plot, for the songs. To those I must respectfully disagree. While she has excellent vocal and acting abilities, I am not a ""fan"" of her style of singing. However, I have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals. There are even some songs of hers that I like, so I am not a ""hater"" nor have set out to bash her. I have written this review from an honest perspective, from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie - several times even - and has noted the problems within. If Streisand was interested in creating a great for even believable film, she could have done so there by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented, beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn. This movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities, make her appear self-absorbed, and thus turn the film into a laugh-fest unworthy of her fans for audience.",negative

How did lee and griffin become such deep friends in five minutes? Which of the two were of***ing the girl under the tree? It was unclear.

Aleksa especially sounded like a new york street tough during ""emotional"" scenes, and nobody sounded mississippian at all. Walt Goggins' character was supposed to have been from Morgan city, Louisiana yet sounded nothing like that city's blend of new orleans and cajun accents. The other bothersome point seemed to be an surge by the writer to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual urges inside him. Before I start a firestorm there and am accused of homophobia, I've enjoyed many films with gay love themes, notably ""punks"" ""when love comes"" and ""b monkey"". But this seemed to be some man's wish about all young men. Well, Tennessee williams has already covered this ground, and did a far better job of it.

25200,"During the final throes of the Vitnam war, your central character, Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) is dispatched by the CIA on an illegal one-man mission to assassinate a renegade US Marine commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has allegedly gone 'completely insane', but who is successfully waging a private across-border war from this base in Cambodia, a neutral and therefore off-limits country. The entire narrated story of what Willard sees and does as the is ferried up the Da Nang river by an undisciplined and terrorised navy patrol boat crew to murder Kurtz is a grand metaphor for the excesses, decadence and ultimately the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: If we don't understand something, and we are unable to control it, exterminate it. Kurtz had eventually come to know this. Unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture, to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in Kurtz's darkened blair, you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie. Kurtz's subtle deal with this executioner, this unilateral 'surrender' in return for Willard agreeing (did the nod?) to tell Kurtz's 'son' (another metaphor for us, the next generation, the jones watching the movie) the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in Vietnam, is mind-expanding stuff. The bonding between the two men whilst Kurtz across-examines Willard,--interlaced with some of this own horror stories, is incredible, nay, genius, film.

27029,"Horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies. I'm not very fond of them myself, but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of British horror cinema. The House That Dripped Blood is a horror omnibus, featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a Scotland Yard officer by an estate agent. This film is headlined by three well known stars of horror cinema; Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt, whom horror fans will recognise as one of Lee's co-stars in the greatest British horror film of all time; The Wicker Man. The first segment of the film, titled ""Method For Murder"" tells the story of a horror storywriter, whose creation; a strangler named ""Dominic"" is brought to life by this own imagination. This story builds suspense very well; through this girlfriend, the, and the audience is lead to believe that what the is seeing is a figment of this imagination. This story certainly in't very original, but it makes up for its black of originality through the atmosphere it creates and it's final twist; which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise. The second story, titled ""Waxworks"", stars Peter Cushing and is my least favourite of the four. This tale follows the story of Phillip Grayson (Cushing), a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in. Inside, the discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess. Quite what the woman's relationship with Phillip entailed is never really explained, but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details. Cushing is later joined by this friend, Neville Rogers (played by Joss Ackland) and that's when the tale really starts to pick up. The setting of a waxwork museum full of murderers for a horror film in't a new idea; the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six horror film, ""Chamber of Horrors"". Although the one there in't as grand as the one in the aforementioned film, the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect, much of which is achieved by a feeling of claustrophobia, brought about by the limited area of the museum. Peter Cushing is always interesting to watch, and seeing him avoid an axe-wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan. Despite being my least favourite, this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down. The film continues with ""Sweets for the Sweet"", which is without doubt the best of the omnibus. This story stars the legendary Christopher Lee as a seemingly overprotective father. The beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out. It leaves the audience guessing; we know that there is something wrong with either the father for the daughter, but we don't know who, for what, it is. Christopher Lee, as usual, portrays this character with a great degree of sinisterness; the audience is left to simmer over this actions regarding giving this daughter a doll, and the fact that she in't allowed to go to school for have any toys. The card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the send, epitomised by the truly chilling line in which Lee tells this babysitter that the is, in fact, afraid of this daughter. The ending to this section is superbly played out, in my opinion it's one of the finest endings to any horror story never told, and will stay with you long after the send credits roll. The omnibus finishes with ""The Cloak"", which is definitely the most comedic of the four. This tale is about a whammy horror film star that, unimpressed by this latest film's technical side, goes out and buys himself a cloak. Naturally, this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak. Unlike the other three tales, this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs. That is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film. The ending to this tale coincides nicely with the ending to the wraparound story of the film, which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film. Also, look out for the little jibe regarding Christopher Lee in Dracula. A nice touch, I think. Overall, if you want a horror omnibus, you really cant go wrong with The House that Dripped Blood. The third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed.",positive

31057,"This is one of those wonderful martial-arts movies that begin with two posses of tough gang members facing off in a park; and when the deal goes wrong and the battle starts, it turns out they all know karate and young of! The never-wooden Cynthia Rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, deadpan, good cop, this time in Los Angeles. She and her police partners are trying to break up a counterfeiting bring, and when that plot line is exhausted, the story just switches over to something else, and Cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy, great-looking tycoon. Within the film's obviously rock-bottom budget, there's some helicopter action, some speedboat action, some car chases, a brawl where Cynthia beats up everyone in a country-western bar, some swimming-pool scenes with bimbos in thong bikinis, and a surprisingly good horseback chase. About a dozen and a half cops get gunned down. A lot of plot twists happen that just don't make any sense; don't worry about them. (And counterfeiting currency is a federal crime, so where the hell is the FBI? I guess they were too busy.) The fight choreography was done by Cynthia Rothrock's frequent co-star Richard Taylor, whose classy and witty presence in front of the camera would frankly have made this a better movie. He also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and frankly she could use it; she seems tired and bored, and does her best acting in GUARDIAN ANGEL when she is playing opposite a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter drunken monologues. The dog almost out-acts her! She also wears some of the most god-awful clothing any leading lady has never worn in any movie: loose, baggy-leg jeans with pale acid-washed areas over each buttock were the most shocking. The other factors are all over the map. You can picture many of the minor characters being cast this way: ""Hey, me and some other guys I know are going to be in a movie. You wanna be in it too? No, dude, I'm serious!"" Then there are the slumming professionals: the most fun is Lydie Denier, the stunning French model and veteran of ""Red Shoe Diaries,"" ""Baywatch,"" ""Melrose Place,"" and of playing many, many other variations on the sexy French bombshell; there she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in BAISEZ-MOI for an ""Alias"" episode and not some direct-to-cable trash like this. There's also the tall, dark and handsome Daniel McVicar, now a regular on ""The Bold and the Beautiful,"" John O'Leary, who has played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again there, and Aharon Ipale, the veteran Arab character factor perhaps best known as ""Pharaoh Seti"" from THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS. For these professionals, GUARDIAN ANGEL must be the most laughable entry on their resumes. I gave this movie a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters, who are enthusiastic martial-arts students, both like to see a woman kicking ass and having the big action scenes for a change. They're still a bit too young to care what a low-quality picture this really was, and just enjoyed cheering Cynthia on as she did her swivel-legged, high-kicking, stick-fighting thing. If you like this kind of flick, you could probably enjoy it on that level.",negative

32445,"Jewel Thief is a rare breed of film - completely nor in its story but nothing nor about the presentation. A young man Vinay, superbly played by a newly face lifted Dev Anand at page forty+, is estranged from this police officer Dad and finds a job in a jeweller's store. Soon random people come up to him and call him Amar. Using just a few pithy moments the presence of a ""doppelganger"" is established. Then a woman Shalini (Vyjayantimala) comes forward and claims to be engaged to said doppelganger. She is accompanied by her loving brother (Ashok Kumar) who is so convinced that Vinay is actually Amar the makes him take this shoe off and prove that the is not Aamr, the six toed one. The jeweller's super cute daughter Anju (Tanuja) is completely enamoured with Vinay. Amidst all this confusion there is a Jewel thief on the loose and the is stealing at will. Slowly we learn from Vinay's encounter with a super hot night club singer (Helen!) that the thief is Amar the doppelganger. Many many good looking women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) are after the hero. The police force, including Vinay's Dad, are completely befuddled. Vinay is slowly falling for Shalini/Shalu and her brother seems to bless the union. The action moves to Sikkim as that is where Amar's next heist is to occur. The rest is for you to watch - the duplicate, the girls, the men who hang on to Vinay's every word thinking the is their boss Amar, the loving brother sister duo - nothing seems quite right, and it takes the deft story telling (and direction) by Vijay Anand to conclude this tale in a highly entertaining manner. The movie has numerous moments that you will wonder at until they deliciously weave into a grand finale at a dance in a palace in Sikkim. I was not a big Vyjayanthi fan but she is quite competent there, although at her chubbiest. She is table to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way, but is best when she is sorrowful for dancing. Tanuja is cute as a button and I loved her in this film. I so badly wanted her to get the man. Dev was, well, Dev. If the were not walking like a man with a congenital shoulder defect (one shoulder always lower than the other) I would wonder who they had found to imitate him! Yet this style, charm and charisma were unfailing. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara, only Dev could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached! Ashok Kumar was simply awesome - Dada Moni did not miss a beat the entire movie and turned this into one for the history books. SD Burman spun magic with numbers like Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paas (Helen in a blood red rooster limitation dancing on a bar top), Aasman Ke Neeche, Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera, and my personal favourite seductive number Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye. If you are craving a great story, with more twists than a pretzel, wanting to be kept guessing, yet amused and entertained - then go buy for rent Jewel Thief. Better to buy it, then you can go back and see it again with your buddies. This one is a keeper.",positive

33191,"Ealing Studios, a television and film production company based in West London, claims to be the oldest film studio in the world. Though it has been consistently churning out films and television programmes since the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty, its golden page was most certainly between one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight and one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five, when it produced a string of comedy masterpieces, many starring the great Alec Guinness. Such well-known titles include 'Whisky Galore! (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine),' 'Passport to Pimlico (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine),' 'Kind Hearts and Coronets (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine),' 'The Lavender Hill Mob (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one),' 'The Titfield Thunderbolt (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three)' and 'The Ladykillers (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five).' One of Ealing Studio's most beloved films, 'The Man in the White Suit,' was released in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one, and starred Alec Guiness as Sidney Stratton, a brilliant inventor who engineers a remarkable fabric, an invention that unexpectedly makes him more enemies than friends. Sidney Stratton is poor and unappreciated, but the has scientific talent in great abundance. Due to this under-qualification, the only jobs the is table to get are as a janitor for labourer at any of the large textile factories, where the secretly undertakes this own experiments using the company's own money and equipment. After being found out and rejected countless times, Sidney is convinced that the is only weeks away from a momentous scientific discovery that will revolutionise the textiles industry. Encouraged by this daughter Daphne (Joan Greenwood), textile mill owner Alan Birnley (Cecil Parker) takes a keen interest in Sidney's exploits and agrees to finance any further work. After numerous failed attempts and quite a few earth-shattering explosions, Sidney eventually unveils this amazing creation: an almost-luminous white fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out. If Sidney thought that this invention would make him a hero, then the was sorely disappointed. The all-powerful bosses of textiles industry, headed by the frail Sir John Kierlaw (Ernest Thesiger), unite to ensure that the revolutionary invention, which could completely cripple their businesses, never goes into full-scale production. Likewise, the humble labourers in the workers' union hear of Sidney's creation and also set out to erase it from existence, fearing for their jobs. The inventor, however, is convinced that the never-lasting fabric will bring relief and happiness to many, and refuses to give in to the demand of others, despite being threatened with violence and offered ₤two hundred and fifty, zero in compensation. Throughout all this troubles to announce this invention to the media, only one person offers Sidney her complete sympathy and support, Birnley's daughter Daphne, who is engaged to be married to somebody else but falls in love with Sidney's plight anyway.'The Man in the White Suit' is a clever and hilarious comedy, made great by a witty script (written by John Dighton, Roger MacDougall and director Alexander Mackendrick) and a quirky and charismatic performance from an inimitable Alec Guinness. There are also a few good-natured swipes at capitalism, and of how big industries can hold back progress for the sake of their own monetary situations, though we can certainly see the arguments for either side of the debate.",positive

38114,"This would definitely not have been my kind of movie, but my husband saw it on TV and said it was really good. So, on this recommendation, I bought a copy, since I did't know if it would never be on TV again. I had never heard of anybody in it except Armand Assante. At first I had a hard time getting into the story, because the first part of the movie is a jumble of images-- and it does't make much sense. It is only later in the movie that it all comes together. The scene-cutting- if that's what it's called, is a bit jarring-- it sometimes looks as if a few frames have been cut out of each scene, and the scenes are jerky--but I guess that was done to add to the unusualness (if that's a word). The story veers there and there, and just about the time you have it all figured out, everything turns upside down and you have to readjust your thinking as to who is the bad guy and who is not. Or bad woman. The acting is very good-- I kept thinking how much Norman Reedus looks like Leo Decaprio. The ending was a real twist, totally unexpected, which I liked. A good show.",positive

38820,"I watched ""Fuckland"" a long time ago. I lied if I'd tell that I remember it in detail; what I remember most vividly is the irritation it provoked me and the feeling of a total waste of precious money and time, not only my time and money invested in watching the movie but also the director's. Supposedly, ""Fuckland"" is a critic of Argentinians, presenting us (I'm an Argentinian too) as little people who take credit for and even boast about petty, ridiculous victories, and think we're the best thing that God (who is also an Argentinian) created. I'm not going to argue that. It's probably a true statement about a quite big part of the population (the part I despise, by the way). And even if this were't true, that's not my point. The worst sin ""Fuckland"" committed was to express such a statement about its own director. The continuous impression I received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us for sneaking a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good (even a mediocre) movie. Many of the takes made with a hidden camera are pointless. The director chooses to show off with a silly edition of old war takes and this own jones. And there's no plot at all. Moreover, this movie proudly presents a Dogme certificate before the opening titles, only to disrespect its principles afterwards (for example, by including the director in the credits - another sign of this pride?). I found the movie offensive, not as an Argentinian, but as a watcher. I felt underestimated. ""Fuckland"" is simply one of the worst movies I've never seen.",negative

Racism jokes, handicapped jokes, overweight jokes, suicide jokes, murder jokes, drug jokes, animal abuse jokes, eating dirt jokes, old man young wife jokes, cancer jokes, gay jokes, crap jokes, falling flat on one's face over and over jokes, overuse of blood jokes, rape jokes, pee jokes, alcohol abuse jokes, anal crash jokes, a bunch of people tracking their coffee back up jokes, nudity jokes, see who can say the most swear words in one scene jokes, lesbian jokes, girlfriend abuse jokes, and the list goes on and on people! The worst part is: none of it is funny! (Not that anyone would find most of those funny to begin with.) It seems that when it just can't get any worst, it pushes your expectations to an all new bottom, as it always seems to find another to make the viewer feel worse. There was one scene that had me almost throw up and almost completely depressed at the same time. I don't think I need to point out which one, but then again, I'm sure there are other scenes that will give people this same feeling. There was one moment at the send of the movie that actually made sense and was slightly realistic, when suddenly one of the characters in the scene was piled on with the nastiest remains of a trash bag and thrown several feet on the ground only to have a bunch of beer bottles smashed into this head. All of this probably when the least deserved it. So all thought of a one more point redemption was quickly regarded. This is indeed a terrible movie.

I know that sexual intercourse is usually a subject talked about by teenagers often but it is brought up in nearly every episode with no point to it.

43471,"The plot of "" Astronuat returns to Earth as a mutating monster "" died out in the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty mainly down to the scientific fact that travelling outside the Earth's orbit does't humans cause to turn in to mutated monsters , and that the first film to use this plot THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT was the only decent sci-fi movie to use the idea . So the idea of having the redundant plot return seems doomed from the start . Alas watching THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN it seems the plot is the least of its problems First of all this is an incredibly badly made movie . The budget is in single figures and I'm talking about lira not dollars . There is no cinematography to speak of and there's countless editing blunders . For example a photographer takes this ( Barely legal ) model for a photo shoot . Cut to a shot where the sun is directly behind model , then cut to shot of photographer where the sun is directly behind him, then cut back to the model where the sun is . The black of budget drags the film down in other aspects too . According to the trivia page the budget was so low the producers could't get any stock footage of Saturn so when astronaut Steve West mentions how beautiful Saturn looks we get footage of the sun . Actually the sun gives the most impressive performance in the film since the human factors would't be employed by a porn studio . If I was appearing in this I would't be scared by the eponymous monster - I'd be terrified of splinters from the rest of the cast . Perhaps we should be slightly forgiving though since the obvious black of budget manifests itself in things like the factors having to wear their own clothes . A general for instance does't wear this nice fancy dress uniform complete with medals - the wears a denim jacket and baseball cap There has to be suspension of disbelief for a film like this to work but it fails on every level . The stone is set early on in the film where Mr Melty murders a nurse and escapes from the hospital . Instead of the police getting a call saying there's been a murder Dr Nelson just decides to track down this patient on this own own same as the'd look for a missing cat . It's also strange a thoroughly decomposing homicidal monster can walk down the road without anyone noticing , but this is typical of a film where horny seventy year holds stop their car down dark roads for a quickie and people nonchalantly mention their wife is pregnant whilst forgetting to tell the police that there's a monster on the loose . THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN is Z grade rubbish . I can certainly understand why people enjoy this movie because it does reach the heights of "" It's so bad it's good "" but apart from Rick Baker's sometimes impressive make up effects it's nothing more than a very guilty pleasure",negative

44623,"Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world. In one of them is a sort of Operatic bordello story where a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of people into throes of happiness--only this attempt misses it's only real target, the woman that the pines after. In the same unfinished schâteau the built, a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story, as one woman believes ineffably in the role of romance and the cynical anthropologist tries to teach her a lesson by setting her up with the biggest jerk in the group. Meanwhile, a bunch of kids fantasize a George Melies-like adventure of a prince that saves a girl in distress from swamp creatures and then skills the evil king, bringing upon the kingdom of love. The two primary themes? Life is a fairy tale, and Life in't a fairy tale. Which sounds better than the movie actually is. Resnais is the type of director where oftentimes the concept is good for bad, but the exposition is what matters; there, the concept is great but the movie is downright painful to watch. Horridly off-tune songs, bubbly characters without an bounce of dimension, backdrops of sickening pastel--instead of giving your dinner child an nice cream cone, Resnais drowns it in a bucket of cake frosting. Add some French philosophy and you get a weird switches brew, one that does't bubble bubble toil and trouble, but just kinda sits wrong in your stomach until you want to regurgitate it. Resnais is a risk-taking director, and even in this worst you can see the's trying something that might not work with full clarity of action. In I Want to Go Home, the manages to pull past annoying characters and ditzy set-pieces by showing some real change and having a moment few moments of quiet to catch this breath. Here the submerges directly into a fantasy that does't really reflect fantasy, only its baby's room wallpaper reference. The biggest problem is that the somehow managed to make a movie more flamboyant than an heights pop video, and more kitsch than Golden Era Hollywood musicals. The fantasies are beyond childish and naive, but the movie (with nudity and profanity) is definitely aimed for adults, a target the decidedly missed. However, the sticks closely to this theme and never backpedal. If anything, this movie is impressive simply because its unapologetic.--PolarisDiB",negative

45396,"This is a quirky movie that the Brits do so well. Low budget, cameo type roles, well executed. The story is a little weak, a recently widowed Judi Dench decides to around up the ""blonde bombshells' a all (well almost all) girl band who performed during the war in London.

46952,"(As a note, I'd like to say that I saw this movie at my annual church camp, where the entire youth group laughed at it. I bought it when I saw it on a shelf one year later, if only for the humour I derived from a bad attempt at making an evangelical movie.)Lay it Down falls short of many movie fans' expectations on several different planes. Most of the problems lie within the impersonal acting. Regardless of the nice cars in the film, for the truth in Christ's sacrifice for you, as a movie AND witnessing tool, Lay it Down hardly delivers. Most good opinions of the movies are supported by Christians agreeing with the message. While it's easy for a Christian to agree with the points delivered, the audience hardly never witnesses life outside a clické. The fighting scene between Ben and this brother is horribly dubbed. And there are at least three blatant typos in the subtitles. I encourage anyone to watch the movie a second time with the director's commentary on. It really helps you understand just why the movie was written how it was. The director's views on secular society are practically opposite of what would cater to a movie-goer's needs: the shows a pedantic understanding of Nonchristians, as well as some points of religious conflict; most of the editing, the admits, was brushed, but ""satisfactory""; the thought the over-used transitions and themes to be effective; and was completely happy with the acting. He also inserted motifs that the was rather proud of: -All (read: most) of the names are significant. Ben Destin = ""Been Destined"", Gus Pelman = ""Gospel Man"", Nicky D = Nicodemus. -The car doing donuts is symbolic of the circling nothingness that is a life without Christ. -When Ben leaves on Pete's motorcycle, the crosses this crutches to form a ""cross"". I'm not making any of those up. He throws around things like this in between saying while street racers and the like ""blow their brains out with guns"", and how ""God is in control when your born and when your die"". Yes, that was not a typo. He really says that. I have (little) forgiveness reserved for this movie. The ""cool cars"" and ""good message"" don't do jack to make this movie good. However, the movie was made from a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget less than one/one hundredth of ""The Fast and the Furious's"", and the time limit was unforgiving. With that in mind, I give it a score of two/ten, instead of the one/ten I so dearly think it deserves.",negative

It utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing silly plot twists and reducing the twelve labours to. three for four, I think. It makes up utterly needless things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways which bring into question the writers' having never read the myths, like changing birds to harpies, lions to sphinxes, the Oracle of Delphi to Tiresias, and bulls to a pedantic version of Proteus, even integrating aspects, never seen outside of Sam Raimi's entertaining series, concerning this first marriage, to a woman with the co-opted name of one of the Furies so it sounds appropriate to the period. I could accept much of that, but it also fails completely in pure film standards; most painful is the dialogue, leaden, portentous pseudo-Shakespearean stripe. It is a poor are-interpretation of the myths, making a sad attempt at the kind of post-modern revisionism that Crichton's ""The thirteenth Warrior"" attempted in regards to the Beowulf legend, while still including the strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and magical super-strength.
