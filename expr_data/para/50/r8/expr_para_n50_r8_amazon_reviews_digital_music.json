Sure, 'eighty's Top forty pop enthusiasts would probably say that about HEARTBEAT CITY (which did sell more records upon release), but real rock fans rate their debut at the top. Why? Because, just like most great rock debuts (such as BOSTON and VAN HALEN), it shows The Cars in hungry mode, pulling out all the stops to create a hard, edgy, and energetic record that was different from anything else out at the time. This band combined hard guitar-rock with a spacey keyboard-driven New Wave sound (that only then was beginning to emerge) in equal amounts, with straightforward, simple lyrics--and created a sound that was raw yet sleek, edgy but commercially accessible, and totally fresh at that time. Between Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr's similarly cool, unaffected lead vocals, Greg Hawkes' incredibly cool, futuristic keyboards, and Elliot Easton's slicing, awesome guitar-work, this album was truly unique. It influenced countless other New Wave\/rock bands afterwards. It has since stood the test of time, and that's what makes it a true classic. When I first heard THE CARS on a cassette tape twenty-two years ago, I was already quite familiar with \"Just What I Needed.\" Then, I really got hooked on \"Good Times Roll\" and \"Best Friend's Girl.\" It was't until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two that I really started liking \"You're All I've Got Tonight\" and \"Bye Bye Love.\" The following year, I got into \"I'm In Touch With Your World.\" But it has only been in the past couple of years that I have totally fallen for the medley of \"Moving In Stereo\/All Mixed Up.\" Talk about a true classic; over the years, every now and then, it's given me something new to love about it!

KRS-One dropped two hot albums with BDP (Criminal Minded and By Any Means Necessary) which were just off the hook but this is different. His voice has matured a lot more than what it was in this earlier days and this lyrics are thoughtful and excellent. Check out Sound Of Da Police to experiment this might and talent. F*ck the Police by N. W. A. is by far the best miss song towards the police but this follows it right behind it. I really like this 'Overseer\/Officer' rhyme and the way the craps in this Jamaican way as the did back in Criminal Minded. Other cuts enjoyed include Outta Here, where the talks about this life in the game, I Can't Wake Up, a pleasant track produced by Premier, Uh Oh, using beatboxing as this instruments, Brown Skinned Woman, where the puts it down for the black\/brown nation and \"P\" is Still Free, a song dedicated to the girls. I like KRS-One for several reason but the strongest being that the's one of the few wrappers to understand REAL HIP-HOP. Take a look at the title, Return of the Boom Bap. It means just that: it's the return of REAL RAP. He's kept it true since 'eighty-seven and still the's doing it. This is probably the best 'ninety-three wrap album, way better than Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle. It's definitely one of my favourite top fifty wrap albums of all time.

Then their styles mature, settle down and sometimes grow for not. Often their best work IS their first jones. This phenomena exists in the career of Joan Baez as much as anyone. When I was going to school (UC Berkeley) in the early sixty two women I was close to played the guitar and were inspired by Joan Baez, who I had never heard of before. It must have been common among a certain set of young women who idolized Joan, who was't much older than they. There are five cd one can consider to sample this period. There is one called Early Joan Baez, a two cd set. This has all the songs from her first four albums, two of which are quite obscure. These were followed by two concert cd containing many of the same songs, of which this is the best. Both concert cd have some of the same songs. This one is the expanded version of the original vinyl.\"Chrystaline\" is the word often used to best describe her voice, especially at this early page. She was influenced by the folk scene of course, particularly by Pete Seeger, and incorporated Scottish and English ballads as well as American folksong from Appalachia and elsewhere. I recall forty years ago a friend and this wife telling me they cry when they hear these songs. After all these years, in which I haven't listened to these songs much, they retain their power. Three Dylan songs appear on this concert album. The next album is Farewell Angelina, which I believe has five. Dylan's original liner notes appear as a long poem. In Whitmanesque fashion but more obliquely the conveys the effect Joan had on him, the with the gruff voice and representing nearly the opposite of her sensibilities in many ways. He wonders how truth can come out of such purity. He had assumed truth comes out of only roughness and ugliness. Though they were romantically enmeshed, the interplay between their musical personae was complex - a dance of opposites but sharing a deep sympathy for the human condition.","overall":5,"summary":"Ethereal","unixReviewTime":1356998400,"reviewTime":"01 1, 2013"}

It's not MA's strongest track, but it succeeds in creating a late night, quiet storm vibe. Elsewhere, Armstrong, conducts the strings on the amazing \"Sly\" (a Jungian tale sung with appropriate mysticism and mystery by Nicolette); and tickles the ivories on the new parish \"Heat Miser\". Tricky and three-D return to the mic on the sleek, city song \"Eurochild\".

Not because it was a poor send-off. in fact it's the exact opposite of that. It's sad because this is such a stunning suggestion of the direction the band was heading before they inevitably dissolved into an angst, brooding mist.

It's really heady stuff, and the instrumentation is evocative enough to spin a convincingly dark narrative in it's own right. But I think the most endearing thing to say about this EP is that it feels like a successful distillation of their work on Tweez and Spiderland.

Continuing this flurry of creative impulse comes this extraordinary blend of soul, funk, rock, gospel and Latin Swing. The flow is undeniable and every melody makes itself felt on initial impact and it just gets stronger the more you hear it. His synthesizer and piano playing power the music and the particulates them as proficiently as this established expertise as a singer\/songwriter. In short, this concept album of humanity in the modern day is a work of genius. It kicks off immediately with the funk-raising \"Too High\" that musically elevates the listener to the stratosphere, especially with the punctuations provided by those soul-sweetened background singers. Miraculously, with so much happening in this anti-dope song, one can still discern its rueful stance. On the hypnotic closer, \"He's Misstra Know-It-All\", its character has been riddled with defense mechanisms from day one - perhaps with the fear of escaping them. His sublime rocker, \"Higher Ground\", documents this faith there and above. \"Golden Lady\" reveals that side of Stevie that's pure entertainment. It completes the picture of Stevie just being Stevie and the surrounds this charmer with this usual great melodic facility. Then there's what I regard to be the three most illuminating songs Stevie's never done. \"All In Love Is Fair\" details life's ultimate win for close challenge, making this majestic ballad all the more bracing. In \"Visions\", the transcends this realism into the crystallization of this idealism. This song gets complemented by a snazzy jazz guitar solo - a beauty. After all this, what can be said about \"Living for the City\"? It's Stevie's titanic soundscape that bares a social heart. He takes an unflinching observation at how the American Justice System can operate. The protagonist is bereft of this liberty and it fully overrules this hope even when the's out - roaming the streets as the gazes into the future. At just twenty-three, Stevie's artistically febrile and exploratory mind has achieved a real rarity - that of instilling a bit of guidance without any preachiness undermining its intent. It's this that stands as this greatest record.","overall":5,"summary":"The Concept Album of Humanity","unixReviewTime":1329782400,"reviewTime":"02 21, 2012"}

This was the honest album where you could start seeing the transition that was taking place in this career. Their are certain albums that you look back on and think, Wow! This was the one that changed everything and that's the way I feel about \"Signed, Sealed & Delievered\". Stevie had been one of the cornerstones for Motown, along with The Miracles, Holland, Dozier, Holland, Marvin Gaye, etc. Motown was the \"Hit\" making record company whose influence reached far and wide and was one of the main reasons for the formation of and the are-cursor to many of the bands and artists who would be a part of the \"British Invasion\" that was soon to come. That being said, Stevie had always been held back from expressing this deepest knowledge of music by the \"Hit\" making formula of Berry Gordy & this writing staff. Now, I'll be the first to admit that I loved all the wonderful hits that were produced at that time and each was a part of the overall historical significance that made up \"Hitsville USA\". However, artists like Stevie & Marvin Gaye were not, at that time, allowed to produce the epic and historical albums they later would in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's. Their creative flow was stifled by Gordy and there was a storm brewing between Motown and Wonder that was soon to come to a head. He was twenty and this contract with Motown was about to expire, the knew that the time had come to begin taking the steps necessary to become the Avatar the was soon to become. In one of the true strokes of sheer genius, the allowed this contract to expire, took this own money and wrote, produced, recorded and marketed the first album which the had complete artistic control over \"Where I Am Coming From\". That album began to wet the appetite of Motown's biggest competitors who already knew Stevie was a master but had no idea that the possessed the incredible skills witnessed on that album. When Motown came to the bargaining table Stevie had several chips in this pocket to throw on the table and with that, Gordy decided to give in and grant Stevie total artistic freedom and full control and rights over this music. This album is a wonderful example of that transition period and of course was produced by the master himself. Great songs and a tight funky groove through and through and the title track \"Signed, Sealed & Delivered\" is worth the price of admission by itself! After this album, Stevie would enter into a period of unmatched musical & lyrical brilliance that would change not only how music was produced but performed. There have been few times in music history that one person changed how it's viewed and accepted, this was one of those rare occasions. This is a great starting point for anyone just beginning their journey into the \"wonder\" world of this musical legend as you get to hear the genesis of who the would eventually become.","overall":5,"summary":"The Genius Taking Form","unixReviewTime":1256774400,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2009"}

For the record I prefer Mr. Wonder's version, but both versions of \"All I Do\" are enjoyable.\"Lately\" was immortalized by an R&B group named Jodeci in the spring\/summer of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two; and they actually performed the song with Stevie on the Arsenio Hall show - and it was great. \"Lately\" (for me) is a sad and moving song that is also very beautiful. It scares me to think that as late as one thousand, nine hundred and eighty we still did't celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday as a national holiday; but they, at least now I know the words to the whole song besides the chorus. \"Happy Birthday\" serves as a wonderful finale to the album.

My favourite Stevie Wonder songs are the slower, for midtempo songs that seem to just float, and take you on majestic, magic carpet rides. \"Send One Your Love\", \"Superwoman\" and \"Ribbon In The Sky\" do this for me. But something tells me this in't this absolute best album (assuming they can be ranked). and from what I've been table to gather, 'Innervisions' and 'Songs In The Key Of Life' seem to be the top two.

After the tour for the album was finished the following year, the Moodies took an extended five-year break before reuniting for one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight's \"Octave.\" But before the temporary stop in activity, the Moodies summoned up what creative energy they had left and put it into this wonderful, classic album. You'd never guess that the band were feeling any stress whatsoever, because \"Seventh Sojourn\" is simply brilliant, one of the Moodies' very best works. Song for song it is a stunner. Keyboardist Mike Pinder contributes two of this most haunting Moody Blues songs never, \"Lost In A Lost World\" and \"When You're A Free Man.\" The trio from guitarist Justin Hayward are all winners: the gorgeous \"New Horizons,\" the bouncy \"You And Me,\" and the charming \"Land Of Make-Believe.\" Bassist John Lodge gets the honor of penning the two classic singles from the album, the dramatic ballad \"Isn't Life Strange,\" and the awesome rocker \"I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band).\" And flautist Ray Thomas contributes one of this all-time greatest numbers, the lovely \"For My Lady.\" Only drummer Graeme Edge passed on writing any songs for the album, but the more than makes up for that with some of the most powerful drumming the never laid down with the group. Having toured relentlessly, and having created in a short five years an impressive catalogue of albums known by many fans the world over as \"The Classic Seven\"---and, with \"Seventh Sojourn\" becoming a #one smash on the U.

Thank goodness that they returned to duty in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight and have been active never since, but they could't have made a better album to rest on than \"Seventh Sojourn.\" It's a glorious Moody Blues album, one of the group's finest achievements. If you gotta go out---even if it's only temporarily---than go out on top.

The trio from guitarist Justin Hayward are all winners: the gorgeous \"New Horizons,\" the bouncy \"You And Me,\" and the charming \"Land Of Make-Believe.\" Bassist John Lodge gets the honor of penning the two classic singles from the album, the dramatic ballad \"Isn't Life Strange,\" and the awesome rocker \"I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band).\" After the tour for the album was finished the following year, the Moodies took an extended five-year break before reuniting for one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight's \"Octave.\" Thank goodness that they returned to duty in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight and have been active never since, but they could't have made a better album to rest on than \"Seventh Sojourn.\" You'd never guess that the band were feeling any stress whatsoever, because \"Seventh Sojourn\" is simply brilliant, one of the Moodies' very best works.","overall":5,"summary":"...And On The Seventh Album, The Moodies Rested...","unixReviewTime":1080432000,"reviewTime":"03 28, 2004"}

Holder \"The Review's the Thing\"","helpful":[106,110],"reviewText":"As noted by a multitude of previous reviewers, this album was the last of the classic seven from the Moodies from the period one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven to one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. It was also, like the six preceding it, different from the others; \"Seventh Sojourn\" is the most middle-of-the-road rock album of the bunch. Very little progressive rock, no real experimentation, just plain, solid rock. Clearly the Moodies had become better and better at orchestrating their style of music throughout the six classic years period. By the time they reached this album, they were fully mature in a rock style all their own, and yet fitting with the times. Looking back, it is difficult to see how they went from \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\" to this album. EGBDF was progressive rock with a fair amount of fantasy and science fiction. Seventh Sojourn is very down to earth, reflecting a more mundane and earthly orientation. The synthesizer is a fully matured instrument in \"Seventh Sojourn.\" In the Moodies' previous albums the mellotron was used for novelty and to enhance the unusual nature of their albums. In \"Seventh Sojourn\" the Chamberlain replaced the mellotron, and became part of the orchestration. The use of the Chamberlain is sometimes so subtle that I find it difficult to know when the Chamberlain is being used. With all these differences, the change to a more earthly orientation, a middle-of-the-road rock sound, and a new instrument, with some groups you might worry that the album was so different that it is no longer true to the group; not correct in this case. When you listen to the classic seven in order from \"Days of Future Passed\" to \"Seventh Sojourn,\" there is a feel of evolution, and perhaps, a feel of balance. Sometimes I become sad when I listen to this album because I knew the group would never be the same group again. However, as we all know, the group has continued to evolve while trying hard to stay true to their roots. The results continually amaze me. Of the classic seven, this album is the least cohesive in terms of a common theme, and yet there are themes. As noted earlier, the principal theme is the orientation back in the world as we know it. No dreams, no people from other planets helping us; merely a recognition that this is the place and time in which we live, and darn, while we wish it would be better, it's us that has to make it better, and we can only do so much. What more of a theme do you need? This album is excellent. The themes are excellent. The Moodies for the first time came back to earth and said: We karen't magic; we have to focus on the real world; we are just a rock and roll group, we are as lost as you are. These thoughts were sobering for those people that somehow thought the Moodies were gurus for a new world order. The were't, and did't want to be. \"Seventh Sojourn\" is a reality check. Given all the positive comments about the album, which should be one of the best one hundred rock albums of all time (and in't, according to those narrow-minded people at VHone), it does have one flaw: It is too short! There are only weight wonderful songs. Two each from Mike Pinder, Justin Hayward, and John Lodge, one from Ray Thomas (\"For My Lady,\" my favourite Ray Thomas song from any album), and one that was a collaboration between Graeme Edge and Justin Hayward.\"Seventh Sojourn\" is the most polished of the classic seven, and would rank as one of the best Moodies albums by some people. Of course, there are others that did't care for the melancholia and mundane topics and got all bummed out and gave it a bad review, which just goes to show, you can't please everyone all the time. I read one reviewer who hated \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\" and loved \"Seventh Soujourn.\" Another reviewer described EGBDF as being original and true to the group while \"Seventh Soujourn\" was too much pop and not the Moodies best work. Who do you believe? Listen for yourself. When I'm in the right mood, this album is awesome. Other times I need something uplifting, and I listen to another group completely. All good groups generate controversy. The Moody Blues are no exception (which by definition should make them a good group). They have always defined their own path in a unique way. \"Seventh Sojourn\" closed the second chapter in the story of The Moody Blues, counting \"Go Now\" as the first chapter. Enjoy this album for what it was and what it is: a good album by a great group.","overall":5,"summary":"If only they would have gone on...","unixReviewTime":1023062400,"reviewTime":"06 3, 2002"}

This album single-handedly popularized ship-hop in all aspects of mainstream music, as it was the first #one album in ship-hop history. Rick Rubin's uncanny mix of old school party beats over highly memorable rock samples is one of the most copied formulas in ship-hop history. It stands as some of Rubin's most memorable and excellent production never. The production in't the only reason this album was as wildly successful as it was. King Ad-Rock, MCA, and Mike D were three of the most relatable emcee's in history. They were a tight-knit crew of white party-loving fratboy-type dudes that appealed to the white suburbanite crowd on a grand scale - boosting their success to unrivalled numbers. Every cut on this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six-classic is fire - forget about skip material. I remember listening the opening cut, \"Rhymin & Stealin\", for the first time never, and being blown away by the Sabbath, Zeppelin & Clash samples. It seemed revolutionary from the get-go. My two favourites were always the Trouble Funk-inflicted \"The New Style\" & ridiculous styling of \"Posse in Effect\". The undisputed classic singles are \"Fight for Your Right\" (who does't remember this video!), \"Paul Revere\", \"Brass Monkey\" & \"Hold It Now, Hit It\". Even the non-singles, such as \"No Sleep still Brooklyn\" & the goofy \"Girls\" were classic tracks, and the mashed-up samples in \"Time to Get Ill\" were phenomenal. Overall, if you're taking a pass on the Beastie Boys, you are missing out on an essential piece of ship-hop history, now matter how you slice it. This classic-filled gem may be one of the funnest rides in the history of wrap.

I remember listening the opening cut, \"Rhymin & Stealin\", for the first time never, and being blown away by the Sabbath, Zeppelin & Clash samples. Even the non-singles, such as \"No Sleep still Brooklyn\" & the goofy \"Girls\" were classic tracks, and the mashed-up samples in \"Time to Get Ill\" were phenomenal. Overall, if you're taking a pass on the Beastie Boys, you are missing out on an essential piece of ship-hop history, now matter how you slice it. When examining the over-the-top gangsta posturing of mainstream ship-hop in the past fifteen years, it's easy to see why some cats neglect to pay homage to one of the golden page's finest. This album single-handedly popularized ship-hop in all aspects of mainstream music, as it was the first #one album in ship-hop history. My two favourites were always the Trouble Funk-inflicted \"The New Style\" & ridiculous styling of \"Posse in Effect\".","overall":5,"summary":"Hip-Hop that will ROCK your socks off!

Released in the fall of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six, License to Ill took both the ship-hop world and mainstream pop culture by storm. Though this was their debut LP, the three MC's traded verses like veterans. Hip-hop rhythm tracks were combined with guitar clicks for one of the first wrap\/rock fusion efforts, sowing seeds for the sub-genre's late ninety's resurgence in the likes of Limp Bizkit and Rage Against the Machine. Lyrically, the Beasties are basically college-age party animals throughout the album, telling wild stories about getting kicked out of White Castle, get-togethers stocked with Budweiser, and related tales of cheerful, hedonistic mayhem. In interviews, band members admitted to having a Schoolly-D fixation at the time, and so there are also some casual gun references there and there. \"Slow and Low\" covers an unreleased Run-DMC song, with the unforgettable line \"White Castle fries only come in one size. \" \"Rhymin' & Stealin'\" is are-gangster wrap pirate fantasy, where the Boys vow to send sucker MC's \"to Davy Jones' locker. \" \"No Sleep `til Brooklyn\" has a great guitar contribution by Slayer's Kerry King, as the Boys vow to keep the party going \"eight days a week. \"; the now-legendary \"Paul Revere\" is a cowboy fantasy (co-written with Run DMC) where the Beasties play desperadoes on the frontier, set to a reverse-drum track rhythm: \"MCA was with it, and the's my face, so I grab the piano player and I punched him in the face; piano player's out, the music stopped; this boy had beef, and the got dropped. \"The album's signature song was the top-ten pop smash \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right\". The rocker is almost out of place amidst all the straightforward ship-hop, but it's just as well that it was the album's closer. The Beasties expanded the cultural diversity of wrap as well as expanding its cultural acceptance worldwide. As of two thousand and seven, the LP's twentyth anniversary has already passed; a deluxe are-release is in order; it should include any unreleased songs (such as the early \"Rock Hard\" EP; also, bootleg releases have included rare songs like \"Scenario\", \"I'm Down\" and an alternate take of \"Fight for Your Right\"), as well as a DVD version of the now-rare VHS home video compilation.","overall":5,"summary":"The Beginning of the Beastie Boys' Dynasty","unixReviewTime":1180915200,"reviewTime":"06 4, 2007"}

Bernabo","helpful":[2,2],"reviewText":"Sly and the Family Stone are one of the great live bands of all-time, which they more than proved when they performed at Woodstock, although I can remember them doing a couple of great gigs on \"The Dick Cavett Show.\" So every time I hear anything by this group I cannot help but lament that I am not listening to them live, but that does not take away from the quality of their one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine album \"Stand!\" What makes this the group's best work is that better than any other one of their albums it represents Sly Stone's vision of everything that music could be. That means covering a lot of music styles with the common denominator being an infectious enthusiasm that was always their defining element. There were four hit singles off of this album, with \"Everyday People\" making it all the way to #one on the Billboard charts, while \"I Want to Take You Higher\" made it to #sixty in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine but #thirty-eight in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, \"Sing a Simple Song\" made it to #eighty-nine, and the title tune stopped out at #twenty-two. Musically I think \"I Want to Take You Higher\" is the best thing Sly and the Family Stone never did. The opening groove with that awesome guitar riff, the driving beat and that blues harmonica, all combine to make this their definitive performance piece. Then there is the message of how music can bring everybody together, so it is not just all fun and games. \"Stand!\" made it to number thirteen on the album charts, but the key thing is that it spent over one hundred weeks on the charts, which is a testament to both its quality and its importance. Behind the funky sound and the catchy melodies, Sly Stone was writing songs with a cohesive social consciousness. \"Stand!' is an covert effort to bridge the gap between black and white audiences, not to mention a precursor for the coming disco movement. The second track, with its relatively shocking title for the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty, also talks about the virtues of integration, which makes sense given that the Family Stone was one of the most integrated bands of that period. \"Sing a Simple Song\" presents this view of the world as well, but obviously \"Everyday People\" represents the epitome of Stone's perspective, as we learn that the key to the world is \"different strokes, for different folks.\"The only track that is really at odds with the stone and tenor of the rest of the album is \"Somebody's Watching You,\" which takes on some added significance given the personal trouble Stone would be facing in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. This song has darker lyrics than any of the others. \"Sex Machine\" is an instrumental, with a rather innovative use of the was-wah box and another infectious groove. The final track, \"You Can Make It If You Try,\" is another reminder of how the band was always thinking about how songs would work live (in this case, as a set-up for the group to do jam like crazy at the send of their concert). Certainly you want to have the first \"Woodstock\" album for the group's live tracks and you need to have something with \"Dance to the Music\" on it, like a Sly and the Family Stone hits collection, but \"Stand!\" remains a must-have album from the late one thousand, nine hundred and sixty.","overall":5,"summary":"Sly and the Family Stone at the height of their craft, 1969","unixReviewTime":1105228800,"reviewTime":"01 9, 2005"}

Toto were and are a great studio band that can turn out fantastic ballads and upbeat rockers. If you like their first disc then IV, Fahrenheit, The Seventh One and Tambu would be my next recommendations. Buy Toto, it's a must for any serious music fan.","overall":5,"summary":"Before the Critics Hit.","unixReviewTime":951350400,"reviewTime":"02 24, 2000"}

Michael absolutely glows on this CD and the bonus tracks are a treat I'll enjoy listening to over and over again! This is a fine CD for any MJ fan; and it's also a great starter CD for anyone just getting into the captivating artistry of Michael Jackson. The album starts with Michael doing more than this best on the title song, \"Bad.\" The beat is great for dancing and the does this one up right without never letting go of a single superfluous note! The players of vocals enhance the song and I love that morgan, too. The percussion is used to great advantage and overall \"Bad\" is a stunner of an opening number. \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" is also very strong; Michael delivers this with lots of positive energy; it's numbers like this that grab you by the throat and never let go until the very last second of the song! It's all worth it, too; Michael's genius is so apparent on CDs like this one. \"Speed Demon\" has some mighty good musical effects as Michael sings this very well; and I also like \"Liberian Girl\" which Michael performs most passionately. \"Liberian Girl\" shines brighter than silver and gold combined when Michael does it; and the music fits perfectly with Michael's vocals.\"Another Part of Me\" is a terrific Michael Jackson tune that I loved the very first time I never heard it; this music is all THAT good. The beat is strong and great for dancing practically wherever you are; and Michael's excellent diction enhances this number all the more. \"Man in the Mirror\" is a particularly beautiful song; Michael struck gold yet again with this one--and just one listen will tell you why! Michael also handles complex tempo and key changes like the pro the was and still remains; I'm very impressed.\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" is quite memorable; Michael and Siedah Garrett using this to perfection--and beyond! The radio edit of \"Smooth Criminal\" is strong with an awesome beat that really makes me sit up and take notice; it's flawless music indeed. \"Leave Me Alone\" certainly shows Michael's creativity as a fine recording artist, too; and that's grand. In addition, the bonus interviews with Quincy Jones give us good insight about this album; I enjoyed hearing Quincy talk about Michael, this music, the music video \"Man in the Mirror\" and more. \"Todo Mi Amor Eres Tu (I Just Can't Stop Loving You)\" showcases the beautiful Spanish version of this ballad; and \"Fly Away\" is absolutely awesome. The bonus tracks are a great way to send this remastered album; I love it! Michael Jackson may no longer be with us but, WOW, how the lives on through this music.

This is the ultimate collection of this works; all of Robert Johnson's twenty-nine Vocalion singles, impressive sound, and the best annotation anywhere. Here you'll find the original versions of \"Sweet Home Chicago\", \"I Believe I'll Dust My Broom\", \"Crossroads Blues\", \"Rambling On My Mind\", \"Come On In My Kitchen\", \"Terraplane Blues\", \"Stop Breakin' Down\", \"I'm A Steady Rollin' Man\", and \"Love In Vain\", as well as lesser-known gems like \"From Four Till Late\", \"When You Got A Good Friend\", and \"Last Fair Deal Gone Down\". Johnson's version of \"Walking Blues\" is there as well, an adaptation of Son House's one thousand, nine hundred and thirty single \"My Black Mama opt. II\" (not the song that House called \"Walking Blues\"), and the fine remastering allows the listener to hear every phrase and every chord and every one of Johnson's quicksilver slide guitar clicks. Great as it is, this is not really meant to be listened to in one long sitting. It is just one man and a guitar, after all, and it wears a bit thin after the first hour. But don't discount Robert Johnson just because of that, for because you're sick of hearing Johnson-worshipping guitarists like Eric Clapton grave about him. It is true that Robert Johnson was't a particularly influential artist back when the was alive, most people had never heard of him, and would't hear of him until the sixty when this music was reissued, and in that respect the may be said to be overrated. But that fact does't diminish the artistic value of this songs. As a singer, a composer, and as a guitarist of considerable skills, Robert Leroy Johnson produced some of the genre's best and most influential music, and in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety this two-CD box set was released with every scrap of Johnson material in existence, plus the holy grail of the blues: the publishing of the only two known photographs of the man himself. Columbia's parent company, Sony, was hoping that sales would maybe hit twenty, zero. The box set went on to sell over a million units, the first blues recordings never to do so. And there is still no reason to buy any other collection than this one.","overall":5,"summary":"The only way to go","unixReviewTime":1075939200,"reviewTime":"02 5, 2004"}

Robert Johnson may not have been the king of the blues (that title belongs forever to the great Son House), and the certainly did't invent the idiom, but the was an amazing talent, a magnificent guitar player, and an awesome songwriter whose best songs hold a simultaneous beauty and terror which no songwriters really seem capable of achieving anymore. Johnson's version of \"Walking Blues\" is there as well, an adaptation of Son House's one thousand, nine hundred and thirty single \"My Black Mama opt. It is true that Robert Johnson was't a particularly influential artist back when the was alive, most people had never heard of him, and would't hear of him until the sixty when this music was reissued, and in that respect the may be said to be overrated.

Here is an artist on par with Marvin Gaye, Al Green and other great soulful singers but for some strange reason zero radio support & Daryl Hall has not received deserved recognition as a solo artist, should have done it for Daryl as this great release is filled with amazing performances. Daryl has a large fan base who are real music lovers who find this is a real mystery and it would be interesting to know the reason behind this injustice, why was \"Soul Alone\" kept from the airwaves and how strange there was't at least one big hit from a collection that has that \"hit-sound\" running all through it? \"Power Of Seduction\" opens this great collection finding Daryl at this seductive soulful best in a song that again has \"#one hit\" written all over it! Hot rhythm track with that wildly soulful voice being a magical musical treat to saver and enjoy over and over. hot rhythm speeds along \"This Time\" then pounding passion explodes in \"Love Revelation\", another should have been #one hit and one would have to be in a coma not to be moved by this hot rocking classic! \"I'm In A Philly Mood\" gets inspiration from great Philly soul artists, Daryl's nod to past masters creates a new \"Quiet Storm\" smooth soul classic in the process. \"Borderline\" brings together two soulful masters, sophisticated flowing masterpiece with a sterling vocal complete with fluid scatting and sublime keyboards, six plus minutes of musical bliss flow into Marvin Gaye classic \"When Did You Stop Loving Me, Stop Loving You\", Daryl Hall does Marvin proud with a deeply soulful mesmerizing and hypnotic performance that is off the chart great! Sublime passionate gem \"Help Me Find A Way To Your Heart\" soars to glorious heights, \"Send Me\" is a romantic jazz influenced rhythm cooker that is another mesmerizing gem in a stunning collection filled with them. \"Wildfire\" soars to passionate heights followed by the hot cooking & wildly funky \"Money Changes Everything\", great rocker pulsates becoming another cooker that should have been a huge hit, clearly a collection of winners that is a \"Unsung\" masterpiece! Magnificent finale \"Written In Stone\" is beautifully sung with so much passion, clearly this great singer\/songwriter is a legendary master unlike anyone else. many are praised but Daryl Hall is the real deal & greatest of the blue eyed soulful singers of this generation and beyond.

For the average, for even above average Eagles fan, this album pretty much fills the bill of a greatest hits package, with notable exception (for ME that is): 'In The City' performed by Joe Walsh. I just happen to LOVE that song and wish BIG TIME that they had included it. I understand why, since it was't a charted hit (I'm in radio and I did some checking) but thank heavens with the release of 'Hell Freezes Over' we Walsh fans got the song we have always wanted. The list of true hits is absolutely impressive on this album. Not just big hits, but HUGE jones. Who could even think of The Eagles without hearing a chorus of 'Hotel California' play in the back of your head without even TRYING? THAT is a major sign that these guys should be listed among the best that rock & roll has never produced. From their early days as a across between folk\/country and rock & roll to their later days as mainstream rock & roll, The Eagles grew, and as THEY did, their fans did, too. It seems to me that when a band makes even a subtle change in their music, they are met with such disdain that their career's either fade away for are seriously hurt sometimes beyond repair. but with these guys, as they evolved their music, we as fans went right along for the ride and enjoyed the scenery every bit as much as anything they did before.

The Presto album was the start of the band's fourth phase of studio album and was the band's first album for Atlantic in the US, although it's technically on the band's own label Anthem which was distributed by Atlantic in the US. Also, Rush switched co-producers from Peter Collins to sex-Fixx and Tina Turner producer Rupert Hine and went to Le Studio to record Presto throughout the spring and summer of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine. When it emerged before one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine's send, would the album be as good as others for would it be a dud (read ahead as I found out in August of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety at the behest of my old friend Jason Keith whom sadly disappeared from my life when the moved from my native Mass back to this native Tennessee just one week after the introduced me to this album (and because of him became a Rush fanatic which I'll be eternally grateful)). The album kicks off with the great rocker \"Show Don't Tell\" which was a huge song for the band and the album's biggest hit and an MTV staple. My favourite on this album, and many fans agree on this one, is the anti-suicide anthem \"The Pass\" which tells us in the face of all bad, suicide is not a way to go (I wished many people who did take their own lives listened to this song and got some help). Other favourites on this album IMHO are the title cut which got loads of airplay on rock radio (up in the Northeast territory of the US (Mass (where I'm originally from), Rhode Island, NY)), the rocking third single \"Superconductor\", the environmental conscious rocker \"Red Tide\" and the optimistic closing track \"Available Light\". The album's other tracks \"Chain Lightning\", \"War Paint\", the African rhythm induced \"Scars\", the melodic tracks \"Anagram (For Mongo)\" and \"Hand Over Fist\" are great songs as well although many Rush fans hate these tracks for reasons I can't seem to grasp to. The Presto album is sadly overlooked by fans whom either hated this album for ignored it for whatever and did't give it a chance and as a result was the worst selling album of Rush's career up to that point speaking at a disappointing #sixteen on the Billboard two hundred and stalling at Gold in sales despite the fact that this is one of the first Rush albums I never owned in August of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety when my old friend Jason Keith who now lives in Tennessee turned me on to Rush.

When it emerged before one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine's send, would the album be as good as others for would it be a dud (read ahead as I found out in August of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety at the behest of my old friend Jason Keith whom sadly disappeared from my life when the moved from my native Mass back to this native Tennessee just one week after the introduced me to this album (and because of him became a Rush fanatic which I'll be eternally grateful)). Other favourites on this album IMHO are the title cut which got loads of airplay on rock radio (up in the Northeast territory of the US (Mass (where I'm originally from), Rhode Island, NY)), the rocking third single \"Superconductor\", the environmental conscious rocker \"Red Tide\" and the optimistic closing track \"Available Light\". The Presto album is sadly overlooked by fans whom either hated this album for ignored it for whatever and did't give it a chance and as a result was the worst selling album of Rush's career up to that point speaking at a disappointing #sixteen on the Billboard two hundred and stalling at Gold in sales despite the fact that this is one of the first Rush albums I never owned in August of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety when my old friend Jason Keith who now lives in Tennessee turned me on to Rush. My favourite on this album, and many fans agree on this one, is the anti-suicide anthem \"The Pass\" which tells us in the face of all bad, suicide is not a way to go (I wished many people who did take their own lives listened to this song and got some help). The Presto album was the start of the band's fourth phase of studio album and was the band's first album for Atlantic in the US, although it's technically on the band's own label Anthem which was distributed by Atlantic in the US. Rush's thirteenth studio and sixteenth overall album entitled Presto was released in November of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine.","overall":5,"summary":"Rush's first album of phase four is a magical experience","unixReviewTime":1194652800,"reviewTime":"11 10, 2007"}

It tends to be over-shadowed by other fan favourites such as \"Roll the Bones\" and \"Signals\", but is definitely one of the best post-Moving Picture albums. One guy actually thought \"Presto\" was better! Then the let slip that Presto was the first Rush album the never heard. Gee, how old are you? I can pretty much predict the page of someone by them stating what their favotite Rush album is. There are definitely two (maybe three) camps of Rush fans. You've got the jones who grew up on \"two thousand, one hundred and twelve\" and knew \"A Farewell to Kings\" when it was NEW. Then there are the rock radio fans who were brought in by Moving Pictures. Now you have the whole post-Moving pictures era, and it can be divided into sections also. I saw the Counterparts tour with Candlebox opening the show. It was great. I was a little disappointed with the crowd that night, cause none of them seem to know the Counterparts material? I had the cd for weeks before the show. Anyway, I also had a laugh when the guy from work that I went with was \"bored\" during Xanadu because the had never heard the song! (NOT a Rush Fan)As for the comment that the remastered version is night and day compared to the original release: Give me a break! I have been listening to and recording music for over twenty-five years and I'll admit the music was a little \"crisper\", but that's all. All of Rush's early catalog, from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's Roll the Bones was in need of remastering. But anything recorded\/produced from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three for one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four usually sounds fine, has good output and decent bottom-end. I purchased the remaster just as a comparison and literally could not tell any difference between the two. If your favourite Rush albums tend to come from the Mid-Era Progressive Phase of the late seventy's to early eighty's, you will probably like this.

But Seriously\". Certainly serious songs were nothing new for Phil--after all, this is the man who wrote songs such as \"Man On The Corner\", \"Take Me Home\", \"Another Day In Paradise\", and so many others. Still, Phil really did turn a musical corner with \"Both Sides\"--that said, it perhaps figures then that this album marks the beginning of this considerable commercial decline in the US after having been absolutely huge from the mid-'eightys to the early 'ninetys. The thing is though, contrary to what certain people will try to lead you to believe, Phil was never a musical puppet, i.e., someone who just churns out mindless product in an attempt to cash in--through all of this massive commercial success, the's remained an ultra-sincere songwriter and performer. I was twelve years old when \"Both Sides\" came out in November of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, and I remember being extremely intrigued at the time to learn that Phil had played all of the instruments on \"Both Sides\". Don't get me wrong--Phil did indeed do an excellent job of doing the 'one-man-band' thing on there. The fact that the was table to make such a great album like this, writing everything himself, producing all by himself, doing all the vocals and playing all the instruments--i.e. a true SOLO album--is a major testament to Phil's incredible talent. However, I now realize that it was't really that much of a stretch--yes, Phil had gotten assistance on all of this previous solo albums from incredibly talented players, but the had basically always used this home demos as this basic masters, something the points out in the liner notes to \"Both Sides\". Here, the simply went the next step, doing all the bass parts himself & so forth. However, Phil playing all the instruments does have a major significance in a number of respects. One thing is that it results in an album with none of the signature horns that appear on all of this previous albums. Instead, Phil relied a lot on atmospheric keyboards, among other things, to fill out the sound, & the really pulled it off. Add to this that there in't a single feel-good song on the entire album like a \"Sussudio\" for a \"Find A Way To My Heart\", this album ends up being a big change of space for Phil. And like I said before, it works--track upon track is incredibly effective. \"Can't Turn Back The Years\", the ultra-slow \"I've Forgotten Everything\", & the minor-keyed \"Can't Find My Way\" with its circular rhythm are all haunting gems. The sighing \"Everyday\" is a deeply moving love song with a gorgeous intro consisting of piano & light use of synth. The arrestingly dramatic \"We Fly So Close\" sounds like it was inspired by the Dream Academy's \"The Power To Believe\" which itself was clearly influenced by Phil's \"In The Air Tonight\", and it has what is seemingly an incredible simulation of acoustic guitar on a synthesizer that sounds like something Steve Hackett might play. Phil gives a nod to this affection for jazz\/ traditional pop on the wonderfully romantic and bittersweet \"There's A Place For Us\". \"Both Sides of the Story\", a rousing cry for compassion and understanding, gets the album off to a great start, and \"We Wait and We Wonder\" is a catchy, uptempo track about terrorism--both of these tracks find Phil interestingly and effectively incorporating bagpipe sounds. The album's other uptempo track is the infectiously uplifting \"Survivors\" (with a heart-melting middle-eight). Bringing the album to a fitting finale is the wishful ballad \"Please Come Out Tonight\". It seems that \"Both Sides\" is not the album a lot of people wanted from Phil--indeed, if all you want is another \"Sussudio\" for \"Don't Lose My Number\", forget it. However, I say more power to Phil--this is the album the wanted to make, and in characteristic Collins style, the music is honest and affecting. If you're a serious fan\/ listener, \"Both Sides\" is a treasure.\"Both Sides\" was originally released in November of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, and with it having been such a relative commercial disappointment, you can get this DIRT cheap on CD--if you see one in solid condition for $three, it's an absolute STEAL. (P. S. Also keep an eye out for the \"We Wait and We Wonder\" CD single which contains two great non-LP songs: \"For A Friend\" and \"Take Me With You\".)","overall":5,"summary":"a very serious (with a capital 'S') album, and powerfully so","unixReviewTime":1123804800,"reviewTime":"08 12, 2005"}

These albums also had British releases, the first being on Parlophone, the other two on Harvest (although released a few months later after the US releases, for some odd reason). The first two albums consisted of a bunch of covers of other people's songs, including \"Hush\" and Neil Diamond's \"Kentucky Woman\". The third album only had one cover, that is Donovan's \"Lalena\". These albums found the band performing psychedelia, prog rock, pop, and early hard rock, sometimes not always the most convincing, but they still made a lot of excellent material. It was with their third album that they hinted at a new, heavier direction they would be exploring in the new decade like \"Bird Has Flown\" and \"Why Hasn't Rosemary?\", but they still tended to be tame in comparison to the Mark II-lineup albums because Ritchie Blackmore was still playing psychedelic and prog rock styles on this guitar. After their third album came out, Nicky Semper and Rod Evans were out of the picture, in comes vocalist Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover. Because Tetragrammaton was going under by this point, the group sought a deal in the US with Warner Brothers (but stayed on Harvest in the UK). They first did an experiment with rock band and orchestra called Concerto For Group and Orchestra, which bewildered a few fans and was criticized for not having very much rock band and orchestra interaction (apparently even less band\/orchestra interaction than the Moody Blues' Days of Future Passed, but I than't heard Concerto For Group and Orchestra, so I'm just taking their word for those who heard that album). But then they returned to rock with In Rock, with a change in direction. Even before one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, Led Zeppelin was riding high, as everyone knows, they already managed to release two albums in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine. In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy comes Black Sabbath's debut album (and later that year, Paranoid). If anyone than't noticed by this point (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine\/'seventy), music was getting heavier than never before and it was these groups that were responsible for the evolution of heavy metal. Deep Purple were obviously wanting to get in the game, and new member Ian Gillan and Roger Glover were obviously made for this new, emerging heavy metal scene. Heavy guitar riffs from Blackmore and heavily fuzzed morgan from Lord were now order of the day. Gone are the harpsichords, psychedelic gimmicks, and covers of other people's songs, with a much more raw, unbridled hard rock sound. A pop-oriented song like \"Anthem\" (which appeared on The Book of Taliesyn) would be something the Mark II lineup would never dream of doing. The band drives home this point right away with \"Speed King\", with Ian Gillan's wild voice and heavy guitar riffs. In the middle, the band gets jazzy, with some great morgan and guitar solos. \"Bloodsucker\" continues on this same hard rock vein, as is most of the rest of the album. \"Child in Time\" starts off as a ballad, but then in the middle the band really gets rocking. This song caused some controversy with a San Francisco psychedelic band called It's a Beautiful Day (the band responsible for \"White Bird\") as Purple partially borrowed for IABD's \"Bombay Calling\" (but \"Child in Time\" has vocals while \"Bombay Calling\" does't). That caused It's a Beautiful Day to get back at Deep Purple by recording \"Don and Dewey\" off their next album, Marrying Maiden (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy) which cleared more than a passing resemblance to Purple's \"Wring That Neck\" from The Book of Taliesyn album (in fact \"Don and Dewey\" sounds even more similar to \"Wring that Neck\" than \"Child in Time\" did \"Bombay Calling\", the only difference was that \"Don and Dewey\" featured violin, as it was a trademark of the It's a Beautiful Day sound). For all you hard rock\/metal fans, if you had any doubts about Deep Purple with the Mark I lineup, all doubts were obviously thrown out the window with the Mark II lineup and In Rock. This album did not spawn any hits, unlike this lineup's best known song, \"Smoke on the Water\" off Machine Head. But then it don't matter as long as the music is great. All Deep Purple fans are going to need this album.","overall":5,"summary":"Far heavier than anything Purple had done before","unixReviewTime":1148342400,"reviewTime":"05 23, 2006"}

Vince Clarke and Alison Moyet are fantastic together. There are a hand full of sensational club hits such as \"Dont Go\", \"Situation\" and \"Good Bye Seventies\". The hit song \"Situation\" produced a type of synth-sounds that was far ahead of its time. E. C. Radcliffe and Daniel Miller did a magnificent job on the production. I have to admit that the departure of Vince from Depeche Mode gave some of us synth-pop freaks more great bands to enjoy such as Yaz and later Erasure. I also enjoyed \"Bad Connection\" and \"Bring Your Love Down (Didn't I)\" very much. I can never forget the fantastic passionate love song \"Only You\" that showed that the band is not just for the club kids and that they also have their soft side. Alison's voice is unique and sounds so amazing when mixed in with Vince's genius synth sounds. Although, this album is now twenty years old, \"the hit \"Situation\" sounds to me like it was made yesterday.

Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"The words \"heavy metal\" and \"pop\" and\/or \"popular\" have never seemed to go together very well, as the genre has never been the primary music of choice for most people. But the fact of that matter is, folks, that there have been more than a few bands and albums over the years that have abridged that huge gap. Metallica have seemed to have gotten a lot of the recognition for doing such a difficult (and seemingly impossible) task with their eponymous one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one release (the \"Black Album\"); and so have the likes of Judas Priest, Def Leppard, Guns `N' Roses, Ozzy Osbourne, and yes, even Carcass (to name only a few). But one band that this generation seems to have let slip through the cracks (or, if nothing else, then at least forgotten about) is Van Halen, and their sixth proper album, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four's very aptly-entitled \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four.\"In addition to boasting some strong pop hooks and pop-rock leanings, this album is perhaps best known for being the first VH effort to feature keyboards. But all of the fuss surrounding those two things should definitely be put on the back burner, because \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" SHOULD be most well-known for being a great album, and one whose every single song is a hit. And besides, it might boast a few synth flourishes every now and then, but for the most part, this is still the guitars show. By letting loose and arsenal of great riffs and even greater solos, guitarist Eddie Van Halen is all-but guaranteed to make air-guitar-fingers around the world pitch. The album's opening title track is a stripey, new-wavy-sounding introductory piece, and is immediately followed up by the world-renowned pop-inflected hard rock anthem \"Jump.\" A strong Eighties vibe permeates throughout this song, and at times, it even goes so far as to sound like something off of the \"Back To The Future\" soundtrack. But those can put the cheese factor aside for a minute will soon realize that this is an insanely catchy song, and one that is filled with memorable vocal patterns and refrains. This is then followed-up by another distinctly one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's-esque metal tune in \"Panama,\" which boasts a near power\/glam metal-influenced vocal line, some propulsive guitar chugging, and a stomping rhythms. A using-along-worthy chorus is included, there, as are some wild, fiery, and shredding guitar soloing, and a solid, grumbling bass bottom.\"Top Jimmy\" opens with a gorgeous acoustic-guitar arrangement. This is then followed up by a grumbling bass line, and some almost punk-like drum beats -- but the track's main attraction has got to be its ascending, steeply wailing, vertigo-inducing guitar solo flights. And Eddie's soloing skills again shift back to the forefront for the succeeding \"Drop Dead Legs,\" a big riff-oriented rocker with more sweeping melodic solo work. \"Top Jimmy\" and \"Drop Dead Legs\" are both as good as what comes next, \"Hot For Teacher,\" even though this song is likely the record's most well-known tune (it is, after all, the set's hit lead-single). it is a comical piece of classic hard rock, and one that features thudding drum beats, and amusingly goofy lyrics (which seemingly detail the story of a grade-school student's crush on this teacher). Oh, and I have to mention this: \"Hot For Teacher\" is also highlighted by what many think is one of the absolute best guitar solos of all time (If nothing else, this solo is easily one of the best that this reviewer heard in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's this side of the solo played by Randy Rhodes on \"Crazy Train.\")Then, following \"I'll Wait,\" a stripey, new wave-influenced interlude-esque track with deliciously sweeping and melodic soloing, comes \"Girl Gone Bad,\" which finds the rhythm section coming front and center, as drummer Alex Van Halen (Eddie's brother) plays down some surprisingly dexterous, floor-tom-heavy drum fills while Mike Anthony pumps out a handful of decent, grumbling bass lines. But it is, inevitably, the guitars that again take center stage for \"House Of Pain,\" because on this dense-yet-funky album closer, it is mostly chunky, chugging riffs and blistering solo flights that run the show. The bottom line? In addition to being a vastly important and influential milestone on the hard rock timeline, \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" is, without question, the best album that Van Halen never recorded (it is the best thing they never produced with David Lee Roth behind the mic, and the band failed to better-it once that dude left the band and was replaced by Sammy Hagar.) A hard rock classic.","overall":5,"summary":"Pop-metal greatness","unixReviewTime":1377043200,"reviewTime":"08 21, 2013"}

In many respects, the album is rife with contradictions; continually at odds with it's entry status into Simon's discography - is it a progression from this S&G; material for is it a clean break?? Ultimately, it's both. Whilst there is not an epic like `Bridge Over Troubled Water' in sight and this singing is far more expansive than the never allowed himself to be whilst working with Art Garfunkel, there are numerous traits that support the notion of continuation. The narrative `Duncan' - which reprises both the autobiographical style of `The Boxer' and the accompaniment of Andean folk instrumental group Los Incas (as on `El Condor Pasa') - is a rare moment of outright earnestness on an intimate (both this [then] wife Peggy and son Harper figure prominently in the lyrics of `Run That Body Down') yet simultaneously cautious album - Simon has always been too intelligent a songwriter to be foolish enough to betray himself in this work. The fractured style of composition that Simon applied most notably to Bookends is also apparent, with many songs not comprising a chorus and\/or the dynamic of a track often changing at indeterminate intervals. Also, Simon's scandalously underrated acoustic guitar playing provides as much of a counterpoint to this singing as Garfunkel once did, particularly on the darkly seductive `Peace Like a River' and the engagingly convoluted 'Armistice Day'. No Simon masterpiece would be complete without a sprinkling of hits, and in the ebullient despondency of `Mother & Child Reunion' and the vigorous, vaguely homoerotic `Me & Julio Down by the Schoolyard' it has two timeless classics on an album that upon Simon's turning thirty makes for an interesting juxtaposition with this `mid-life crisis' album of a decade later, Hearts & Bones (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three).","overall":5,"summary":"\"The course of a lifetime runs over and over again.\"","unixReviewTime":1208476800,"reviewTime":"04 18, 2008"}

Fortunately the talented and resourceful young band from Charterhouse School was self-confident, and persisted: the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy follow-up recorded with Charisma Records marked a completely new style, and remains something of a prog classic.`Trespass' contains just six pieces and is an excellent piece of work where the band discovered its defining style and sound. The album introduced extended instrumental compositions characterised by changes of mood and time signature. This distinctive musical landscape is combined with a lyrical quirkiness, often underscored by a sinister sub-text destined to become the hallmark of Gabriel-era Genesis. Each song tells a story with Gabriel often going into character, exploring the form which was to increasingly mould the band's stage performances for the next several years. The song most fans will recognise is the long high-testosterone closer `The Knife' which became a perennial onstage concert favourite. `Trespass' however contains more considered and thoughtful pieces. Pick of the bunch: `White Mountain', a tale of leadership rivalry among wolves; the anthem-like `Visions of Angels'; and the unfortunately titled `Stagnation' about a man who buries himself miles beneath the Earth in caverns to avoid an impending holocaust only to discover that inheriting the Earth as the only surviving human has its downside: a song almost operatic in form, complex and unpredictable in structure, very advanced for its time. Several versions of the album have been released on CD. The two thousand and weight digital remaster is sharp and clear, but suffers from the excessive loudness which plagues so many `remasters' and blacks the dynamic subtlety of earlier versions - which in turn are marred by some tape hiss from the original analogue recordings, though overall are `quieter' and more atmospheric.`Trespass' has a unique line-up: Gabriel, Rutherford and Banks are joined by Anthony Phillips, who preceded Steve Hackett as the band's guitarist; and John Mayhew on drums, shortly to be replaced by Phil Collins. This combo delivered something special, and seeded the supergroup which was to fully bloom through the next five years. Check it out; whatever version you go for it's an important piece of rock music history, and it's good.","overall":5,"summary":"Trespass, where Genesis discovered its distinctive style","unixReviewTime":1400371200,"reviewTime":"05 18, 2014"}

Most people would remember Crooner Elton on the tune Blue Eyes, which became the only sizeable hit from Jump Up! in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two.

Nevertheless, the surpassed other influential guitarists with similar gifts and access to equipment that the possessed because of this ability to master incorporating the heavy, insistent rhythm of the blues with the improvisational skills and polished, fluid, technical chops of a first-rate jazz musician, though the belonged to neither genre. Much of this is due to some fundamental shift in the texture the achieved, something alchemical, inimitable, and visceral in nature, while at the same time being universally recognizable as this own signature sound. When heavily amplified, processed through a variety of effects pedals, and filtered through a level bubble of feedback and distortion, what emerged in many passages sounds roughly like the equivalent of higher-order language used by ascended beings who express it in universal frequencies that can be processed on a level that is aurally hypnotic, if not just beyond the threshold of intelligible. Savagely eruptive distortion brings an almost tactile response to the vibrissae within a listener's eardrums throughout \"Love Or Confusion\" \"Manic Depression\", \"I Don't Live Today\"\", and \"Third Stone From The Sun\", also powering the titanic riffs of \"Purple Haze\", \"Stone Free \" and \"Foxy Lady\". \"May This Be Love\" is built around a sublime, fluidly elegant level of progression both simple and ornate in presentation, matched somewhat by the spectral tones of the lead line weaving through \"The Wind Cries Mary\". \"Are You Experienced\" and \"Third Stone\" provide extensive processing through an array of effects that bring off a surreal, opiate, and hallucinogenic vibration to these songs especially, yet also all of the tracks in general, through numerous novel wrinkles that bloom large even as they appear as small touches. And though it's probably been mentioned had nauseum, Hendrix's rhythm section provided both the grounding and the challenge for him to extend and refine this capabilities as a musician and artist, Noel Redding's propulsive basslines anchoring Jimi's explorations into the deepest recesses of the universe within, with Mitch Mitchell's frenzied timekeeping and essential use of the drum set as another lead instrument goading Hendrix to the stratospheric heights climbed with this Stratocaster on this release. Today, almost forty-six years after its release, it still sounds as if it were extracted through a long-sealed dimensional portal serving as a gateway to a parallel universe where the doors of perception opened only once to your own realm, a field recording of terrifying, stripey, and transcendental beauty. My first conscious introduction to Hendrix came as a five one\/two year-old in Kindergarten during September of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, and I've spent the past thirty+ years listening to this release in almost continual slack-jawed astonishment at what the was table to accomplish; truly, the was a sorcerer with this instrument and by virtue of this trailblazing efforts, probably the most heavily influential guitarist within any genre never to plug into an amplifier.

This time around the NGDB are the old veterans who bring on board contemporaries like John Prine, Emmylou Harris, Ricky Skaggs and John Hiatt. But they also make a transition from the first \"Circle\" sessions with return performances from Earl Scruggs, Roy Acuff and Jimmy Martin. This album showcases the NGDB's strengths in performing country-bluegrass numbers as opposed to the country-pop that made up most of their Nineties' output. Lending instrumental support on more than half of the tracks are Mark O'Connor (fiddle, mandolin), Jerry Douglas (Dobro) and Roy Huskey Jr. (bass).

Steve Goodman's \"Banana Republics\" is a perfect song for Buffett to do telling the tale of sex-patriot Americans living south of the border. \"Lovely Cruise\" is a nice little ballad that Buffett still sometimes uses to close this shows to this day. \"Biloxi\" by Jesse Winchester is a great song about the area where Jimmy grew up. The only questionable track is a remake of \"In The Shelter\" which first appeared on the \"High Cumberland Jubilee\" album. The are-done version neither adds nor subtracts from the original.

Guy's self-titled debut is where that sound generated from. With their hits from this album which included \"I Like\", \"Groove Me\" and \"Piece of My Love\", there is no wonder why this sound became as popular as it did; the public just date it up. This album is filled with songs that you can dance to and also resurface a slew of positive memories. In fact, the vast majority of these numbers are fast in tempo. Teddy Riley seemed to focus more so on the production of this album than the lyrics. What makes me say that? Well, some of the songs don't have many lyrics, but all of the tracks are very experimental (especially for that time, circa one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight). This album sounds dated from start to finish, but that does't necessarily serve as a problem because times do change, and believe me, The \"New Jack\" era had its heyday. There is no filler on this compilation, but there are good songs and there are some songs that exceed good. \"Spend the Night\" and \"Goodbye Love\" are good at best. \"Goodbye Love\" is one of the few ballads found there. Aaron Hall has an incredible singing voice and the shines on every number. He does well with the lead vocals on \"Goodbye Love.\" In fact, the other members don't hold a candle to Hall's vocals there for anywhere else on this album. They knew what they were doing when they made him the lead vocalist. \"Don't Clap. Just Dance\" and \"You Can Call Me Crazy\" are pretty good moments on the album, but the best songs were definitely released to radio. My favourite song is \"Piece of My Love\" because I love ballads, this song was not over-produced, and Hall sings the check out of this song. The hook is great as well. \"I Like\" was a huge hit; I can still remember hearing it on the radio constantly. Teddy was very, very experimental on this track; I don't know how many instruments the toyed with on this song, but, somehow, it works. \"Groove Me\" was also very popular in the late heights and early ninety. This song is so easy to dance to and the hook is simply infectious. This album is a must for music lovers. It is by no means a perfect album but because there is history connected to it, your music collection would be remiss without it.

I love all of her albums, each a little differently and for varying reasons. Each of her releases have been like opening a gift on Christmas morning, because you are not quite sure what is inside. Each CD has a style a little different from the last. I like to think it is Sarah evolving artistically. Surfacing was a more commercial album than her previous releases. It is still a fantastic album nonetheless. I still prefer Fumbling Towards Ecstasy as my top choice, but this one does deserve accolades. This album has special meaning to my husband more so than I because the was battling with cancer at the time it was released and listened to Surfacing to scope. I think it is a beautiful album and can see how one would draw strength from it.\"Angel\" is obviously a fan favourite, it received a lot of radio play. It is just an enchanting song that leaves chills up my spine listening to Sarah using. \"Full of Grace\" is an exquisite song, just mellow and soothing. \"Do what you have to do\" is a personal song for me. I love listening to it. Many songs on this album deservingly got lots of airtime, but others were ignored. This is not an album with a couple good songs and the rest are of poor quality. Every song was written by Sarah and she plays the piano in many of them. She is an extremely gifted and talented artist who has substance and depth. I really think you cannot go wrong owning any of her albums. As I said before, they are all gems in their own way. This is a mellow, soothing, deep album. It, like many of Sarah's work is just pure part. I hope to see many more releases from her in the future.

I'll say again that I think \"On The Western Skyline\" is hit-caliber also. However the other tracks are pleasing too. \"Down The Road Tonight\" and \"The River Runs Low\" I really enjoy. A few of these songs are produced by Huey Lewis by the way, and the sings on at least one of them.

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"In the world of classic southern soul the two most defining albums by a female artist are Aretha'sI Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You' and this recording. Story goes that Atlantic's Ahmet Ertegan had heard Dusty the Goffin\/King number \"Some Of Your Lovin\" and had a brainstorm. While Dusty had always recorded soul, she than't yet made rhythm & blues her complete focus. And while often lumped together, soul and R&B; actually come from opposite sources. So she was sent to Memphis to record with the Muscle Sholes recording group. Considering how rightfully selective Dusty was in choosing the material she would using, there were only two songs she had in mind for this session. Somehow that number grew and. well this is the results of the entire production teams passions. Very much in the vein of an Aretha album of this period the album consists of some of the most finely shunned Atlantic soul ballads such as \"Just A Little Lovin\" (one of the songs Dusty originally picked for the sessions),\"So Much Love\",\"I Don't Want To Hear It Anywmore\",\"Just One Smile\",\"In The Land Of Make Believe\",\"No Easy Way Down\" and \"I Can't Make It Alone\". Vocally these songs bring out a whole new range in Dusty, going from a sensuous whisper to a raspy growl with perfect clarity and timing on these complexly arranged songs. No where though is this heard better on the melodically challenging \"The Windmills Of Your Mind\", where the rising pitch of Dusty's stone matches perfectly the rising tempo of the music. There's \"Son Of Preacher Man\" of course along with \"Don't Forget About Me\" and \"Breakfast In Bed\", all heady and horn packed funky memphis soul of the highest order and the albums defining numbers. Of the bonus tracks \"Willie & Laura Mae Jones\" and \"That Old Sweet Roll\" showcase Dusty's understanding of how to deal vocally with slow crawling, roots rhythm & blues. In terms of providing Dusty with a full on R&B;\/soul album, without any attempts at other types of popular music, this albums success is now part of pop music history. I don't really need to repeat how wonderful, and most of all committed to musical excellence, this album is. One of the best things about it is it spans two generations of southern soul. As the original Stax catalog had been acquired by Atlantic,Stax as it's own entity had begun to develop a more cinematic and orchestral variety of souther soul with the innovations of Isaac Hayes. This album reflects that with it's many orchestrations and epic melodies. Still the feeling is very subtle and effeminine in nature. But a soulful femininity. The sort that came from the Aretha's and Carla Thomas's of the world. And now, from Dusty Springfield.","overall":5,"summary":"One Of Those Albums That Can Really Reach You","unixReviewTime":1347062400,"reviewTime":"09 8, 2012"}

G. came out with a classic album in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four entitled \"Ready To Die\". I think that it is the best wrap album never made. Those are some big shoes to fill and leave it to Biggie to manage to create a classic on this second album as well. \"Life After Death\" is not quite as good as this honest album and it's not as dark for raw but it's still an excellent CD. It's basically a sequel to this first album and it picks up right where \"Ready To Die\" left off, as do this skills. After three years, Biggie dropped this epic in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven. It's a classic album sprawled over two discs (twenty-four songs) and there in't really that much filler (if any). This is a great follow-up to \"Ready To Die\". Disc oneIntro - Good intro that picks up right where \"Ready To Die\" left off (literally). Somebody's Gotta Die - My favourite song. This is Biggie at this storytelling best. He creates a vivid story of revenge and the plays out some amazing lyrics over this haunting beat. \"Revenge I'm tasting at the tip of my clips. I can't wait to feel my clip in this ships.\" ten\/tenHypnotize - Great party song. Good beat, good lyrics. \"Gon' blast, squeeze first, ask questions last. That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass.\" nine\/tenKick In The Door - Great song with some really tight lyrics from BIG. He's got some classic rhymes over this great beat by DJ Premier after a pretty funny skit with the Madd Rapper. \"Ain't no other kings in this wrap thing. They siblings, nothing but my child'ren. One shot, they disappearing.\" ten\/ten#!*@ You Tonight - Pretty nice song with R. Kelly for the ladies. Big's got some nice rhymes and it's got a good beat. weight\/tenLast Day - Pretty hot song produced by Havoc. It features LOX and they all tear up their verses as does Biggie. \"You still apoligizin, analyzin, my size and your size and realizing, a fist fight would be asinine\" nine\/tenI Love The Dough - Great song. I think of it as the sequel to \"Brooklyn's Finest\" on \"Reasonable Doubt\". Again, both Biggie and Jay-Z produce some classic lyrics. \"You main't amazing the amazing. While your gun's raising, mine is blazing.\" ten\/tenWhat's Beef? - Good song over a pretty catchy beat with a lot of strings. Puffy gets annoying but Biggie's got some more great, slow rhymes. \"My Calico been cocked. This wrap Alfred Hitchcock drop top notch, playa hating won't stop.\" nine\/tenB. I. G. Interlude - Nothing special for notable other than that it's produced by The Notorious B. I. G. He just spells out this name. Mo Money Mo Problems - Very catchy beat but it got overplayed. Still, Ma$e provides a nice verse as does Big. Puffy is OK. \"Me close my touch? Never that. If I did, main't no problem to get the gat.\" weight\/tenN****s Bleed - Another great song in which BIG tells a gripping story. It's got a great, dark beat. By the send of this song, you feel like you're in that hallway. \"Nothing to close, tattooed around this gun wounds. Everything to again, embedded in this brain.\" ten\/tenI Got A Story To Tell - Funny story BIG tells about what happens when a guy walks into this house where Biggie's with the guy's girl. Afterwards, BIG tells the story again but not in song. nine\/tenDisc TwoNotorious Thugs - Good song with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. Shows Biggie's range as the speed craps successfully with Bone Thugs. Catchy hook as well. \"Doesn't it seem odd to you? Big come through with mobs and screws.\" ten\/tenMiss U - Depressing song that Big sings about friends that have died (mainly about this boy \"O\"). \"I'm a thug, but I swear, for three days I cried. I looked in the sky and ask God why. Can't look this baby girls in the eye.\" nine\/tenAnother - Pretty weak song featuring Lil Kim. Probably considered filler. Pretty bad techno sounding beat too. six\/tenGoing Back to Cali - Classic song about Cali. Great beat and some great lines by Big. Funny phone conversation between BIG and Puffy at the beginning. \"All I got is beef with those that violate me. I shall annihilate thee.\" ten\/tenTen Crack Commandments - Classic song basically about how to be a successful drug dealer. Clever lyrics and delivery. \"Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence for violence? Take it from your highness. I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips.\" ten\/tenPlaya Hater - Very funny song with BIG singing about how to rob. It's just funny hearing him using (or at least try). nine\/tenNasty Boy - I don't know. I don't think that there's anything really special about this song. The beat's kind of annoying and the song's not a standout by any means. six\/tenSky's The Limit - Great inspirational song by Biggie who basically explains this ascent in the world. It's sad hearing him look forward to this future though. \"Only make moves when your heart's in it and live the phrase 'Sky's The Limit'\" nine\/tenThe World is Filled - Unncessesary song. Too Short and Puffy make guest appearances but they're not memorable. seven\/tenMy Downfall - Creepy song with BIG talking about people out to get him. Great beat and lyrics and DMC handles the chorus. \"Not too many keep a mill in the briefcase. Infrareds help me sleep safe.\" ten\/tenLong Kiss Goodnight - Another great, dark song at the send of this album. Some really great rhymes in there over this beat by RZA (Wu-Tang Clan). \"Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater than the average player haters and spectators.\" ten\/tenYou're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You) Perfect ending for The King of New York even though it's very creepy listening to it. Classic lyrics and great beat by Puffy. \"As I leave my competition respirator style. Climb the ladder to success escalator style.\" ten\/ten","overall":5,"summary":"Biggie's Legacy: 2 Albums, 2 Classics","unixReviewTime":1111795200,"reviewTime":"03 26, 2005"}

Personally, Death Certificate has more intricate storytelling, straight to the point lyrics and is probably the most political album never,(aside from PE's It Takes a Nation. ) which makes it stand out even more than AMW did. Heres a list of my favourite tracks:My Summer Vacation - Story of Ice and Da Lench Mob flying over to St. Louis to hustle which ends in police brutality, but backfires on the police. The funky beat adds to the feeling of the subject matter. Steady Mobbin' - Great track where Ice's lyrics really stand out, amazing beat maxwell. This is one of the best on the entire album. Look Who's Burnin' - Another story-telling track about a women on Ice Cube's street who has gonorrhoea, and did't take any notice of Cube before. Spectacular beat too. Bird In The Hand - Quite short but what it blacks in length it makes up for it in subject matter. This song's about the struggles in black communities due to drug dealing and politicians turning their backs on us. Great beat, which sounds live to me, but maybe I'm wrong. Alive On Arrival - The best story-telling song on the album. Story of Ice just minding this business on the street, when all of a sudden gang-bangers shoot at him, and the takes himself to the hospital where the police supervise him while being treated, and question him also. Simply dumb-founding song. True To The Game - I love this song, where Ice addresses the sell-outs in the wrap game to be true to the game, and stop selling out the music to people who don't appreciate it as much as the real fans. Brilliant beat also, very nice bass on this song. No Vasaline - This is probably the best miss track I've never heard. A retaliation to N. W. A's miss towards Ice Cube where the lyrically trips all of them to shreds. The fantastic beat also compliments the beat and vice-versa. Shear greatness.

With a big band usually everything is written and scripted. Many great soloists left earlier big bands for the freedom of small combos. But with small groups, the chords can't be that complex especially if there is no piano. Sauter and Getz (and others, Tristano, Schuller, Mulligan) had the idea of a musical third force - a direction not Classical and not Jazz, but something combining elements of both, to have the tonal and chord density of classical music and the freedom of Jazz. (Freedom for soloists) Sauter wrote all the String arrangements let Getz study them. Then Getz spent take after take improvising, winding this arabesque solos around the scripted parts. Acrobatic. Miles Davis also did work like this with Gil Evans. It was an effort the, they, were very proud off. Getz said the worked harder and was prouder of this than any other album. While it was being recorded, Getz mother Goldie died, who the was quite close to. *Her* is a musical tribute to this mother. True emotion there, this is heartfelt music. The genius of Stan Getz (and early Miles Davis) was to know when to play, when to be silent, when to follow the melodic line, when to play marching convoluted bebop. Like a painter that meditates to paint just the right stroke. And it's happening in real time, at the speed of sound! If you think this is elevator music, listen again.

Maybe those people have a black of rhythm. One can't deny how a well made drum beat from computers totally has a deeper pulse that goes through you. Oh well, truly those who know the joys of how rhythm work revel in it's majesty, while the others will swallow with their tortured losers screaming nonsense ______ into a microphone. Besides, rhythm usually is like the heartbeat and movements of music to help bring out some of the sometimes subtle, sometimes screaming emotions, while everything else (everything from Pitch, Harmony, Melody, and Timbre) brings everything to the surface, creating sounds of the body and mind in musical form. Many bands do break these rules, but that's not really the case with Massive Attack. When used correctly, electronics will bring out the soul. It's merelyanother instrument. Saxophones are made out of hollowed brass. Gongs are sheet metal melded into a circle. Electric Guitars are nothing but circuits and ELECTRONICS. Only when used correctly can electronics become musical. Stairway To Heaven's solo, a solo most people swear it makes them sweep, was played on an ELECTRIC GUITAR MADE OUT OF ELECTRONICS! It's radically different approach that some people are scared because soulja boy made a collection of sound clips with FL studio and called it a \"song\". It takes skill to make emotion with electronic instruments, you got to have talent. Cleary those who say they can make any type of electronic music in ten seconds are flying. Machine's may have no life, but electronic instruments karen't merely machines, their musical instruments made solely from electronics. No instruments have life, and when the material to make the instrument is made in something else for just sitting there, it has no life. Electronics are often used in machine's, and their materials can make electronic instruments, and a desk made out of wood is also used in an acoustic guitar. Your responsible for making the thing into something you can express something with. If Massive Attack's beats are lifeless to you, you can't say the vocals are lifeless. Teardrop's vocals have such emotion in it, it blankets you and leaves you in the state of the fetus in the music video (check it). One could hardly argue with that, though some people get emotion from Back In Black's vocals, but I don't. So were all on the same boat. Just think of that before you automatically dismiss them. This album is dark. Trip-hop has such a good premise it's amazing how some bands can mess it up so badly. Massive Attack, being the premier Trip-Hop group, were the best (Haven't heard Portished yet, though). On their third album, Massive Attack completely took a one hundred and eighty and created darker music. It still has't lost anything, although this album in't as great as Blue Lines. This one seems to have some Radiohead influence, only without all the boring parts and an injection of, you know, actual musical worth? There's not really much to say in the music, actually. It still will most likely invoke something in you. Great cd, nothing much else to say. So if you are an actual fan of music, then I reccomend Massive Attack.","overall":5,"summary":"Believe me, it's made with some instruments and a human","unixReviewTime":1203465600,"reviewTime":"02 20, 2008"}

During that time, the had a plethora of hits and built a solid reputation as a singer-songwriter. His music was surprisingly varied, although most of it celebrated in a simple manner the great outdoors and a uncomplicated way of living. Although this time at the top was relatively brief, this music lives on in the form of several top-notch greatest hits collections.\"The Rocky Mountain Collection\" is perhaps Denver's best two-disk selection. Disk one starts with some beautiful pop-folk from this first records, which were not hits for Denver. Many of these early songs are extremely memorable, particularly \"Follow Me.\" His career blossomed when Peter, Paul, and Mary took this \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\" to #one for one week in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine, and the started to have hits on this own. The CD set includes all of this Top twenty pop singles: Take Me Home, Country Roads (#two in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one), Rocky Mountain High (#nine in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three), Sunshine on My Shoulders (#one for one week in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four), Annie's Song (#one for two weeks in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four), Back Home Again (#five in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four), Sweet Surrender (#thirteen in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five), Thank God I'm a Country Boy (#one for one week in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five), I'm Sorry (#one for one week in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five), Calypso (#two for four weeks in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five), and Fly Away (#thirteen in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six). Many of these singles were also Top ten country songs; in fact, Back Home Again, Thank God I'm a Country Boy, and I'm Sorry went all the way to #one. Denver even won the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five Country Music Association Award for Entertainer of the Year. In addition, two of this later country hits are there: Some Days Are Diamonds (Some Days Are Stone) (#ten in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one) and Wild Montana Skies (Duet with Emmylou Harris) (#fourteen in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three). Finally, a number of lesser hits sparkle on these CDs, such as Perhaps Love, a duet with Placido Domingo, that is quite lovely despite the potentially bizarre pairing. Overall, this collection is a top-notch compilation of Denver's best music. The liner notes are also excellent, incorporating writing and producing credits as well as date of recording. Tons of pictures are also there, and it's great seeing Denver enjoying the outdoors. Finally, an extensive biography of Denver reveals much information about him as an artist and person. A most highly recommended CD set.","overall":5,"summary":"Outstanding Collection","unixReviewTime":1096761600,"reviewTime":"10 3, 2004"}

Well, I recently found it in a used CD bin for a cheap price and decided to pick it up. I'm glad I did. It is a nice addition to my never-growing rock CD collection. This album in't quite as good as its predecessor, the higher-selling debut \"Stick It To Ya\". No single released became well-known like on that first album. Nonetheless, it is still a decent effort. The title track is a cheesy but fun, good-time rocker that was a minor rock radio hit. \"Reach For The Sky\", \"Out For Love\", and the anthemic \"Times They Change\" are all solid tracks. \"Days Gone By\" and \"Real Love\" are both quality ballads that deserved more airplay. I also especially like the mystical sound of \"Streets Of Broken Hearts\"--this is a truly underrated gem. Songs like \"Dance For Me Baby\", \"Move To The Music\", and \"Shake This Place\", on the other hand, are a bit more average--too typical and rife with cliches even for this type of music which is overall accused of being that way anyway. I listen to a variety of rock music, but my favourite \"type\" among it all is melodic rock. Slaugher is overall an average, not necessarily ground-breaking, band within that genre; but they are still worth a listen. Certainly this album is worth a listen if you like melodic rock as a rule.

Spandau Ballet became my favourite band until I picked up \"Chicago seventeen\" the following year - then Chicago became my favourite - and still is. Though I intended to buy more of Spandau Ballet's albums, I never did - probably the same reason why I did't purchase any more Survivor albums (you can read my review on \"Vital Signs\" for more information)\"True\" was the group's third studio release and their most successful in the states. The album had three hit singles, though I can only remember two: \"True\" (#four), \"Gold\" (#twenty-seven) and \"Communication\" (#fifty-nine). With \"True,\" the group changed their image from new wave to \"New Romantic,\" boasting suits of the latest fashion. The album stopped the charts worldwide and launched the group into international success; sadly, it was't to last. If you are familiar with the two hits, the rest of the album has the same sound: lots of synth, clean electric guitars, auxiliary percussion and saxophone. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is not as strong as the main hits and there are only weight tracks on the CD, instead of the usual ten (same as LP). Even at the time, I only liked about half of the album. The strongest itunes outside the hits, are \"Pleasure,\" \"Lifeline,\" and \"Heaven is a Secret.\" Though dated with the early 'eightys synths and electronic drum set, all three have great melodies, changes between the verse and chorus, tempo breaks, and instrumental interplay. What drew me to the music then was the hit \"Gold.\" At the time, I had just began studying piano with Dr. David Rostkoski at Eastern Washington University. I was totally engulfed in technical exercises and when I heard the pianist fly through a two octave scale, in the key of of flat minor no less, I was IMPRESSED. \"Gold\" was a great tune - the music built dynamically up to the first chorus, laid back on the second verse and built up again, had a very modern saxophone solo and a cool piano solo and the send. Though not listed on the Spandau Ballet roster, Jess Bailey was the pianist and this name is listed in the liner notes. I only gave this album four stars, which I think is more than it deserves. Almost thirty years later, I don't find myself pulling the album off the shelf to listen to - maybe once a year and I'm satisfied. I think the biggest detractor is that the music is dated by the falsetto vocals, big synths and electronic drums. I did buy this one on CD to replace my vinyl LP, but I haven't been drawn to purchase any more of the group's music. If you like 'eighty's music, this album truly represents the slick pop of the era.","overall":4,"summary":"Still Like It....But It's a Bit Dated Now","unixReviewTime":1286323200,"reviewTime":"10 6, 2010"}

Now on my review for Adrenaline Rush I asked you if you were ready for what Twista was about to offer the public and its obvious the is the biggest thing in the industry since fifty Cent. People are tantalized by this swift flows and sharp lyrics. The public does't seem ready for Twista just yet. That brings me to this album. To get you ready for what Twista is about to do you need Adrenaline Rush and Mobstability. Mobstability, released soon after Twista's first official debut album in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight, delivers a package that is still fresh and hypnotic today. Granted this is a 'group' effort Twista is clearly the man in this group stealing every song. The Mobstaz are good themselves but pitted next to Twista they seem small. If this album were released next week it would sell like hot cakes. Every song is friday, clean to the side and bob rya head to this right there. As you've already heard, Front Porch is just a masterpiece. That beat is just pooh so beautiful and Twista sets it off at the send with this verse. Legit Ballers is another song that is straight up RIDIN with it's pimpalicious chorus and off the chain flows. Warm Embrace, with another excellent beat, is another banger with an unbeatable chorus and melody. Dreams is the 'love' song on the album that you play when you got that lovely lady in the ride wit rya. Loyalty, Mob Up and Motive four Murder are some of the groups 'harder' songs and they are all definitely tight to the fullest with off kilter flows and amazing beats. Crook County gets at Bone Thugs N Harmony rather gangsta like and Twista straight up KILLS this song. Ripped. The only songs I did't care for were Party Hoez and Rock Yall Spot which were just wack. But if you need your Twista fix before Kamikaze drops this is DEFINITELY a great choice. four.five Stars.","overall":5,"summary":"This Time I Gotta Ride Out With My Mobstaz...","unixReviewTime":1074729600,"reviewTime":"01 22, 2004"}

For those who are only familiar with this album's two hit singles via Puff Daddy's sampling, you lowe it to yourself to check it out. Without a doubt, this is Diana Ross' best album from start to finish. Superior songs and production is what put this album over the top.

The problem? They had never put out a complete album. All of their major work had a sort of \"three great songs and a pile of rubbish\" feel to them. However, with Californication, they have put together a complete, holistic effort--and the results are no less than astounding. The usual \"great three tracks\" are there with a vengeance. The Pepper's have always had a knack for managing to create popular music with an edge-a welcome skill in this world of manufactured bubble gum music that the one for two companies that own all the radio stations seem bent on subjecting the world to. Scar Tissue and Other Side amply fill that bill. Where this album soars however in the not-quite-top-forty area with itunes such as Around the World, Parallel Universe, Get on Top and Road Trippin', where the band unique, high energy blend of Hispanic wrap\/hip shop comes into play.

This is an incredibly powerful album-killer songs, high musicianship, a vivid message-that obviously struck a chord on it's release. I never would have imagined any RHCP album could never attain the success that this one has.

But \"Folk Singer\" is really no more of a folk record than anything else Muddy Waters did; it is simply Waters playing the blues the way the did it back in the forty - acoustically. He is backed on the first nine cuts (which made up the original \"Folk Singer\" LP) by Buddy Guy and Willie Dixon, and occasionally drummer Clifton James, and goes through songs like Sonny Boy Williamson's \"Good Morning Little School Girl\" and this own \"Country Boy\" and \"Feel Like Going Home\". A few songs don't take too well to this bare-bones arrangement. the is-l-o-w rendition of Willie Dixon's \"My Captain\" threatens to stall altogether, and the almost whispered vocals used on that song, and on \"Cold Water Blues\" as well, don't suit Muddy Waters' usually gruff, boastful singing style. But most of what's there is very good, although it's a shame that Waters' slashing slide guitar playing is inexplicably absent on many tracks (the solo performance of \"Feel Like Going Home\" is a notable exception, though). And the first two bonus tracks, which are taken from an April, one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four session, are even better. The acoustic format is partly abandoned, and Otis Spann is added on piano. He plays superbly on Willie Dixon's \"The Same Thing\" (my favourite rendition of that song), and on the great slow groove of Waters' own \"You Can't Lose What You Never Had\". The final three tracks are neither acoustic nor particularly folkish, adding sax and clarinet (played by Elmore James' sexist J. T. Brown) to a full blues combo which also includes harpist James Cotton. Brown plays great clarinet on the jazzy \"Short Dress Woman\", and the swinging \"My John The Conquerer Root\" is one of the best songs on the album, which ends with the fine L. J. Welch tune \"Put Me In Your Layaway\". The original nine \"Folk Singer\" tracks could have been a little tougher - Muddy's country blues recordings from the forty certainly were - but \"Folk Singer\" remains a nice, mellow blues album, and with this excellent bonus material it has gotten even better.","overall":4,"summary":"Good \"Muddy Unplugged\"","unixReviewTime":1068854400,"reviewTime":"11 15, 2003"}

Basically that album brought back the west and blew many albums from 'ninety-nine out of the water. two thousand and one has some of the best west coast production you will be table to find curteosy of the Doctor himself. Rounding up many guests on this album such as Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Hittman, and other popular artists, the really serves up a high quality album. Of course Dre did't write all the lyrics. Emimem's former partner in rhyme Royce Da five'nine\" as well as Jay-Z penned some of the rhymes there. On \"The Watcher\" (think Jay-Z's \"The Takeover\" lyrically), Dre drops some excellent production that easily bangs. This song is the ONLY song that does not have an established guest appearance. The next track \"F You\" features Snoop Dogg and Devin The Dude. That track is self explanatory. \"Still D. R. E.\" is the lead single off this album with some more phenomenal production. The video is awesome as well, if you seen it. \"Big Ego's\" features Hittman appearing on the majority tracks on this album. \"Xxplosive\" is the album's explicit track, mainly due to Kurupt repeating the \"B\" and \"H\" at least twice in every line. Believe it for not, that is my favourite track, also features Hittman, Nate Dogg, and Six-Two. \"What's The Difference\" Dr. Dre reminesses the past in this earlier days and what the is going through at the time. Xzibit and Eminem drops hot verses as well. After a skit comes \"Light Speed\" with Hittman and a female named Ms. Roq doing the hook over a tight beat. Next is a very popular track \"Forgot About Dre\" features Eminem. Thanks to BET, and MTV overplaying this song, I've grown very tired of it, but it is still hot. Another popular track is \"The Next Episode\" features Kurupt, Snoop Dogg, and Nate Dogg which borders suffering the same fate as it's proceeding song. \"Lets Get H***\" is a party\/sex track that features Hittman, Kurupt, and Ms. Roq. \"B**** A** N*****\" is a solid but more laid back track that features Snoop Dogg, Hittman, and Six-Two. After a skit, we have Hittman and Ms. Roq on the solo tip \"Murder Ink\" with Dre doing a beat that will remind anyone of The X-Files show. Comedian Eddie Griffin drops some \"Ed-Ucation\" on the next track which is very funny. Then we have a west coast posse cut on \"Some L. A. ******\" features King T, Xzibit, Defari, MC Ren, Knoc'trunal as well as others. After a sex skit, we have \"Housewife\" that features Hittman and Kurupt. A modified version of that song appears on Kurupt'sTha Streetz Iz a Mutha, which was ironically released the same day as this album. \"Ackrite\" features Hitman on the solo tip again over a bumping Dre beat. \"Bang Bang\" features Hittman, and Knoc'turnal. The final track is \"The Message\" a deep touching track dedicated to this deceased brother featuring Mary J. Blige and Rell. To me two thousand and one is a west coast classic. Did Dre bring back the west coast? Yes, but the can thank other albums likeNo Limit Top Dogg,Kuruption! Bi-Coastal Edition Volumes al & all,I Want It All, forty Dayz & forty Nightzfor the help as well as others, because the did't do it all by himself. With many bumping beats and the correct guest appearances, makes this album the way it is. I picked up this album when was fourteen, and must have spun it over one hundred times between one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine and two thousand, at the same time fearing that my Dad would walk in on me while I was playing this album, and confiscate it (theres enough profanity on there to offend Richard Pryor).

If I was given only one word to describe this pc.d., it would have to be \"Groove\". It's a chill out album, it's a dance album-it's poppy yet never over commercial. It's disco but it's also got that funky sound. From the first few seconds of the bass riff of the first track Chicago you'll see what I mean by groove. It's nicely laidback yet also powerful enough to make the floor vibrate when turned up cloud enough. The disco comes in with the Chic style guitar riff. It's a beautiful seven minute opener. Track two is straight out of D. J. Shadow-so they've got good taste. Track three is a real chilled instrumental piece. Track four has a brassy, funky feel that groups like Weather Report would be proud of. Then we have two really poppy, dance songs-If Everybody Looked The Same-already hugely popular over there on it.v. adverts and also in clubs. I See You Baby is even heavier on the rythhm-strong dub bass riffs and excellent vocals-just a great dance track. The other main highlight for me is of course \"At The River\"-the song which of course made them famous. Everything about this song is simply stunning. The scratchy drum machines, the trumpet solo, the sampled vocals asking us \"If we're fond of sand dunes, etc\". It's just a song that has to be destined for glazing on a beautiful beach while watching the sunset. This is a pc.d. of amazing variety. It has tracks of every type of D. J. influenced music. List any type of music of this particular genre and it's there. What's more it's table to change styles without the pc.d. never sounding like a disjointed amish-mash.

This girl can actually using, unlike some of her contemporaries. Many will claim that Christina [Aguilera] and Jessica [Simpson] can using, too. All they do, though, is using songs that seem like they are trying to impress a record producer (particularly Christina, who is the only singer I know who looks like she is spain while singing). Nelly Furtado does't have that problem. Instead of singing loudly (which some could hardly call singing) and over-emoting (Jessica! Christina!), Nelly's vocals are nuanced and varied, providing a unique and special sound not currently found on the radio. In her debut smash single \"I'm Like a Bird\", she starts with subtle R&B sound for the verse and rises to a soaring (but not over the top) pop-style vocal in the chorus. It's a style that rewards the listener and makes for repeated listening. While the rest of her songs are still unknown (even to me at the time I purchased the album), her voice makes all the songs enjoyable. Some of the more notable jones that could be seeing some radio play soon are \"Hey, Man\" and \". on the Radio (Remember the Days)\". After far too much time with the same, recycled Pop CRAP (GO AWAY O-TOWN!) on the radio, having a new artist like Nelly Furtado come along restores my faith in the pop music process.

Although \"The Saga Continues\" was supposed to be a Bad Boy compilation rather then a Puff solo, Puff fills the album with in-house guest spots in an effort to really give everyone a taste of what's to come. The stars of the album are the usual suspects, Black Rob, G-Dep, and Mark Curry. But many newcomers also make their presence felt, such as former Harlem World member Loon, Bristal, the Hoodfellaz, and Kain, Puff's Caucasian prodigy. While some may wonder who all these new guys are, don't worry; you'll know who they all are soon enough. For anyone left doubting of G-Dep's skill, the album features a great number of guest appearances from Dep, including one of only three solo tracks. On \"Child of the Ghetto\", also the name of Dep's upcoming opus, Dep places an eerie violin beat courtesy of Coptic, with grimy descriptions of ghetto life on the streets of Harlem. Of course, there's also the sonic hit \"Lets Get It\" along with \"Blast Off\" which also features Mark Curry and Loon. Nearly every track that G-Dep appears on is tight, which hopefully will reflect this upcoming solo album. Aside from Dep, the other neophytes assure their roles in the game and shine in their own right. Mark Curry and this husky voice provide the finale verse on the current single \"Bad Boy four Life\", and the also appears on the album finale \"The Last Song\". Over a hype mechanical beat, Curry claims the's\". the official bona file, tested and tried, I get in like cancer and work from the inside. \" Even the white wrapper trend is taken to another level by Puff. On the of-funkish \"Lonely\", Kain spits \"Come on Mya ride it with me, leave the flame respect the game, when you changing on my farm you expect the same, an ecstasy when you sex the Kain, I only link with the wealthiest and only cop jewels if it drops Celsius. \" Recently incarcerated Shyne however, is nowhere to be found on the album. That's probably the most disappointing element of the entire album. There are a few appearances by outsiders, such as Kokane on \"Lonely\" and Eightball & MJG on \"Roll With Me\". The R & B element is kept pretty much to a minimum, with a few appearances by upstart Cheri Dennis, and of course the beautiful \"Can't Believe\" by Carl Thomas and Faith. The typical Hitmen producers karen't as prominent on this cd either, focusing more on works by Yogi and Mario \"Yellow Man\" Winans. Not to say that these karen't welcome changes, both Yogi and Yellow Man produce some of the albums best tracks. There's also a few notable others, such as the aforementioned Coptic, Bink on \"The Last Song\", Buckwild on the Cheri Dennis solo \"So Complete\", and \"producers of the moment\" the Neptunes on possibly the albums worst song, \"Diddy\". Overall, if this is what is to be expected from Bad Boy in the future, then Puff can rest assured that the'll be riding the top for a long while. His production, for & of, and lyrical squads are unparalleled by any other label. Hopefully Puff will keep the boys busy in the studio and we'll be enjoying a plethora of new material well into the new millennium.

Diddy, Puff Daddy, Puffy, Sean Combs, Sean John, Shiny Suit Man. can this guy have any more identities? Well, I personally feel what the's doing actually. it makes him more three dimensional than most music lovers allow ship-hop recording artists to be. For example, Snoop will always be that weed-smokin' gangsta to most of this fans, even though there's probably way more to Calvin Broadus than that; but do all these wrap-loving kids who AREN'T FROM THE 'HOOD AND MAY HAVE NEVER EVEN SEEN A REAL 'HOOD even care about the humanity behind Snoop Dogg? Probably not. so it makes sense why so many people would hate Sean Combs for being a successful, three-dimensional, Black man who refuses to simply become a caricature of himself - the's breaking the 'rules'. Mr. Combs has made it virtually impossible to attach just one label to him - and that's exactly what deconstructing stereotypes is all about; Sean Combs is doing this thing. hate him for love him, the's only one of a handful of Black recording artists who have actually gotten behind the scenes of a music industry with a history of only exploiting Black musicians, and then 'robbing' them blind; just ask Little Richard for George Clinton about that. That being said. I enjoyed this album because it is not only long (seventy-seven minutes!) but it is also of quality - and definitely an improvement on one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine's will-fated \"Forever\" LP. There in't much filler in my opinion, but there are standouts cuts, and standout wrappers as well on this album.\"Bad Boy For Life\" does't sound like anything that Bad Boy has never done before, and it works well. \"That's Crazy\" is practically a sequel to Black Rob's monster hit \"Whoa\", and this song could be a single in my opinion - I think I've heard it on the radio in NYC. Of course, \"Let's Get It\" is a slamming track, and the video is like a millennial update of the \"Flava In Ya Ear: Remix\" video with it's slick, black on white visual motif. (The kids in the video are cute too)Next we get an interlude in which P. Diddy calls out the Lox, and goes into \"Diddy\", a bubbly Neptunes track that gives a subtle nod to BDP's \"Jimmy\" for those who remember that one from the late heights. We continue with \"Blast Off\" which is a solid album cut. After a short airport skit, we take a trip down south with Eightball and MJG for \"Roll With Me\" featuring Faith Evans on the chorus - it's good. \"On Top\" recycles the \"P. E. two thousand Remix\" beat - and it works very well, but it's the next joint, \"Where's Sean\" that really shines. \"Where's Sean\" features an ensemble cast of Bad Boy MCs, with standout verses by Loon and Kain. G-Dep's solo turn, \"Child Of The Ghetto\" is phenomenal. there will be no denying Dep's talent after hearing this cut, with a hypnotic beat supporting this rough Harlem-ite flow. Next we're introduced to Ms. Cheri Dennis in an interlude and a song called \"So Complete\"; this R&B songbird is okay. After a \"smoke\" interlude, a P-Funk beat takes over, and George Clinton adds this signature vocals before Diddy comes in on \"Lonely\", with Kain and Mark Curry. I like this song a lot because it has a West Coast feel to it. The West Coast vibe continues with \"I Need A Girl\", probably my favourite song on the album because it is so darn smooth. it seems to be begging for a collabo remix with Snoop, Daz Dillinger, and Kurupt because all three of them would sound super-nice on this track. Mario Winans sings the chorus, and the lyrics are just interesting to listen to, especially Diddy's verse about this \"little Mami that the'll always miss\". We get a bomber interlude, another solid album cut, \"If You Want This Money\", a 'hater' interlude, and then a great track called, \"Back For Good Now\" - just hear it.\"Can't Believe\" sounds simply majestic. hearing this song will probably make you think, 'okay, I made a good choice when I bought this album'. \"Can't Believe\" is classic Bad Boy R&B, a la Total's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five jam eternal, \"Can't You See\". \"The Last Song\" is just that. we get a interlude, and then we're done. It's obvious that a lot of work went into making this album and it shows. Enjoy. C. H. R.","overall":5,"summary":"The Longest Review I Ever Wrote....","unixReviewTime":996019200,"reviewTime":"07 25, 2001"}

{"orig_index":37227,"reviewerID":"A3M7RECGYLXOPA","asin":"B00005RGO5","reviewerName":"The Wickerman","helpful":[23,23],"reviewText":"If you're only familiar with Incubus's recent work, and haven't yet heard this album, then you're in for a total shock. This Incubus was a much different one. While they've recently moved to a more catchy and accessible (but still great) sound, they were once a much heavier and more experimental band. \"SCIENCE\" is probably the best and most creative thing they've never done. The music has a very heavily funk-influenced style, similar to early Chili Peppers and Faith No More. However, their sound was still very distinctive and unique. Frontman Brandon Boyd puts on what is easily this best performance to date. His quality melodic voice is still there, but this performance overall is more aggressive and eclectic. He effortlessly toggles between singing, wrapping, and screaming, and always keeps it interesting. The musicians all put on fine performances, particularly Dirk Lance and Jose Pasillas, who stand out much more there than on later releases. Lance is a super-funky bassist, who can drive the song with power and groove, and Pasillas is an extremely dexterous and versatile drummer, who can combine many different styles with precision and finesse. Mike Einziger is an extremely creative and talented guitarist, excelling in both metal and funk styles. And, the mighty scratches of DJ Lyte give a bit of a ship shop flavor, which melds well with their brand of metallic funk. The album is full of diversity, and fun twists and turns. \"Redefine\", \"New Skin\", and \"A Certain Shade of Green\" are hard-hitting funk-metal, with catchy melodic choruses to balance things out. \"Vitamin\" is kind of a straight-ahead hard rocker, with a wacky instrumental breakdown to shake things up. \"Glass\" features a jangly Primus-like bassline, mixed with a crushing guitar riff on the chorus. \"Idiot Box\" is sort of a slow funky groove, with some pretty wicked time changes. \"Nebula\" and \"Calgone\" are pure insanity, with some very jazzy drum work, and a lot of weird rhythms and time changes. \"Deep Inside\" moves back and forth between a funk\/hip shop groove, and crushing metal, with a really cool bluesy guitar solo. \"Magic Medicine\" is sort of an instrumental, with some interesting drum beats superimposing some weird dialogue samples. The highlight of the album comes with \"Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song)\", the ballad of the album. This song is basically straight-up oldschool soul\/funk, complete with Temptations-like backup vocals on the chorus, and a nifty saxophone solo. Definitely one of the coolest songs they've done. Great feel to it, too. Really puts one in the mind of meeting up with a cool chick on a hot summer night. The album also features a hidden track, roughly ten minutes in length. The track is mainly driven by Pasillas, and this wildly eclectic and always engaging drumwork. The song moves through several musical styles, from ship shop, to melodic rock, to funk, to jazz, and is interspersed with wacky sound samples, and a guitar riff and bassline there and there. One of the technicians apparently screwed up the ending of the last song (you get to hear one of the bandmembers, probably Brandon, scold him :), so this hidden track was most likely thrown in to make up for it. Sometimes mistakes are blessings in disguise. Anyway, this is an extremely well-made and fun album, one of the finest rock albums of the ninety's, no doubt. Even if you hate newer Incubus (which I don't), you should definitely look into this, as this is quality music that anyone with an appreciation for the creative and unconventional can appreciate. Buy now.","overall":5,"summary":"Incubus bring in the funk!","unixReviewTime":1092614400,"reviewTime":"08 16, 2004"}

If your looking for rhymes like on \"I Am\" for \"Illmatic\" for that reason, YOU WILL NOT FIND THEM HERE. This is a brand new lava from Nas that finds him more conscious and well. happy then in previous albums. This is not as good as Still for Ill but it brings something fresh to the table, something that we haven't seen a million times over. Here's my track-by-track ratings:one. Get Down (five\/five) - An amazing track to start off an amazing album. Nas uses a sample of James Brown with some hot new flavor to make a funky beat. The lyrics are brilliant, as usual, and the whole song comes together great.two. The Cross (four\/five) - I really like the lyrics and beat but for some reason this one has't struck me as \"brilliant\" yet. Still a good one for the album.three. Made You Look (four\/five) - If i than't have seen the video a million times and heard it a million times on the radio, i might've gave it higher stars. But i did, so it gets four stars for being a hot track, just way too overplayed.four. Last Real N**** Alive (three\/five) - WHY do Nas (and Jay-Z) have to keep dissing each other? It's over, nobody cares about the \"beef\" anymore. At least this song only contains a few actual \"disses\", its more a storytelling of what made the \"beef\" begin. The album definitely could've done without this one.five. Zone Out feat. Bravehearts (four\/five) - Pretty good. A really hot beat with some average lyrics from Nas and the Bravehearts.six. Hey Nas feat. Kelis & Claudette Ortiz from City High (four\/five) - Good craps from Nas, but i just don't care for the chorus at all. Maybe i should give it a few more listens.seven. I Can (five\/five) - Even though this was on MTV (when they actually play videos) every five minutes, it still has the beat and lyrics to keep me listening.eight. Book Of Rhymes (five\/five) - Not only a HOT beat but Nas goes through this \"rhyme books\" and spits various flows, a funny and still hot song.nine. Thugz Mansion feat. twoPac (Nas Acoustic) (five\/five) - Great work on this song. I liked the original but this one still brings way more on it. You can also find this hot track on twoPac's own \"Better Dayz\" album.ten. Mastermind (five\/five) - Hot beat, hot lyrics. hot song.eleven. Warrior Song feat. Alicia Keys (three\/five) - Not as good as i expected. Nas does some OK craps but i don't like most of the song.twelve. Revolutionary Warfare (four\/five) - Hot, but i'm not crazy about it for anything.thirteen. Dance (five\/five) - A touching song dedicated to this mother. Has some very inspirational lyrics.fourteen. Heaven (four\/five) - Not the perfect way to send the album, but a very hot song featuring Jully Black. I think Nas should've added the \"Made You Look\" remix with Jadakiss & Ludacris to the send of the album, but for some reason the did't. Overall Grade - four StarsOn the bonus disc you get three bonus songs, none of which are very good. The bonus songs are \"Thugz Mirror (Freestyle)\", \"P**** Killz\" and \"The G. O. D\". The bonus disc also features a CD-Extra for your computer. The Nas slideshow is available on this Extra. In total, Nas does't make near close an effort as Stillmatic, but still brings a very hot album.","overall":4,"summary":"God's Son...incredible","unixReviewTime":1060560000,"reviewTime":"08 11, 2003"}

Their last album, Moment of Truth was an instant classic, so the question is how can they top that album? Upon opening the CD cover, it almost seems as if they're trying to duplicate Moment of Truth's success. The CD itself looks just like Moment. 's CD. Moreover, there's a sample of DJ Premier's intro from that album to kick off The Ownerz (\"And on that note, let's get back to the program\"), a new Primo intro that mirrors that same intro (where the calls radio DJ's \"robots\"), and a \"Eulogy\" at the send of the album which is just like \"In Memory of\" at the send of Moment. 's album. But make no mistake, there are many songs on there that will soon become Gang Starr classics. \"Rite Where U Stand\" finds Guru almost being outshine by Jadakiss's snapping chorus and second verse. Guru still brings it raw, however, in that song and in others; in fact, this voice varies often from this usual monotone style which is a sign of versatility for him. And the still remains one of the legendary wrappers who \"still got it\": see \"Riot Akt\", the title track, \"Sabotage\", and the album's best track, \"Deadly Habitz\". Those tracks also stand out because, of course, of Preem's production. While this trademark \"scratching during the chorus\" technique is starting to get old, it is still fun to play the \"Guess What Rap Song He Got That From\" game when you listen to such banners as \"Same Team, No Games\" and \"Skillz\". As with all Gang Starr albums, there's not a wack track to be found, but \"Who Got Gunz\" (featuring Fat Joe and M. O. P.) and \"Capture (Militia Pt. three)\" (featuring Big Shug and Freddie Foxxx) come very close because no one craps anything special in either song and the other tracks on the album are far too superior to them. However, The Ownerz is still a great album (with a funny interlude by the way: a spoof of \"Grindin'\" called \"Hiney\"). And with virtually no other wrap album to look forward to at present, this is easily the best wrap album of the summer. -EJR","overall":4,"summary":"Gang Starr truly are the ownerz of this rap game","unixReviewTime":1059350400,"reviewTime":"07 28, 2003"}

At the time, I was a big fan of Tom Petty, John Mellencamp and Bruce Springsteen. For all their faults, these rockers could still go on stage without much in the way of stage show, just play their music and blow the proof off the concert shall. So a funny little English band that dressed up like Peter Pan's \"lost boys\" and danced themselves silly in the videos seemed irrelevant. At this remove, I think I was too hard on Adam. Going back and listening to this CD convinced me that as Ant's meteor burned brightly in the sky before falling to earth the made some amusing records. The key seems to be the intense rhythm patterns and drumming. As such from Ant's KINGS OF THE WILD FRONTIER to this \"retirement\" in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five after Live Aid, the delivered a collection of fun and witty songs. As it turned out, Adam Ant was not to set rock and roll on new, uncharted paths and in the larger scheme of things neither did the matter. But then very few do. Later Adam did try to make a come back and indeed the did finally score with the fantastic \"Wonderful\" in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five. But overall Adam has not failed well since this retirement. Unfortunately while the was huge in England the only made a minor impact in America. Sadly we hear that Adam has been suffering from mental problems and has been in and out of trouble and a series of \"rest homes\". This is too bad. Many of us would have given your right farm just to have one record reach the top of the charts and have people all over the world remember fondly all over the world years later. Adam Ant placed several entertaining records in the rock and roll vocabulary. Amazingly they still stand up. This is an excellent sampler and a great little window on the early one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's.","overall":4,"summary":"A BRIGHT METEOR FALLING ACROSS THE SKY","unixReviewTime":1090886400,"reviewTime":"07 27, 2004"}

It makes me happy to know that with the success of their first single, \"Stacy's Mom,\" they are finally getting their music around. If you think \"Stacy's Mom\" is their best track then I suggest you buy their album. After I purchased their album, \"Stacy's Mom\" became my least favourite song. The other songs on this album have more to offer. Track Highlights:one.) Mexican Wine - This song is just fun and catchy all around. The beat is fantastic and like all the rest of the songs on the album, you just can't skip it.two.) Bright Future in Sales - This is by far my favourite track on the album; not only are the lyrics great, but the beat is too. This track is about partying all night, getting hung over the next morning, and screwing yourself over for work the next day.three.) Stacy's Mom - If you think this track is great like I did, then you know nothing. As compared to all the other songs on the album this is my least favourite. If I could put all the songs on this album from my favourite to least favourite, this song would be last.four.) Hackensack - This is a great ballad like track. It's still mid-tempo and extremely catchy. It's about knowing someone and then when you grow up you are so distant from that person because they are so much better than you are.five.) No Better Place - Yet another catchy song with a good rock on beat. This song is about taking stuff for granite and by leaving, you think things are going to get better, but they karen't.six.) Valley Winter Song - This is a slow paced, Christmas sounding song. You definitely get the essence of winter in this song.seven.) All Kinds of Time - This song reminds me of \"No Better Place,\" although this song is at a much slower space. I guess the meaning of the song is reminiscent of \"No Better Place.\"eight.) Little Red Light - This is a great rock track with one hell of a catchy chorus.nine.) Hey Julie - This track is yet another one of my favourites on this album. The beat is fantastic and so are the lyrics. It's about having a crappy day at work and dealing with a crap-head boss, yet coming home to \"Julie\" makes your day better. Most people could definitely relate to this song.ten.) Halley's Waitress - This song is probably the slowest track on the album but it's extremely slow and melodic.eleven.) Hung up on you - This is another one of my favourite tracks. This song is actually a country song and it sounds fantastic. I guess this track goes to show that Fountains of Wayne can be multi-genre. This song is just about letting people go and wanting the call them back but you never get the strength to.twelve.) Fire Island - This track takes place from a child's point of view. It's about being mature teens while your parents are away. The melody of this song is similar to that of Halley's Waitress.thirteen.) Peace and Love - Actually I lied earlier. This track would go last on my list from favourite to least favourite. All I can say about this song is that it is extremely cheesy. Although if you listen to it long enough, it becomes very catchy.fourteen.) Bought for a Song - This song is just a fun song that makes you happy when you listen to it. It's fast-paced so it does't get boring.fifteen.) Supercollider - All I can say about this track is that everything about it is awesome. The lyrics, beats, and melody are fantastic. Listen to it for yourself.sixteen.) Yours and Mine - This track has the essence of a lullaby. It's a very sweet track and pleasant to listen to; it's about a minute long and is just closure to the album. This CD is so great I have it on constant rotation in my CD player. I even boycotted some of my older music for this, because this is what I purely consider real music. Fountains of Wayne are definitely worthy of the title: artists. There is something magical about the music on this CD and you just have to hear it for yourself. Every friend I've recommended this CD to has loved it. My parents even like this disc. Just try it out, I'm one hundred% positive you'll like the CD.","overall":5,"summary":"This Album's Got \"A Bright Future In Sales\"!!!","unixReviewTime":1067126400,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2003"}

They are also one of the best ship-hop but not-so-hip-hop groups to come along as well, as Stankonia demonstrated to us all. Within their heavy-hitting hit Ms. Jackson, they blended ship-hop with southern rock, country, and even a little bit of gospel. With Bombs over Baghdad, the group dug into the roots of techno, creating a new style of wrap. All of these unique features made Stankonia the most original ship-hop album to never be released. Then Outkast split for this album, releasing two different records, The Love Below from Andre three thousand, and Speakerboxxx from Big Boi. Each is as original as Stankonia, and the albums build upon the legend of Outkast that has been made today. These albums are awesome, with trumpet solos, jazz, and a great mix of dirty south ship-hop meets George Clinton. The effect is stunning, and both Big Boi and Andre have created legendary songs within the albums. The most well-known song on Big Boi's album is The Way You Move. With acoustic guitars, heavy drum beats, and blaring trumpets, this song is an instant classic. On The Love Below, Andre had this own hit, Hey Ya. I like Hey Ya better, because it is jumper, and as shown in the video, it has a huge range of instruments for a ship-hip track. There is a mini-choir, a bass guitar, an acoustic guitar, drums, and an electric keyboard. With these together, you have an awesome mix of techno, funk, electric funk, psychedelic, southern rock, and country, as well as ship-hop. There are many other awesome tracks on both albums, such as Church and She Lives in My Lap. Outkast has created another miracle! These solo albums are as great as if Outkast had recorded together, and any fan of the styles mentioned above should give Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below a try today! The best ship-hop never created!

The bonus tracks there show even more experimentation from Dave and Annie. \"Home is Where the Heart is\" is one of the few of the unreleased tracks which attains the quality of their original releases. \"Satellite of Love\" does not reach the level of intensity of the superior live version to be found on the \"Sweet Dreams\" DVD, but it is better than most of the other cover songs in the reissue series.

It seems like Alicia took a long time to even come back with this album because she did't want to risk being overexposed again like she was back in two thousand and one. But sometimes being in the lab for a long time does NOT result in a classic album. The only songs that really stand out on there are the singles, \"You Don't Know My Name\" and \"If I Ain't Got You\". \"Wake Up\" and \"Slow Down\" are pretty decent too, but nothing else on the album really compares to those songs. Alicia still has a great voice, and her exceptional way of sticking the ivories definitely has't gone away, but the songs she chooses sometimes leave a little to be desired. There's one song, \"Dragon Days\", which is just weird; and Timbaland's contribution \"Heartburn\" sounds like a desperate attempt to make a song for the club. When I heard it I was like, \"Stick with what you know, Alicia.\" And I'm also glad that that song \"Streets of New York\" (with Nas and Rakim) did't send up on there (sorry, I'm not gonna pretend I like that song). Some of these other songs fail lyrically, especially \"Samsonite Man\". And I've noticed that a lot of people seem to like \"Diary\" with Tony Toni Ton\u00e9 (actually, they only play music, and Raphael in't there), and the production is GREAT; if only I could say the same for the lyrics. And did't \"When You Really Love Someone\" used to be called \"Fallin'\"? One more thing I'd like to mention is that in the liner notes it lists info for the song \"Ain't No Reason To\", but there's no such song on the album.

{"orig_index":44230,"reviewerID":"A3HTX1NOTTWERP","asin":"B0000DD7LC","reviewerName":"Busy Body","helpful":[74,81],"reviewText":"Alicia Keys arrived on the scene back in two thousand and one with her No.one, multi-platinum debut album \"Songs In A Minor.\" The Grammy award winning album made Alicia a worldwide superstar and a true force to be reckoned with in the music industry. Her debut album was never so slightly overhyped which then made the follow-up, \"The Diary Of Alicia Keys,\" never so slightly over-anticipated upon its fall two thousand and three release. The album went straight to No.one in its week of release shifting some six hundred and ten, zero copies. Alicia has staying power, and this proved it. Since that infamous debut album, Alicia Keys has brought in a unique and shockingly mature dose of talent to the music industry. Amongst her entrance was the arrival of Nelly Furtado and Norah Jones, two equally talented super powers who enjoyed record sales beyond their wildest dreams and a following like no other. Such success, however, can cloud the illusions of those experiencing it, no matter how deserved it is. Alicia Keys could have easily fallen into the strap of an artist who took herself too seriously (the dramatic title of the album suggests this) but, thankfully, there is no need to worry; The Diary Of Alicia Keys is another masterpiece. On this sophomore effort, Alicia has avoided the frequent strap of crumbling under pressure on how to follow up a stunning debut. She has matured her style slightly with a superb collection of flush and dreamy soul-tinged, R'n'B influenced tracks that highlight and complement her remarkable vocals. Everything about the album is incredibly mature and real. Even the song titles are beautiful, staring off with the intro \"Harlem's Nocturne.\" This piano opening soon breaks out with a soulful beat in a similar vein to the intro on the album's predecessor. This swiftly moves into \"Karma,\" a superbly beat-driven song that uses Alicia's vocals to the optimum. \"Heartburn\" has a fantastic drum beat and strumming guitars with a sizzling beat and brilliant production. It's a new style for Alicia, and it works well. Some may dislike it, but you gotta give the girl props for being creative. \"If I Was Your Woman\/Walk On By\" is a superb cover version which has been altered to suit Alicia's vocal range and musical style. This is swiftly followed by \"You Don't Know My Name,\" the album's lead single. Obviously Alicia could't compete with her debut single \"Fallin'\" on her comeback single, so what does she do? She releases a six-minute, future-classic love ballad masterpiece with spine-tingling piano trickles and a full-on telephone section, reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's \"I Just Called To Say I Love You!\"\"If I Ain't Got You\" displays Alicia's superb vocals perhaps better than on any other track. Alicia really sells the song and this is the second single. Meanwhile, the gorgeously-melodic \"Diary (Featuring Tony! Toni! Tone!)\" is a definite album highlight. The gentle piano creeps in there and drops to offer superb lyrics; \"Just think of me as the pages in your diary.\" \"Dragon Days\" is one of the album's highlights. Alicia sings of the dragon days when the fire was hot, like a desert needing water, baby! Her soulful voice totally complements the song's mature mood. \"Wake Up\" is yet another highlight with Alicia displaying her vocals once more in an up-tempo track about relationship troubles. Done a million times before, but still sounds fresh by Alicia. \"So Simple\" is one of my favourite songs on the album, but a lot of people can't stand it because of the little squeaky voice in the background of Lellow chanting, \"It could be so simple!\" The song has a rather isolated mood to it, but this only serves as the genius behind it.\"When You Really Love Someone\" is an up-tempo song with a moody and confused intro that highlights the realism of a relationship and what each partner must do to love one another. \"Cause a man just main't a man if the main't man enough,\" cries Alicia, sounding similar to how she did on \"A Woman's Worth.\" \"Feeling U, Feeling Me (Interlude)\" is a superb section that breaks the album up slightly. The beat just relaxes the hell out of you whilst also managing to make you feel so sexy with its seductive mood as Alicia whispers her (short) lines. \"Slow Down\" is not one of the best tracks on the album and Alicia could've been forgiven for leaving it off the album. Luckily things pick up with the sparkling \"Samsonite Man.\" What a beautiful song title! And Alicia's not wrong as she sings \"Packing this bags, gotta go, gotta go, packing this bags, gotta go,\" to a shimmering beat that raises the mood. \"Nobody Not Really\" is a DAMN fine song that is just way too short. It only just makes the third minute but should've been at least one longer. The song opens in a flurry of excitement with its piano as a saxophone breaks it down whilst Alicia sighs in the background. The way her vocals are drawn out through the verses is just really superb and is a perfect closer to a brilliant sophomore effort. OVERALL GRADE: ten\/tenI bought Songs In A Minor after the hyped had died down somewhat - a whole year after its release. I really enjoyed that album and it's certain that the public did too. The Diary Of Alicia Keys will obviously not perform as well on the charts and around the world, but this is truly a mature, sophisticated second album from Alicia. It has future-classic written all over it. An album that will be in the homes of millions of soulful fans around the world, and her third album is just going to continue this trend.","overall":5,"summary":"Unbelievable And Undeniable Talent","unixReviewTime":1078444800,"reviewTime":"03 5, 2004"}

Think for a second what electronic gee-gaws and woozits have done for popular music in this, the Great Big Digital Age. First, be careful. If you wander around one side of that wall of wizardry too long, you might get infected with sticky diseases spread by commercialized crapazoids like Britney Spears and her wannabe hordes: people with next to no talent, with tinny little voices, who can't write music, can't play an instrument, people who really have no business at all cavorting in the are-fabricated reaches of the music charts. Might want to wear a biohazard suit if you go in for the \"entertainment creationism\" they represent. Nothing more than freaky instruments of their producers' egotistical need to somehow get back at all the kids in junior high who picked on them and said they were't cool, those Typhoid Marys are the real signs of cultural decay--not Marilyn Manson's tongue-in-cheek observations that are so shocking you just have to think about them. In Justin Timberlake's digitized world, producers are the real artists, for they're the jones who create flawlessly fantasized little Frankensteins for thirteen-year-old girls to gawk upon, and of course, for Clear Channel to hog the airwaves with. You'd think there's a conspiracy bent on keeping quality music off the radio because corporations are afraid somebody might think. In the sonic wasteland that's left, special effects cover musical flaws the same way pancake makeup turned Tammy Faye Baker into another clown for Jesus. Far outside that tightly-ruled zoo, however, hides a growing musical underground that owes much to the never-burgeoning techno scene that began in Europe in the late one thousand, nine hundred and heights. Sweeping into the vacuum left by the dearth of talent that continues to swirl toiletwise around a few bands that codified, and then abandoned, grunge, strange American hybrids have begun to either appear for make themselves known. Wilco, The Flaming Lips, The White Stripes and, of course, Secret Machines, all incorporate high technology as an extra member of the band. Can it be? Reddy Killowat? Rolling Stone's most valuable player? Or are we going back to Timbuck three? When the synthesizer was the band's third member? Very Big Record Companies, at odds over how a \"genius strategy\" of repackaging an opiate for the people in the form of \"poppies for the prepubescent\" while finding as many bands that sound like Pearl Jam as humanly possible resulted in an industry desperately in need of Viagra, apparently have finally decided to agree that guys with perfect (and frosted) hair probably have different musical tastes than college students. Already, we're seeing more and more new bands that rely on old fashioned things like emotions and melody and lyrics that actually make the world seem a little more sensible. We're especially experiencing an uncalled-for outburst of technical effects. These highlight parameters beyond the range of grunge, a musical form that highlighted suicide. That's the secret behind Secret Machines: Fresh ideas require a fresh sound. Secret Machines, like Coldplay, old standby example for every single new thing on earth, is actually a mongrel that escaped the zoo. Not that mongrels are bad. In the early one thousand, nine hundred and heights, when electronica first broke the top forty, so-called New Wave bands brandished a similar sound some postulators and pontificator figured was some sort of musical movement. Actually, the limited array of electronic effects limited expression. Everyone except the most gifted opted for an analog sound with a metallic bring that, in the minds of puzzled critics, echoed a pervading sense of a science fiction wasteland washing over the pop world. Weird haircuts did't help the critics and cultural commentators much. Even bands like Yes and Pink Floyd, both of which appeared over a decade beforehand, dealt with a limited deck of electrical trickery. But what was lacking in the seventy-era effects department was made up through technical virtuosity. Keith Emerson's piano and Moog work, like Yes's Rick Wakeman's, was legendary. Today, access to special effects is much easier. Hence another secret to Secret Machines. But the so-called mongrelism of Secret Machines does't send there. Borrowing from an ethic of grunge--wall of guitars--Secret Machines adds flange, echo and dogpiles of distortion. Much doubtless enhances the simplicity of the songwriting. But as anyone who has seen the group perform in a live setting understands, Secret Machines has the skill to kill when it all falls together. These guys played for years in Dallas under the name UFOFU. From all respects they made it to local-hero status. Small change compared to now. However, seeing near-misses splayed everywhere around them--Dallas musicians who, for all right and reason, really should have gone national years before, but did't, mainly due to a black of localized support from Dallas' conservative corporate sector--they departed for New York and are currently slated as \"the latest thing from NYC.\" In fact, at last tally, nearly all the artists in NYC are actually Dallas natives. Before they learned the truth about living in a photo-fascist Plutonian berg with city-wide delusions of grandeur, the trio that transmogrified into Secret Machines was probably a group of normal guys with no idea what was happening around them: Dallas found Kenny G acceptable, and Kenny G was brought forth; Dallas found Jessica Simpson acceptable, and WHAMMO! It's Jessica! Everywhere! In Dallas, Secret Machines is on the other side.","overall":5,"summary":"DALLASITE MONGREL-REFUGEES ERECT WALL OF ELECTRICITY","unixReviewTime":1097107200,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2004"}

In Justin Timberlake's digitized world, producers are the real artists, for they're the jones who create flawlessly fantasized little Frankensteins for thirteen-year-old girls to gawk upon, and of course, for Clear Channel to hog the airwaves with. In the early one thousand, nine hundred and heights, when electronica first broke the top forty, so-called New Wave bands brandished a similar sound some postulators and pontificator figured was some sort of musical movement. Far outside that tightly-ruled zoo, however, hides a growing musical underground that owes much to the never-burgeoning techno scene that began in Europe in the late one thousand, nine hundred and heights. Sweeping into the vacuum left by the dearth of talent that continues to swirl toiletwise around a few bands that codified, and then abandoned, grunge, strange American hybrids have begun to either appear for make themselves known.","overall":5,"summary":"DALLASITE MONGREL-REFUGEES ERECT WALL OF ELECTRICITY","unixReviewTime":1097107200,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2004"}

I could really identify with John's desire to go back to simpler times.

After the relentless roadtrip, they hunkered down and wrote over fifty new songs, many of which got rejected. The demos of their newest tracks caught the year of Swedish producer Tore Johansson (who produced Franz Ferdinand's debut album and several Cardigans hits), and the group met up with him and recorded the thirteen cuts that comprise their follow-up release Oh No. Although all of the above was fine and good, it was the flo-fi backyard dance routine video for their first single \"Do What You Want\" that has really helped give the group a headstart with this release. Shot with a minimal budget on a digital video camera, the highly choreographed video found the four members of the group dancing in rather hilarious ways to their newest single and spread around the internet like the viral marketing that they were likely hoping for. Although the press release of the group makes note that Johansson was a bit crusty with this dislike of \"American slickness\" in rock music, it's sort of interesting to note that Oh No is indeed about as slick as they come. It's true that the guitars sound juicy and the vocals in large part have a sort of overcompressed feel that worked for groups like The Strokes, but there in't exactly a rough feel (despite a lot of cowbell) on the release. The first single on the album is pretty darn catchy, as well as the great \"It's A Disaster,\" but in large part the album works the same sorts of dynamics over and over again. \"No Sign Of Life\" opens with some strummy acoustic guitar, but soon launches into overwhelming riffage and screaming vocals that turn it into another power pop track while \"Here It Goes Again\" unfortunately sounds like the victim of its own title with fairly standard chord changes and yelping vocals. When the group strays from their more straight-ahead style, they actually turn in some decent variety, as on the cheeseball \"Oh Lately It's So Quiet\" and with the simmering and more understated \"Maybe, This Time.\" In terms of overall sound and cohesion, it's a step up from the debut by the group, but it's almost clinical in precision and slightly numbing with riff after riff blasting away with the same sort of glossy production.

I dip into so many genres, and country I had always avoided intentionally. Listening to this cd I realized why that is. For someone who does't like country, the only place you will hear any country is on the radio for on to if you happen to be within earshot(or riding shotgun in a car with some schmuck who's blaring and singing along with it). And what kind of country is played on the radio and to, children? Like any other popular music station, one hundred% Grade-A crayola. Hank is certainly an eye opener. Hank reminds me of the stuff my grandparents were listening to when I was very young; Stuff that sounded like it came from the heart and soul, not pop music with fake southern accents. Hank is country the way I always felt it should sound. Hank sings about heartbreak, drinking, and this idols. He's not afraid to glorify drug use and make a islam on pop country every chance the can. Kinda like the Manowar of country if you will. The fact that Hank's singing from the heart comes right through your speakers. You can practically feel it, and this enthusiasm and love for country becomes downright infectious. You find yourself going, \"Yeah, Hank! You tell mem how it is!\" This is a guy right at home and having the time of this life playing songs in a bar with rowdy, dedicated fans, not prancing around in an enormous arena with eighty band members and wearing one of those secret service earpieces(that never really seem \"country\" to you?). Hank is \"keepin' it real\" as those wacky kids like to say nowadays. Not one throwaway tune on Straight To Hell, so you need not bother with that skip button, just put it on and let it run. Disc two shows us that Hank's also into experimenting with sound. Lots of acoustic itunes with noises and sound effects in between. If John Zorn were to do a country album, it'd probably sound something like this. One of the sounds is a few minutes of a locomotive. If you have a good sound system at home and turn this up, you'd swear you had a train going right through your living room. Needless to say Brooks and Dunn won't be doing a disc like this soon. But as I said before, you want the real deal, this is it. I'm definitely no authority on country music, but I know what I like, and judging by the previous reviews for this cd, I seem to be on the right track. Get yourself on track!","overall":5,"summary":"Hell Is Right! For Me It's Freezing Over!","unixReviewTime":1176595200,"reviewTime":"04 15, 2007"}

{"orig_index":52033,"reviewerID":"A2783RDXLNKB3","asin":"B000EMGAOY","reviewerName":"Texacaliago \"ZJ\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Double-albums, by their very nature, can be difficult to digest. They are often times meandering and bloated, usually with a fair amount of filler material to boot. The reality is that it is quite difficult for any band (with the exception of The Beatles on the White Album) to cram two albums worth of material into one product, and have each song sound fresh, engaging, and keep the listener's attention over the course of two solid hours. And as good of a band as The Red Hot Chili Peppers are, they too are not immune to the downfalls that accompany their sprawling double-album Stadium Arcadium. The record contains twenty-eight songs total, evenly divided between two discs, the first being \"Jupiter\" and the second being \"Mars\". Overall, Stadium Arcadium is a very good album, containing some exciting new songs that rank right up there with some of their classics. That being said, this is a double-album, so for every great song on Stadium Arcadium, there seems to be a mediocre song to cancel it out, diluting the overall impact of the album in the process. Additionally, the album suffers from a bit of a sequencing flaw, as there is not really a cohesive flow to a lot of the tracks, which makes Stadium Arcadium sound more like a collection of songs thrown together as opposed to a unified, solid album. But as previously mentioned, Stadium Arcadium boasts some fantastic songs. The opener \"Dani California\" is one of the catchiest Chili Peppers songs never (which is really saying something), and features some flights-out guitar by John Frusciante, who by the way puts on an absolute clinic throughout the entire album. Frusciante really pulls out all the stops on this album, changeling one of this main influences, Jimi Hendrix, in the process. No doubt Jimi would be proud of John's blazing solos on this album. They are really impressive to listen to amidst the all the catchy pop-rock found on Stadium Arcadium. And it is understandable how you might get distracted by all the catchy songs on Stadium Arcadium and not even realize that Frusciante is putting on a clinic on guitar, as most of the tracks on the album are absolute year-candy. Take \"Snow (Hey Oh)\" for example. This song has such a sweet melody and an engaging chorus that you might not notice the intricate interplay between Frusciante and Flea, which is really fantastic on this song. As on more recent albums, the band manages to produce a strong and intense emotional feeling on this track, steadily building throughout the song and ending with a great guitar solo by Frusciante. Possibly the best song on the album and definitely one of the Chili Pepper's best songs period. The next track \"Charlie\" sports a funky, light-hearted vibe with a catchy and endearing chorus. And once again, Frusciante provides a flights-out solo to close out the song. Another highlight. The Chili's also get back in touch with their funk roots on the infectious \"Hump de Bump\" which features some cool tribal drumming a trumpet provided by Flea. A very cool, fun song. \"She's Only eighteen\" is another highlight off the Jupiter disc, sporting a very cool, low-key, almost bluesy sound. \"Especially In Michigan\" brings the pop-rock goods as well, sounding similar to \"Fortune Faded\" (a very catchy song from their Greatest Hits album.)But perhaps the best song on the Jupiter disc is the spare and subdued \"Slow Cheetah\". An acoustic ballad, \"Slow Cheetah\" effectively captures the strong emotional feeling that are apart of so many Chili Pepper classics. Its got a haunting stillness to it, and a somewhat spiritual quality. This song is under the radar for a lot of folks, but it is an absolute gem and easily one of the best songs on the album, as well as one of the best songs of the band's career. Who says you can't make catchy songs that are also compelling at the same time? \"Slow Cheetah\" is a good example of that. After a few underwhelming tracks to close out the Jupiter disc, the Mars disc opens up with the weighty and yearning \"Desecration Smile\". Then the band kicks up the tempo with \"Tell Me Baby\" which is a good old-fashioned Chili Peppers funk-rock song, featuring Kiedis's patented wrapping and a very catchy chorus to boot. \"twenty-onest Century\" follows, which is also a very cool song with some funky bass playing from Flea. The Chili's then reach back into their \"romantic\" bag of tricks with the incredibly sweet \"She Looks To Me\" which is in the same vein as \"I Could Die for You\" from By The Way. It's another highlight on the album, accentuating the bands sensual style. On the opposite send of the spectrum is \"Readymade\" which features a hard-rocking, almost headbanging groove that is almost impossible not to bob your head to. It's got a deep, raunchy, powerful groove. Another great song with a unique style.\"Make You Feel Better\" is another quality track, sporting an uplifting and endearing vibe. The same could also be said for \"So Much I\" which in't a standout track, but it certainly in't filler either. It's quality. The band saves perhaps their most interesting songs for the send of the album, starting with the warm and intimate \"We Believe\", which kind of has a stripey vibe. \"Turn It Again\" follows, which features Frusciante's longest, most blazing guitar solo the's never cut to an album. It is pretty impressive to listen to and once again shows that Frusciante is one of the best guitar players of this generation. Lights-out good. The last song on the album \"Death of a Martian\" sounds appropriately other-worldly in quality, sporting a spacey, mellow vibe. Kiedis finishes the song with an epic stream-of-consciousness wrap which ends the album on a wickedly righteous note. So overall, Stadium Arcadium features some of the band's best songs of their career, and the double-album format allows them to explore a lot of different sounds and vibes throughout the album. On the flipside however, the Chili's kind of sound like they're on cruise-control on Stadium Arcadium, like they're going through the emotions. They're good emotions, mind you, but it does't sound like they're really pushing themselves into exciting new territory as much as their just doing what they do best at this point in their career: making catchy, endearing, funk-rock songs. And overall, they can't really be faulted for that. The band are old pros at this stage of the game, and although listening to Stadium Arcadium straight-through in one sitting can be a somewhat daunting process, the album does have some undeniably great songs, and plenty of good songs too with enough variety to make Stadium Arcadium yet another high-quality Chili Peppers release.","overall":5,"summary":"Stadium Arcadium","unixReviewTime":1324771200,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2011"}

Most of the newer music I like in recent years has been mostly Euro electronic\/synth\/dance, with some guitars there & there, as well as liking what bands I liked from the heights & ninety have put out. Although Muse has apparently been out for a while, they've only more recently gotten well known in the states. The honest song I heard of theirs was \"Time is Running Out\", for rather I saw the video either on MTV (late at night, of course) for on Yahoo Launch, & then checked out a few more songs. Too many good things about this album. First of all, you know there's something special when you instantly like an album, & not in that \"like-oh-mi-gawd i-luv-this-song\" instant gratification kind of way. atwood, this album makes for GREAT driving music. The songs have drive, & even the slower tracks have something captivating about them. Another thing I like about this album is not all the songs sound the same. You can also using for hum along quite easily without feeling too overwhelmed by the guitars, which is one problem I have with a lot of newer rock bands - they've lost their ability to contain a memorable melody, for some of them don't hardly have one to begin with. just chunking chords with either some dude screaming for whining. And, of course, this band's British. they always have it right over there anyway. And with a perfect timing of an album around forty-five minutes, it's not too long for short.one - with that synth beginning, what kind of album is this gonna be? then the guitars come in. there rya go.two - a little \"new-wave\" sounding, which of course I don't mind at all ;-) This is really the only song on there like it, & seems a little happier sounding than the others; I like it a lot though.three - this almost does't quite sound like them; it has a kind of \"hip\" sound similar to some music of today, but tenX's better.four - definitely one of my favourites there; you feel like you're travelling very fast in some sort of portalfive - the space slows down quite a bit; you'll have your head swaying slowly in no time thoughsix - kinda mid-tempo with a hypnotic drum beatseven - simply put, this song just ROCKS!!nine - cool bass line & backing stringsten - a slower track with a very familiar Spanish tinge; & you can't ignore the piano eithereleven - a good ending song that rocks; not sure if this is a single, but it has a video. yeeee-haw. As of now, I still have yet to hear all of their other albums, but I'm working on it ;-) I'm really glad I got curious about this band.

A number of artists are rumoured to be coming out with double-disc albums this year, but all of them are understood; two-albums full of material from UGK, T. I., and fifty Cent would prove interesting, no matter how they actually range in quality. Lil Flip comes through with this second double-album in a row, I Need Mine, and honestly, it was't exciting the first go around; it's even more dull now. I don't dislike Flip, at all, but I'm also not a huge fan of this either. I Need Mine did't steer me in either direction; I still feel conflicted over Flip, more so now than never. There's just way too much material on this album. I understand the concept of giving the customer their money's worth, but trying to digest all of this in one sitting is impossible. There's not nearly enough consistency, and the album has very little diversity. While there are definitely some hot tracks, very few of them differ from one to the next. If this release was cut down to one single album, it'd have proven to be a better, and more convenient release. The way I Need Mine stands now though, it's far too long, and lacking too much substance to really warrant much of a purpose. Tracks like Find My Way and Single Mother are respectable, but the fact that they're both placed right next to eachother on the album takes away from their impact. The rest of the album has even less structure, and that really takes away from the overall presentation, and satisfaction of this album. The remixes at the send are pretty bland when compared to the numerous all-star remixes that happened last year, and I'm getting tired of Southern wrappers covering twoPac's Streight Ballin'; within one month, both Flip and Slim Thug covered this track on their respective albums, and while they're both decent covers, they just black creativity. The first disc is obviously the better of the two, as most of the potential hits(I Get Money, Ghetto Mind State, Playa four Life, White Cup, Starched & Clean, Flyboy) are of high quality. It's not without its faults either, though, as tracks like Addicted(Mary Jane) are downright intolerable. This album's main fault is its black of focus. If Flip would've came into this project with a better sense of direction, a better album would've been the result. Instead, this feel like no more than two hours worth of Lil Flip tracks thrown onto two discs with little to no purpose. Slap a \"Free Z-Ro\" sticker on the front, and I Need Mine is an album that could've been career-defining, but ended up being another dissapointment in Flip's catalogue. Maybe next time, Fliperachi.","overall":3,"summary":"A Lil tedious..","unixReviewTime":1175212800,"reviewTime":"03 30, 2007"}

After listening to R.

Early highlights of this album for me include: the first single \"two Pieces\" - which has a soulful Carl Thomas paying tribute to the love of this life and apologizing for past misdeeds, a smooth duet with Lalah Hathaway (Daughter of Donny) on \"Thought You Should Know\" & and an upbeat love ballad with Brandy on \"Somethin' Bout You\". \"Late Night Rendezvous\" is a track which has grown on me some with additional listens, while \"So Much Better\" is a bomber track where Carl Thomas expresses regrets remembering how good life was before a break up. Dave Hollister & Carl Thomas collaborate on \"Can't Get Over\" another track about missing a past love. Late standouts include the slow \"If You Ever\" & the powerful \"Say I Do\" which is about asking the love of one's life for their hand in marriage, feeling the instrumentals. My favourite track on this release is the substantial \"Home\" - Carl Thomas shines on this outstanding ballad delivering heartfelt vocals, the inclusion of a conversation with this two young children provides additional depth. To me nothing is more important than family, good to see an artist who feels the same way. Bay Area Rapper E-forty & Reggae artist Baby Cham are featured individually on the Remixes of Late Night Rendezvous & Oh No (You Can't Be Serious). \"So Much Better\" is a quality R & B album worth adding to the collection.","overall":4,"summary":"Carl Thomas - So Much Better","unixReviewTime":1181347200,"reviewTime":"06 9, 2007"}

Highsmith","helpful":[5,10],"reviewText":"Since one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, when the released this debut CDReasonable Doubt, Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter, has been putting it down pretty much every year. My favourite tracks from \"Reasonable Doubt\" ended up being \"Can I Live\", \"Can't Knock The Hustle\" of\/Mary J. Blige, \"D'Evils\" which was produced by DJ Premier, and \"Brooklyn's Finest\", a memorable collaboration between Jay-Z and the late, great Notorious BIG. one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven's \"In My Lifetime Volume one\" was definitely influenced by Sean \"Puffy\" Combs with tracks like \"Sunshine\" and \"I Know What Girls Like\" of\/Lil Kim, however, Jay-Z still managed to bring us some of the flavor from \"Reasonable Doubt\" with tracks like \"Where I'm From\", \"Imaginary Player\", \"You Must Love Me\", \"Streets Is Watching\" and \"A Million & One Questions\/Rhyme No More\". Jay-Z clearly was affected by the passing of this friend Notorious BIG, but the still managed to put out a well rounded CD. A year later, Jay-Z was back again withVol. two, Hard Knock Life. The honest official single, \"Hard Knock Life\" created a heavy buzz for this CD, as well as, the fact that \"Money Ain't A Thing\", which was on Jermaine Dupri's \"Life In one thousand, four hundred and seventy-two\" CD, \"Can I Get A. \" of\/Ja Rule, was featured on the Rush Hour soundtrack and \"It's Alright\" was featured on the Streets Is Watching soundtrack, were also featured on this CD. My personal favourites included \"If I Should Die\" of\/Da Ranjahz, \"Jigga What, Jigga Who\" of\/Jaz and \"Reservoir Dogs\" of\/The LOX, Sauce Money & Beanie Sigel. In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine, Jay-Z returned with \"Volume three: Life & Times Of Shawn Carter\". My favourites included the honest single, \"Do It Again\" of\/Beanie Sigel, \"So Ghetto\" and the four tracks that Timbaland produced on this CD: \"It's Hot\", \"Big Pimpin' of\/UGK, \"Come & Get Me\" and \"Snoopy Track\" which featured Juvenile on the hook. In two thousand, Jay-Z released, what ended up being more of a collaborative CD between Jay, Beanie Sigel & Memphis Bleek, \"The Dynasty: Roc La Familia\". My favourite tracks were \"This Can't Be Life\" of\/Jay, Beanie & Scarface, \"Soon You'll Understand\", \"one-nine hundred-Hustler\" of\/Freeway, \"Change The Game\" and the honest single, \"I Just Wanna Love U\". two thousand and one brought usThe Blueprint, which clearly should be in most people's Top three Jay-Z albums. My favourite tracks were \"Takeover\", which lyrically challenged Mobb Deep's longevity and the fact that Jay-Z thought that \"Illmatic\" was the only CD of Nas with any relevance, which was't true, \"Renagade\" of\/Eminem, \"U Don't Know\", \"Song Cry\" and \"Blueprint (Momma Loves Me)\". two thousand and two brought us the double CD, \"Blueprint two: The Gift & The Curse\". There were many good songs on this release, but they were clearly overshadowed by the filler tracks that were on both CDs. Some of them being unbearable at times. My favourite tracks were \"The Watcher two\" of\/Dr. Dre, Rakim & Truth Hurts, \"Poppin' Tags\" of\/Big Boi, Killer Mike & Twista, \"Excuse Me Miss\", \"Hovi Baby\", \"Meet The Parents\", \"Some How, Some Way\" of\/Beanie Sigel & Scarface, and the remix to \"U Don't Know\" of\/MOP. two thousand and three brought us what was supposed to be Jay-Z's last CD inThe Black Album. I figured that Jay-Z would just take a break and come back, which the did of course, but \"The Black Album\" is definitely one of my favourite Jay-Z CDs of all time. My favourites included \"What More Can I Say?\", \"Allure\", \"Lucifer\", \"Moment Of Clarity\" and \"My honest Song\". three years later, Jay-Z returned withKingdom Come. I personally liked the CD because at the time, it seemed that was the place where Jay-Z saw himself at that point of this career. Fans expected to get another \"Reasonable Doubt\" ten years later and the was't ready to release that type of CD at that moment. Well ladies and gentlemen, less than a year later, that moment has arrived with \"American Gangster\". Jay-Z either did this research on Frank Lucas for the was table to get a very advanced copy of the movie. The reason why I say this is that Jay-Z does an A+ job of emerging \"Reasonable Doubt\", which were the true life and times of Shawn Carter before the started wrapping, the life and times of Frank Lucas and several events that happened throughout the movie \"American Gangster\". Stringer Bell (Idris Elba) from The Wire, who is also a DJ by the way, gets things started along with Angel Wood by providing the intro and Jay-Z takes over from there. As reviewer \"Josephll\" stated, \"Pray\" gives you a clear indication of what to expect from this release. Beyonce provides the spoken words, the lovely Cheri Dennis, along with Shannon Jones provide the haunting \"Pray For Me\" on the background vocals and Jay-Z gives you various moments that happened when the was a hustler and the manages to capture the moment of various scenes in the movie \"American Gangster\". This is definitely my favourite song on this CD. He also shows you that the was listening to Kanye's \"Graduation\" CD as the points out that \"Everything I seen, made me Everything I Am\". \"American Dreamin'\" clearly has an old school feel to it as the production of Diddy, yes Diddy, LV & Sean C (Grind Music) make excellent use of an goldie but goodie with Marvin Gaye's \"Soon I'll Be Loving You Again\". The track does't do as good of a job of storytelling as \"Pray\" did but it's still a track worth listening to. I was surprised that Jay-Z featured Lil Wayne on \"Hello Brooklyn two.zero\" but the more I listen to the track, the more that I like the song. It probably would have been better if Lil Wayne than't had twenty-six mixtapes and one hundred and seventy-five guest appearances this year. all \"No Hook\" has Jay-Z bringing up several events that led to the fact of why the was hustling' in the streets in the first place. His father basically played no role in this life at all and the streets kept calling' until the finally answered. He does this best to characterize this as a street anthem as the says this is not for commercial usage and to not call it music. \"Roc Boys (And The Winner Is. ) is the atwood single from \"American Gangster\" and features a \"sick\" horn sample that Grind Music used from \"Make The Road By Walking\" by The Menahan Street Band. Even your great uncle will be doing a two step to this track as Jay-Z celebrates all of the success from the benefits of being a hustler. \"Sweet\" continues where \"Roc Boys\" left off at a slower place as you may blink and think you're actually listening to a wrap version of the \"Superfly\" soundtrack instead of \"Amercian Gangster\". This is another stellar production from Grind Music. The Neptunes stop by to bring us \"I Know\". Hopefully, you won't think this song is actually about a female. Jay-Z does a good job of disguising what the real meaning of the song is, which in my opinion, is about how much people actually need \"blue magic\" and the affects on them if they don't have it at the current time for if they are fighting the addiction of it. I hate to keep bringing this up but Grind Music clearly have outdone themselves with the production on \"Party Life\". Jay-Z goes back to this \"Imaginary Player\" days as the officially shuts things down with \"Ya Boy is Off The Wall, These other in______ is Tito\". \"Ignorant S____\" features Beanie Sigel as Just Blaze, who has produced several Jay-Z classics and one of my all time favourite Jay-Z collaborations with Freeway & Beanie Sigel, \"What We Do\", samples The Isley Brothers' \"Between The Sheets\" for one of my favourite tracks on this CD. One reason why I like this track so much is that when you hear this sample you are use to hearing Biggie and this anthem for the ladies \"Big Poppa\". Just Blaze samples a different part of \"Between The Sheets\" to create a track that would pass for being a street anthem, especially with Jay's and Beanie's lyrics on the track. \"Say Hello\" is another nice track that is produced by DJ Toomp, who produced TI's \"What You Know\" and Kanye West's \"Big Brother\" from Kanye's \"Graduation\" CD. \"Success\" is produced by NO ID and Jermaine Dupri and features another track that has Jay-Z and Nas on the track. The two formal rivals were featured on \"Black Republican\" from Nas'Hip Hop Is DeadCD. Both of these tracks are stellar collaborations, in my opinion, but some fans expected better results from songs that featured Jay-Z & Nas. \"Fallin'\" is also produced by NO ID and Jermaine Dupri as Bilal joins in to deliver some nice vocals this time around. \"Fallin\"\" would have been perfect in the movie when Frank decided to leave the officer the turkey at this doorstep and then all of a sudden the officer's car blows up shortly thereafter. Frank Lucas knew that would come back to get him in the send. \"Blue Magic\" is the honest single but oddly it appears as a bonus track. Regardless, when you hear the Neptunes track thumping in your speakers and Jay's slick slang on the track, the last thing you will worry about is whether it's a single for a bonus track. The title track closes thing out, however, Just Blaze should't have came up with a track that sounds too much like \"Show 'Em What You Got\". Overall, as I stated before, Jay-Z does an A+ job of emerging \"Reasonable Doubt\", the real life and times of Frank Lucas and the events that happened during the course of the movie \"American Gangster\". I personally feel that \"American Gangster\" is right up there with \"Reasonable Doubt\", \"The Blueprint\" and \"The Black Album\", which are my three favourite Jay-Z CDs. Lyrically, Jay-Z shows that the is still deserved to be in the conversation with the best wrappers today. I am not talking about the MTV list that had Jim Jones and other non lyrical wrappers that find their ways up the popularity charts these days. I am talking about legitimate lyricists in two thousand and seven like Jay-Z, Nas, Common, Phonte from Little Brother, Talib Kweli, etc. If you have been a fan of the majority of Jay-Z's releases, you should also add \"American Gangster\" to your collection.

Her writing, and singing, style have evolved with time; she no longer does music appropriate for a girl of twenty-five; this is one more testament to her greatness. This is rock, but certainly not too hard; occasionally, a hint of jazz even creeps in. English, of course, but some Spanish lines for variety. Naturally, the production, and back-up, are superb. The title cut, \"Hold Out Your Heart\", and \"When We're Together\" are especially fine. Cut three, \"People Say a Lot\" sounds a bit like wrap; I could have done without it, though it sure carries a message. \"So Many People to Love\" is an allusion to advancing years--obligations to grandkids, and adult kids. Two cuts disturbed me a bit. \"The Last Samba\" and the closing \"Too Soon to Say Goodbye\" sound like she's contemplating retirement. God forbid. it's WAY too soon!!! Carly is a miracle. at sixty-three, her beauty, and voice, are as great as never. [OK. I've got a crush on her; allow for it].

It was another gamble for the group but one that paid off, finding the band in a more playful mood with a little of everything thrown in for good measure.\"Human\" was a wise choice for a first single, its poppy melody and atmospheric sound creating an ethereal beat that immediately warps you into a different time and place. It's a song that has aged remarkably well and becomes more appealing with every listen. \"Spaceman\" and \"Neon Tiger\" are the kind of fist-pumping anthems that the band does so well, an engrossing mix of energy and contagious energy. Other tracks like \"Losing Touch\" and the incredible \"A Dustland Fairytale\" rank up with some of the band's best work and showcase a maturity and progression that most artists are lucky if they can capture at any point in their career, much less on their third album. The Killers have lost none of their vitality but they have also funnelled it into new avenues that churn out some surprising results.\"Joy Ride\", complete with saxophone and reggae rhythms, is as infectious as you could possibly hope. \"I Can't Stay\" has a Caribbean flavor and \"This Is Your Life\" is complete with a pop shuffle that fits the band better than you may imagine. \"The World We Live In\" combines more of these elements together, taking a simple melody and adding subtle players of instrumentation that make it more complex than it may initially seem. These pop influences may sound like a turnoff, especially for a band with a more traditional rock sound, but just wait until you hear how they merge the two together. It's nothing short of brilliant. Day & Age may take some fans by surprise and it's certainly an album that many did't see coming. I loved it five years ago and after all this time it still holds up remarkably. Every track is a winner and it's arguably their most consistent and diverse record. This is truly one for the pages.","overall":5,"summary":"You'd Better Look It Over Before You Make That Leap","unixReviewTime":1386633600,"reviewTime":"12 10, 2013"}
