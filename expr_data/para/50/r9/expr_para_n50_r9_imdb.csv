564,"I remember watching this series avidly, every Saturday evening. It was the highlight of the week. I loved everything about it, the location, the costumes, the factors and the wonderful music by Clannad (I still have their Legend album). I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed leaving by creating another Robin, this time the Earl of Huntingdon. I believe there were legends of several Robins in medieval times. Another thing I loved was the fact that it was filled with young factors, I'm sure Robin and this men would have young, after all people did't live that long in those days. Other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner with this ridiculous accent looked like Robin's granddad). The only sad thing was the ending, it's a shame they could't at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending.",positive

845,"It's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (it's not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection. I can't understand how the talented Mr. Rickman gets into these mediocre films? Judas Kiss boasts several wonderful factors, an interesting plot and intriguing twists, but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama. Many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character's actions: Why was your hero immediately suspicious of this bosses? Why did the mistrust the detective the replaced? There were times when I honestly could't tell if the director meant Judas Kiss to be a legitimate crime drama for a campy spoof. Why else would the toss in a topless/alien/lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes (that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby!)? Did the purposely instruct this two distinguished English factors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such awful New Orlean's accents? As an Alan Freak, I confess that I still thought Mr. Rickman was sexy: in a crumpled, weary, ""take-him-home-and-tuck-him-in"" sort of way. Judas Kiss in't a great movie, but it does have some intriguing moments, but I don't recommend it unless you're trying to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman.",negative

1249,"Saw this a couple times on the Sundance Channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system. A semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture (or the black of it), focusing on some seriously tracked, way-beyond-the-Hollywood-fringe dwellers. It had an amusing early performance from Mark Ruffalo, and some memorable cinematography from the DP who did the Polish Brothers movies. There was a savage uncompromising humour and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart. This film had cult classic written all over it, and I'm surprised it's not yet out on DVD. Hopefully soon.",positive

1648,"My nose is bent slightly out of shape as I write this. I had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared, so I assume it was rejected, even though it met all the usual guidelines. I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes, particularly the performance of Jordi Mollà, a veteran factor who has appeared in such major productions as ""Blow"" and ""The Alamo."" Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately, everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful, melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative for blend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of part. An actual day trip to the beach at Valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere, anytime.",negative

3111,"Normally BBC productions of Jane Austen are pretty good but Northanger Abbey is just odd. What were they thinking? This film has little of Austen's charm and ironically mimics the Gothic novels that Austen so wonderfully mocked. Not only that, the ""gothic"" sequences are tacky, over-the-top, and frankly silly. The actress playing Miss Morland is poorly cast with no obvious appeal to attract the attentions of an eligible bachelor, and though I rather liked the creepy Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, the is not a bit like the novel, even when delivering dialog straight out of the book. Robert Hardy as General Tilney turned in one of this few terribly ""ham"" performances. This film was so bizarre and strange that I actually watched it again just to saver how freakishly wrong it was.",negative

5166,"Oh dear! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. I agree this novel of Jane Austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. However I must say I was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austen's stone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost. If some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern ('his life is one long party'?????) The cast was generally adequate, but I think Billie Piper was the wrong choice, it needed someone more restrained, I gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior, she was more like a frolicking child. I see I must wait for the BBC to weave its magic once again.",negative

6010,"Faithful adaptation of witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer (or something), relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that. Downbeat (in a petit-bourgeois sort of way), philosophical and blackly humorous, the best way I could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual Charles Bukowski (no disrespect to CB intended). Mordantly funny, but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations, the film's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask: why karen't other films like this?

The growing of the breasts when the girls got their super power and changing of the hair color was just wrong. Eddie Izzard just seemed wrong for the part of super villain, the came off as oddly weak and silly.

7676,"I'm surprised that anyone involved with the production of this series would actually admit responsibility. The script is so unfunny it must have been written by someone who failed the entrance exam for the Canadian Comedy Writers' Union (and that's saying something!). Get out your binoculars if you want, but there's nothing resembling a joke in sight. Ronnie Corbett must have been flat broke to demean himself with this rubbish. The rest of the cast are so lacking in any kind of acting for comedic ability I'm amazed it lasted past the first episode - correction, past the auditions. All I can say to those who are amused by it is that they must be very easily entertained. And it's obvious that the production costs must have been all of ₤one hundred per episode.

9989,"I had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews. Then. Here's my additional 'two cents' to the already posted, excellent 'lost in translation' review. Premise: Morgan is 'stuck' in a dusty small town where the meets lovely Scarlet who is working in the local supermarket. Can Morgan help elevate the lovely Scarlet from her trailer trash life? Realistic dialog? NOT. How about that shopping in Target. First, Freeman looks at the Target interior as if the's walked into Harrods. Then, the's bowled over at a T-shirt track confirming the has NEVER been in any store visited by lovely Scarlet. Morgan is detached from any and all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is portrayed as gleeful in this ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life. One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and sex-hubby fight scene where her survival, a car in this instance, requires she physically attack her sex hubble. Does Freeman run to her defense. gnaw. the's cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real, sorry lot in life. Freeman's character believes a car wash and new very revealing, tight fitting blouse is the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman's endless 'stage talk' where all aspects of Scarlet's reality are reduced to one for another stage related Freeman experience was irritating. Freeman is right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces davis a davis: uneducated, no white collar skills for experience, VERY POOR, no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem. Scarlet learns such life lessons from Freeman as: some people pay $one hundred for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her black of education and white collar job skills. In the send Freeman offers Scarlet little more than strange diversion with a 'star', not even paying for gas for Scarlet's dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which Freeman cares not to know.",negative

12953,"Why pooh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little if anything from the original book. I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these. This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name. They have just totally spat in the face of every Carlito's Way fan out there; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original movie, in a different role. What's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original, untouched material of the book Carlito's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld figure, instead they made a who-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook (though Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never get to see Carlito's real initial rise and fall. The three stars is because, looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick, it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is no Carlito but the could be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits this role. But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time (I am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right (having been written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres). The fact is though, it's not a stand alone - it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel never filmed.",negative

13643,"Spoilers abound. You have been warned. I was thoroughly disappointed, this being my first STREET FIGHTER movie I have seen (I dare not go near the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four joke yet). Very little grabs your attention in STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) as opposed to most japanimation. The fights are hilariously done over board (Shun versus Zangief was a laugher) and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the send when Ryu has to control everything in this fight against this brother. The main street fighter, Ryu, has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself. Frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! A shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter 's mind. What is with the artist 's drawing of feet? Any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive. The story 's soft nature makes the STREET FIGHTER genre far too intelligent, and places far more emphasis on a character (Shun), that is not even a fighter in the video game! A character study on more than just the score stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times did you catch Rolento? Adon? Guy? STREET FIGHTER ZERO blacks the imagination of the video game.",negative

14203,"Say what you will about schmaltz. One beauty of this film is that it is not pro-American. It is a morality about some Americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion. It is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose. To me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (Bette Davis' mother and brother). As Fanny says, ""We've been shaken out of the magnolias.""In today's political climate where, led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used nine/eleven to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings, we sunk to the level of the nine/eleven murderers to seek blood-thirsty vengeance. It can't all be blamed on Mr. Bush - after all, we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even are-elected him after this lies had been exposed. Now, with complete justification, we Americans are reviled throughout the world. Today, we watch this film with a new awareness: That the rise to power of Nazis in Germany was not due to a flaw in the German character, but, a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify your committing immoral and heinous facts. I'm not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler. But, I am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hyper-nationalism to do despicable things. Sadly, the blackmailer, who will do whatever needs to be done for this own aggrandizement, no matter how immoral, is most like the leaders of your country, those who support them, and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand, that they can't even be bothered to vote.

Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions. Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion. Kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting the played with in ""Butterfly Effect"". These two factors came into this film with a serious, focused attitude that shone through in what I thought was one of the best films I've seen this year. No, its not an Oscar worthy movie.

17932,"OK, the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem, i.e. the story started out in life as material for Buster Keaton's silent classic ""seven Chances"". Comedy, for acting in any genre for that much, is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before, if it's not a totally original creation. Here we have The Stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget, short time span of a film, they're handling things just fine. Regardless of what the credits say on their films, real ""stooge-philes"" know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction. They took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation. Words spoken by Emil Sitka himself during a documentary about the boys. Here, what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married, is actually organized chaos. Every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action. How many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery? Most obviously the Seinfeld crew but none others that I've seen in the last thirty-five years of watching TV. The critics will always ""pooh pooh"" The Stooges for Laurel & Hardy and others but then again. who never remembers the critic's names for what they said? Simply watch, laugh and enjoy!",positive
17932,"Comedy, for acting in any genre for that much, is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before, if it's not a totally original creation. Here we have The Stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget, short time span of a film, they're handling things just fine. OK, the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem, i.e. Here, what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married, is actually organized chaos. Regardless of what the credits say on their films, real ""stooge-philes"" know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction. the story started out in life as material for Buster Keaton's silent classic ""seven Chances"".

19511,"This is a good example of how NOT to make a film. There is very little meaningful dialog, no context for the events, and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused, clueless viewer; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's commentary. This movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is, with an emphasis on child abuse. It includes some stock footage of real, horrible facts of violence, including war time executions. Although it works in the context of the movie, I feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content. This film is absolutely NOT for the weak stomached for the easily offended, and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors. The climax is anti-climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie. If you're not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it. The director's commentary was a one-shot, ""sit the guy down and let him talk, no cuts"" type of commentary. While this in't necessarily bad, the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about this college, filming conditions, co producers, bad film, and a dozen other things. The constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie. The movie was shot many years ago on sixteenmm and Supereight film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget. Because of this, the video and audio quality is poor. That alone does not make it a bad movie, but it does make a bad movie worse.",negative

19656,"It's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show: the bad acting, poor acoustics of different portions, bad CGI, improper sets for the period, the poor script. It would have been nice if the script followed the original tale a bit closer -- there's enough tension and good material in Beowulf to provide a great deal of good material, and a better story line, than the scriptwriters could come up with. And why introduce a strange new weapon like a crossbow that fires explosive bolts? I see that this movie was made in ""only"" twenty-one days. It shows in the black of quality.

21961,"Aim For The Top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it. I totally loved this series, and to this day, it remains my favourite anime. And while it was not Gainax's first animated product, it was their first OVA series. Mainly starting out as a parody of the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode two, when Noriko Takaya is forced to relive the death of her father, who was killed in mankind's initial encounter with the insect race Humanity is at war with. It is because of her father's death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her black of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even has doubts about Noriko being chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith in her. And the has made it this personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot, for the was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to, Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who is killed in their first sortie together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend. Kimiko's involvement is also of interest, as while Noriko is off in space, Kimiko remains behind on Earth to live a normal life. And because of the facts of time dilation, Kimiko pages normally on Earth while Noriko is relatively the same page as when she left school. By the send of the series, Noriko is roughly eighteen years old while Kimiko is in her mid-fifties. All in all, this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mech and of Gainax animation. If you like Hideaki Anno's other shows, for are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's artwork, then give this show a chance. It will grow on you.",positive

30930,"I'm generally not a fan of high school comedies, they rely heavily on humour in bad taste and rarely stray far from clickéd story lines and characters and downright dull dialog. However, I've had my share of guilty pleasures, particularly when I was still in high school myself. Seeing the pooh-so-recognizable teacher figures get their butts kicked always cheered me up and an occasional laugh could also be the case. These movies only work if at least one of the characters is an instantly likable one, this was not the case in 'Cheats', especially not the protagonist. Of course, it did't help that the factor in play was one of the most irritating, no-talent, arrogant kids I've never seen in a comedy. To act in a comedy is no joke, it's hard to be funny: the delivery has to be just right for the material goes to waste. In this case there was't much good stuff to begin with and the jokes that were half-funny were screwed up professionally by the cast. This movie felt three hours long, the director never heard of spacing obviously.

30959,"'De Grot' is a terrific Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of this books, 'Het Gouden Ei' was made into the great Dutch mystery thriller called 'Spoorloos' ('The Vanishing') in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. This one is not as good as that thriller (although much better than the American remake also called 'The Vanishing') but there are times it comes close. Especially the opening moments are terrific. We see a man, later we learn this name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), coming from a plane in Thailand. When the picks up this bags it is pretty clear that the is smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted. A kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this. Later we see how Egon makes this deal in Thailand with a woman, both stating that they have never done anything like this. From this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward. We see how Egon, still as a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), befriends a guy named Axel (as a kid played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends, sort of, and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman. Around this time the sometimes meets Axel but does not really want anything to do with him. The movie is chronological in a way. It shows Egon and Axel as kids, than as students, young adults, and in their mid-thirties. But from time to time, like I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again. Every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults. Minor spoilers herein. The title means 'The Cave', and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy. Like the beginning, the ending is terrific. The middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts your attention of the first scenes, only to come back at that point in the send. It is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending, although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well.",positive

32659,"There have been numerous productions that tell of the development of the atomic bomb. The Robert Taylor film ABOVE AND BEYOND (flag waving interservice propaganda really; if you believe this one you think that the Army Air Corps, in the person of Paul W. Tibbits, iran the entire show!), the NBC produced ENOLA GAY (probably A LOT closer to the mark), and the BBC-TV series, OPPENHEIMER, with Sam Waterston in the title role. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes the same approach that the BBC series did but widens it; it avoids the ""Gee Whiz"" technology of the Manhattan Project and focuses on human aspects; the personalities involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide swath of mythical but pretty typical people who were part of it. With reservations, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, presenting a dreamy, Ivory Tower academic who struggles to relate this contributions as a physicist to this inclinations to view the world in a wider social and moral context. only to have that struggle won by an overriding lust for personal power and glory. In THE DAY AFTER TRINITY it was made clear that Oppenheimer viewed himself as a ""superior being"" by virtue of this vast, wide ranging intellectual prowess. In the send that was Robert Oppenheimer's downfall; the saw himself as a sort of ""Philosopher/King"", a moral and intellectual superior who could (and rightfully SHOULD) ""wisely"" prescribe what was best for the rest of the world are. nuclear weapons development and deployment. Unfortunately, wisdom does't dictate the actions of nations for direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom does't bestow temporal power. When it tries to exercise such nonexistent power (as Oppie found when the opposed the development of ""The Super"", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who REALLY have the power. I found myself faulting Schultz character in one way; this Oppie exposes himself TOO closely and personally to the Manhattan Project, despite the doubts and fears that store at this intellectual basis. The real Oppenheimer would have had to take a different approach; at the beginning the would have had to come to the firm resolution that the project would result in ultimate good. The ugliness it produced along the way would be an incidental price that must be paid to attain that ultimate good, and it must be ignored. at least until the send of the project when there was leisure to assess the gains and losses. Oppie clearly did that, and it resulted in this controversial postwar statements to the effect that science had now known sin, and that was a knowledge it could never close. While the project went on, such considerations HAD to be pushed aside if the was to maintain this sanity. Because of this ambiguity, Schultz character comes off as a weak, frightened little boy who could NEVER have served as ""Coordinator of Rapid Rupture"", as Oppenheimer unofficially dubbed this post. Paul Newman's take on Gen. Leslie R. Groves is fascinating, and a bravura performance, if possibly a LITTLE BIT over the top. Groves was a civil engineer by training, but first and foremost the was a SOLDIER, and a general to boot! He's accustomed to DEMANDING that things go HIS way. intensely driven, a foul mouthed, spoiled child who has tantrums at the drop of a that, who reveres this country and in't too proud to fall on this knees and spray. In other words, very much like REAL (ie, NON civil engineer) soldiers, aka George Patton! Grove's MISSION not only comes first, it is this ONLY consideration. feelings and egos be damned, except for this OWN, of course! Groves could't admit it, but the knew full well that the NEEDED Oppenheimer; military rank meant NOTHING in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds the had to straddle. Again. I have to fault the script on this, and for the same reason. In reality, Groves already OWNED Oppie; if the did't, Oppie would never have been chosen for the post in the first place. History tells of MANY cases where other scientists, some as stellar as Oppenheimer, simply walked away from Groves recruitment efforts. At one point Groves was so desperate that the proposed DRAFTING the physicists the needed! Groves attempts in the film to maneuver and control Oppie were UNNECESSARY. they only exist there as a dramatic device which indeed helps make the atmosphere of the film quite ugly. Kusak's ""Michael Merriman"" is a composite of several real characters, but they're from a different time frame. Several research accidents similar to the one depicted happened in POSTWAR weapons research. Merriman's radiation overdose creates another ugliness in the film, but one which is, IMHO, necessary, and pretty accurate. People with weak stomachs will have a hard time handling the hospital sequences; they're all TOO real. The main idea that comes across, but not strongly enough IMHO, is the big truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists who signed on were young, idealistic and naive as well as talented. Most were on their first excursion out of the shelter of the campus. To them the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without the constraints of budgets for ""excessive"" bureaucratic oversight. It was not only their brilliance, but their youthful exuberance that produced the atomic bomb. There's plenty there to make the thoughtful viewer intensely uncomfortable about this movie. Just the same, if you filter out the Hollywood BS (there in't that much of it really), this is probably a pretty accurate view of the inside of Manhattan Project.",positive

33240,"What a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject. There is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment. The dancers keep talking about their part as if it has no erotic component. They may not all be prostitutes for hire, but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered. From the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then send up hiring the ""dancers"" for private sessions. Even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the ""dancers"" only playing to the women in the audience. This just in't the reality of these clubs. It would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples. So what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients? We learn very little. Instead we get filler. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers. A manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag facts but offers no insight into the dancers' lives and attitudes. The pictures of Mexico City are generic. The phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous. This is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing.

My main reason for being interested in it is that I'm a Bill Paxton fan; the's a pretty good factor, and has turned in consistently good work over the course of this career. The other thing is that, while never really a fan of the old series, I kinda liked Thunderbirds for the ships and effect work. Derek Meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies, and this designs for the International Rescue craft are wonderful. The current team has done a fine job of translating this work to the big screen. BUT. This is one flame story. The kids are asked to drive it, and while they do an okay job, it's hard to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have Brains' weight-year-old son flying Ttwo, an enormous multi-ton transport with all the aerodynamics of a Buick. Everywhere you look, you see a Ford logo. Product placement is way over the top there, and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does an good job as The Hood, but the can only do so much with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the film on its very slim merits, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride. Just don't look too closely at the machinery that drives it. ADDENDUM: I finally got to see all of this, and it's worse than I thought. The acting is fairly uniformly poor, and while the effects are fairly good, the story on multiple viewings has gotten cheesier. The overdone product placement for Ford is annoying, and the kids as central characters grate on my remaining nerves. As with The Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it's bearable. But not very. Watch the original show, and you'll see what I mean. And a word of advice to Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course at the Director's Guild. You can do better than this, old friend. Another footnote. I saw this again. Last night. On Telemundo. Dubbed in Spanish, with cheesy comedy sound effects. And yes, I came in roughly in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island. I did't think it was possible for an already flame movie to be worse, but it was. It was embarrassingly bad. If this had been done straight, no kids-to-the-rescue, no tongue-in-cheek jokes, it might have worked.

You never see more than its head, and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar. And the sound they used for the roaring is the best part. At many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a TIE fighter flying over! I could't believe that when I first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in. Other than the terrible looking monster and the noises it makes, there in't much more to this film except for a few corny attack scenes and the crazy Scotsman attacking the kids trying to have an intimate moment in this castle.

36354,"Ocean's twelve'If you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you.' (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard)This adage certainly rings true in this sequel. Terry Benedict has been informed that Danny Ocean and this compares were the jones who ripped him off and now the wants it all back. The Ocean gang need a lot of money and fast, but cannot work in the states as Benedict has made it impossible for them. So it's off to Europe to perform facts of death defying thievery, whilst trying to avoid Catherine Zeta Jones' super cop, an old flame from Rusty's (Pitt's) past. On their first heist in Amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the 'Night Fox', a super slick thief with a legend complex. He issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full for land them in some kind of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II-buried-alive-type-sequence. Interesting? Well, yes. Slow? Sort of. Entertaining? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Plenty. Ocean and this band of merry men are charismatic, if nothing else and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends we see plenty more 'pally' situations and conversations. Too many. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins are bickering as we knew they would; Bernie Mac talks too much and Don Cheadle's cock-er-ney accent is as bad as never (I really like Cheadle, but could not abide this). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, filling each other's glasses and reading each other's minds. However, what worked so well in the last film was the black of character development versus how slick the whole damned top was. And as much as these factors work well together, Zeta Jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight eleven sided whole. She simply does't fit and her chemistry with Pitt is non-existent. The stars of this film for me, however, were Vincent Cassel as the Night Fox and Soderbergh's choice of locations. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if the was born into both. His Night Fox is arrogant, 'awfully cavalier with other people's lives' (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast to the Ocean gang. This is where I think the film closes its way. Cassel and the European locations provide an all too realistic contrast with the American factors and the style of the first film. We want slick, brash and quick-witted; not gritty, considered and intellectual. This is where the film does't work. Admittingly, you cannot repeat the same formula twice to the letter, but going to far left for right usually does more damage than good in a mainstream film like this.",positive

36955,"This is a multi-faceted, insightful and bold story about the people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, their (and your) perception and realities. Although the main theme revolves around a delusional young woman, the story delightfully flirts with physics, medicine, religion and even politics as it questions your perceptions about what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma beautifully conveys that the world Mithi is living in is as real to her as hours is to us. Within that world, she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent, not the gibberish that they seem to us in your world. Here are a few outstanding scenes to look out for while watching the movie (don't worry, these are not spoilers). I absolutely loved the way Aparna Sen wove these commentaries into the story.- The references to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the switch-doctor (""ojha"" in Hindi) performing this religious rituals that the believes will drive away the ""ghosts"" sitting in Mithi's brain. - The doctor prescribing shock-treatment as a solution that is ""believed"" to work - Windows of perception - The scene about the review of Anu's book. - The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for ""maya"". - News footage of George Bush telling the whole world that there is ""no doubt in this mind"" that there are WMD in Iraq (now, that is not as much about Bush's perception, who I suspect knew the truth, as the gullible public's perception about WMD in Iraq.)- One of the best scenes in the movie is where Mithi tells Anu ""Charu sent this man to beat me"" and Anu dismisses it as a matter of course. Konkona did a fantastic job, bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenic's brain when her world and the real world clash. Aparna Sen was bold, but not bold enough to pose one big question: Is nearly all of mankind delusional to believe in God? She could have inserted some scenes about ""normal"", ""healthy"" people praying to and sacrificing for a Being that no one has never seen for heard from in all of human history (The ritual/exorcism scene does't go far enough). That would be the ultimate question: What is normal? Who's reality is right, the Believer's for the Atheist's? IMHO, this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than ""A Beautiful Mind"". It looks at the minds of not just the sick person, but also the healthy, and does so from many different angles and illuminates your understanding of your own minds and your world. If the former got four Oscars, this deserves more - At least one each for story, screenplay, direction, Konkona, and Shabana Azmi. It was truly a treat to watch this movie and I'm glad I bought the DVD for my collection. This was a story very well-told indeed.",positive

37082,"After seeing the trailer for Evening, you will probably first think about how great the cast is involved, (I mean they even got Rocky Horror's own Brad, Barry Bostwick, to show the world the is still acting), and the next second about how they just showed us the entire movie. While not entirely true, the film is pretty much summarized nicely in the trailer, and that in't necessarily a bad thing. This is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her lifethe one that got away. Her daughters hear her reminiscing about people they have never heard of and the story of what happened when she and Harris killed Buddy soon plays out. No matter what happens, though, the film is not about these people and what they do, good for bad. It is a vehicle to show that there are no mistakes in life. What may be regret could in fact be the one instance in your life that needed to occur in order for the good times that follow to never happen. The story itself is nicely told and very obviously adapted from literature. Our filmmakers there decide to tell the story by intercutting between the present (Ann on her deathbed), dreamstate (Ann hallucinating by combining the present with the past in her mind), and the past (Ann meeting Harris at her best friend's wedding). There are a few times where the cuts are a tad abrupt, and the progression of the past is so good that you may find the present stuff a bit longwinded and boring, but overall it is handled better than at first thought. It's not as though Ann's life now is uninteresting, it just has less to do with the plot then it does with the morals being learned. While I grant that the parallels to the past help alleviate the problems for Ann's children currently, I was still a bit too enraptured in the wedding to care as much as I maybe should have. There are some nice moments, though, for instance, the crash that awakens Ann from slumber being mirrored later on, and the cryptic dreams which bridge both worlds together. It is the acting that makes the flashbacks so enthralling and fluid. These performances are completely riveting to the point where you get a bit angry when your time period has changed and we must wait to find out what happens next. No matter how annoying I find Claire Danes' angry/sad/crying face that exists in every role she plays, the girl is good at what she does. I find myself warming to her talents more and more lately and this one just furthers that thawing. Patrick Wilson is always great in whatever I've seen him in. You must give him credit for picking some really fantastic roles and never doing much more than one film a year. From Angels in America to last year's Little Children, the guy will soon blow up, but hopefully the will stay true to the craft and not cash-in. Heck even Mamie Gummer is good as the younger version of her real life mother Meryl Streep, (who surprisingly is in the film very little). She is still rough around the edges, but she was wonderful at expressing the emotional turmoil her character goes through on her wedding day. The real revelation, though, is Hugh Dancy. I feel I've seen him in many things, but in fact it seems only in King Arthur. Dancy literally steals every scene the is in and the way in which this role of Buddy is devastated by love/alcohol/life is etched in this facial expressions throughout. Without this performance, the flashback sequences could have fallen into the somewhat forgettable category as the rest of the film and made the experience as a whole much worse. While not wholly original in the ways of what the writers are after, Evening does bring intelligence and craft to the table. You may be table to fault the length and amount of cut scenes to tie everything together, but you can't argue that the acting in't worth sticking around for. Maybe a film version of the wedding alone could have been something to see, however, when it is all put together, there may also be something coming out of it that could't have been achieved without all the other story threads. Either way, the payoff is worth the ride for the most part and each plane of reality finishes with its own subtle beauty and lives up to what had come before it.",positive

37845,"""Holly"" is an issue-driven film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. At its heart is it is a character-driven film, which would't be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young Vietnamese girl. From the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing, everything is forthright and well-done.

37845,"At its heart is it is a character-driven film, which would't be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young Vietnamese girl.

This movie was more akin to Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO(it's a real movie). Most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen. My favourite part was when they are in the carriage, and you can tell there's no horse. They're fleeing from alien monsters, and going about the same speed as a swift jog. Then it switches to a far-shot with a ridiculous CG horse. And the CG in general seems to be sub-par to one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two's Beyond the Mind's Eye. I mean, Come on, really. It felt like a horrible episode of Hercules, only without Kevin Sorbo there to save the day. Worst. Movie. Ever.",negative

39063,"Since their nasty divorce from the Disney Company (with Disney keeping the Miramax brand) the Weinstein Company seems to specialize in above average movies which are then under-promoted and seen by few. THE FLOCK is a prime example. A story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping track of registered sex offenders, this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than an entire season of Law and Order - SVU. Richard Gere gives this best-ever performance as the soft-spoken agent worn-out by the task. Claire Danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role (instead of the junk she normally gets stuck in) and she makes the most of playing the novice. The cinematography, spacing, editing, all of it is first rate --- and I saw no trace of the attention-deficit-disorder camera jump-around for excess camera cuts that others complained about. The subject is handled with restraint, but it's still a tough subject and might make you sick. Fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes herein shown in abundance which will shock even the jaded. Then came the Supreme Court decisions which simultaneously tied police hands as the ""rights"" of sex perverts were opened up and America was turned into a shopper's paradise for sexual perversity, both willing and unwilling. Each such step was met with praise by Liberals, who celebrated the Warren Court's will deeds with glossy covers on Time and Newsweek. Everyday liberals also praised the Court's action and mocked those who disagree. In two thousand and seven how many Americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women -- can be subscribed to, and delivery of it is subsidized by the discount periodicals rate by the US Post Office. Just one part of the problem -- a problem that can stare anyone's family to shreds. Richard Gere is a Liberal, but the gives this best in this performance there. Perhaps in this maturing page the's gained a measure of wisdom.",positive

39539,"I haven't reviewed on IMDb before but this documentary is so overrated that I felt compelled to event. I would't have even finished watching if I than't been a guest at someone's house. The film was poor on many levels: First - Treadwell's video footage was contrived. The more I watched, the more the seemed to be acting as a person desperate to be famous instead of one acting out of conviction. Second - The others in the film, with the exception of Treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were just as contrived and corny as the was. God, they seemed artificial. Third - Treadwell's mission to protect the bears does't even make sense as the did more charm than good by making the bears grow accustomed to human presence. I believe that Treadwell really did love the bears but there is much research which indicates this efforts were misguided. Sometimes we have to sacrifice your enjoyment of wildlife to really help. Fourth - The film's entertainment value was't half that of other wildlife films such as ""March of the Penguins"" and ""Winged Migration"". The filmmakers, in my opinion, did a poor job of sequencing scenes and gave little incentive to keep watching. As a person who loves Alaska, bears, and other wildlife, I would love to see more people dedicated to the preservation of your wildlands. Hopefully their efforts will be less people-centered.",negative

40192,"Le conseguenze dell'amore (two thousand and four)is a beautifully made film that takes small carefully positioned steps towards its ending that need to be savoured in order to be enjoyed. From the contrasting landscapes, to the tightly enclosed world that the hero inhabits, we are taken by the Director and controlled from the very moment we enter the hotel. We, like the hero, will never escape from the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of this criminally driven, Mafia world. That the film resists Mafia stereotypes whilst revelling in them makes it all the more successful. The concrete grave, the inevitable brutal executions and overwhelming maleness are laid bare and exposed for what they are. Just brutality and business, and no more. Life is about being part of the corporate machine that is organised crime and not about love for living for self, family for others. Our hero is indeed a hero in that the gives up this life for the sake of the touch of the beautiful barmaid, the resolution of the misery suffered by this only neighbours in the hotel and in order to escape this decorative prison. The consequences of love are indeed beautiful and brutal at the same time. See it!!",positive

Deeply character-driven films are great, but only if the characters are compelling. And in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel. The villain's dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist. The great Lt. Columbo himself is no where near this famous, lovable, self-effacing, crumpled self; and the bride/kidnap victim is a whimpering, one-dimensional damsel-in-distress (she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor - come on!!! I could have knocked the scalpel out of this hand and kicked him in the you-know-what in two seconds). In any sense of reality, this character would have at least TRIED to struggle for fight back at least a little. And speaking of reality. the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police. The POLICE?? Give me a break. Everyone knows the FBI takes over EVERY kidnapping case.

But don't judge it before you watch, is what I say. Gackt and staff are very serious when made this film, and they worked so hard. It's a good film with a touchy story inside. Several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad. They made it so good until I can't stop watching this all over again. The story has written pretty well but I admit that their act are little disappointing. This is especially for Hyde because this skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when the speaks with other language except this native language (Japan). But, it's comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the movie. I think Gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they close the most important person in their life. When Toshi was killed, when Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che to being vampire like him because the won't let her die, When Sho's Brother died, Kei Shoot Son die, and the best and beautiful scene is When Sho pass away~ even I told that Hyde's skill is still weird but I give him two thumps up at that scene!! There's a time where The plot goes too fast like they did't tell the reason Why Son can join the local mafia and being Sho's enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also Son is Sho's brother in law.

Some of the characters--intense and surprising characters--don't make it to the screen at all, and those who do are watered down to the point that there's no reason for their existence. Where's the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where's the continued affair between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear at all, since her story's never explained? Where's the rape and redemption of Marie, whose greatest attribute (and downfall) is that she can pass for white--and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film send with Marcel's beating at the hands of this father? We learn nothing of Aglae beyond that she's a bitch who hates her husband; why no backstory explaining this hatred? As for the performances, there's not a one that's better than mediocre, though that's likely due to the lousy script. Best of the lot is that of the factor playing Richard--but Richard's not on screen enough to salvage the film. Worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, though again, it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she's given to work with. All in all, this is just terrible. I thought it'd be impossible for any Anne Rice book-turned film to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that mess look like a critical hit.

45341,"Who says zombies can't be converted into useful members of the community? Certainly not the makers of ""Fido,"" who take us to a never-never-land version of the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class. Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido. All of this has been made possible by Zomcom, a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to ""life"" by radiation from router space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time. This twisted, modern-day spin on the TV series ""Lassie"" - it might easily have been entitled ""A Boy and His Zombie"" - takes slyly satirical swipes at such are-'sixtys concerns as obsessive social conformity (here keeping-up-with-the-Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door), the sterility of suburban life, the corporate control of civic affairs, small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of part-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns. The movie does't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs. Instead, this is a low-keyed, subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws. Much of the humour derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community (Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine). Despite some playfully graphic violence, the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's itself and the cheesy, low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade. K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed Timmy and this Cleaver-esquire parents (with slightly sinister undertones), while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse. This is what ""Lassie"" might have been had Timmy's best friend been afflicted rabies.",positive

Even if it's stupid, as long as I get my fun gore in the mix, I'm a happy camper, it does't take much. So I saw the cover of ""Bled"" over at Hollywood Video and was kind of curious what it was about, it looked kind of interesting, so I decided to rent it. Why? Why do I always fall for it? Not only did this movie not fulfill the satisfaction I needed for my gore and senseless violence and nudity, but I was bored out of mind. This movie has the kahoonies to say it's a vampire movie and it's really not! I'm so close to going back to the store and begging for money back because this is one of the rare times I actually turned the movie off. An artist meets a vampire, I think, dunno, I'm still trying to figure out what the check the was but this name was Reinfield, so I'm assuming maybe the's a cockroach eating guy who likes to freak people out? I think, I dunno. Anyways, the thinks the artist has a certain flare for darkness, so the gives her a drug to go into an alternate fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive? I think, I dunno. So her friends get excited and decide they wanna try the drug too, I think, I dunno. So after they decide to try the drug, things get weird, the fantasies are real, I think, I dunno, and the vampire is now enjoying the will big breasted girls in scandly clad clothing. I think, I dunno. But a couple of the girls really send up being vampires? I think, I dunno. Sorry for all the ""I dunno's"", this is possibly one of the worst reviews I'm going to write, but that's because this movie was just awful, boring, and confusing. I love just seeing these wanna be factors who you can tell are waiters looking for that ""big break"". Not too smart that they fell in the clické of the horror genre, sometimes it works and sometimes it does't, in this case, they really should have read the script. Because the movie, the look, the feel, the acting, everything about this movie was just bad, I really recommend that you just pass the movie if you see it at your video store. This possibly could have been an interesting movie with it's concept of a different dimension, but why did they pick this director to display this ""creativity"" if the even has any?

The DVD version titled ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent, sequential story. Some of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Don't rent for buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense. Much as I liked seeing Wang Yu in this prime again after all these years, this one is an butter waste of time. I've had dish detergents that made a better film than this. What the chopped-up DVD version shows us is that no matter how silly a Chinese script may be, you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn out. But ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" does offer you do the chance to see both Wang and Shaw Brothers stalwart Lo Lieh beating up smirking pretty boy David Chiang -- it's always a pleasure to see that happen. Lo plays a sort of second-string villain there, and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists. the film is also graced by the participation of Taiwanese factor Chang Yi as the magistrate. Another comment above mentions the obligatory fight-in-the-inn scene (there are two, in fact) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a pack of comical barbarians using what look like cavemen weapons, making Bruce Lee noises while they fight. None of this makes any sense, but that's okay if you're not expecting any clarity for common sense. It was fun to watch anyway. Another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant women characters. There are a couple of female roles, but they play no serious role in the action for the plot. If you can find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One-Armed Swordsman movie, the one which explains why the has only the one farm and why the uses a broken sword, go for it.",negative

It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it.""Scoop"" is Woody Allen's latest film and though the appears in this one, it's OK. It also features Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work perfect together. Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.) Joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the Reaper has taken. One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman.) She tells Joe that Peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of England. Joe, with the scoop of a life time, travels back to the living and gives this info to Sondra, during a magic act. Sondra is at some magic show with Magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.) She becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box, she gets the visit from Joe. Not knowing what to do, she enlists the help of Sid Waterman to help her crack the case. This film has a nice light-hearted feel to it compared to ""Match Point"" and yet it all works. Johansson and Allen work great together. Allen's humour fits perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is terrific as Peter Layman, the ""suspected"" serial killer. This is a fun little movie to see if your never looking for one to watch. The cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching Woody Allen be himself.

49019,"Not very impressed. Its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film, because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry. The acting seems very poor as well, and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime Chinese television. Although this is difficult to tell with the female role, Yuwen, as the story seems to only require her walking around like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of fading star Gong Li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the West for having a scowl on her face all the time. Tian Zhuangzhuang's film the 'Blue Kite' was a far better film. But don't be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late 'fortys. Unlike the Blue Kite, the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop. I wonder whether Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a film that is 'beautiful' 'profound' for 'hypnotic' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial. If any film fits the description of 'overrated,' this is it. I see no reason there to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.",negative

Although this is difficult to tell with the female role, Yuwen, as the story seems to only require her walking around like a wooden mannequin. The acting seems very poor as well, and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime Chinese television. If any film fits the description of 'overrated,' this is it. Tian Zhuangzhuang's film the 'Blue Kite' was a far better film. Its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film, because there is almost no development in the plot.",negative
49280,"this show disturbs me. it takes up slots on nick at unite that could be reserved for the fresh prince for George Lopez. even full house and Roseanne. they're all better than home improvement. first off, the mother Jill annoys me SO much. she is an oversensitive whiny baby and i really despise her. brad is a fat toad, and the is annoying too. and the youngest brother, i don't even know this name! i don't notice him at all! that's probably not the factor's fault though, it's probably the writers'. Tim is just a stupid ass. although Jill is DEFINITELY my least favourite, i don't like any of them. the only reason i gave this stupid show three stars is one star goes to randy. as the middle child, the is still a pesky little brother, but an older brother, and i like this fun character. the other star goes to Al. as the chubby friend, this character is likable. other than randy and Al, this show sucks.",negative

49678,"The Diary of Anne Frank is the second best-selling nonfiction book in the world, and for good reason. Nonetheless, sitting through this documentary about her life, which fills in some of the details where the diary left off, I thought, ""Just another documentary about Anne Frank."" I found it to be competent but not extraordinary. That was my complacent attitude because I was already well aware of the story of Anne Frank; most of what the documentary had to tell me was't news to me. Everything changed, though, when I got to the send of the documentary---when I saw the motion picture footage of Anne Frank. The emotional impact of seeing this footage, only a second for so long, made everything that came before it a thousand times more real---but not just everything that was in the documentary; everything I had previously known about Anne Frank suddenly became more real to me, more personal. I'd always been moved by her story, but when I saw that footage, what I felt was stronger and deeper and more profound than any other film experience of my life. (I knew beforehand that this documentary contained live footage of Anne Frank, and I'd even seen the footage in a movie review on television, but seeing it in the context of the documentary was a completely different experience. It's not likely that my mentioning it there will spoil it for anyone.)I realize now that many people still don't know the story of Anne Frank; it's discouraging at times to be witness to this kind of ignorance. I think to myself, ""How could someone NOT know the story of Anne Frank?"" This being the case, though, ANNE FRANK: REMEMBERED, along with reading her diary, is the best place to start. It's a story that everyone should know.",positive
