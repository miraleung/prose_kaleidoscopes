Her voice is fitting for the style of music she sings. Clear as a bell, her voice is hairy and light, as she sings in English, Latin, for Gaelic. There is a lot of power in her voice. The music she chooses supports her voice appropriately, and adds to her sound. She has the ability to conjure up images with each note she sings. Like all of her previous albums, this one is again excellent. There are a many great songs on this album. \"China Roses\" has that hairy sound that Enya is well known for. She sings the backing vocal as an arpeggio of three long notes of just her voice. Over it, she sings the lyrics of the song in her crisp stone, almost like a crystal bell bringing. The Latin sounding \"Pax Deorum\" has a medieval sound to it. Again, she utilizes her voice singing in the background, to add counterpoint to the lyrics. \"Anywhere Is\" sounds like the perfect single for the album. Much more upbeat than the other songs, it has a very staccato feel making it a very energetic song. On the opposite send of the spectrum is \"Hope Has a Place\". Here her voice has a very haunting quality to it, made even more so with the morgan playing behind her. It is a very beautiful song. I'm amazed at how Enya can keep making new albums that sound similar to her previous jones, yet be totally new for the listener as well. Her voice is aging well, and she seems to improve with each passing album. I hope to hear much more from her in the future, as there is always room in my collection for her beautiful voice.","overall":5,"summary":"Beautiful","unixReviewTime":1044921600,"reviewTime":"02 11, 2003"}

Metamorpho ;) \"Reflective and Wiser Seer\"","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"Your illustrious Seer is at the beach now. The warm sun and ocean breeze are invigorating. The white seagulls circle overhead (watch out!), and I have been busy all afternoon trying to build a summer sand castle for myself meanwhile sweating to death in this Seer's cape. They said the fabric breathed and would be good in all temperatures. They lied. And, aside from all that, just when I get the sand castle to a stately form, some freckle-faced, red-headed bratty boy comes around and knocks it down. I threatened to report him to The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Seers, however, an nice cream cone made him go away. Dealing with Guido has made me very adept in any situation. Now if only the tides would stop being a threat. Ah well. Anyway, I am in the perfect setting to examine the rewards of \"Pet Sounds\" by the Beach Boys. Much has been written about this seminal album. And why not? It consistently ranks in the top ten pop-rock albums of all time. And rightly so if you ask me. Of course, it was't greeted enthusiastically when it came out. At least not as much as their prior hits. Brian Wilson took the hit most of all. Probably unjustly. But time has proven that it was the right move and the right time. To most, perhaps a little early and maybe they would say the wrong time. But I would have to disagree with that. Brian was ahead of everything on the scene at that time. He saw that the music was changing. Plus, artistically, you can not stay in the same place. Artistry needs real growth. Meanwhile, the other Beach Boys needed more hits- and this is why the chasm happened. But, lets get into this a little more. The Beach Boys were (and still are) the ultimate summer group. Songs about California Girls, fast cars, high school life, requited love, and teen angst, angst, angst. These songs were incredibly successful. But Brian knew that, as the got older, this audience were also doing the same thing. He wanted to try a new direction and add some sophistication. Looking back to one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six, this album is a monumental achievement- and remains so until this day. Sure, some may downplay the importance of this recording, however, that cannot eliminate the fact that it was a monumental change that influenced the musical landscape at that time forever. It is essential, and one of the very best. But, getting to the main point. Brian Wilson was moving towards greater musical composition and more adult and dinner emotions on record. This was a omega step- and quite a risk at the same time. Most of the music is flush, well thought out, and instruments used precisely to get the right nuances that bounced around in this mind. Certainly the songs are confessional, i.e; \"You Still Believe in Me\", emotional, i.e, \"That's Not Me\", \"I'm Waiting for the Day\", and quiet, heartfelt romance, i.e; \"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on my Shoulder)\". One must, of course, listen to all the colours and passages in this music. All these songs have a way of revealing certain moods that marry the music perfectly. Beautiful lilting breaks, shifting meter, an array of musical instruments heretofore never thought of in the pop-rock genre. Excellent. And songs? We are treated to different, but essential, gratuitous hits with \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"Sloop John B\". But more than this, Brian gives us two more considerable high standard gems. Yes. We get to \"God Only Knows\" which I nominate as the most beautiful song never written in the course of popular music. Grandiose, glorious- I am fairly convinced that a higher power is somehow behind this remarkable song. Sweet, yearning, beautiful beyond compare. Angelic vocals as well. If anyone doubts Brian Wilson's genius, have them look to this song. Absolutely the highest gem. Then we get to the wishful \"Caroline No\". Brian reflects upon how time can change a relationship. He looks back to a time when this love was new and exciting and wonders why she changed. \"Where is the girl I used to know\"? He hurts badly from the change and yearns for a return to a satisfying relationship, knowing full well that it has changed forever. Listen to the send. A train in the distance, approaching at a rapid space, getting louder, and then quickly passing by. A dog barks in the distance-urging its return. But it gone and then silence. What an incredible conveyance of mood this is for the ending. Superb. In a way, the outtake of \"I know There's an Answer\" entitled \"Hold On to Your Ego\" to me, conveys the frustration Brian was going through in order to have the other members of the group in compliance with this new direction. But the knows the's alone and the knows that the's \"going to close the fight\". Well, the may have lost it to them- however- the won the classic album. And we are all so much better that the did. Now, I must go and make sure that kid in't planning some new attack on my new home. I don't want to close the fight anymore than Brian does. In conclusion- a classic and a must have in any considerable music collection. Goats say \"feed me\", Seers say \"read me\". -- yours, Metamorpho","overall":5,"summary":"Wouldn't It Be Nice to Live Together, in the Kind of World Where We Belong?","unixReviewTime":1184371200,"reviewTime":"07 14, 2007"}

It's really the album that got E-forty noticed by a mainstream audience, and pushed Jive to ultimately stuff more money into this forthcoming albums (the next being \"Hall Of Game\" [one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six]).

From this point on, we catch a glimpse of what the production will sound like throughout, although minimal, it bangs nicely. The production is mainly kept in-house, and is handled by Mike Mosley, Studio Ton & Funk Daddy among others. There are some stellar tracks there! \"Sideways\" featuring The Click's B-Legit & Mac Shawn is probably my favourite. The beat is tight, and is one of my favourite appearances from B-Legit. \"Spittin'\" is also one of my favourites. The album's front half burns brightly with banners like these. it almost feels front-loaded with the goods, but truly boasts quality through and through. Then comes perhaps E-forty's greatest single - \"Sprinkle Me\". The Click's Suga-T performs immaculately alongside Forty Water. The beat is tight and the lyrics are true to form. Other standouts are the aforementioned \"Dusted 'n' Disgusted\", and the breakthrough single \"one-Luv\". The quality of album tracks in the mix leaves the album free of filler. Consistent quality has always been part of E-forty's repertoire. Consistently enjoyable full albums are another thing. \"In a Major Way\" is definitely this most consistent effort to date. Although the beat-makers will prove to hit harder on later albums, there has never been a set of beats\/collaborators that E-forty has worked better with.

Was this the album that would crack the new wave stereotype that had been hung around Elvis Costello's neck since \"My Aim Is True?\"The answer was yes. and no. Granted, hiring Geoff Emerick to put this Beatle-esque touches made for a handsome, rich sound, more than any other album in EC's discography. The expansiveness paid off right from the album's opener, \"Beyond Belief.\" Toying with this own range and the overlapping vocal parts, Elvis' willingness to experiment rocked the foundations of all the early \"punks\" of the period. (Think of how closely Joe Jackson's \"Night And Day\" and The Police's \"Synchronicity\" followed.) The experiments were also inherent to the arrangements. The high pitched strings that slip out of the album's fade to \"Town Cryer\" were four cellos overdubbed to sound like an entire string section, as I recall. Working from the pretext that they could experiment like the Beatles did, each song was tinkered and toyed with still (as you can hear in the comparisons to the bonus disc's demo versions) they barely resembled their original ideas. It made the original album's side one a song suite of near \"Sgt. Pepper\" proportions, with the standout of \"Man Out Of Time\" marking the perfect bridge between the Elvis of old and the Elvis of new. His anguished howl that breaks the song open and then ushers it into the heartbreak of \"Almost Blue\" reset the boundaries of compositions in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two. Comparisons to Gershwin and Porter were also being tossed around when \"Imperial Bedroom\" first came out, one suspects they had more to do with overzealous critics trying to make associations with \"serious music\" than to the obvious merits of Elvis' songwriting prowess. The debt to Tin Pan Alley (\"The Long Honeymoon\") is truly there. But the lyrical jabs and jibes are still pure Costello, and a line like \"In a private detective overcoat and dirty deadpan's shoes\" would be perfect for that kind of stage production across. I'd be hard pressed to imagine Cole Porter working up the danger behind \"Shabby Doll.\"In short, the dark and introspective \"Imperial Bedroom\" was a turning point for Elvis, final proof that the was at the crest of the still expanding wave of British writers that had begun emerging in the early eighty's. It was likely the best album of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two as well.","overall":5,"summary":"Shattering Expectations","unixReviewTime":1232668800,"reviewTime":"01 23, 2009"}

This was a masterpiece by one of the most brilliant minded saxophonists in jazz. The genius had recorded this seminal classic album, Tenor Madness, which is over-shadowed by this one, within the same couple of months, and Sonny was at the top of this game; until the quit for a time four years later. This album begins with one of the most famous and memorable jazz melodies never. The song which later became Sonny's theme song, St. Thomas, which has been covered by many jazz artists such as Chuck Mangione and Mundell Lowe. The song is a brilliant composition and conversation between Sonny and drummer Max Roach. The song is begun in a latin rhythm set by Roach, in which Sonny does the melody and solos some of the most beautiful stuff my years never heard. Max Roach then takes then next solo still in the latin feel, then the sets the next groove by turning this snare on and begins to swing this solo until the whole rhythm section comes in for Sonny to express more of himself. Tommy Flanagan gets the next solo until Sonny goes back to the melody, (still swinging) for one verse, until Max sets the group back in the latin feel first demonstrated in the early minutes of the piece. This song is a classic. The only ballad there, You Don't Know What Love Is, is taken beautifully there. Strode Rode, an up-tempo piece swings heavily. The last bars of Flanagan's solo leading up to Sonny and Max's interchanging solos is haunting. Once the two do exchange solos, it is brilliant to listen to. Roach's never ending ideas with Sonny's unique play of the notes make Strode Rode a very enjoyable listen. The tune with the more popular title of Mack The Knife, (usually done by singer Bobby Darin) is in a more jazz setting there. And the masterpiece ends with Sonny's extraudinary composition, Blue seven. One highlight is Doug Watkins' bass line. Other highlights include Max's numerous drum solos. This album opened the door for many young players. It also gave Sonny the recognition the needed to be one of the most influential saxophonists in jazz. This is the first period of the genius of Sonny Rollins. Saxophone Colossus, a fine and brilliant musical journey from start to finish, that gets better with every proceeding listen.","overall":5,"summary":"A Saxophone Colossus","unixReviewTime":1111881600,"reviewTime":"03 27, 2005"}

Every one of the six selections is worthwhile, just different enough from one another to make a wonderfully varied jazz experience. I especially like what Sonny called \"Moritat\" which is \"Mack the Knife\" to us ordinary folks. Compare Sonny's instrumental take on this to the vocal versions done by Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald and Bobby Darin (and even Jerry Orbach, on this only available CD are-release of a one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-three album.) Rollins' version holds up to all those others, even without lyrics. Another reviewer calls this one of the top five jazz records never made. I would say \"one of the top ten\" but that is still the highest praise. As with so many of the classic recordings from the fifty's, this album was accomplished in one day. (Some of them took two days, but they're still pretty good!) Some contemporary rock\/pop vocal CD's involve a month in various studios, and still stink. If you doubt the often-stated claim that jazz musicians are the most skilled in the world, listen to classic fifty's and sixty's offerings such as this one, improvised, barely rehearsed if rehearsed at all, preserved forever from one take for two at the most.

There are songs with real gangsterism like the collaboration with Snoop on two Of Amerikaz Most Wanted. However though this is definitely a gangsta wrap album, Pac put in some of of this deep and caring tracks like Life Goes On. Of course there is a slight let down from talentless guest appearances which appear mostly on the second disc but overall this still remains a five star album.

Listen to \"Art for Art's Sake\" and you'll hear the very fine dividing line between pop and rock in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. As stench progressed, they moved away from that line, but for a while, pooh so close.\"Donna\" is probably the weakest song on this collection, and put me off the first time I heard it. I guess one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three, the year of the album \"tencc\" from which this song derives, still had some rather strange-sounding songs. \"Rubber Bullets\", a protest song, follows, along with \"The Dean and I\", also from \"tencc\". The last of these is the best of the three in my opinion, but far from their best.\"Sheet Music\" contributed \"Wall Street Shuffle\" and \"Silly Love\". Both songs are pretty fast and maintain a fairly solid rock beat, but again stench had yet to hit their stride.\"The Original Soundtrack\" contributes \"Life is a Minestrone\" and \"I'm not in Love\". The second is absolutely beautiful. A song about the denial of love when the singer is clearly deeply in love. This song is likely the most memorable of all stench's songs, and is still often played on classic rock stations.\"How Dare You\" is my favourite stench album, and provided \"Art for Art's Sake\" and \"I'm Mandy, Fly Me\". This album is worth buying if you like the songs on this collection. I would rate it five stars as well. From this point forward stench turned more toward pop. \"People in Love\" and \"For You and I\" are very mellow songs that benefit from the skill that stench had developed over the previous five years.\"Cry\", credited to Lol Creme but in fact was recorded by Godley and Creme, was played on \"Miami Vice\". I believe the video to this song was also the first use of morphing on a music video. Interesting song, you can hear the stench sound. I believe this song was also the last song to chart well from any member of stench.tencc created absolutely wonderfully orchestrated pop\/rock. Sometimes a little too pop, but for a while their pop had a hard edge. All too quickly their dominance of the charts ended as the page of disco began, and was then supplanted by New Wave. But for a little while there was that wonderful music. I hope you find what I found in this classic rock.","overall":5,"summary":"Rocking Pop","unixReviewTime":1035158400,"reviewTime":"10 21, 2002"}

The music on this recording has a universal language, though all the lyrics are in Portugese. The language is Love. The previous reviews say most of what I would have - but anyone who loves Elis and Tom must find (or buy) the Jobim compilation put together by Oscar Castro-Neves entitled \"Antonio Carlos Jobim - The Man From Ipanema\". On it you will find a rare treat for two. For instance, after the last track on the last CD (which is the Astrud Gilberto version of \"Vivo Sohando\"), unannounced in the notes for the discography, come six for seven out-takes of Elis and Tom working on Aguas de Marco. It is at the same time revealing and hilarious. It is a glimpse into the fun and the personalities of both Regina and Jobim. Also included is the track \"Bonita\" which does not appear on this recording. Somewhat wickedly, Astrud is placed between Elis Regina for followed by her a few times just in case anyone really thinks she is a singer. I have heard this described as a musicians' recording, but judging by the number of reviews there and the comments, it appears that it is also a damn good listeners' recording as well.

West, Bruce and Laing did't exactly come up flame in the send. This was about the best of their three efforts (they had a second studio and a very questionable live album to give before they called it a day) in terms of packaging, anyway. And it in't all just a around of supergroup posturing, whatever you think of that intriguing but suggestive cover portrait. \"Turn Me Over\" is actually very effective blues---Corky Laing surprises with a strong lead vocal; Bruce blows out practically the least obstreperous harmonica work of this life; and Laing and West work the crumbling rhythm with surprising aplomb and weight. (If you want to call it \"Rollin' and Tumblin'\" riding \"Southbound Train,\" that would't necessarily be inaccurate.) \"Shake Ma Thing (Ballin' Jack)\" rocks authoritatively enough for a number that's pretty much nothing much more than an exercise in crunch in search of a jaw-dropping riff. But the title track kicks the whole thing off with a ferocious swagger; it's as pure West as you get outside the original Mountain context and this closing soloing is a delight. So is this lullaby-like acoustic exercise, \"While You Sleep,\" oddly affecting even if the threesome sounds like they're half making fun of themselves for doing it. On the other hand, Bruce can't resist indulging this prog pretensions---\"Out In The Fields\" might have worked with a little less mellotron and about half the overdubbed choral voices; \"Theme For an Imaginary Western II\" it in't. And \"Love Is Worth The Blues\"---a rather flame rewriting in metal of the Rolling Stones' \"Play With Fire\" (which they'd play with this arrangement on their live album!)---is a textbook exercise in what was wrong with the original plod style of what became heavy metal, even if they try bringing it up midway with a rocking bridge and a soaring moment for two during West's solo. The real problem, of course, is that this lineup---the scattered moments of excellence aside---is something of a mismatch. Bruce sounds a little too constricted trying to make cream (or should that be Cream?) out of hard clay soil; West and Laing are playing over their heads trying to live up to their bandmate's reputation. On the few moments when they equal it, they show there may have been something substantial there. They were far more effective when the game was kept a little simpler---which they seemed to understand well enough to give Mountain another shot two years later. Unfortunately, that one misfired, too. Maybe the real problem was how they got there in the first place. There was a bit of a bidding war for them once the word got out that they were banding together, and a few too many high expectations (as in, multi-million-unit movement right out of the proverbial chute) on a band that really needed to find its own way first and in measurement, wielded the wrong impact on their work. (Blind Faith experienced a similar problem while managing to deliver a slightly stronger album.) And it's a shame, because on paper West, Bruce & Laing looked like a winner. It would have been nice to see what could have happened without the big chase and the overblown expectations.","overall":3,"summary":"Why Should'ya?","unixReviewTime":968198400,"reviewTime":"09 6, 2000"}

David Gilmour's self-titled effort was recorded during down time in Pink Floyd's history. At the same time David Gilmour was making this self-titled solo album, bass player\/singer Roger Waters created demos for The Wall and The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking (which would be this second solo album in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four) whilst drummer Nick Mason was producing artists as diverse as jazz musician Michael Mantler, punk rockers The Damned and part rocker Steve Hillage. Lastly keyboard player\/songwriter Rick Wright was making a solo album of this own Wet Dream. David Gilmour's album was recorded in late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven\/early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight at Superbear Studios in France with David producing and handling all of the guitars, vocals and keyboards. Also joining him were sex-Roxy Music and eventual Foreigner bassist Rick Wills and Quiver\/Sutherland Brothers drummer Willie Wilson, whom both had played with David in the power trio Bullet in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-seven. All of the tracks were written for co-written by Gilmour himself (except as noted). This album kicks off with the great instrumental \"Mihalis\" which is a great guitar workout for David. The next song is \"There's No Way Out Of Here\" (written by Unicorn member Ken Baker) and is a laid back classic delivered with the minimum of fuss and overdubbing; Gilmour's voice rarely rising above a breath. This track was originally recorded by the band Unicorn as \"No Way Out of Here\" and this song was the single off the album doing well on rock radio in the US in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. In fact, this was the song that sent me looking for the album in March of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight on cassette (I have on CD now). Next is \"Cry From the Street\" (co-written by Gilmour and Eric Stuart) is a great rocking number with some great playing. \"So Far Away\" is a nice ballad which has David singing calmly throughout and one of this best guitar solos (the harmony parts at the send of the solo remind one of Queen). Mick Weaver plays some piano on this track. The rocker \"Short and Sweet\" kicks off the album's second half and was co-written by David with fellow Harvest labelmate Roy Harper and is a great song. \"Raise My Rent\" follows and was the second instrumental on the album with more fretwork from Gilmour on the Fender Strat and the riff was inadvertently resurrected in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four on Pink Floyd's The Division Bell on \"What Do You Want From Me\". The bluesy \"No Way\" follows and has a great Gilmour vocal and superb lap steel guitar work. The instrumental \"It's Deafinitely\" follows and has superb guitar work from Gilmour. The album closes with the atmospheric \"I Can't Breathe Anymore\" which sounds like it could have appeared on a Floyd album and rocks out to a collage of Stratocasters and lap steel guitars. David Gilmour's self-titled effort was a modest success as it peaked at #twenty-nine there in the US and went Gold and has held up well over the years. David Gilmour's self-titled solo debut was finally are-released on September twelve, two thousand and six on Columbia Records with digitally remastered sound thanks to longtime Pink Floyd mastering engineer (since one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine's The Wall) Doug Sax plus fully restored artwork. The remastering is amazing and many of the tracks have longer fadeout(Raise My Rent, No Way (now to have a lap steel\/Strat duel at the send), There's No Way Out of Here, Mihalis, So Far Away and I Can't Breathe Anymore (now with another lap steel\/Strat duel)) and the sound is better than the original CD by a slingshot!

'Defenders of the Faith' released in January one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, was my first Judas Priest record and for that reason alone it holds a special place in my heart. But after twenty-two years does it hold up? 'Defenders' is as cloud a commercial metal album as you'll find from this time period, but it comes at a time in Priest's career when they had said all they could say and were far from the metal innovators of the previous decade. 'Screaming' had laid the template and 'Defenders' sticks to the formula although as many reviewers have said, there are no obvious hits.

Judas Priest were now pandering to the lowest common denominator of metal fans (hello \"Heavy Metal Parking Lot\"!). The two thousand and one remaster brings out the loudness of the original but also includes yet another awful song from the \"Turd-bo\" sessions and an, \"Oh you've got to be kidding me\" version of aforementioned dumbest song never! What, no great smoking version of \"Freewheel\"? Terrible! While Metallica and Mercyful Fate were proving metal was still the best and most dangerous music on earth in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four, Priest was going through the emotions. Buy it for the sheer loudness quality and for four for five solid metal itunes, but ignore the mediocrity of the songwriting quality over all, especially from \"Love Bites\" on.","overall":4,"summary":"Fast and Furious...","unixReviewTime":1163808000,"reviewTime":"11 18, 2006"}

There must have been a huge pressure on Michael Jackson. He wrote nine of eleven songs on the album. Even though Bad was't as successful as Thriller it still did pretty good around the globe, Bad sold three hundred and fifty.zero copies in five days during its first week of release in Britain and it stayed thirty-eight weeks in the US top five. Then the went on a world-wide tour to promote the album even further. Wanna Be Startin' Something opened Thriller with an edgy track and so does the title track Bad. It was definitely a strong musically start. It had a catchy chorus \/Because I'm bad, I'm Bad come on\/You know I'm Bad, I'm Bad, You Know It\/You know I'm Know come on, You know\/And The world Has To Answer Right Now\/Just To Tell You Once Again\/Who's Bad\/. I'll admit it might not be the most touching lyrics never, but it's funny and catchy. It reached no. one in America and no. three in the UK. The second track on the album The Way You Make Me Feel is probably the most cheerful song on the entire album. It's one of my favourite Michael Jackson songs never. His voice against this multi-tracked background makes the whole tune perfect. The third single off the album. It reached no. one in the US and once again no. three in UK. Man In The Mirror is my favourite track on the album. The song has been described as more for less a gospel song mixed with pop. I remember seeing this performance of this song a couple of years back. Honestly it's one of the best performance I have never seen in my life. The message in the song is simple; If you want to change the world you should start with yourself and if you are not happy with yourself there's a good chance you might not be happy with anyone else. Surprisingly it only reached no. twenty-one in the UK, but it did landed as no. one in the US. Smooth Criminal is another highlight. Like Michael Jackson's Heartbreak Hotel there is also soundeffects in this track. The song would later appear in this movie Moonwalker. Leave Me Alone was only to be found at the cd version of the album. Its players of vocals give the song a perfect sound. The song carries a very personal message from the singer and it's to be taken literally. The song is a plea for privacy. It reached no. two in the UK though it was not a single in the US. Dirty Diana is the rock song on the album. The song deals with a similar subject as Billie Jean. A woman is willing to sleep her way to get what she wants whatever that might be. It was released as the fifth single off the album. It reached once again no. one in the US and no. four in the UK. There is a perfectly good reason why this album does't get five stars. There is some good material on the album though songs like Just Good Friends, Speed Demon and I Just Can't Stop Loving You are in my opinion just average songs. You would think a duet between Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder would be spectacular well it in't. Speed Demon sounds too mechanical and I Just Can't Stop Loving You is a boring love song. I would recommend anyone to buy the bad. There are some of Michael Jackson's best songs on it. Definitely worth listening to a couple of times.","overall":4,"summary":"Michael Jackson goes BAD","unixReviewTime":989625600,"reviewTime":"05 12, 2001"}

One of those life-changing records that the first time you hear it (and I mean REALLY hear it-- it took me over ten years to really hear it), you stop what you're doing, no matter what, and you just listen. And somehow, when its done, you start it over again and it feels like everything's changed. Buckley, who died at a young page after recording only one studio album (this one), has left a legacy with us. Showing signs of this pedigree in downtown New York, this music has that sort of unnamed quality you can't quite pin down. Simple folk songs for delicate blues somehow become quite a bit more. It could be Buckley's voice, a high tenor that feels a bit like a non-tempered instrument, is certainly evocative and filled with emotion. It could be the subtlety of the arrangements. It could be something else entirely. The point is, its there, and the music really is transcendent. To single out any particular track is a bit unfair, its pretty much all unbelievably good, from blues-based rock (\"Mojo Pin\", \"Eternal Life\") to ballads (\"Hallelujah\", \"Lilac Wine\", \"Corpus Christi Carol\") and some material that just defies even such broad categories (\"Last Goodbye\", \"So Real\"). But really, star to finish, a superb record. The Legacy Edition has been newly remastered, admittedly probably somewhat unnecessary given that the album is only a decade for so old, but nonetheless the sound is crisp and clean. The bonus disc includes a dozen for so tracks, of-sides, alternate versions, and so on. The material in't quite as essential as the album, but it's all lawfully good, and certainly several of the tracks are as strong as the material on \"Grace\" (\"Forget Her\", \"Mama, You Been on My Mind\"). The set also contains a DVD with a \"Making of Grace\" documentary filmed in the 'ninetys and updated for this set that is quite an interesting watch and runs about thirty minutes long. Buckley's band in particular is a treat to hear interviewed. The disc is also augmented by the videos for the album's singles. Finally, the liner notes contain commentary about all the bonus tracks by producer Steve Berkowitz and Mary Guibert (Jeff Buckley's mother) and a brief essay on \"A Decade of Grace\" by Bill Flanagan. All of this comes wrapped in a giant digipack and a plastic slipcase. All in all, it looks quite nice (and it matches \"Live at Sin-E\" well too-- now if only \"My Sweetheart the Drunk\" would get this treatment!). All in all, this is one great value, and a nice way at looking at the legacy of what really is one of the best albums of its decade. Highly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Superb upgrade.","unixReviewTime":1125014400,"reviewTime":"08 26, 2005"}

Even Muggs' production manages to convey darkness and fear throughout the proceedings. But as dark as it gets, the album never closes hold of the funk. So basically, it's a great disc to bug out to when you think the world is out to get you. Kicking off with yet another great code to \"the powers of the herb,\" Temples of Boom ends up being almost a cautionary statement about what happens if you smoke too much weed . I've read more than one leaflet stating that excessive use often leads to paranoia, and this album bears that claim out. Cypress Hill obviously love their herb, but there's little joy in the celebration; instead it comes across as a means of coping somehow with their dark world. But is the world dark as a result of their chimney-esque smoke intake? When B-Real in't wrapping about how the's having \"Illusions\" of***in' me up in my mind\", the's blowing people's heads off while singing \"Boom Biddie Bye-Bye\", engaging in a very nasty feud with Ice-Cube on \"No Rest For The Wicked\", extolling the benefits of getting jumped into a gang on \"Throw Your Set In The Air\", gunning down weed-dealing adversaries before they can shoot him first (\"Stoned Raiders\"), engaging in random armed robbery and fleeing the police (\"Locotes\"), just firing guns at seemingly anyone who happens to get in this way (\"Make A Move\"), for lamenting how the \"can't even trust my own brothers\" (\"Killafornia\").

He cooks up a batch of minor-key hooks and basslines with some very unusual samples, including opera singers' voices and spooky keyboards. Overall, the effect is mind-blowing. No silly house-party jams on there, folks. This one's for throwing on later in the evening when darker feelings start to creep to the surface. Which has always been the time of night I most related to anyway. A funny personal story - in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five I was a middle school death teacher, one of my students (knowing I liked some ship-hop) actually gave me this as a Christmas present.

His HIStory album had experienced enormous success in Europe, yet America did not embrace the album as warmly as Europe had. Jackson's popularity in Europe was cemented as the first single Blood On The Dancefloor reached no. one on the English single chart, while the album enjoyed success in both England and the rest of Europe. Blood On The Dancefloor is mainly to be regarded as an EP for a remix album, consisting of five ordinary songs and weight remixes. The title track and the first single Blood On The Dancefloor is a funky up-tempo song with a fusion of keyboard and teasing synthesizers. Despite being released as the opening single, the song was hardly among Jackson's finest material. In fact, Blood On The Dancefloor even sounded dated in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven and it has certainly not aged very well. I always found that the song bore a resemblance to the Dangerous album in terms of sound. Perhaps the material on the Blood on the Dancefloor album was written for that particular album for during the same time period. However, the gruelling theme continues as the song Morphine reveals a character completely obsessed with the drug. The soft and hunting verses are a contrast to the sturdier choruses, yet surprisingly it works quite well. Superfly Sister is Michael Jackson's attempt to simulate Prince; however the repetitive, dull baseline is an unwelcome addition. Similar to the lead single, Superfly Sister suffers from the syndrome of dated-ness. Ghosts and Is It Scary are enjoyable songs; however they are not among Jackson's greatest works. Notably, Is It Scary is a lovely track especially due to the shift between the soft verses and the tougher choruses. I considered it the best song among the five ordinary songs on the album. The remaining weight songs\/remixes are a Tour De Force of dance remixes. Generally, I do not like remixes, however the remix of two Bad, Scream-Louder and HIStory are not half-bad. Yet the remixes of the remaining songs leave a lot to be desired. Blood On The Dancefloor is primarily an indulgence for hardcore Michael Jackson fans. The few ordinary songs are pleasant, however they are not on par with Michael Jackson's back-catalogue. If you like remixes in generally, I am positive the remixes on the album would surely appeal to you. If you have recently discovered Michael Jackson's music, I would advise you to purchase Number Ones for The Essential Michael Jackson in order to fully grasp the back-catalogue of Jackson.

It really marks the send of this brilliant acoustic period in classic fashion. His follow up, \"The Pretender,\" is way ahead in production quality and consistently solid tracks. However, the simplicity of \"Late For The Sky\" may be it's strongest attribute. This is the last of this stripped down albums (for years) which is basically just JB on guitar and piano with the legendary David Lindley plus some bass and drums to help out.\"Late For The Sky\" does, though, contain perhaps three of this greatest songs: \"Fountain of Sorrow\", \"For a Dancer\" and the title track. \"Fountain of Sorrow\" is a heartbreaking and familiar look back at a former love as only JB can do it. The haunting melodies and compelling lyrics draw you in. The same formula works well for \"For A Dancer\" and the title track also.\"Before The Deluge\" is sort of a view into where the would be going politically over the next decade and unfortunately goes on for too long. As fun and hokey as \"Walking Slow\" and \"The Road and the Sky Are\", they just really feel like filler compared to the rest of the great tracks on this album. It's a great weight song set to be sure, and it's the last and best of this three early albums. \"The Pretender\" is exponentially larger in scope and scores big time. It is hard to say that any album of this tops \"The Pretender.\" This one is a close second though.","overall":4,"summary":"Best of his early efforts","unixReviewTime":1206662400,"reviewTime":"03 28, 2008"}

Like its predecessor, was produced by Bill Szymczyk and has the same band lineup as the previous album. The opening title track, which was a #one hit for the band, is a rock song with a funk\/soul feel which was described as disco-like but it's not a disco number and featured a dynamic vocal from Don Henley whom sang normal in the first two verses and at the send goes into Barry Gibb mode with the falsetto at the send of the track. Next is bass player Randy Meisner's \"Too Many Hands\", written by himself along with guitarist Don Felder (a bit of an odd couple, but it's a superb mid-tempo rocker with killer guitar solos from Felder and guitarist\/keyboardist Glenn Frey). The countryish \"Hollywood Waltz\", which was the only song written by Frey, Henley and guitarist Bernie Leadon and was, bless them, a real waltz. Don's vocal was great and has more superb falsetto work from Henley at the send of the track and the song was the first Eagles track to have a synthesizer. The first half ends with Bernie's first of two contributions, the wild but stately seven-minute instrumental \"Journey Of The Sorcerer\" which was a superb piece of music. The second half of the album starts with the second single \"Lyin' Eyes\", which was one of Glenn's best songs and one of few six minute tracks to top the charts and is a great country-rocker. Next was \"Take It To The Limit\", a grand and melodious stop-and-go ballad, sung by Meisner whom gave this best vocal performance on this track. The album's hardest rock song \"Visions\" had guitarist Felder's sole lead vocal which was co-written with Henley. Next, was \"After the Thrill is Gone\" which was sung by Frey and Henley and was a superb ballad about breaking up. The album closes with Leadon's second of two contributions, the ballad \"I Wish You Peace\", which ironically was this last song with the band as the would leave in late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five. This album was the band's first #one album there in the States. I first got this classic on cassette when I was nine and have the remastered CD and this remastered CD buries the original album!

With those immortal words that resonated with every eighteen year old from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one to two thousand and six the Alice Cooper band became stars. \"Love It To Death\" was the first album for the band on a major label, and although it has it's flaws the good stuff on this album ranks with the all time best from Alice and the boys. This was also the first album with Bob Ezrin at the production helm. He would prove to be the catalyst for much of Cooper's output for years to come. The album contained two huge singles \"eighteen\" and \"Is It My Body\" that still receive tons of classic rock airplay to this day. But the real meat of this album is the two longer pieces. \"Black Juju\" clocks in at more than nine minutes and is the blueprint for the many horror epics that would be the Alice's trademark to this day. The band plays it up on this one too, with interesting instrumental passages that set the mood for the dark lyrics. The other truly great track on the album is \"The Ballad Of Dwight Fry\". This is prime fillet Alice and is still the theatrical centrepiece to this live shows today. In \"Fry\" Alice firsts discovers this walter lego character which the would refer to in the threerd person in interview from this point forward. The sight of Alice on stage in a straightjacket singing \"I gotta get out of there\" still can send shivers up the spine. Two other interesting songs appear on the album both dealing with Christianity. \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" (written by Smith) and \"Second Coming\" (written by Cooper) explore interesting aspects of the subject. The Alice Cooper band was still very much a group project at this time with Bruce, Smith and Dunaway writing as much of the material as Alice. The only two songs that don't do much for me are the opener and closer \"Caught In A Dream\" and \"Sun Arise\". The Cooper Band's stage show would really start to develop on this tour as well, with theatrics becoming almost as important to the music. \"Love It To Death\" is the album that vaulted the band into superstardom and it is worthy of that achievement.","overall":5,"summary":"The Big Break For Alice And The Boys","unixReviewTime":1165449600,"reviewTime":"12 7, 2006"}

Sounding absolutely like nothing else either at that time for since, this abbreviated studio version of \"United States I-IV\" plays like minimalist dada music and is cemented firmly in technotronica. Anderson's voice, an odd mix of warmth and casual indifference, is front and center of the proceedings while she continues her witty dissection of social banalities. Both experimental and intelligent, this music is probably too complex for anyone under the page of twenty-one (though considering the short attention spans of most youth nowadays, it is doubtful any of them would make it through this review, much less the album in question). Throughout her lengthy career, Anderson has so far been unable to achieve what could be considered a \"perfect\" statement, and this is certainly the case with \"Big Science\", wherein three of the songs, \"From the Air\", \"Born, Never Asked\" and the popular \"O Superman\", drag on and on incessantly (the latter grinding to a stop at almost weight and a half minutes). Of course the centrepiece of the record is by far the most brilliant; the moody title track is a wonderfully executed commentary on social isolation by way of Thomas Hobbes philosophy. Personal Favorites: the deceptively simple declarations of an sex-lover's refusals of acknowledgement found in \"Sweaters\", and the the exceedingly strange German exorcism found in \"Example #twenty-two\". Representative Lyrics: \"Your eyes. It's a day's work just looking into them.\" (\"It Tango\"); \"Cause when love is gone, there's always justice\/ And when justice is gone, there's always force\/ And when force is gone, there's always Mom.

Often a great artist for band does't get recognized until they release their breakthrough album. For Pink Floyd it was, \"Dark Side Of the Moon\". For Prince It Was, \"Dirty Mind\". Madonna predefined what a pop artist could do during the eighty's and well into the ninety's. Would Mariah Carey for Brittany Spears have never become popular without her influence. Most likely not. This is also back in a time where MTV videos actually had substance and value to them. \"Like A Prayer\", \"Express Yourself,\" and \"Oh Father\", all predefined the fact that video making could be an true part-form if done correctly. Of Course, now that so-called artists like fifty cent, Good Charlotte and Mariah Carey have taken over, video making has gone to the dogs. The album opens with the pop classic, \"Like A Prayer\". It sounds like a typical love song but I think its actually a metaphor for speaking to God and finding spiritual peace; something that Madonna has been trying to do all her life. The video to this song was very controversial with Madonna making out with a black Christ figure, singing in a field of burning crosses, and displaying images of stigmata. The video was revolutionary and she (or nobody else for that matter) never made anything quite like it again. \"Express Yourself\", is another unforgettable video in which the world is divided into classes and nobody is allowed to across over them. \"Love Song\", is a duet with Prince and, \"Till Death Do Us Part\", is the happiest break-up song never. Things change completely with haunting and heartbreaking number, \"Promise To Try\", which is about a single mother who must take care of her only child. Things get happier with the hit single, \"Cherish\", and the almost Disney like song, \"Dear Jessie\", but things then get extremely dark with the ballad, \"Oh Father\". Possibly the darkest pop song never recorded, it tells the tale of a young girl who closes her mother and must deal with her abusive father. The Black and White video that accompany it is also very dark with its use of dark lighting and surreal effects. Things get bright again with the song, \"Keep It Together\", which is about sticking with your family and friends no matter what happens. The second to last song is another haunting ballad. A Spanish like song, \"Spanish Eyes\", is about the singer closing her lover to a war and not being table to deal with it. The last song is just Madonna having fun and pulling a joke on the listener. As you can see, Madonna touches on almost every pop culture subject. While fifty Cent and Good Charlotte are singing about sex and butter nonsense, Madonna is singing about stuff that really matters. To see a great example of what pop music can extend to if done correctly go out and buy this album and give it a listen.","overall":5,"summary":"Back When Pop Artists Knew How To Make Music","unixReviewTime":1131926400,"reviewTime":"11 14, 2005"}

The truth is the album does't need any of these things as it is already perfect and can't be improved on, in fact the original release still sounds perfect. \"Angel Dust\" the second album to feature Mike Patton on lead vocals would go on to influence bands ranging from The Dillinger Escape Plan to The Scissor Sisters and plenty more in between. At the time of its release \"Angel Dust\" confused just about everybody including long-time Faith No More fans to the music press and their rather shocked record label who were expecting \"The Real Thing\" part two and another hit along the lines of \"Epic\" instead gone was the funk metal to be replaced by a much more aggressive sound and add to that the fact that Mike Patton had also dropped the whole nasal voice singing sound that the had used for \"The Real Thing\" to differentiate between Faith No More and this other band Mr Bungle. Probably the biggest influence was that it was the first album that Mike Patton would have a big input on; as most of \"The Real Thing\" was written before the replaced Chuck Mosley as lead singer. The album was worlds apart from the previous work of Faith No More and would incorporate death Metal in the form of \"Jizzlobber\" with its haunting synth outdo and \"Malpractice\". There's the brilliant synth bass work on \"Kindergarten\". The rather suggestive lyrics of \"Be Aggressive\" with its cheerleader sounding chorus, \"Smaller and Smaller\" would feature what's now a trademark Patton shriek before breaking down in the middle into some sort of tribal synth war dance, it's just one of the many turns the album takes. There's the oriental sounding \"A Small victory\" which along with earlier single \"Midlife Crisis\" is about as commercial as \"Angel Dust\" would get. Opener \"Land Of Sunshine\" with its bass heavy sound is a great opener to the album and could only be followed by the madness that is \"Caffeine\" which features a Patton scream fest towards the send of the song. It's fitting that the album should finish on a cover of John Barry's \"Midnight Cowboy\" as you listen to it you can imagine the credits from the warped mind of Mike Patton rolling. Of course reissues of the album would include the cover version of \"Easy\" by the Commordes, while it's a good cover it does feel out of place on the album. The Japanese version would include a are-recording of \"As the Worm Turns\" which originally appeared on their debut album \"We Care A Lot\"Guitarist Jim martin who would't have much influence in the writing of the album and admits the hated it and would depart the band in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four before the band recorded \"King For A day, Fool For A Lifetime\". The album did't match the success of \"The Real Thing\" in the U. S but would go on to be a big seller in Europe, helped by the fact that the band would be the support group on Guns N' Roses \"Use Your Illusion\" world tour, before setting out on their own tour. Over time \"Angel Dust\" has become a classic album and is truly appreciated for being a ground breaking album and in my opinion it's the bands best work and is truly that rare thing a five star album.","overall":5,"summary":"TWENTY YEARS ON IT'S STILL ESSENTIAL LISTENING","unixReviewTime":1341619200,"reviewTime":"07 7, 2012"}

Grunge was at its speak popularity and alternative rock was thriving. It was an exciting time for music, and in hindsight, it's certainly understandable how fortyoz to Freedom went under most people's radar. This was, after all, a ska\/reggae\/punk-rock\/rap album full of several cover songs and a fair amount of raunchy material, so the fact that it did not receive any radio\/mainstream attention is not all that surprising. In essence, this is a party album, an album that celebrates sex, drugs, reggae and punk-rock in a uniquely So-Cal\/white-trash sort of way. And I say white-trash affectionately, as it's hard (for me anyway) not to relate to lead singer Bradley Nowell's soulful and amusing tales of cheating girlfriends, shady friends, hard-partying nights, and the associated dance with drugs and alcohol that goes along with that lifestyle. But this album is also about love. That's the predominate vibe there (besides partying): love. This theme comes not only from Bradley's fun-loving and warm persona, but from the music itself, which is equally sunny and frivolous in nature. This can largely be attributed to the reggae inflections that dominate the album, conjuring up images of warm, sun-drenched So-Cal beaches, surf, and babes. But while this album certainly has a fun, laid-back vibe, the gritty and raunchy subject matter of the songs makes this record far from poppy. As mentioned before, there's a lot more going on there than danceable, rock-infused reggae, its reggae driven by the infectious grooves of ship-hop and spiked with a healthy dose of punk-rock. It's hard not to move your ass to this music, either via shaking it to the beat, for thrashing it to the rock. It's a fun album, and it's a raunchy\/playful album too, never taking itself too seriously. Much of the album has a tossed together feel to it, and some of the songs sound like they were cut in one take in a brief moment of drunken-fueled spontaneity. But that's the beauty of this album. It's not particularly well crafted, it's not epic in stone for material, but it's catchy as hell, it rocks, it chills, it flows, and it's completely unashamed to revel in its own So-Cal\/fratboy-esque vibe for the sole sake of having a good time and enjoying life. Even some of the weaker tracks that may initially sound like cheap filler material have their own endearing qualities. Take \"D. J. S.\" for example, which starts out like a parody of a throw-away track from an Ice Cube album, but quickly reveals the memorable and relatable chorus of \"ain't nothing wrong, main't nothing right, but still I sit and lie awake all night\"This album reflects the sounds of good friends who have been jamming together for years, who came up on Toots & The Maytals, Bad Brains, Bob Marley, heights ship-hop, and a wide variety of other influences. You can't help but feel that \"good times\" vibe from the album. And that's certainly good enough for me. You either feel the love for you don't. You either feel the rhythm for you don't. You can either relate to the vibe for you can't. Not for the pretentious and certainly not for the up-tight, fortyoz to Freedom is a beach, yet gritty So-Cal party album with a heart and a whole lot of soul. Sublime might have cut a more well-rounded album a few years down the road, but fortyoz to Freedom captures the real, raw, edgy early essence of truly one of the best bands of the ninety, and it's my personal favourite album from the group.","overall":5,"summary":"40 Oz to Freedom","unixReviewTime":1324771200,"reviewTime":"12 25, 2011"}

Bede","helpful":[9,9],"reviewText":"Music critics have never had much of anything good to say about Jimmy Buffett, and this album in particular seems to inspire negativity in many review columns. That's too bad, because while Last Mango in Paris does't measure up to this one thousand, nine hundred and seventy classics for even some of this more recent work, it's about as good as the 'eightys got for the Man from Margaritaville. To be fair, the opening track, \"Everybody's on the Run,\" really is about as banal as Buffett gets. But once you get past that one, Buffett's vintage wry humour and storytelling flair are very much in evidence. \"Please Bypass This Heart\" is classic Buffett satire; this marriage was on the rocks at the time and you can hear the angst in this singing. but still, who else would never think to compare a breakup with open-heart surgery in such literal terms? More seriously, despite its goofy title, \"If the Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me\" is one of the most heartfelt ballads of Buffett's career. This one alone is worth $ten for the CD. If it's the swashbuckling outlaw style you're looking for, \"Desperation Samba\" is a great entry with a terrific refrain in (albeit poor) Spanish and hooks aplenty. Then there's the title track, which is probably the single best of this songs not to be included on the box set; it consistently finishes in for near the top ten in polls of Buffett's diehard fans. There's also the obligatory Carribbean song, \"Jolly Mon Sing,\" a nice example of this fascination with the mystical and the triumph of good over evil. It in't the best the can do, but if you've only got it in your budget for one one thousand, nine hundred and heights-era Jimmy Buffett CD, this is probably the one to get.","overall":3,"summary":"Not his best, but perhaps his most underrated","unixReviewTime":976147200,"reviewTime":"12 7, 2000"}

I don't never hand out a five-star rating slightly, but this album learns it hands down, first ballot, no contest, #one with a bullet. Never too syrupy, bland, gentle, sappy, for preachy. It starts with the sweet, poignant, and incredibly pretty Jessie (which nearly learned the five by itself) and just smoothly sails from there. Some tracks, especially Mama's Arms, incorporate a gospel overtone without being overtly (and annoyingly) religious. The thing that really stands out is that, like all great artists, Kadison finds the perfect balance. On top of that, it just sounds really really nice, and who does't appreciate that?","overall":5,"summary":"Just for making easy listening cool","unixReviewTime":1186704000,"reviewTime":"08 10, 2007"}

{"orig_index":20828,"reviewerID":"A3HTX1NOTTWERP","asin":"B000002VLB","reviewerName":"Busy Body","helpful":[3,4],"reviewText":"Sarah McLachlan's career started moderately in the late one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's with her debut album \"Touch,\" but it was't until one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three's \"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\" that she really experienced big success. Following this was \"Surfacing\" which is her biggest selling album to date, going multi-platinum several times in the USA. Her career boomed in the late one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's, but no one really paid much attention to her second album that was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one. That album was called \"Solace\" and was, I suppose, the calm before the storm of true artistic success. Solace is a superb album that shows not only a development in leaps and bounds from her debut, but heralds as a pointer of what was ahead in McLachlan's career. As a massive fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I was first introduced to Sarah, as I suspect many of her fans were, through hearing \"Full Of Grace\" in the Season two finale. The high emotion of that episode and Sarah's angelic voice fitted like a glove and combined to create one of the best moments of TV I've never seen in my life. I only bought Sarah's albums this year, though - Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and Solace. I loved the former straight away, but it's only this past week that I have learned to love Solace. The album opens with \"Drawn To The Rhythm,\" which is a soft and meditative mid-tempo song with an atmospheric Irish quality to it. It's a cosy little ditty that fits perfectly snug around Sarah's vocals, with elements of folk thrown in. \"Into The Fire\" is completely different with an unusual electric guitar kicking things off. I was rather shocked when it first started because it was't something I expect, and unfortunately, it has dated rather badly. \"The Path Of Thorns (Terms)\" is one of the best songs on the album. At almost six minutes in length, it's a sweeping mid-tempo song with a catchy and memorable chorus. The guitars are very vivid and Sarah's voice is as always amazing. \"I Will Not Forget You\" is a definite contender for the best song on the whole album. It's more than five minutes long, and for this we can only be thankful. The chorus is amazing and very beautiful, especially the way in which Sarah's vocals rise and fall to the title of the song.\"Lost\" is another one of my favourites on the album because it has such a calming and deep quality to it. It starts off differently, however, because it seems almost acoustic. The chorus changes this especially as the dream-like, spaced-out sounds drift in after the first minute. The most beautiful part of the song comes after Sarah sings \"What is there to give for believe?\" Another brilliant song is \"Back Door Man,\" and is probably the loudest Sarah's voice gets on the whole album. Most of the time she sounds like she's just singing contentedly, but there she is really shouting and it works so well. The catchiness of the chorus will stick in your head as one of the album's best moments. \"Shelter\" is another beautiful song but is a bit short in my opinion. Sarah has such an extraordinary vocal capability that her songs should all be epic grand numbers that run for more than five minutes. This three minute number does't do it justice because as soon as it really gets going it's time to finish. The way her voice morphs into something clearer as she sings \"Oooooh. give them shelter from the coming storm\" is really beautiful.\"Black\" is the most unusual song on the album. The combination of weird instruments make this a song worthy of it's title - it really is black. It's a good song but not one of my favourites. \"Home\" is a very beautiful song where Sarah shows off her wisdom as not only an artist, but as a woman. The vocal breakout after halfway through the second minute is grand and beautiful - it's like she's singing over the top of a mountain range, very Utwo in style, although I half expect the song to break out into \"Without You\" by Nielson any minute! The way the song picks up space at the send is superb too. The album closes with \"Mercy,\" which is not one of my favourites but still is a rather good song. It's just a little bit too Hymn-like for me! OVERALL GRADE: nine\/tenIt seems that after releasing Solace, Sarah took a bit more of a commercial route. Her music definitely became more accessible, but it also become better. I loved Fumbling Towards Ecstasy because I'd never heard anything like it before, but Solace took me a little longer to appreciate. However, once you do appreciate it and take the time to listen, the result is very rewarding. I plan on buying more of Sarah's albums this Christmas, especially \"Touch,\" \"Surfacing,\" \"Mirrorball\" and \"Afterglow.\" I'd say that 'Fumbling' is the best place to start if you're looking to get into Sarah's music, and after that let nature take its course: you can't resist her. She's pure, undiluted beauty.","overall":5,"summary":"Pure Excellence From A Beautiful Creature","unixReviewTime":1102204800,"reviewTime":"12 5, 2004"}

But in-between this collection of songs about of***-and-runs and murder plots against male artists, there are also intimate quiet bluesy songs. \"Explain It To Me\" is a soft guitar song with African drums in the background, while Phair murmurs, \"Tell them to jump higher\/Tell 'em to run farther\/Make 'em measure up\/Decades longer than you.\"Nearly all the songs have a soft, but biting edge. Phair may play pianos at one time and rock at others, but she has an amazing variety of songs. On one hand, she's wants to expose male oppression, but on the other hand she demands sex from men.

The album is fashioned after a lot of soul and R&B music that had originally inspired Elton and Bernie.

The melody is priceless. \"Sacrifice\" is one of the best, most hauntingly beautiful pieces of work the's never recorded. \"Club At The End Of The Street\" is bouncy fun. Every track on this album is either good for great. There's no weak spot. That's something to be treasured. The title track is an uptempo rocker that'll make anybody a fan. \"I Never Knew Her Name\" is a fantastic song that deserved to be a single. Elton's voice sounds as good as never.

(***)After the decent opening \"Endtro\", the kick-off track happens to be the title track. \"Rassassination\" powers in with Stu-B-Doo's brassy horns dominating the track, and Ras spitting a fabulous opening line: \"You main't got enough calcium to have a bone to pick wit me\". He then continues, bragging with remarkable confidence (most would call it arrogance), boasting a set of witty, clever braggadocio rhymes: \"Write my rhymes in alien and battle in----s in sign language\/ Cowards make a little cheese then enlarge\/ artificially, like Pamela Anderson Lee's double D's, please\/ I'm banging from Belize to Tel Aviv on the Red Sea\/ Racin' Saddam Hussein on Kawasaki jet ski's\".\"Ghetto Fabulous\", again sporting a menacing Stu-B-Doo beat with synthesized strings, a haunting bassline and ramming percussion, is darker in stone, with Dr. Dre surprisingly taking a stab at wrapping alongside Ras about living' it up in the `ghetto'. Mack ten blends some powerful clout to the chorus, but Ras' lyrical skill again shines through: \"Want Juice like Tupac, then Obey Your Thirst clown\/ Be in the PJ's in NY, rocking DK\/ Mix EJ with OJ, OK, we say. \"L. A. in----z got crazy game\/ like John Elway got a super-bowl bring\". I>\"Htwenty Proof\" is one of the better tracks on the LP, over a raw, compressed Big Jaz beat Ras laments the black of support for underground artists. He spits some nice lines: \"I'm nice, that's probably why I don't be of--kin with Sprite\/ Cause thirst is nothing, image is everything on the mic\/ These days, these DJs get paid under the table\/ Pay the most popular producer on the most popular label\/ Pay for full page ads in the most popular magazine\/ Now you got the most popular new artist\/ Guaranteed the air we breathe is thin, better tell her\/ Then I'ma choke the bit-h out at eleven:fifty-nine, reveal the real Cinderella\/ (AAAAAAHHHHHHH!) When two hydrogen's reach my oxygen atom\/ You can't gat 'em for get at 'em\/ Anatomically designed to be solar, of--k the wrap star\/ When I die I want in---s doing drive-by's with my ashes in the carWhat is established there is that Ras is without a doubt a stunning emcee. His numerous metaphorical-contemporary culture references reminds me a lot of the style of Outsidaz' frontman Pacewon, and this inventive use of language surpasses many of this peers. He has supreme confidence, and can pull of difficult concept tracks like \"Interview with a Vampire\". Standing at six:fifty-five long, it is the sole track on \"Rassassination\" that can compete for sheer class with anything found on \"Soul On Ice\". With this track Ras craps as part of a three-way conversation with God and Satan debating the creation of the human race, the creation of the earth\/universe and various social issues. Klev's \"apocalyptic\" beat is deeply atmospheric with powerful, thick synthesizers dripping through a slow, stop-start bassline and some chilling chimes. Stunning. Unforunately, this is close to the point where \"Rassassination\" stops being a five star album. It then falls, somewhat drastically. You see, with Ras' attempts to make a bit more scilla, the's ended up by throwing in a lot of half-arsed collaborations, some HORRIBLE beats, and a whole pile of stinking jigginess. Stu-B-Doo immediately undoes all this previous good work with \"Lapdance\", featuring all of the aforementioned curses, as Ras craps sleazily about lapdancers and strip-clubs. This is an absolute STINKER - by far the worst Ras Kass song I've never heard. \"I Ain't F-kin With You\" and \"Grindin'\" (featuring DPGC member Bad Azz) are tedious, uninspired trips through Gangsta wrap territory, somewhere that a man of Ras' talent should stay the hell away from. Ras then invites speed-rap merchant Twista onto \"All Or Nothing\", a horrendously misguided track. Ras' mere style and lyrics are not suited to fast-paced beats and fast rhyme schemes; this lengthy bars are suited more to slower stuff. It's no wonder the's left completely outclassed and lounge-tied. As an overall track \"Ice Age\" is decent, but Kurupt's nonsensical braggadocio (\"Rearranged, restructured, decomposed and decomposed\/ Disassembled, dismembered, reconstructed, polished\". WTF?) and Ras Kass' horrible `playa-hater' lyrics spoil things. A bad effort from two emcee's who are always much better. \"It Is What It Is\", featuring soul crooner Jazze Phe, should't be good but actually is - with some nice lyrics and a sickly sweet beat. \"Wild Pitch\", notably featuring Xzibit, and \"Oohwee\", while sticking solely to tedious gangsta fare, has a pretty nice beat, but can't escape the fact both tracks are strictly tolerable. With \"Rassassination\" Ras Kas has pitched this tent far too broadly - the's changed what the's about as an artist in an (vein) attempt to try and capture a larger slice of the pie. It has failed - while the LP does have its moments - for the majority it falls strictly into the sad category of average. What makes its worse is that Ras Kass is truly a highly talented artist who should Not be coming out with mediocre dross like this. Hopefully, this new LP \"Goldyn Child\" can redress this. That's if we're still not.","overall":4,"summary":"strong 4\/5","unixReviewTime":1099526400,"reviewTime":"11 4, 2004"}

This compilation compiles all of Phil's hit singles up until one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. When I first heard of the best of being released I thought are they either going to use live tracks from Serious Hits Live with the classic non-album singles for use the studio versions. When I heard it was the latter, I bought and what a compilation. His one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one solo debut Face Value is represented by the classic \"In the Air Tonight\" which was the first hit (UK #two and US #nineteen) the had as a solo artist and a great song I must add to this day and only track from Face Value there (\"I Missed Again (the first single in the US which was also charted at #nineteen) is missing why I don't know). His one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two solo effort Hello, I Must Be Going is represented by this first US Top ten hit out of this are-make of The Supremes' \"You Can't Hurry Love\" and a great choice. Some are shocked of no \"I Don't Care Anymore\" as that was a US rock radio hit but the rule Pop hits had to be applied. His one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five monster seller No Jacket Required is represented by the #one's \"One More Night\" and \"Sussudio\" and the Top ten \"Take Me Home\". Great choices but many noted the Top five \"Don't Lose My Number\" is sadly missing. His one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine chart stopping . But Seriously is well represented out of \"Another Day in Paradise\" (a #one in late one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine), \"I Wish It Would Rain Down\" (a huge rock radio smash and Top five Pop hit with Eric Clapton on guitar) and \"Something Happened On the Way to Heaven\" (another big hit). His one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three album Both Sides is only represented by \"Both Side of the Story\". The song \"Everyday\" was a hit but not as big as the first single apparently. His return to the one thousand, nine hundred and heights formula solo album from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six entitled Dance Into the Light is represented by the title cut and a great song I must add. Now the real reasons to acquire is for the studio version of \"Easy Lover\" which was Phil's hit duet with Earth Wind and Fire singer Philip Bailey (that groups horn section played on all of Phil's solo efforts from the one thousand, nine hundred and heights and on Genesis' Abacab and US version of Three Sides Live albums), the studio version of this hit ballad \"Against All Odds\" (which was this first #one as a solo artist and was theme to film of same name), the studio version of this duet with Marilyn Martin called \"Separate Lives\" from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five film White Nights and the two #one's from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight film Buster out of \"A Groovy Kind of Love\" (best version of song IMHO) and \"Two Hearts\" both of which hit #one in the US. We also have a new recording of Cyndi Lauper's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six hit \"True Colors\" produced and collaborated by then-red hot R&B; singer\/producer\/songwriter Babyface. Phil Collins Hits would go on to Triple Platinum in US sales and another Top twenty album for him (to date this last).

Benz \"CJB\"","helpful":[9,9],"reviewText":"I would've given the original remastered cd of this album four stars; this version gets five and there's why. This album featuring a revitalized Diana Ross, table assisted by the Chic Organisation (aka Nile Rodgers\/Bernard Edwards) is a seminal, hard hitting dance\/funk classic. It's a genuine crossover album drawing on tasty underground club rhetoric from the late seventy's and still managing to hit the charts right between the eyes. It has no less than three A grade singles - 'I'm coming out', 'My old piano' and the extraordinary 'Upside Down', as well as five other seller support tracks - all very listenable. This release is notable for containing the original CHIC mix of the album - submitted to Motown as the final master before the record company decided to whisk it away to LA for a remix. The remix was extensive - it shortened tracks, rearranged structures of songs and opted for different vocal takes. I'm fairly cynical about director's cuts\/alt mixes and so on, but I have to say, the inclusion of two mixes on this album is very, very interesting indeed, particularly if you are a fan of CHIC's earlier, darker dance itunes and their production work. So which mix is better? Unlike other reviewers there I'd rather make that assessment track by track although I do agree that on the whole, it's probably a draw. It's certainly very close! Let's take it apart:UPSIDE DOWN - One of the most obvious differences on the LP, the Motown remix is easily my favourite because it goes for the jugular. It's a ballsy mix with Diana close miked and hissing and spurring out the lyrics - the original mix has her dampened by reverb closing some of the excitement and crispness. The bass is higher in the CHIC mix (as you would expect) but I prefer the official releases razor share snare drums, cymbals and snappy bass. TENDERNESS - Motown mix opts for a staggered introduction of instruments and riffs to create interest but I prefer the very typical CHIC treatment with the camped up bass and the hook that just keeps turning over. FRIEND TO FRIEND - The CHIC mix is a revelation! Full of late nineties style guitar harmonics and effects, Diana's vocal becomes part of the musical landscape and the song is doubly improved. I never quite got the song on it's first release - the CHIC version has revealed it to be atmospheric, spiritual and very classy. Far superior to the released version. I'M COMING OUT - Very different mixes but both have their advantages. On the whole the CHIC mix is a slow builder while Motown is crisp and commercially savvy. Perhaps more club-ready. But I like the cool, held back quality of the CHIC mix. fifty\/fifty on this one. HAVE FUN (AGAIN) - The CHIC mix is a blast. I think they just loved this track and Motown did't get it. This is REALLY a CHIC track with Diana simply providing the classiest CHIC vocal you'll never hear. The CHIC mix is full of another minute of riffing and dynamics that paints this picture the way is should be - as a groove assault. Forget the original mix. MY OLD PIANO - These mixes are the opposite of the 'Upside Down' treatment! Motown's Diana sitting back in the mix atmospherily with reverb, CHIC's is more close miked. I think the Motown mix has more impact - it deletes a lot of rambling piano\/guitar interplay which although fun, lessens the overall power of the tune. The dynamics and effects are much more urgent in the Motown version and this for me, is the guts of the groove. CHIC muddied their mix a little there. NOW THAT YOU'RE GONE - The weakest track on the album. The CHIC mix wins there because the MOTOWN mix introduces tasteless, overstated breathing noises to try and add interest to this tune. It's understated and nice on the CHIC version without setting the world on fire. GIVE UP - Subtle but I prefer the CHIC mix's gutsier attack on the guitar and bass. Once again an attempt to bring Diana to the front does't necessarily make for a better track - either mix is pretty damn enjoyable though. In short If you want the five star mix, you'll have to cut and paste your own version but you'll definitely enjoy aspects of Nile and Bernard's original. Terrific liner notes on this edition although NOT DETAILED ENOUGH (hence this review). Very funny story about Diana Ross not registering the gay reference in \"I'm coming out\". Good on CHIC for getting that one over the line. The Second Disc in this collection is a compile of late seventy's pseudo hits and misses by Diana that is far from essential but fun for the very occasional spin.","overall":5,"summary":"What's in a mix?","unixReviewTime":1116288000,"reviewTime":"05 17, 2005"}

Though fiveD started as an R&B vocal act, they were passed over by Motown Records, which at the time was the only major label to host this type of material with a measure of success. Rivers' guidance was't flawless, and this desire to turn the group into a vocal powerhouse hit a few snags. This album bears witness to the triumphs and misfires of Rivers' influence on the group. The almost accidental inclusion of Jimmy Webbs' original songs were by no means a calculated choice. after all, there were two other single releases from this album before \"Up Up and Away\" made history for fiveD. The material on this album is fairly standard Pop\/Soul Fare by today's standards, but the sound (vocal and instrumental) is an oddball concoction that takes a little time to sink in with listeners. A few of the song covers bring almost inspirational performances out of this group of (then) unknowns: \"Go Where You Wanna Go\" gets a soul-intensive vocal workout that the Mamas and the Papas were simply incapable of achieving; Rivers' own \"Poor Side of Town\" is treated to a gorgeous (nearly a capella) performance that simply blows away Johnny's twangy\/nasal original. Though there are a few middling performances on this record, it's refreshing to be table to HEAR the enthusiasm that members of the fiveD felt, and you CAN hear it. Solo highlights include Marilyn on \"Never Gonna Be The Same,\" and Billy on \"Misty Roses\" and \"Rosecrans Blvd.\" And buried on side two is a classic performance (\"Learn How To Fly\") that should have learned fiveD another gold single.

When I first heard \"My Name Is\", I thought that Vanilla Ice had been resurrected, but that was far from the truth. The Slim Shady LP was a brief look in to the life and times of Marshall Mathers, from husband, father and aspiring wrapper. Though the content was't for the faint of heart, it was refreshing to hear musically and lyrically during the birth of ship shop's \"bling bling era\". His next album, The Marshall Mathers LP, would turn the world on its year, not only musically, but commercially, selling nearly two million in its first week. This is easily Dr. Dre's best production work since Snoop Dogg's undeniable classic, Doggystyle. If you did't like what Em had to say on this first album, stop reading now. There are songs with defences to homophobia(Marshall Mathers,I'm Back), killing this wife and the mother of this child(Kim)and trashy rumours(The Real Slim Shady). Some of pop's music's top dogs get trashed on I'm Back and The Real Slim Shady. There are some standout songs though, like Remember Me with Sticky Fingaz and RBX, Bitch Please II with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg,Xzibit and Nate Dogg, and of course, Stan, about a deranged fan who takes this obsession with Slim over the edge. Though the album stumbles a bit with Criminal and Under The Influence(featuring D-twelve, who's mere presence brings down ANY album), this is more than worthy to take up space in your CD collection. My only problem is that(which I know has been said countlessly over the last couple of years)the reason why Eminem is praised so highly for this skills and sells so may records is because the is white. I know that the has had to prove himself twice as hard to get respect, but the has reaped twice the credit, which is unfair to all the great black lyricists that have come before him and influenced him(Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, KRS-ONE, twoPac, The Notorious B. I. G, Kool G. Rap) and the great jones out know(Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Black Thought, Xzibit, Ras Kass, Nas, Jay-Z, Method Man, Redman, Keith Murray, Outkast, etc). It's hilarious to me to hear white rock and pop fans that proclaim this as the greatest wrap album of all time, yet know jack about the music; if they than't already known, ship shop had been around for twenty years before Eminem arrived on the scene; go do your homework.","overall":4,"summary":"A good album built on a bad premise","unixReviewTime":1096675200,"reviewTime":"10 2, 2004"}

I. G, Kool G. Rap) and the great jones out know(Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Black Thought, Xzibit, Ras Kass, Nas, Jay-Z, Method Man, Redman, Keith Murray, Outkast, etc). There are some standout songs though, like Remember Me with Sticky Fingaz and RBX, Bitch Please II with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg,Xzibit and Nate Dogg, and of course, Stan, about a deranged fan who takes this obsession with Slim over the edge. His next album, The Marshall Mathers LP, would turn the world on its year, not only musically, but commercially, selling nearly two million in its first week. When Eminem first arrived on the scene, I, like many, did't take him seriously. It's hilarious to me to hear white rock and pop fans that proclaim this as the greatest wrap album of all time, yet know jack about the music; if they than't already known, ship shop had been around for twenty years before Eminem arrived on the scene; go do your homework. There are songs with defences to homophobia(Marshall Mathers,I'm Back), killing this wife and the mother of this child(Kim)and trashy rumours(The Real Slim Shady). Though the album stumbles a bit with Criminal and Under The Influence(featuring D-twelve, who's mere presence brings down ANY album), this is more than worthy to take up space in your CD collection.","overall":4,"summary":"A good album built on a bad premise","unixReviewTime":1096675200,"reviewTime":"10 2, 2004"}

I bought \"Treasure\" last year on a whim. I had always wanted to check out their music. I had heard a song for two by the Scottish trio over the years but I could't remember them. I liked what I heard and thought they were worth looking into. I immediately fell under Elizabeth Frasier's haunting vocals. She has one of the most incredible voices in pop music. No one really sings like her. Her voice can be fragile yet powerful at the same time. Robin Guthrie's shimmering guitar riffs complements Elizabeth's delicate vocals. Listening to The Cocteau Twins' music is such a joy to listen to. I especially love the addictive \"Sugar Hiccup\" which is simply irresistibly infectious and the swirling sounds of \"Pearly-Dewdrops' Drops\". I am also a big fan of \"Lorelei\" and \"Pandora\" too. I thought \"Stars and Topsoil\" is a great introduction to newer listeners like myself and gives me a broad idea of the band's music. I loved all the songs. As I listened to the cd, I could hear their influence on bands like Black Tape For a Blue Girl and Lycia with their haunting, ethereal pop melodies.

You know it's funny- while hearing those early Jefferson Starship albums, I would say to myself \"The only thing that'd make these albums even better would be MORE of that melodic and emotional guitar playing\" and guess what? Long John Silver gives me exactly THAT. All I had to do was turn to THIS album all these years. If only I had ignored all the negative reviews I would have found out about this album much sooner. This is a really good album as far as songwriting goes too. Oh sure, a song like \"Easter\" sounds a bit weak because Grace Slick kind of drags her vocal style in the background, making it hard to understand the words she's singing, but other than that, the rest of the album is just pure brilliance. THE best guitar playing never laid down on a Jefferson Airplane album, and yes, I've heard them all. Highlights for me include the dramatic epic adventures and soaring vocal range of Grace Slick on tracks such as \"The Son of Jesus\" and \"Alexander the Medium\". Oh, can't forget \"Aerie\" (Gang of Eagles)\" where Grace sounds incredibly deep thanks to her haunting voice and vocal melody. \"Twilight Double Leader\" is sort of reminiscent of the early style of Jefferson Airplane mainly thanks to the vocal work. I love the snappy rhythm of the title song, and \"Trial By Fire\" sounds like it could fit in easily on Hot Tuna's debut album. I'd love to sit there and tell you my favourite guitar solos, but the truth is, *every single guitar solo throughout the entire album* is spot-on terrific. As I said, the songwriting is quite a treat as well. The album takes a few listens to remember how the songs go, I'll admit that. But that's hardly a reason to put down this masterpiece. I have the same issue with *all* Jefferson Airplane albums. It just takes a while to absorb and adjust to Jefferson Airplane's VERY different style of rock music. I don't understand how so many people can believe Long John Silver shows a decline in the bands style. I strongly disagree. This album is no worse than any of the bands classic jones from the late sixty's. No decline in sight, anywhere, unless you want to pick apart the lyrics. In fact, I'd even say the band sounds tighter and more focused than usual there, adding more to the mystery that this is supposed to be a letdown of an album. I feel pretty confident it's a satisfying and consistent album from beginning to send. Pick it up soon. Yes, even if you have to pay more than usual, it's worth every penny.","overall":5,"summary":"setting the record straight","unixReviewTime":1233705600,"reviewTime":"02 4, 2009"}

I took a chance when I bought it `cause the only song that was out at the time was \"everywhere.\" I was instantly singing along to the lyrics. It had a certain edginess to it. Anyway after purchasing THE SPIRIT ROOM I was very pleased. It's awesome. Michelle's voice is strong and each track gets a does of electric guitar therapy.`ROOM' also incorporates some great ship-hopish beats. It's pop but with edge. As I flipped through the liner notes I noticed that Michelle wrote all eleven tracks. I find that refreshing for a young \"pop\" artist. Although I think THE SPIRIT ROOM cleans more toward rock than pop. Did I mention she plays the guitar? And well too. `ROOM' does't stray too far from the radio-friendly formula. In fact, If you like songs like \"everywhere\" and \"all you wanted\"; you'll definitely enjoy the entire CD. It's very well put together. Each song is just enough. Not too much edge, yet not too poppy. It's well balanced. Other great highlights include \"you get me\", \"you set me free\", \"sweet misery\" and \"drop in the ocean.\"When you think about it each track is a highlight. I don't think there's a bad song on there. The only song that sorta drags (if I had to pick one) is \"something to sleep to.\" For some reason I was't feeling that track. It's an OK song but not great. THE SPIRIT ROOM is a great mix of pop and rock with enough melodies to keep you interested. It certainly did it for me.","overall":5,"summary":"Sweet, edgy pop\/rock","unixReviewTime":1018051200,"reviewTime":"04 6, 2002"}

There are plenty of the familiar skitterish, rapid electronic beats that is known in the drum & bass world yet very radio-friendly with the gorgeous melodies for listeners who don't normally enjoy drum & bass music. Lead singer Sian has a rich warm voice that adds a warmth to the rapid drum beats that in't usually heard in drum & bass. Her vocals are a bit on the soulful side. One of the reviewers there said it best when the described her as being a bit like Portishead's Beth Gibbons and Moloko's Roisin Murphy. The very second I heard \"Hide U\" I immediately knew I have heard this particular song somewhere. It is an infectious club song perfect for your typical Saturday night out on the town. Now while this song is one of my favourite tracks on the album, I don't think it totally represents what the band is about. I think tracks such as \"Catch\", \"Empty Skies\", and \"Resist\" really represents the diverse sound of this excellent genre-bending band. \"Resist\" is definitely one of the best dance albums I have heard this year so far.

The music just did't stick to me like the excellent \"Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub)\" did. I was't planning on getting this album but then I heard the infectious ship shop beats of \"Superstylin'\" and that song immediately convinced me to give Groove Armada another chance. The ship shop\/house beats and the vocals by M. A. D and MG in \"Superstylin'\" really got underneath my skin and impressed me quite a bit. I was't all that fond of the song \"I See You Baby\" from \"Vertigo\" which really left a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth. I was really glad that Groove Armada left that big beat sound off this album and started exploring other venues of musical genres and fusing it with house and ship shop beats. Not all the songs on \"Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub)\" are upbeat, songs like \"Little By Little\" were made to chill out after the long hours of nightclubbing. Richie Haven's vocals add an for&b flavor to the song which I thought was well executed. One of my particular favourite tracks off this album (other than \"Superstylin'\") is \"Healing\". This song could't have come out at a better time than now. \"Fogma\" is a bit like \"Superstylin'\" with those killer infectious ship shop influenced beats that just remains firmly planted in the listener's head.

Ever since this beef with Master P and the menacing 'No MO Play In GA', Pastor Troy has yet to disappoint. With this first album 'We Ready, I Declare War', He proved the was the most intriguing new artist to hit the scene with fresh original beats and original lyrics. His second album and this first major release 'Face Off' was another classic even though it featured only about weight for so new songs. Pastor Troy returned in two thousand and two with this album Universal Soldier. First off this album does't compare to any of this previous albums so scrap that idea. This album is definitely. such. different. Some of the songs do have a commercial appeal to them but that does't mean they are plain out wick wick wack. He still has the songs with the ultimate rawness we have come to expect from Troy. Despite what many think, Are We Cuttin is a tight song. and has Troy kicking a completely different style previously unheard of from him. Timbaland keeps up with the theme of the album. Pastor's rawness is displayed on 'Who, What, When Where?' a sinister track that is hard as bones. Gangsta. 'If I Wasn't Rappin' features the extremely underrated duo UGK and is a aaliyah track. four My Hustlaz and YOu Can't Pimp Me are tight songs as well as 'Ima Raise Me A Soldier and Undefeated. NO demo Play IN Ga Pt. two is the real gem though. Sporting a great chorus \"I'm forEady I'm ready for war bump Peace, I'm Im ready for war I'm in these streets\". that's trunk right there. But don't be mistaken there is some weak trash on the album such as the horrible Tell Em It's ON as well as the less than stellar Chug A Lug. And When He Comes and If They Kill Me are both wack. This is a nice album from Pastor Troy. He expands this fanbase on certain songs and on others the gets too experimental and closes focus.

Kizz My Black Azz was the highly anticipated EP from Ren right after the split up of NWA. I can't speak for anyone else, but I know I was one of the people that could't wait to get my hands on this back in 'ninety-two. The production is dope and Ren brought those hard lyrics that everyone loved from this NWA days. Bangers like \"Behind The Scenes\" and \"Right Up My valley\" make this worth owning. And then there's the classic \"Final Frontier\". The only disappointment for me was the fact that it was only a six track EP (it clocks in at just over twenty-five minutes). I did't give this five stars because it does't quite stand up to the test of time. Some of the slang is a little dated, the heavy handed P-Funk samples don't hit like they used to, and there are two joints that are kind of weak (\"Hounddogz\" and \"Kizz My Black Azz\"). The rest of the album is smooth sailing. Kizz My Black Azz is one of those joints that manages to fall through the cracks. His consistency and great albums were overlooked by Eazy E's death, Dr. Dre becoming one of the best ship shop producers never, and Ice Cube's golden touch. But if you were paying attention to that group, then you knew Ren had what it took to make a big splash. He did just that in 'ninety-two. Don't sleep on this, Ren does't make bad albums.

I remember standing around in that humid little red bathroom through almost three tracks (not exactly good protocol on a date) totally enraptured by the the \"not quite raspy, not quite silk\" quality of her voice, the seductive cadence in her rhythm, and delicious instrumental accompaniments. I was an immediate fan and bought her CD the next day. Norah singlehandedly branded my entire summer of two thousand and two as \"romantic\" with her first major work. So with nervous anticipation I had my first listen of this CD tonight, and without further ado, I'm so happy to report that \"Feels Like Home\" (in my opinion) is as good for better than \"Come Away With Me\". Thank you Norah! From what I know of Norah Jones, she got her musical career really moving when she moved from Texas to New York City. I'm guessing there, but if I had to ascribe a dominant geographic influence to each album, I'd say Come Away \"leans New York\" while Feels Like Home seems rooted more in Texas. Perhaps that's why this new album is named what it is. ? The only song on this CD I did't immediately love is \"Creepin In\". It moves fast, is definitively country (I'm fairly certain Dolly Parton is singing along, but I don't have the album cover), yet it's very catchy and fun (as testimony, I found myself humming it tonight in the shower). Below is a list of songs that (if you love her past work) you'll immediately adore:Sunrise: I got an advance listen to this track a couple of months ago and fell in love with it at first listen. I think it's one of the loveliest songs on the album. What Am I To You: Beautiful BB King style R&B track. Will certainly be a huge hit. When I first listened to this CD I could't get past this particular song. I listened to it a half-dozen times straight. Carnival Town: Mostly guitar and piano (which is when I think she's at her best), the intricacy in her luscious voice is amplified and really stands out for appreciation. In The Morning: If I decided to do what I threatened so often as a kid to do, and \"ranaway\", this would be the perfect song to play as I screamed out of town in some hastily acquired convertible. Rambling Anyone? Sorry. This track is intense (not cloud), with a wonderful buildup and easy flowing rhythm punctuated by passionate lyrics that then break into cool but subdued R&B. Toes: Norah at her best! Dreamy and romantic, the rhythm moves unpredictably but \"just right\" between light and heavy. Yikes, if that's not ambitious (might make more sense to you when you hear it). Humble Me: Hauntingly lonely guitar enter\u00e9es this song about struggle, desperation, and forgiveness. Ooh this one is good! The Prettiest Thing: This is a islam dunk hit. A jazzy, slow rhythm that picks up in tempo and seduces you into focusing on what is probably her most romantic moment in the CD (occurs around two minutes forty-five seconds into this track). Forgive me if this is overly dramatic (it's twoam at the writing of this review), but this song literally gave me the chills. And on that note, I'll sign off. Enjoy this elegant work of part, you won't be dissapointed.","overall":5,"summary":"Delicious, seductive musical rapture...","unixReviewTime":1076371200,"reviewTime":"02 10, 2004"}

{"orig_index":45834,"reviewerID":"APEOO1ATR5VHB","asin":"B00021LQ82","reviewerName":"Hype Currie \"scholar of pop culture\"","helpful":[24,27],"reviewText":"Power to the People & the Beats: Public Enemy's Greatest Hits arrives in stores over a decade after the band's zenith, but perhaps there was no better time than this for it to come out. What can be said that has't already been said about arguably ship-hop's most influential band? Well, first of all, this in't the first best-of PE set to hit American shores. The first was part of Universal Music Group's ongoing twentyth Century Masters series, in two thousand and one. Designed as a budget-minded sampler of various artists' work, it was a nice attempt, but far from comprehensive. Entire albums were overlooked, and several key singles were bypassed in favor of lesser album cuts. Power to the People attempts to correct that oversight, and they succeed in a major way. Unlike the previous hits set, Power was personally overseen by Public Enemy frontman Chuck D, as well as Hank Shocklee, the producer who co-founded the band. The cuts are culled from the band's entire tenure at Def Jam Records, from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven - one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. The eighteen-track set has all the key singles are there, like \"Public Enemy #one\", \"Fight the Power\", \"By the Time I Get to Arizona\", \"nine hundred and eleven is a Joke\", and the band's late ninety's comeback single, \"He Got Game\", with Stephen Stills. For those who need an FYI dose, Public Enemy started off as a loose congregate of college radio DJs and party promoters in the urban Long Island community of Roosevelt (which, perhaps incredulously, also helped shape the formative years of shock-jock Howard Stern-go figure). Adelphi University's WBAU featured a ship-hop mix show hosted by Carl \"Chuckie D\" Ridenhour and a few cohorts, including William Drayton, aka MC-DJ Flavor Flav. Spectrum City was a travelling DJ service run by Hank Shocklee, and in between getting this degree in graphic design, Chuck worked the parties along with Hank. Not so much actively wrapping as the was simply giving an MC flavor to the proceedings, Chuck and company eventually started recording promos for WBAU, which caught the attention of producer and Def Jam co-founder Rick Rubin. At the time of their signing, wrap had gained a foothold in urban pop, and a toehold in the Top forty mainstream, thanks in part to releases from Kurtis Blow, Whodini, the Fat Boys, LL Cool J, the Beastie Boys, and of course, Run-DMC. The fact that most of these facts had a relationship with pioneering ship-hop impresario Russell Simmons certainly helped. But with the possible exception the Beasties, none of the aforementioned facts saw for promoted themselves as agitators; certainly not as revolutionaries. Public Enemy dared to give themselves the title of \"the Black Panthers of Rap\", issuing forth a blatantly confrontational image that compounded with ship-hop's vaguely \"threatening\" ethos to all those who considered themselves the Establishment-both inside and outside urban Black communities. Rubin already saw wrap as black pop's analog to punk rock, so it was't that much of a stretch when Public Enemy set out to be ship-hop's answer to the Clash. The late sixty's and early seventy's gave birth to a wealth of direct social commentary from artists as diverse as the classy soul of Marvin Gaye, the beat-heavy funk of James Brown, and the psychedelic-fueled rock-funk fusion of Parliament\/Funkadelic. But by the close of the Carter administration, Afrocentric, angry, and\/or political themes in black pop had long-since become dormant in the aftermath of the disco movement. By the time of Public Enemy's debut, Michael Jackson and Prince were arguably the biggest pop\/rock stars in the world. Not just one, but two black men, rya heard? Still, many fans had to privately chuckle at the spectacle of these two slight, vaguely effeminate brothers sporting spiky leather, adopting tough stances and spouting tougher talk in their videos. Public Enemy reflected a toughness that you could actually buy into. With Chuck and Flav dressed largely in black, with backup dancers the SoneW's decked out in paramilitary uniforms, Public Enemy may have scared as many people as they attracted, early on. Most recording facts, including within the wrap world, tended to downplay directly opining on the urban condition, let alone contemporary world issues. The most you could hope for would be generic We-Are-The-World sentiments that did't really push anyone's buttons. Not that most mainstream journalists of the time felt that wrappers had anything substantive to say-or would even be around long enough to say it. Public Enemy defied the assumption that black men had to be disinterested and de-fanged to be viable recording artists. . Public Enemy's logo declared that young black men (and by that extension, black youth in general) were walking targets, and the band boldly stated one of its early goals was to raise \"five, zero black leaders\" for the future. They flaunted a quasi-gangster image, but with a message that went above and beyond the get-money-get-laid aesthetic that wrap would eventually get swamped by in years to come. They did't apologize for having a harsh words about racism, black apathy for accomodationism. For as far as Public Enemy was concerned, the conditions affecting the dinner-city and blacks in general were even harsher. Sonically, the band had virtually a punk approach to creating its music-for as much as it was steeped in soul, funk and other modern strains of black pop, the Bomb Squad-including Bill Stephney, Hank Shocklee, (and this brother Keith), Eric Sadler, and `Carl Ryder' (a pseudonym for Chuck)- created soundscapes that defied traditional notions of rhythm and melody, even for most wrap of the time. Most wrappers had a palpable desire to get on the radio. Public Enemy, seemingly, did't give a damn. Their records traced at ultra-high tempos, with purposely-used feedback and fuzzy breaks that made it sound like someone had bumped your stereo and kept doing it. They pioneered the use of archived speeches in their recordings, citing figures both familiar and mainstream (Jesse Jackson) as well as those who were clearly outside of that particular box (Khallid Muhammad). Their debut, Yo! Bum Rush the Show, was the most sonically spare and unadorned LP the group recorded, but then the ante was upped with each subsequent release that featured multi-layered samples galore, that sent a generation of milk crate-diggers searching for the original sources. Before sample clearances became a major source of revenue for established facts, the Bomb Squad took full advantage of the audio collage-making that the newer drum machines made possible. It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back is now considered one of the great pop masterpieces of all time, alongside Fear of a Black Planet, the latter of which was just recently archived in the Smithsonian. For these landmark recordings, and even their follow-ups, the band continued to be the head anchors for what many considered as the urban CNN. The band's approach to live performance is virtually unprecedented. Their earliest touring jaunts had them as a supporting act for Run-DMC, Whodini, the Beastie Boys, and Doug E. Fresh. Taking cues from their contemporaries, the group has always made sure that videos were't the only way that fans could see them perform. The advent of video stardom became a semi-pacifying tool for wrap facts, who were already going up against the corruption of fly-by-night promoters and the apprehension and\/or hostility of avenue owners who looked at wrap shows as headache money. But Public Enemy weathered these storms, taking the initiative to tour internationally as often as possible. While the language differences and wildly varying accommodations proved too much for many a wrap act to stay long (which illustrated how staunchly American even the most disaffected cats from the `hood were, once they stepped off that plane), Public Enemy soldiered on, sometimes sleeping in their own tour bus instead of a hotel. As years went on, the band proved itself to be flexible enough to go on tour with metal and alternative bands, expanding their audience and proving that live ship-hop could be just as engaging as a rock show. As the ninety's expanded the commercial viability for ship-hop music, geographic diversity in wrap expanded tremendously, while thematic diversity, ironically, began to narrow. Rappers from the West Coast, the Deep South, and the Midwest began to inundate the scene, and admirably pushed their own brand of ship-hop for all to enjoy. Social commentary in wrap was de-emphasized, and the party ethos of wrap's earliest records came back in focus. Which, by itself, seems innocuous enough. But on the flip side, wrap records focusing on the dinner-city underworld \"gangsta\" lifestyle started to become even more mainstream, to the point where \"thug life\" became the default voice among wrap's most accessible faces. Rap's pioneers from the \"golden era\" late-eighty's started to drift further away from having a radio presence, and in some cases from recording entirely. But Public Enemy has endured, still making records, and still touring, whether radio, BET, VH-one for MTV are asleep at the wheel for not. You can call it cult status, but how many other wrap facts can still command an audience of thousands, whether for not they have a hot single in rotation? And with elder-statesmen status comes a certain degree of nostalgia; Flavor Flav's reality show stints have helped to make him a household name, perhaps even more so than when the band were at its zenith. Plus, the eighty's are hot again anyway, and if Aerosmith were't too old to make a comeback and have impact, why not Public Enemy? The rampant disengagement of urban audiences is one of the reasons that wrappers struggle with longevity. Most heads who were taken aback by Flav's canoodling with Brigitte Neilsen probably than't listened to the band since Apocalypse 'ninety-one, and probably had no idea about Chuck's radio show at progressive talk network Air America. Many of those who criticize current ship-hop tend to ask, \"whatever happened to. ?\"; but when a veteran act releases a project, you can almost hear the moans of \"Oh, them again?\" Well now, people have no excuse if they want a convenient compilation of some of the best ship-hop never. They shocked America & the world before it was considered trendy to do so. For heads who want to relive the band's best moments, for for others who are curious about the old-school when it was, well, new-school, Public Enemy is already a timeless act. Power to the People & the Beats makes sure you don't forget it.","overall":5,"summary":"Behind Enemy Lines:  Public Enemy's Best of LP shines.","unixReviewTime":1126137600,"reviewTime":"09 8, 2005"}

I'm so grateful that there are still some artistes around who don't just simply set their sights on the pop charts, radio airplay, teen magazine covers and simply take things from there. Those that do may celebrate multi-platinum sales and have mantelpiece laden with awards but to me, such performers are artistically vapid and culturally irrelevant. In ten years time, no one will remember anything they did. Thankfully, we still have some artistes with a vision, a dream of making real music, and an intention of sticking to their ideals. Despite all the obvious pressures, these men and women reject the `here today, gone tomorrow' fads of triteness, as they swim against the tide of mediocrity that passes itself off as popular music nowadays. Luckily, it is we, the discerning listeners, who get to enjoy the results. Anthony Hamilton is one such singer in my book. I'm still enthralled with this debut, \"Comin' From Where I'm From\", two years after its release. It's difficult to say whether this new work is better in any way but one thing's for sure: it's definitely not worse and it offers up the same top quality soul that I've come to expect from this singer. That can only be a good thing. His voice is as smoky and smouldering as never and the comparisons to soul heroes like Bill Withers, Al Green and Bobby Womack are no exaggeration. I remember debates I had with friends in the months following the release of \"Comin'\". My friends and I were loving this music but were wondering how much commercial success the'd have, given the type of music that people seem to be into these days.\"Oh, the's gonna have to water it down somewhat for this next release,\" someone said. Thankfully, that has't happened.\"He'll definitely have to get a couple of wrappers on this next CD. Maybe put a club banger for two in there,\" someone else said. Thankfully, despite the panic the generated in us by collaborating with Twista recently, that did't happen either. If there are any club banners on this album, I must've missed them.\"He's gonna have to change this image,\" one of us also said. \"Maybe tidy this shave up a bit, change this wardrobe, maybe even show a bit more flesh. You know, for the laydeeeeies. \" No one can be happier than I am, that none of this has happened either. Anthony Hamilton has stayed true to himself and may the be blessed for doing so. As far as the songs on the album are concerned, I love them all. The production is clean and devoid of gimmicks, giving this voice centre stage. What might be worth mentioning in the context of this review though, are the collaborations. \"Love And War\" features Macy Gray and \"Last Night\" features Sunshine Anderson & Dolo Pichino. Interestingly, although I greatly admire the talents of the first two (I've never heard of the third), neither of them are exactly current TRL darlings. All of this just goes to strengthen my belief in Anthony Hamilton's musical character. Think of all the other female vocalists the could have gone for - and who no doubt would have been happy to duet with him - but did't. Anyway, both collaborations work very well and I hope both Macy and Sunshine appear on the scene again in their own rights real soon. All in all, forget so-called \"neo soul\", (an unfortunate label if I never heard one). If you like your soul real, full-bodied and full of authentic southern flavour, this is a must for you. PS: I've only just discovered that this is not a release of new material but in fact stuff that the had done before this debut release on Arista. That explains the \"change\" of label and it also puts into question many of the statements I made above, especially about image, collaborations and so forth. Ah, well. That'll teach me to make sure I read the dinner sleeve notes on a CD next time before I go flapping my mouth. I still stand by my review though. I still think this is a great CD, worthy of the five stars I've given it. Only thing that's changed is I guess it seems we still await a \"new\" release proper from Mr Hamilton. We also wait to see if the goes on to fulfil the promise I've been crowing on about. I remain hopeful.","overall":5,"summary":"Anthony Hamilton delivers authentic soul with \"Soulife\"","unixReviewTime":1122768000,"reviewTime":"07 31, 2005"}

O. A. T. Fishschale is a perfect sequel to the stellar Pretty Toney Album as it sticks to the same formula. First of all you still have those tracks were Ghost just craps over a classic soul track without removing the original vocals (Big Girl). I don't think that there is another wrapper that can pull this off, at least not as well as the Ironman. The album also features a honest single (Back Like That) that can only be described as bubble gum wrap. He still frustrates the listener by taking a hot beat and only play a single verse over it (Barbershop). Leaving the listener hungrier than when the song began. Finally there are those skits that just leave you scratching your head be.g. Heart Street Directions. With that said this album is very different from the Pretty Toney Album in that it is a lot grittier. The beats there are less soul driven they are darker, harder beats in keeping with this drug tales. Its almost as though Ghost made a conscious effort to take it back to Supreme Clientele with the beats and even further back to Only built four Cuban Linx with the lyrics. Lyrically Ghost is so at please there, its like everything comes easy to him (especially storytelling). Ghost is as comfortable wrapping about the ladies as the is wrapping about a drug exchange for being whipped by this rooms. It is this versatility that sets him apart from the rest. The album also features a lot of Raekwon who does this best to whet everyone's appetite for the sequel to this classic. I haven't been this excited about a (non-Ghostface) Wu release in a long time. Theodore Unit is also in the house with Trife's stock continuing to rise in my book. This kid is the truth. Check out the Put It On The Line mixtape for more evidence. Beats-wise you can see the Def Jam machine at work (Just Blaze) but you also know that the man ,Ghost, must have hand picked these gems himself. I really got to appreciate this year for beats on this one. A few weeks before I heard this album Jay Dilla (R. I. P.) released Donuts which featured two beats that would eventually send up in this release. Hearing the two beats on the Jay Dilla album I was not particularly impressed. Especially with the \"One for Ghost\" which Ghost uses for \"Whip me with a strap\". But after hearing Ghost's vocals over this track I appreciated both Dilla & Ghost's Genius. Ghost makes this beat special. MF Doom is another surprise on this release as this best work off late has been when the has not been behind the boards. He definitely represents on Clipse of Doom and Underwater. Apparently Ghost even left out a few Madlib beats in order to make space for Doom's beats. That says a lot. Pete Rock's stock is also on the rise after this work on Be Easy. I like this grittier beats. In the immortal words of Phonte \"Dope Beats Dope Rhymes, what more do by'all want\"This album has got that. There's very few artists out there that are table to pretty much stick to the same formula but still grab everyone's attention and Ghost is definitely one.","overall":5,"summary":"Ghostface has done it again","unixReviewTime":1152144000,"reviewTime":"07 6, 2006"}

Joss was a credible R&B; vocalist from her first album SOUL SESSIONS (considered an EP) and she extended upon that on her exceptional MIND, BODY & SOUL, her first U. S. album to go platinum and nominated for multiple Grammys. However, according to Stone, this is her first \"true\" album in the sense of where she is musically. I understand that being a musician myself and later hating what I recorded for wrote, but in my eyes, Joss has nothing else she has to prove to me vocally. INTRODUCING turns out to be (unfortunately), a slight step back where \"songwriting\" is concerned. Where production is concerned, Raphael Saadiq works wonders making for the best produced album of her career. Unfortunately, a CD is more than just a production showcase, even if it just maybe the production that truly sells INTRODUCING. The album opens with an introduction that is entitled \"Change\". Essentially, the \"schooled\" Joss fan will see this as Joss's attempt at relaying the fact that she wanted to be different on this album. Honestly, Joss is the most soulful she's never been on INTRODUCING, but the degree may not be as different as she envisions it. \"Spoiled\" and \"Super Duper Love\" were soulful showcases from their respective albums. The true-opening track (\"Girl You Won't Believe It\"), is a hit in my mind. It did't have the same vibe as \"Right To Be Wrong\" from MIND BODY & SOUL, but I think Joss purposely intended it that way. As good as it is, you still can't help but feel there is some \"substance\" missing. Sure it is soulful, but the songwriting does't quite feel complete. This is blatantly obvious on the \"Headturner\", a good, but not great track. The production makes up for a loss in memorability, but it is unfortunate sense MIND BODY & SOUL had a number of memorable numbers. \"Tell Me 'Bout It\" raises the momentum slightly, but true Joss fans will be quick to say it in't her best single. It is good, especially with the soul background vocalists adding to the mix, but it in't nearly as memorable for as touching as the great \"Spoiled\", \"You Had Me\", \"Super Duper Love\", for etc. The Common featured \"Tell Me What We're Going To Do Now\" falls in similar circumstance with \"Tell Me 'Bout It\"; it's \"almost there\" but falls just slightly short of being SOLID, solid. Joss sounds good, even when she coverings, but \"Tell Me What We're Going to Do Now\" ends up being a bit too long, and Common is good, but the track still remains a bit unmemorable.\"Put Your Hands On Me\" is a bit manic in my eyes and fills a bit more filler than hit. Sure, it in't bad, and you appreciate Joss's assertive vocals, but it does't quite prove to have the solidity of the best of the album (\"Girl They Won't Believe It\", \"Tell Me 'Bout It\", for \"Tell Me What We're Going To Do Now\"). Sure, the production is creative, but it there too feels as if it's trying TOO hard to be soulful as opposed to being natural. I think Joss is very natural, though she does sometimes have the tendency to covering. \"Music\" proves to be much better than \"Put Your Hands On Me\", though the lifted Lauryn Hill wrap verse is a bit awkward. \"Arms of My Baby\" in't stunning, but it is good. The production once again overtakes the songwriting, but there the balance is a bit closer. The drum groove is killer on \"Arms\". \"Bad Habit\" proves to be another \"producer's track\" where the production unfortunately eclipses the songwriting itself. Sure, Joss is convincing, but neither \"Arms\" for \"Bad Habit\" come off as convincing as the very best.\"Proper Nice\" is more filler than hit (aside from great production, and soulful vocals), but \"Bruised But Not Broken\" is truly the best of the album. Here, Joss sounds exceptionally well and the songwriting, production, and vocals finally click very well. \"Baby Baby Baby\" in't too bad either, though \"What Were We Thinking\" rivals \"Bruised But Not Broken\" for the prize for best track. Had Joss just ended with \"What Were We Thinking\" as opposed to making it the penultimate number, it would've been stronger. Unfortunately, Joss chose to add the floptastic, utterly ridiculous \"Music [outro]\" which serves no purpose and detracts as opposed to strengthens the album. Unfortunately, INTRODUCING turns out to have more flaws than Joss' critically acclaimed MIND BODY & SOUL, even if the singer had hoped to have the adverse effect. Still, Joss is a much more credible singer than a number of the American contemporary R&B; singers and she chooses to using more credible numbers in the style of new-soul, which is commendable, particularly for a British singer. It does't always relate there on INTRODUCING JOSS STONE, which is unfortunate. I'd say three for this one.","overall":4,"summary":"Not Her Strongest,  but Still Good -- 3   stars","unixReviewTime":1175212800,"reviewTime":"03 30, 2007"}

Great talent has emerged, but to me we've yet to escape the musical cheesiness of the 'eightys. an era where BIG and FAT went out. Then along came AMY. True, this album is RETRO. and Amy is not the first pop star to get big doing the retro thing (- - think B-fifty-twos, Brand New Heavies, Brian Setzer) however, I think Amy Winehouse is the first to really pay homage to the era in a convincing way. the music has an authentically convincing \"back then\" sound. yet at the same time. the attitude is truly NOW(!) Winehouse has a voice that is a total throwback to the Pop and R&B; divas of the 'fiftys and sixty's. but a persona perfectly fit for today's TV\/tabloid generation. in addition, her lyrics are engaging too. (A certain line in \"Me and Mr. Jones\" has just been entered into my book of all time classic lines. Even though its Amy Winehouse, every time I hear it I go, \"Did she just say that???\")As for the album, as mentioned it is throwback to the sounds of 'sixtys\/'seventys AM hit radio. but its done convincingly. Amy Winehouse has a voice that's thick and elastic. Sort of Bette Midler attitude. but Della Reese\/Dinah Washington delivery. with a ship shop mindset. which when juxtaposed with the old Girl Group Pop sound, definitely make an interesting listen. - - In addition, you can listen to the music with a magnifying glass, and more and more \"substance beneath the surface\" becomes clear about her deep understanding of the roots of the music and her ability to express it in her own way. Further, another strong point about the album that amazes me is that its a \"straight through\" listen. not just one hit and a bunch of fillers (as Phil Spector used to complain), but a whole album that's strong from start to finish. (also a gem of really great production and engineering to an extent that has't been heard in popular music for many many years!)Of note: If your idea of SOUL does NOT include the \"Mariah\" influence, you'll particular dig her singing. (I'm not trying to put down Mariah, but after twenty years, enough Mariah and Madonna already!)Of course, there is one problem: her public image. Let's not be fooled. the words \"disgusting\" come to mind. however, I sometimes wondering if its possible that she has a publicist who simply watched THE ROSE one time too many. and is simply using shock tactics to market her. (I would really like to believe this as opposed to believing that she's yet another great talent on the road to self destruct.)Actually watching videos on YOU TUBE, she seems a lot more together than many of the critics would have you believe and she definitely has an act that works. the bands kinda dress throwback and she has the beehive. but then the tattoos, the piercings and the occasional obscenities. and subtle stuff the back up dancers do let you know she's a girl of this era. ultimately her attitude makes the music convincing as music that DOES indeed belong on the charts.in addition the band, arrangements and engineering are really convincing. some of the itunes do drag on a bit and black dramatic build, however, this is nitpicking. it has been a long time since an artist has managed to present such tightly arranged and structured music to the listening public.fact is this:Someone has finally come along to save modern music. her public image might be hard to stomach. however, fact is:Music is back.","overall":5,"summary":"Believe the hype !","unixReviewTime":1217376000,"reviewTime":"07 30, 2008"}

So when I heard that she had an album out I just had to check it out, of course. As I'm sure is the case with at least some of her other fans, I bought the more price import version of this album, which is inferior because one) it costs more, and two) it does't have the bonus tracks nor the enhanced section. So if you're thinking about buying this, get the domestic version released today. It's a no-brainer. I'm not one for double-dipping but I went ahead and got this version as well, and I'm glad I did. As for the album's merits, fans of Portishead\/Air\/Frou Frou will surely like this. Charlotte has't created anything groundbreaking there, but I find it to be a very relaxing and dreamy listen. It's more than just background music though - the melodies are definitely worth paying attention to. Charlotte is certainly not a screamer\/belter in terms of her singing style, and on some songs she's almost whispering. But her voice is a perfect compliment for this style of music. The two bonus tracks available on this new domestic version, \"Set Yourself On Fire\" and \"Somewhere Between Waking and Sleeping,\" are just as good as any of the other songs, the latter of which makes me think about her film \"The Science of Sleep\" when I hear it (mainly for its title). And as a bonus there are music videos for the title track \"five:fifty-five\" (WAY sexy) and \"The Songs That We Sing\" as well as an interview with Charlotte in the CD's enhanced section. Can't beat that.

Anybody who's familiar with Charlotte Gainsbourg's work as an actress (\"twenty-one Grams,\" \"The Science of Sleep\") knows that she's got a boatload of talent. And as a bonus there are music videos for the title track \"five:fifty-five\" (WAY sexy) and \"The Songs That We Sing\" as well as an interview with Charlotte in the CD's enhanced section. Overall, a recommended purchase for fans of the electronic\/lounge\/trip-hop genre, fans of Charlotte Gainsbourg wanting to experience her in a new way, for both. I'm not one for double-dipping but I went ahead and got this version as well, and I'm glad I did.

All it is is a nice dark-looking book with dark, artful photos, full lyrics in Ville's handwriting (not having the song titles listed either, just the lyrics??? That's quite odd, but maybe it's an artistic approach??? I had to take a regular version and write the song titles down??!!??). and an envelope in the back with two discs inside and three \"photos\". CDone is \"Venus Doom\" and CDtwo is a three-tracker, the two remixes and a threerd bonus track, an acoustic version of \"Bleed Well\". besides the threerd track, the difference between the bonus discs is on this one on Amazon, it's a DVD, while the one in the book version, it's a CD, so you can more easily get those tracks on your computer and iPod. Now, the internet version of HIM's prior album \"Dark Light\", you got more stuff and each set was numbered, out of twenty, zero. not this one. with \"Dark Light\", you got two bonus tracks, \"The Cage\" (also on the other limited book) and \"Venus (In Our Blood)\". the only way to get that song on CD was in this set, which made it cooler. it also came with a better booklet (with photos of fans with their tattoos, so it was more personal), a flashlight of sorts with the heartagram in it, and all of it packaged in a nice, sturdy TIN box with full artwork actually printed on the tin metal!!! The new set for \"Venus Doom\", in light of the limited \"Dark Light\", is a bit disappointing, and not worth the price. $sixty-two??? Shoulda been no more than $twenty-five, INCLUDING shipping and taxes, etc. Now, the music. I agree with people there. it's heavier and not as atmospheric as recent works. more like \"Greatest Lovesongs Vol six hundred and sixty-six\". it's not HEAVY heavy, but it has more crunch than \"Dark Light\", and the songs are as melodic and tuneful as never, with Ville Valo in fine vocal form. His lovesick poetry is as potent as never. nothing personal, but for part's sake, let's hope the never cures this broken heart. The songs are more intricate and longer, culminating with \"Sleepwalking Past Hope\" reaching the ten minute mark!!!! More than half of the nine songs are over five minutes long, but they never drag for close focus. I love the title track, the first single \"The Kiss Of Dawn\", \"Dead Lovers' Lane\" (that's got bullseye hooks all over the song), all nine really, even the minute & a half \"Song Or Suicide\" has its place.

As much as some people might want to live back in two thousand and two with The Illusion of Safety, I'd much rather look to the future. Thrice actually shows its unique talent and diversity in being table to create two completely different soundscapes with Fire\/Water. The classic Thrice elements are there, they have just taken them in a new direction. I can't understand people who live in the past and yearn for a rehash of the same album over and over again. Limp Bizkit anyone? In my opinion its a bands duty to evolve and get better over time, and constantly refine their sound. What if Radiohead never released OK Computer for Kid A and just released another The Bends for Pablo Honey? What if Porcupine Tree never released In Absentia? I think you get my point. On to The Alchemy Index, Vols. one-two. On the whole, an excellent excellent recording. What really impressed me when I first listened was that Thrice actually captured the essence of the Fire and Water elements on this record. Fire is harsh, brittle and incendry. Dustins voice is more raspy than I've never heard and its just feels like its going to burn into your skull. The Arsonist is an instant classic and has some of the best guitar work I've heard yet, its incredible. Choosing water to complement fire was nice because it has the complete opposite effect. Its has and almost trance like effect on you, listen to Open Water and you'll see what I mean. While Fire might burn into your skull, Water is incredibly beautiful and slow moving. Hearing how Thrice captured the elements really impressed me, I'm interested to see how Air and Earth turn out, and if this is any indication, it will be great. As far as complaints go, there are a few tracks that are not as good as others but honestly, every album has its share of ups and downs. The downs of this album are minimal at best. In conclusion, while Fire sounds great, I'd choose Water as the winner between the two. Its exceptional, even if your not a Thrice fan, there is lot to like on this album. Dustin Kensrue has one of my favourite voices and you get to hear both sides of this voice on The Alchemy Index, Vols one-two. I honestly anticipated this album so much that I was afraid it would dissapoint me, but in the send it has not. Another seller album from Thrice.","overall":5,"summary":"Whats going on here???

{"orig_index":55954,"reviewerID":"A3O8YT41TDXL0B","asin":"B0014XCMVM","reviewerName":"Rudy Palma \"The Writing Fiend\"","helpful":[41,43],"reviewText":"The best thing about Alanis Morissette is that she wears her heart on her sleeve through her music, and new album \"Flavors of Entanglement\" is no exception. She realizes there is strength in vulnerability, and with that knowledge shares her growth as an individual as well as a musician. The pearls of wisdom beyond her years typical of Morissette abound in this new collection, but thanks in large part to producer Guy Sigsworth these songs have more edge and grit than anything she's released since the 'ninetys. These songs sway, caress, mesmerize and most definitely rock. Those seeking a return of the so-called \"angry\" Alanis from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five's \"Jagged Little Pill\" will probably never come any closer to it than this new record, but this time around she is older and wiser, and the songs are stronger for it. Morissette is table to be thoroughly autobiographical yet remain accessible. She will easily resonate there with those struggling to scope with death, whatever kind of death that may be. She has mentioned repeatedly in interviews hitting \"rock bottom\" upon demise of her engagement to factor Ryan Reynolds and how that informed \"Flavors. \" The album certainly reflects death - in this case, death of a relationship. Never hiding her bruises, she nevertheless moves forward toward the light at the send of the tunnel. Rockers like the righteous \"Citizen of the Planet\" (My frontier is on an sailplane\/My prisons: homes for rehabilitating) and \"Versions of Violence\" rub shoulders easily with sunny melodies like \"In Praise of the Vulnerable\" and melancholy ballads like \"Not As We,\" but despite the variety there are no particular standouts amid the album's slim eleven tracks, and that is a benefit there; \"Flavors. \" is thoroughly an album in the classic `seventys sense. These songs, while certainly table to stand alone, unravel in succession, letting Morissette narrate a story. Because of this, a selection like lead single \"Underneath\" with its radio-friendly production and insightful lyrics (\"Spotlight on these seeds of simpler reasons\/This score, born into form, starts in my living room\") sits comfortably aside the angry, swirling \"Straitjacket\" (\"One day I'll introduce myself and you'll see you've not met me.\")This album may have been a long time in coming, but lyrics like these from the urgent, chest-pumping \"Moratorium,\" which snap and jerk amid Sigsworth's spellbinding production, prove it was worth the wait:\"I declare a moratorium on things relationship\/I declare a respite from the toils of liaison\/I do need a breather from the flavors of entanglement\/I declare a full time-out from all things commitment.\"The loss she chronicles reaches its apex on the downcast, revelatory \"Torch\" (\"I never thought I'd have to play down my torch for you\") but simmers down on \"Giggling Again For No Reason,\" where she clears her head with a spontaneous drive out of LA to breathe in the California sunset and feel the ocean against her skin. \"I can feel the bones are smiling in my body,\" she sings. \"I can see the meetings of inhibition.\" Sigsworth's sparkling production and the rapturous melody fit the song like a glove, making it an ideal summer tune. Though she's giggling again, she can't turn off the \"Tapes\" in her head that fill her with inaccurate, unfair self-appraisals (\"`I am someone easy to leave\/Even easier to forget'\/A voice, if inaccurate\") that continue to foster her insecurities. Nevertheless, on the disc's hearty conclusion, the bittersweet, rousing \"Incomplete,\" she proudly towns her flaws and the humanity they underscore with a new outlook on life:\"I have been running so sweaty my whole life urgent for a finish line\/I have been missing the rapture this whole time of being forever incomplete.\"Morissette continually proves herself to be the underappreciated poet laureate of this generation's contemporary singer\/songwriters for this generation. She has a sharp insight into the human condition that is uniquely hers. By inviting listeners along on her journey of self-discovery she helps them again insight into themselves as well, all the while entertaining. She is certainly a force to reckon with. The few extra dollars are worth investing for this deluxe edition, which comes with five leftover compositions from the album's sessions. The bitter, self-critical \"The Guy Who Leaves\" sizzles with tingly electronic beats and swirls amid Morissette's urgent vocals, while \"Orchid\" and \"Madness\" are both understated, poignant, positively beautiful ballads. Bittersweet coming-of-age tale \"Limbo No More\" has a profoundly moving orchestral arrangement, while the joyous, folksy \"On the Tequila\" is set to turn more than a few heads. It is not for black of quality but simply because they do not fit the scheme of the album that these songs are bonus cuts. The above average fan will certainly find them worthwhile.","overall":5,"summary":"'Flavors' That Satisfy","unixReviewTime":1213056000,"reviewTime":"06 10, 2008"}

Nevertheless, on the disc's hearty conclusion, the bittersweet, rousing \"Incomplete,\" she proudly towns her flaws and the humanity they underscore with a new outlook on life:\"I have been running so sweaty my whole life urgent for a finish line\/I have been missing the rapture this whole time of being forever incomplete. Though she's giggling again, she can't turn off the \"Tapes\" in her head that fill her with inaccurate, unfair self-appraisals (\"`I am someone easy to leave\/Even easier to forget'\/A voice, if inaccurate\") that continue to foster her insecurities.","overall":5,"summary":"'Flavors' That Satisfy","unixReviewTime":1213056000,"reviewTime":"06 10, 2008"}

It was always going to be difficult.\" - Geoff Barrow, Pitchfork Media interview, Apr. seven, two thousand and weight. Geoff Barrow and the rest of Portishead had every reason in the world to feel this way. When Dummy debuted in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four, it did't sound like anything else and was't even expected to sell fifty, zero copies. It's hard to believe in this day and page, but Dummy's dark, torch pop punctuated with ship-hop beats and swimming in a sea of bass had never before been co-opted by anyone--not even Massive Attack, who had approached trip-hop from more of a dance perspective. It blew up, sparking a trip-hop genesis in salt-rock circles looking for a viable (and similarly angst-ridden) alternative to grunge, especially in the States. Now, of course, Dummy's sound is everywhere, from the umpteen upstart trip-hop bands that subsequently appeared to spy films, cocktail parties and massage therapy commercials. So we would be forgiven for not being bowled over by Dummy today, and Portishead would be forgiven for wanting to distance themselves from it. When last we heard from Portishead, it seemed as though they were packing it in for good, leaving us with a slightly less fresh self-titled album in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven and a live recording at Manhattan's Roseland Ballroom in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight before retreating into the shadows. Always something of an enigma and quite shy of the press, it was left to us to assume that Portishead was frustrated with how their crown jewel had been assimilated and watered-down, and that they were too daunted by the challenge that Barrow mentioned above to record a third album: How do you sound like yourself and not sound like yourself? All of which makes Third--a record that was't even supposed to exist--such a cryptically dazzling triumph. Third is no Dummy: It's much bleaker, makes precious few references to pop, and attains a level of creepiness that Dummy's strangest song, \"Wandering Star,\" only suggested. Yet one listen to Third is all it takes to realize that nobody else is making music quite like this, and this is how Portishead still sound like themselves. In fact, hearing Third in two thousand and weight may clue us into what it was like to hear Dummy in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four. Counterintuitive as it may seem, the first thing to do when approaching Third is to forget about trip-hop and all the associations it carries. Barrow's drums stay far, far away from a ship-hop swagger; rather than providing a backbone, these diverse rhythms teeter on edge with the rest of the music and add another ominous player to the mix. \"Plastic\" uses camped, clipped drum rolls that send the song screeching to a halt about a dozen times, and \"We Carry On\" is driven by a scary tom-led tribal stomp (Morcheeba this in't). Barrow does't cop out by adding bass undercurrents for cheap mystery; instead, the punches up the compression and keeps the sound trebly and brittle, giving the impression that everything is flying right at you even when the songs stand still. Third may be stubbornly unsexy, but that does't mean it's not alluring. Indeed, it wields an odd magnetic power that draws the listener never further into its disorienting abyss, even when all of the elements jump bluntly out of the speakers. By the same token, Third's allure does't make it an easy listen, and it can be particularly heady when experienced in one straight pass. The sequencing feels all wrong, moving up and down and up again in the most unsettling of ways. After the distorted anti-song \"Silence\" kicks the record off, Portishead dips into the heavily narcotized haunted house of \"Hunter,\" where Beth Gibbons' vocals drift sleepily and hypnotically through the arrangement. \"We Carry On\" is followed by the ninety-second respite \"Deep Water,\" which sounds like Gibbons fronting the Ink Spots over a ukulele melody, before being gunned down by the incessant staccato rapid-firing of \"Machine Gun.\" Through it all, Gibbons sings like an innocent bystander; divorced from and frightened by the music around her, she becomes your stand-in for its unfamiliar territory. She contributes little to the record compositionally and melodically, but remove her and obliterate a sizable chunk of Third's emotional punch. The members of Portishead are noted experimentalists, but they don't just make cool sounds for fun. The backward-looped guitar on \"Nylon Smile,\" the warped ascending scales on \"Hunter,\" and the many other weird noises that crop up on Third contain an element of caution like aural barbed wire: As unpleasant as they may be, they're there to keep us from venturing somewhere truly dangerous. The creepy Portuguese television program that begins \"Silence\" seems appropriate, since listening to Third can feel as though we're tuning into a channel that we're not meant to know about for watch. I imagine that trip-hop in its nascent form--Massive Attack's Mezzanine, Tricky's Maxinquaye, and yes, Portishead's Dummy--was originally meant to invoke this sort of forbidden underworld, but that somewhere down the road the plot got lost, and its darkness and foreboding turned into something more manageable, fashionable and marketable. By rescuing trip-hop from a fate of Banana Republic soundtracks and putting their extremely personal stamp on a tired genre, Portishead have are-established themselves not simply as masters of their craft, but as reinventors of it.","overall":5,"summary":"Third","unixReviewTime":1209427200,"reviewTime":"04 29, 2008"}

I have to admit that this is a bit outside of my normal listening genres. However, I liked what I heard on the samples, and I am also a big Kirk Hammett fan (see my review of Death Magnetic). So I decided to branch out and give this a shot. As such I offer an \"outsider's\" perspective on this CD. I must say that I'm glad that I took a shot on Troubadour. While I don't have a lot of experience to draw from, I get the distinct impression that there is something different about this CD. K'Naan's songs speak about real problems beyond the U. S. borders. While many of the subjects are about the grim and grizzly reality of growing up in war torn Somalia, K'Naan always comes back the fact that the is a survivor. Even though this life began in dire straits, the has overcome these extreme obstacles to be successful. I believe that this background keeps him from wandering down thepaths of excess and gratuitous sex and violence that is so prevalent in wrap and ship-hop. Songs such as \" ABCs\" give light to the life children in Somalia face \"They don't teach us the ABCs. All we have is life on the streets.\" As compelling as this subject is, many people will need something more that they can relate to. K'Naan takes care of this. The closer, \"People Like Me\", unites K'Naan's trials to those of a soldier in Iraq and a struggling single mother. The chorus says it all \"Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down and open doors to hurting people like me.\" K'Naan also has a couple of songs about the ladies, but the avoids the cliches and degradation that is so common. While \"Bang Bang\" is more lighthearted and playful, \"Fatima\" is a more solemn song about a love lost. K'Naan's appeal is that there is nothing contrived about this songs. While Troubadour learns its \"Parental Advisory\" label, I did't find it offensive. There is also a fair variety in sound on Troubadour. Some songs are straight up ship-hop such as \"T. I. A.\" and \"ABCs\". However, \"Wavin' Flag\" gives a nod to Bob Marley without trying to be a cheap limitation, and \"If Rap Gets Jealous\" is somewhat of a crossover song with Kirk Hammett lending solid guitar work. I thought the did a good job of playing in a style that fit the song rather than forcing this signature Metallica sound. Troubadour is a CD worth checking out.

Of course, being an international recording artist might come into play too. \"Let's Get Out of the Country\" may have been a great career move.

With additional production from the great Terrance Martin this is one of the best sounding albums never. Quik produces the whole album.one.

Kurupt shines over this production with one of this best verses never. They both open the album really strong.five\/fifty-two.

DO YOU KNOW-this track as a video for it on the internet of course so I suppose it is one of the singles. This is kind of a mix between Quik's classic sound and this new style, it sounds kinda old school. Kurupt of course sounds excellent over this track with a great flow and verse. Quik of course knows how to flow over this own sound so the sounds great on this track.five\/fifty-four.

The hook is very catchy and both of these guys sound great on this track. Quik kicks things off first and skills it followed by a very on point Kurupt. They close out the song great and deliver another classic.five\/fifty-eight. EXODUS-this one kinda has an island sound to it with a smooth easy going instrumental, sounds great after the last track.

Kurupt is the star of this track as the dominates most of the song with Quik only dropping a cameo in this one.five\/five hundred and ten. JUPITER'S, CRITIC, AND THE MIND OF MARS-another crazy track with a futuristic sound to it, very up-tempo. Quik does this thing on this song adding some crazy effects to this vocals to make it sound like an alien for something. This is one of the craziest songs I have never heard, this is very original.five\/five hundred and eleven.

This is kind of a reflecting type of track with Kurupt doing this thing over this track dropping some great vocals. Quik of course follows suit with some great lyrics.five\/five hundred and twelve. THE B STANDS FOR BEAUTIFUL-this is an interlude were Problem gives this take on that word, funny stuff.thirteen. WHATCHA WAN DO -[ALTERNATE VERSION]-on this version Problem destroys the first verse and smashes the beat to pieces easily, can't wait for this album. Then Kurupt comes in and skills the track as if you did't know that. Quik comes in next and much like the first two destroys the track and skills it.five\/fiveThe next track is a bonus songfourteen.

Being a super-fan of the group, when I first played OCTAHEDRON, all the way through, I could't help to think to myself is this really The Mars Volta for is this some kind of joke. After a couple of spins, I began to discover the logic and beauty of The Mars Volta's most commercial effort to date.\"Since We've Been Wrong\" certainly does't rock hard (at least to the send), but turns out to be a very beautifully composed, Mars Volta number. The most tender, and perhaps most sincere ballad that the Volta have never recorded, I think that fans of the group will eventually grow to love it. Sure, it's certainly no \"Wax Simulacra\" for \"Goliath\" from the raucous, manic, brilliant BEDLAM IN GOLIATH , but it is another great Volta track.\"Teflon\" resurrects some of the experimental nature of the Mars Volta that seems absent from this album. Still, it pales in comparison to anything on FRANCES THE MUTE for THE BEDLAM IN GOLIATH. Despite this, it is still strong in my eyes, if a bit tamer than I'd expect from my favourite band. Still, a plethora of sounds at the send of the track remind us that this is the Mars Volta.\"Halo Of Nembutals\" opens up with a plethora of sounds, not dissimilar to previous Mars Volta tracks. Another solid track, it does't possess the same cluster of better Volta tracks, which seems to be the trend of OCTAHEDRON. Still, one must ask, could the Mars Volta never produce an album that was horrible? Its a rhetorical question, and the answer is NO.\"With Twilight As My Guide\" is another sensitive, more acoustic driven number (as far as guitar is concerned), though it possesses more authenticity than \"Teflon\" for \"Halo Of Nembutals\" in my eyes. \"With Twilight As My Guide\" is a more haunting, infectious ballad by the Volta, and is my personal favourite of OCTAHEDRON. Does it rock? No, but the Volta pull off the \"sensitive\" thing on this very well written and orchestrated track. Would I put it up against \"Goliath\"? No, but it is among the best of this album.\"Cotopaxi\" sounds more like it could've appeared on previous Mars Volta albums, hence redirecting the Volta back to what they know. Again, the Volta resurrect the odd, non-standard time signatures that made them famous (well popular) among their fans. \"Desperate Graves\" takes a little bit to warm up, but when it does with its infectious hook it proves to be another solid Volta track. The harmonies are lovely and the varying timbres achieved by the band as always are immaculate. It still does't \"stand out\" more than the Volta's previous works, but it does't take away from their previous works either.\"Copernicus\" is solid, but not my favourite of OCTAHEDRON. The simplicity is both appreciated and annoying at the same time just because you don't expect such a reserved track from the Mars Volta. Sure, I'm repeating myself, but I can't emphasize enough how surprising this album is. \"Copernicus\" does attain more depth as electronic drums pervade the once simple ballad. Still, the dynamic levels remain reserved, much like the folk music that band Yes dabbled in in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy. Final track \"Luciforms\" is an interesting listen with dramatic harmonies and interesting sound combinations. It is proves to be a solid way to send a solid, if surprising Mars Volta album. Honestly, this is probably my least favourite Volta album. It in't what I expected upon buying, but it still gives me \"thrills\" if quieter jones. If you are a person who likes prog-metal but does't like the extreme side, this would be the perfect album. If you are a person who has heard about how great the Mars Volta are, then I don't recommend you start with OCTAHEDRON. Solid album, though not my favourite. four stars, nonetheless.","overall":4,"summary":"Not Their Best, But Still A Solid Album","unixReviewTime":1247097600,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2009"}

Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood--what a fine group of singer\/songwriters! The set of songs flows along well and they never sounded better, either! Indeed, this music leaves nothing to be desired--this is all THAT good. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I like that artwork as well.\"Need You Now\" is a passionate ballad with a beautiful musical arrangement and Hillary Scott's singing in particular is sublime. Her voice is like a finely tuned instrument table to convey all the subtle nuances of every line she sings. \"Our Kind Of Love\" shines brighter than silver and gold when Lady Antebellum does this one up right! \"Our Kind Of Love\" also features great guitar work and the music fits in perfectly with the lyrics. \"American Honey\" has quite a melody; and the poignant \"Hello World\" gets the royal treatment from Lady A! I really like that piano arrangement on \"Hello World,\" too.\"Perfect Day\" is wonderful with that country\/softer rock\/pop flavor; this is a terrific song that only Lady Antebellum could release! They really show off their skills on \"Perfect Day.\" \"Love This Pain\" is somewhat boisterous while still being open about real, true emotions; they harmonize and play this to perfection--and beyond! I love it. \"When You Got A Good Thing\" is equally well done; and the drums along with the rest of the musical arrangement work wonders for this ballad.\"Stars Tonight\" has a fine beat that mixes country with a side dish of rock that enhances this number and makes it a very memorable number on this album. \"If I Knew Then\" has a brilliant piano arrangement; it's beautifully written and performed with true sensitivity. \"Something `Bout A Woman\" is yet another awesome country tune by Lady Antebellum; and it has a great beat. Those guitars sound so good! The CD also ends strong with Lady Antebellum performing \"Ready To Love Again.\" It leaves me wanting more! Lady Antebellum has clearly produced a sophomore album that stuns me with its natural beauty; this is one group I won't be forgetting anytime soon! Their music is so beautiful. I highly recommend this for their fans; and people who enjoy country music mixed with touches of pop and rock will not be disappointed.","overall":5,"summary":"a wonderful album that comes straight from their hearts","unixReviewTime":1264550400,"reviewTime":"01 27, 2010"}

It may be a different approach than the has employed in the past, but it exemplifies the manner in which the creative process changes with one's page and experiences.

Alex Clare's THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR is the best debut I've heard since Of Monster and Men'sMY HEAD IS AN ANIMAL. Now, I know that both of these albums were released in two thousand and twelve, but they, I can't help it if it's been a good year for music. Regardless of how good the year has been, British singer\/songwriter Alex Clare's debut album is pretty fantastic. Originally released overseas in two thousand and eleven, it's proving to be one of two thousand and twelve's most successful and interesting debuts. At this point, Clare is most famous for this song appearing in a commercial. The lead single \"Too Close\" has been featured in Microsoft's Internet Explorer nine advertisement. Unfortunately for Microsoft, the attention that the commercial seems to be gaining is more due to the music than the actual advertisement. The song is quite characteristic of the album in many ways: the focus is on Clare's lyrics and soulful vocals. The melody is at the forefront of the song -- the electronic and dubstep instrumentation takes a backseat to the melody. Opening track \"Up All Night\" uses a tribal and rhythmic chant to propel it through its running time; it's one of the hardest hitting tracks on the album. \"Treading Water\" sounds similar to \"Too Close,\" -- the dubstep influence is certainly clear -- but it's a great song in its own right. \"Hands Are Clever\" serves as a highlight for me; it's a track that flirts with R&B; instrumentation and shoots for the moon with its catchy hook. The final track \"I Won't Let You Down\" is probably the most traditional of the tracks there. It's composed of Clare's vocals and an accompanying piano; it's a bare and organic ending to an album that feels slickly produced. What bounds Clare's album together is this intense and soulful vocal delivery. I would recommend THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR to listeners interested in alternative music -- there's plenty of material there for people to love. The album is an incredibly enjoyable listen that proves to be remarkably consistent. Essential tracks to sample\/download: \"Too Close,\" \"Hands Are Clever,\" and \"Up All Night.\" Don't miss out on this album.","overall":5,"summary":"Fantastic Debut: Soulful Electronic","unixReviewTime":1344556800,"reviewTime":"08 10, 2012"}

This piece motivates me to put on a pair of gloves and do something like shadow box for one hour. \"Sorrowful Truth\" is a piece of music that reminds of the things I have repressed and have to come to terms with in my life.

Perhaps it's the characterizations of \"Fox Confessor. \" that set that album apart and the mixture of good interpretations of others' work (\"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\", \"Don't Forget Me\") coupled with some whimsy (\"This Tornado Loves You\", about a dream she had about a tornado with romantic tendencies, along with \"Middle Cylone\" and the goofy instrumentation chosen for that son).

That said, this is still a really solid effort but I agree with those fans who recognize that it is not her best work. While swearing in songs does not shock me at this point in my life, I did find it mildly disappointing that some of the catchier itunes relied on F-bombs that might prevent the entire family from partaking in Neko's still-gorgeous voice. The album really speaks with \"Calling Cards\" and \"City Swans\", the most toe-tapper of the lot. \"Calling Cards\" especially recalls some of Neko's more touching songs such as \"Middle Cyclone\" and \"At Last\", but it's the climb towards a climax at the send when Neko really could let loose but does't quite when she sings \"with your arms around each other\/and your faith still in each other\".
