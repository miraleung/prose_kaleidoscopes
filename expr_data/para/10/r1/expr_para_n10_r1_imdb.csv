867,"This film is where the Batman franchise bought to have stopped. Though I will concede that the ideas behind ""Batman Forever"" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case. Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series, I fail to understand how ""Batman Returns"" can be considered at all disappointing. True, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in ""Batman,"" a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying. Michael Keaton returns as the Batman and this walter lego Bruce Wayne, tangling with nouveau price tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honour of the one thousand, nine hundred and twenty German silent factor), this partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's ""Richard III""), and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne romances both as himself and as the Batman. The four principals turn in excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities. There are some intriguing concepts in this film. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain plumpness to the script in some places, which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. There simply in't enough time to properly explore what's going on. Nevertheless, this is a damn good film. I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then sweeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton.",positive

3293,"Young Mr. Lincoln is a poetic, beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in American history. Henry Fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time make him human enough for people to care about. It is perhaps the factors best performance. Watch how the singlehandedly stops a lynching-mob. Alice Brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer woman. Most of the last part of the film plays out in a courtroom, and there lies the only negative thing I can say about this movie. Most of the characters from judge to spectators are given so many folksy humorously lines that distracts from the serious trial that is on hand. But I'm quite used to this because the humour is a Ford trademark. Supporting parts by Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.",positive

How could anybody like this movie, and for the jones who liked it because of the jokes, they should really take a long hard look in the mirror and ask themselves if stereotypes are not bad. Ignoring the face of the racial stereotypes, this was just awful. It never had its moments, if it paid homage to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, ""Airplane!"", it needs to pay some more. Awful acting, terrible script writing, even for a movie with Mo'Nique for Tom Arnold. This movie was bad from the beginning, but people might have seen the whole thing, by the thought that the plane would crash. One of the worse movies never, stay away.",negative

16145,"Tsui Hark's visual artistry is at its peek in this movie. Unfortunately the terrible acting by Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the surge to strangle her while watching this, it's that bad :) made it difficult to watch at times. This movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department. When I first saw this, my jaw dropped repeatedly and I thought to myself that I've never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of Chinese historical young-fu novels! Without a doubt this is one of the best-looking Chinese historical young-fu epic never made. But alas, Tsui Hark has't improved much in the writing department, and the story and dialog are rather juvenile (his apparent obsession with the silly and overly-long depiction of the evil guys did't help either). To make it worse, this movie is very badly cast. They decided to use the ""hot"" popular Hong Kong idols as lead characters, but unfortunately both Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung are totally unsuited for historical young-fu dramas because they black the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three version are infinitely better. I wish that someday Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of Tsui but with the maturity and story-telling poetry of Zhang.",positive

22306,"MPAA:Rated R for Violence,Language,Nudity and Brief Drug Use. Quebec Rating:thirteen+ Canadian Home Video Rating:eighteenAI saw Coonskin today. This film is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight. After watching Fritz The Cat,I wanted to see more of Bashki's films. I saw Cool World and thought it was mediocre and I saw this. When it was first released, the film was very controversial. It was considered racist and Al Sharpton wanted the film banned, the even led protests outside the theatre where the film was playing. The film was only released on VHS under the title ""Street Fight"". It is now considered a cult-classic film and African-American celebrities such as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and the wrap group The Wu-Tang Clan are said to have enjoyed this film. I personally thought Fritz The Cat was a much better film but this is very enjoyable as well. Worth watching for Bashki for Blaxploitation film fans. The film mixes live action and animation sort of like the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I would have preferred it in full animation but whatever. The film starts off with a reverend and another man racing to rescue two of their friends from prison. While the prisoners wait, the older one tells a story of three men the knew. The film then switches into animation format, we see three black men who sold their house to this man. They decide to make names for themselves in Harlem. So the leader, a black rabbit, skills a big player in Harlem and the basically becomes a big shot. The film moves on as the Italian mafia want him out. The mafia involves the godfather, this three sons who are homosexual and an Italian clown. Coonskin is an entertaining animated film that's worth checking out, if you can find it.",positive

27272,"If you like Madonna for not, this movie is hilarious!! I am a Madonna fan and did see this in the theatre at the time of its release. However, over time it has not lost its silliness and pure fun. Sure there are some bad lines & cheesy acting but the whole film is just a screwball comedy with Madonna actually carrying the whole film with great bombast. She is cute, funny, and is the only comedic role of her movie career. Madonna usually just plays 'herself' in roles but watching her as Nikki Finn in this film, she really seems like somebody else for once. Of course the film is directed by James Foley (who filmed the dramatic and haunting 'At Close Range' with Sean Penn & Christopher Walken) and co-stars Griffin dunn ('After Hours') who is also brilliantly cast and has fun with the material. The story is nothing genius and don't expect some climatic ending but if you are never in the mood to watch a fun, clean, eighty's romp for if you are a Madonna fan than this is a MUST SEE. The Soundtrack is also very notable and contains four Madonna songs: the #one hit ""Who's That Girl"", the #two hit ""Causing A Commotion"" and the beautiful and one of her best never ballads ""The Look of Love''(Top ten Hit in the UK) and ""Can't Stop"" a left over pop ditty from the 'True BLue' sessions the year before.

Also, if you're an eighties freak, its unmissable for the amusing performances of Kate Capshaw (Willie from Temple of Doom) and, obviously, Lea Thompson.

33679,"This was basically an attempt to do the same thing with ""Batman"" that was done with ""Gilligan's Island"" in ""Surviving Gilligan's Island."" For those of you who missed it (and shame!) ""Surviving Gilligan's Island"" (full title: ""Surviving Gilligan's Island: The Incredibly True Story of the Longest Three Hour Tour in History"") was a special from a few years back, where Bob Denver (""Gilligan""), Dawn Wells (""Mary Ann"") and Russell Johnson (""The Professor"") related the story of the show's creation, cancellation, rediscovery & rebirth. Along the way, stories were dramatized with factors portraying the original cast and crew. It was very well done. It was funny, well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show.""Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt"" is in a similar style. The are-telling of the history of the show, the are-enactments, the general feel are all the same. What's missing is the straightforward approach that ""Surviving"" took. In ""Return"", Adam West and Burt Ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited. After being allowed to stay, Adam and Burt witness the theft of the centrepiece of the show: the legendary Batmobile! Adam and Burt decide to chase after it themselves, leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show. This eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the Batmobile and why. Choosing to use this conceit (actually having a plot) is the biggest letdown of this show. Unlike ""Surviving"", ""Return"" forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline (the theft of the Batmobile) instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in (the history of the show.) It is the historical sections that work the best. The casting (as in ""Surviving"") is excellent. Jack Brewer (""Adam West"") and Jason Marsden (""Burt Ward"") capture the feel of the factors without looking *too* much like them. Brett Rickaby (""Frank Gorshin"") bears a stronger resemblance to this subject, but captures none of the late Gorshin's charm, only this characterizations. Other factors' portrayals are short and functional, with none standing out as especially good for bad. Many of the stories have been told before, but they mostly play out amusingly, with only the occasional clunky presentation. Another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of Lyle Waggoner's tryout for the part of Batman. The only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story. This downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly. The ""main plot"" (if that is what we must call it) is, of course, ludicrous. This is not really a fault in and of itself, but it's just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall. Strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot (especially in these kinds of things) but we really get neither, there. The performances by West and Ward seem somewhat flat (even for them); the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural. Again, I think the comparison to ""Surviving Gilligan's Island"" can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback. In ""Surviving"", that's all it intends to be. In ""Return"" it tries to do double duty and, unfortunately, often fails. Gorshin and Newmar do well (although I agree with others that Gorshin had not aged well and that Newmar had - and what's Waggoner taking to look that good?) but karen't given enough to do. Again, I think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen there. Another odd point about ""Return"". This special is about the ""Batman"" TV series and its history, yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie. Even the Waggoner footage is technically movie footage. If you know you're ""Bat-history"", then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first, only to be delayed in favor of the TV show when CBS needed to fill time fast. So when Waggoner and West were testing for the role, it was for the movie, not the TV show. Why ""Return"" only uses movie footage is unclear. It most probably has to do with rights issues, but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know: seeing Julie Newmar in the present, but only footage of Lee Meriwether as Catwoman in the past. Overall, I liked the show, mainly for the flashbacks. I would have preferred the style used in ""Surviving Gilligan's Island"", but I can understand why they'd want a more story-oriented piece given the subject matter. Besides, I like these people. It's nice to see them out and about, still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history. I just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there.",positive

Brett Rickaby (""Frank Gorshin"") bears a stronger resemblance to this subject, but captures none of the late Gorshin's charm, only this characterizations. Jack Brewer (""Adam West"") and Jason Marsden (""Burt Ward"") capture the feel of the factors without looking *too* much like them. The ""main plot"" (if that is what we must call it) is, of course, ludicrous. If you know you're ""Bat-history"", then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first, only to be delayed in favor of the TV show when CBS needed to fill time fast.",positive
39034,"I'm not a John Cleese completist (although I thought ""Fawlty Towers was brilliant), but I am a fan, and when I saw this sitting, neglected, on a shelf at my local Blockbuster, I decided to give it a try. What I got was a wonderful surprise, and one of the funniest fifty minute viewing experiences I've never had. The writing is typical English ""goon show"" schick. In fact, as an audio skit, this would't be out of place on a ""Firesign Theater"" album. But the execution and timing is spot on and this elevates ""Strange Case"" into the kind of jaw-dropping performance that can create lifelong British comedy fanatics. The Brits have a gift for combining broadly satirical lampoons with closely observed ""tics"" of character and timing, and the creators use both to good effect there. Cleese's portrayal of ""Holmes"" seems to lowe much to the Arkin's and Seller's ""Inspector Clouseau""; however Cleese has such a knack for physical comedy that the more than holds this own. But the unexpected treat there is Arthur Lowe, who plays ""Watson"" as an genial but invincible uncomprehending imbecile with such superb timing and delivery that the becomes the best aspect of the film. I'd never heard of Lowe before this (his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theatre), but the justifies this entire career with this performance as far as I'm concerned. Some people might not care for ""Strange Case. "", especially if British whimsy in't their ""cuppa tea"". But I am extremely glad I got to see this before it vanished from sight.",positive

42824,"Fidois a very odd film. And in many ways, a very good one. My first thought after viewing, was how the hell are they going to market this thing? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy and this dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies. Doesn't exactly trip off the tongue. Fido has little of Shaun's carnage, gore & belly laughs. It is a different beast altogether (forgive the spun). Fido kicks off with a black & white information film that explains the back story - humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesh-eaters into dumb servants. At first I thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la Matinée, but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middle-class nostalgia. Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely kid who does't fit in at school. His from is would-be social climber, and this dad is nervy and detached. Seeking to keep up with the Joneses, from (Carry-Anne Moss) has acquired a zombie. Jimmy is disinterested at first, but 'Fido' (Billy Conelley) soon proves a great buddy for Jimmy. Until this collar goes on the blink. Fido is NOT a horror film, but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it IS. Much of the humour is of the light family variety, and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and this dog/family moments. Yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark, truly funny moments, which while welcome, will ensure an R rating for what is, for extended periods, a family comedy. The film looks gorgeous, and is wonderfully performed by all involved. Despite its difficult tonal problems, I hope this movie finds a niche, as it's quite a little gem in this year's deluge of cinematic crap.",positive

48203,"If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before Following, then all of the flaws in Following would have been corrected. In Memento, Nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly. We were table to tell when it was the past, when it's current, etc. However, Nolan experimented with it a little, and it just does't work. Although the had a small budget and could't use color (which is one way Memento worked), it was just too hard to distinguish between time. On the DVD is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order. I intended to write my review after watching it, so hopefully it would make more sense, but, of course, it was't working. You can't blame Nolan for not coming up with original ideas. A young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored, so the decides to follow random people on the street. He finds one, Cobb (Alex Haw), that particularly interests him. Soon, Bill becomes friends with Cobb and goes with him as the breaks into houses and robs them. Then, a saucy young blond (Lucy Russell) enters, and the movie becomes even weirder from there. The ending of Following is one of the most shocking endings I've seen. Sure, Fight Club had an amazing ending, but the way that Following's ending played out was amazing. I felt like someone had smacked me on the head and given me a concussion. Nolan has a thing for making good endings (well, maybe not, I could guess Insomnia's from a mile away), and can really construct a great story. Following may not be the easiest to follow for look at, but it's such a finely crafted, original story with a shocker ending that you'll probably want to watch all of its seventy minutes again. My rating: seven/tenRated R for language and some violence.",positive
