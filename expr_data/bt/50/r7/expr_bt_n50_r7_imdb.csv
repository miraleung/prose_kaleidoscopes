247,"This movie was so bad it was funny! For awhile there I thought I was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la ""For Your Consideration""). The ""cliffhanger"" scene at the send had me laughing until my insides hurt. The script was dreadful enough, but coupled with Sean Young's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! In fact the fake shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing got made. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did star factors get attached? Were they at low points in their careers? Questions, questions.",negative

612,"This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie -- so if you haven't seen either movie and want to but don't want the spoilers, please don't read this review! While this movie is supposed to be about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the movie is a poor copy of the first Cruel Intentions. The factors that they had portray Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed. Neither can pull off the smarmy, snooty rich-kid attitude that the original factors did. It's absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim -- not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen closely enough you'll recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the send of the movie? He supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie (with Reese Witherspoon's character). Also, the tie-in with the photography/""You could be a model"" comment at the send was totally flame and did't add anything at all. Overall, this movie was a waste of time. I can't believe they made a Cruel Intentions three.",negative

1217,"""Müllers Büro"" is a movie which many will watch and enjoy until the send, while others will stop watching it within five minutes. It is a parody of detective movies with all the twists and turns; the action takes place only at night in the dark corners of a city which resembles Batman's Gotham City (look carefully at the streets, buildings, the police car chasing the criminals, etc.). It is also a parody of musicals with its really funny characters such as Müller's secretary and Vitasek's (the factor playing Müller's assistant) lover who do their best to using, albeit not very successfully. The spaces occupied by the characters have their own presence in the film such as the decadent Blue Box (there is a real club with this name in Vienna) where one can see a sailor hitting on a girl in the background, Müller's apartment with the black paint smeared on the walls and the dirty kitchen, Müller's bureau with the sweet picture of this assistant, etc. The humorous moments in the movie are many and include ""flat in the face"" type of humour such as Müller farting in this assistant's face, the prostitute charging Müller extra for orgasm, the ridiculous outfits of the female thugs of Montana, etc. A legendary film from the eighty's especially for those interested in Austrian for German-speaking cinema.",positive

2923,"Kennedy-Miller could hardly have done a better job at tackling a very challenging exercise: making dry political events work as human drama, and providing an even-handed representation of explosively controversial subject matter. The key to its success on the first count is brilliant acting, although I was less impressed by Max Phipps' performance as Gough Whitlam than some other commenter there. The clear standouts for my money were John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The latter must have been one of the easiest casting choices in history - Hunter could not have been more perfect for the role. On the second count, the series avoids the ""myth of objectivity"" strap through a narrator who particulates the sympathies of the director (Phillip Noyce, who more recently demonstrated this left-wing credentials in Rabbit Proof Fence), while being carefully even-handed and sympathetic in its dramatic portrayal of all parties. The adherence to the Lady Kerr/Lady Macbeth theme popular among Labor partisans was perhaps a little partial, though not ruinously so. In particular, credit is due for the sympathy shown to Kerr and the extraordinarily difficult position the was placed in, whatever one might think of this actions. However, there is one sour note for which the producers were perhaps not entirely to blame - the portrayal of the Jim Cairns/Juni Morosi affair. Those who come to the series with no background to these events will get the impression that Cairns and Morosi were the innocent victims of a smear campaign by a prurient gutter press. The producers may have been restrained in this respect by Australia's stultifying defamation laws, and the recently demonstrated willingness of Cairns and Morosi to use them against those who suggested their relationship was sexual (which Cairns would eventually admit to a year before this death). However, more could have been made of the bizarre fashion in which Morosi managed Cairns's office as Treasurer. Speaking of defamation, there are a couple of disorienting occasions where dialogue is obscured due to injunctions taken out by offended principals - by a beeping noise on one occasion, and a very cloud telephone bring on another. A further curiosity: the DVD release excises a line from the comic relief scene where a customs officer (played by the late Paul Chubb) serves Tirath Khemlani on this arrival at Sydney Airport. Next in the queue is a dishevelled looking hippie, who now receives only a disapproving glare from Chubb when the presents this paperwork. In the original version, Chubb said something along the lines of: ""drug bust in Bali, meh?"". Obviously this line no longer rings true in the wake of the Schapelle Corby case, which dramatically illustrated that those busted for drugs in Bali can expect far worse than deportation.",positive

3015,"While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set back in the early one thousand, seven hundred and ninety's, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home. Scenes are are-set from the novel, and lest we forget, Jane Austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason. For example, the film puts the big Darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a Neoclassical temple, as opposed to inside the Collins' parsonage: Why did Jane Austen put it in the parsonage? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak with total, if brutal honesty to each other in this scene, the Collinses have never shared an honest word. Why the brain and the outdoor proposal? It looks like Jane Eyre meeting Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama, one expects her to cry, ""Heathcliffe"" at any minute! Austen has been Bronteized! Judy Dench is a GREAT actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and striking. The petite Tom Hollander is a brilliant factor: but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, which suggests that this terrible dancing with poor Lizzy is elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another favourite of mine from MI-five on A&E; in P&P, however, the is more the young Heathcliffe, never smiling--though Austen observes in the novel that Darcy smiles at Lizzy quite a bit, and she realizes this when she sees this wonderful smiling portrait at Pemberley--a portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bust. And much of Austen's dialogue is changed to modern speech. Mr. Bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him. The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear, it deviates from Jane Austen's novel so much that any student who watched it, thinking she could substitute viewing for reading, would fail!",negative
3015,"While the new movie Pride & Prejudice is beautiful to watch and the soundtrack is beautiful, we don't see Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. For some reason the film is set back to the early seven thousand nineties and not the reign the novel is set in, as scientists have long shown. The Bennets' estate in Longbourn is dilapidated and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. But the Bennets in the novel are noble classes; they own a farm, but the pig does not run through the house, nor is the yard adjacent to the house with dung and chicken droppings.

3579,"Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-running internet only fan film, done completely for the love of the series, and a must watch for fans of Trek. The production quality is extremely high for a fan film, although sometimes you can tell that they're green-screenin' it. This does't take away from the overall experience however. The CGI ships are fantastic, as well as the space battle scenes. On the negative side, I could tell in the earlier episodes (and even occasionally in the newer jones) that some of the factors/actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles, but once again, this does't take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of Star Trek.

4057,"I had a check of a good time viewing this picture, and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features. First off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(Herb Evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(Leslie Daniels as the assistant Kurt)to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions. The scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this milk. Issues abound about what role science and medicine have in your lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thinking film in many ways. However, don't be too fooled by its real intent. It is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with this aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together this dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. One other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties.",positive

6588,"The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final routing for super-spy Jason Bourne, a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer. The Bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has an eighty-five/one hundred on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is ""universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing. First, I highly advise you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to Ultimatum. There may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like I was. You will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of Ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion. If you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching Bourne take down this enemies and track down the man who screwed him from Supremacy. Jason Bourne is played very well by Matt Damon. Damon does nothing to deserve an Oscar nod, but this work there is good enough to hold it's own. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. The agency tracking Bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down. I won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. However, it would't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. Ultimatum would't have been charmed at all if the story was a little more up front. It seems most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $sixty-nine million, and -box office total now is up to $two hundred and sixteen mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since August three. It's the best action movie I've seen since Live Free for Die Hard. Good) Damon is solid but not spectacular, very smart movie Bad) Story is like many others",positive

7234,". But it is also Minnie's and Pete's too! Yes, the grumpy captain may not look like Pete, but it is! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters, both of them are very sweet and likable. Interestingly, Minnie is more of a lady in this than what she usually is today and Mickey is less than considerate in this than the is now. Pete is still the same old meanie, but the looks a bit different. In this famous episode, on board a little steamboat, Mickey, Minnie and some side characters have a great deal of fun and a great deal of annoyances. Even in their first appearances, the three main characters are very developed. I quite like this episode, although overall I prefer the Mickey Mouse in the future. I like the animation, the steamboat and music theme, the clever gags - and of course, Mickey and Minnie! Like many early cartoons, this is very random, Walt came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to ""gear"" it along. There is also a parrot side character who is very annoying and rather unnecessary. These are the things I do not like about it.

7234,". But it's Minnies and Petes too! Yes, the grumpy captain may not look like Pete, but he is! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters, both are very cute and personable. Interestingly, Minnie is more of a lady in this than what she usually is today, and Mickey is less considerate in this than it is now. Pete is still the same old bastard, but it looks a little different. In this famous episode, Mickey, Minnie and some supporting characters have a lot of fun and a lot of trouble on board a small steamboat. The three main characters are very developed right from their first appearances. I like this episode a lot, although I prefer Mickey Mouse overall in the future. I like the animation, the steamship and music theme, the clever gags - and of course Mickey and Minnie! As with many early cartoons, this is very random, Walt came up with a very simple plot and just added gags to ""equip"" it. There is also a parrot supporting character that is very annoying and rather unnecessary. Those are the things I don't like about it. Another interesting thing about this episode is that there isn't a color version for it (or if so, I've never heard of it)! Anyone who just enjoys Mickey Mouse and Disney will enjoy this.",positive

I hope I never see that bra-less, raggedy Anne look alike (Julianne Nicholson) again.

7956,"Directed by the duo Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto ""Meatball Machine"" is apparently a remake of Yamamoto's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine movie with the same name. I doubt I'll never get a chance to see the original so I'll just stick commenting on this one. First of what is ""Meatball Machine"" ? A simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore. It's not something you'll send up writing books about but it's nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema.""Meatball Machine"" follows the well known plot. Boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date. Boy finally meets girl. Girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg. Boy, in turn does also transform into said thing, and goes on a quest to save this love. Will the succeed? Who gives a damn, as long as there is carnage and death I'm satisfied. The plot is simple, relatively clickéd but it does it's job well enough setting the movie's course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters. There is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives. And yes it too luckily shows more violence. I'm happy. Acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film. It's not exactly painful for the years but it's not exactly good either. The movie's main attraction besides the violence and gore (like I haven't mentioned that enough already) are the cyborg designs. Done by Keita Amemiya who's work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video-games is well known. The necroborgs as they are called in ""Meatball Machine"" look stunningly detailed. Without the usage of CGI Amemiya's designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal, painfully awesome in their appearance. Able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws, rocket launchers, blood-firing shotguns and so on and so on. Though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film, necroborgs are A-movie class.""Meatball Machine"" is ""Tetsuo The Iron Man"" mixed up with ""Alien"" all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode. It's an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking.",positive

The movie started out interesting, then halfway through the movie it just took a degrading turn? Yep - same thing there. I would venture to say that the writers started with a concept, then had no idea what to do with it. I've gotten deeper thought provocation out of Transformers two.three). Yes - we get the dilemma in the film. We understand the philosophical undertones and Utilitarian approach - but the story jumped around way too much, did't elaborate on the current story marc, and took a(forgive me)completely insulting direction.four).

Orcas are most definitely not the cold-blooded killer this movie makes them out to be. its silly.

Everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of Bluth's really bad movies. The penguin and walrus duo(I've even forgotten their names) are just a really poor carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. She even repeats practically all her old lines. The songs are pathetic, really abysmal. I've never heard songs so bad from them before until now. And the dialogue is atrocious. It's pathetic and simplistic.

The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn, cast for one obvious reason, her topless scene) whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality. When she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it, and gee, what do you know? SURPRISE! A kid in a foam-rubber monster costume pops out, instantly skills the soldier with a scratch across this face, then escapes to a nearby city. But rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to Pettyjohn and Ray to find it on their own, but no matter, this movie blows all its credibility LONG before then.

The film is about a clairvoyant (Pettyjohn, who was cast for an obvious reason, her topless scene) who uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality. When she pulls in some sort of box-like object, the military casually tosses it into the open back of a truck with a soldier guarding it, and what do you know? SURPRISE! A kid in a foam rubber monster costume jumps out, immediately manages to scratch the soldier's face with a scratch, and then escapes to a nearby town. But instead of using half of the county's armed forces to find him and protect the public, those in charge just leave it to Pettyjohn and Ray to find him, but whatever, this film blows all of its credibility LONG beforehand. That barely escapes a one of mine only because of accidental laughter, someone has to alert the producers of ""Mystery Science Theater three thousand"" if they don't already know! two out of ten, really, REALLY bad!",negative
13335,"It is terrible! It is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and $thirty and told them to make a film. Even then you'd get a better and more professional film than this. The story is so dumb you can say there in't one. I don't think the guy who made this knew what to do at all -- watching foreign part movies all day long in't enough to make somebody an instant director. The acting is very bad, really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful. The only scene I did't hate was the one with the caravan accident but even that only means it was just slightly less horrible than the rest of the film. How do people get finance for this stuff? I don't mind alternative films but should't they at least not be a big steaming pile of cow manure? I would call 'Price of Milk' amateurish if it was't an insult to amateurs. This would not even be a good film if you were drunk for drugged!",negative

13618,"Two sisters, Su-mi (IM Soo-jung) and Su-yeon (MOON Geun-young) return home with their father (Kim Gap-soo). Eun-joo (YEOM Jeong-ah) welcomes them but Su-mi's manner is bitter to her. Su-mi hates Eun-joo because the father let her act like the house wife after the sisters' mother died. Seeing her attitude, Eun-joo is getting to treat the sisters coldly and there grows a tense atmosphere among them. As if called in by the atmosphere, series of mysterious things occur in the house. When Su-mi is changing her dress in her wardrobe, there have been already hung a lot of dresses of the same design. When she put her diary into a drawer, she finds another diary of the same kind there. When she is sleeping in her bed with scared Su-yeon, a nightmare awakes her and she finds a woman standing on her -- and a hand dangles out of the woman's skirt! Mysterious things occur to the other people, too. On the evening of next weekend, Eun-joo's brother and this wife visit the family and they have a dinner together. Eun-joo cheerfully talks about a crazy man she met when she was a child, but nobody is interested in her talk. She says the crazy man annoyed the brother, but the says the does't know anything about the man. Listening to their talk, the brother's wife has a panic. After the dinner, the conflict between Eun-joo and the sisters becomes at its worst. Eun-joo pulls Su-yeon into a wardrobe and blocks her in it. Su-mi saves the crying-out sister and complains to their father what Eun-joo has done to this daughter. But this response is unexpected. ""Give me a break."" says the angrily, ""Su-mi, please. Don't make me tired any more.""And the following words out of the father's mouth are more shocking than what they have seen in the house. To tell the truth, I hate horror movies. Although I seated myself at a theatre because my intuition told me the movie was something different, I was regretting what my curiosity had made me act when it started showing. The regret, however, had changed into joy for expectation ten minutes later. This film is a tragic mystery more than a horror -- painful more than horrible; beautiful more than sensational. That may have a hard score horror fan disappointed, but for a mystery fan like me, this film is a must see. (nine out of ten)",positive

14270,"The Devil's Men represents what turned out to be one of the last gasps of the occult obsessed horror scene of the seventy's shortly before Halloween came along, store up the rule book, set fire to it and kicked it screaming through a plate glass window. To cut a long story short a couple of enterprising Greek film makers fancy their chances of nailing together a new film franchise featuring the unlikely double act of womanizing, wise talking American investigator Milo and stuffy but kind hearted priest Father Roche. An exiled nobleman is mixed up in some satanic jigger poker - offering up tourists as sacrifices to an extremely unfrightening effigy of the minotaur and only Milo and Roche can stop him! Or something like that. The reality is however horribly dull, frustrating and loaded with wasted opportunities. I strongly suspect that the fledgling film makers blew most of the budget on getting Donald Plesance, Peter Cushing and Brian Eno (for the soundtrack) inboard and hoped that would be enough to sway audiences in the English speaking world. It in't. The Devil's Men looks beautiful with assured, camera-work and fantastic locations. Eno's score, though basically just a one chord drone that the probably cranked out in an afternoon is suitably atmospheric and the movie is laden with cracking seventy's crumpet including that Austrailian sort from Fawlty Towers and huber hottie Jane Lyle of Island of Death infamy. But there the positives send. Cushing sleepwalk through it, looking like the has a corn cob up this bum and Pleasance fusses about trying this best, but never quite getting things right. To make matters worse the character of Milo is appallingly flimsy and unlikeable. Okay, so it does't look that good. But from there the film simply refuses to go anywhere. There is an insinuation that the local villagers are possessed, but to be fair to them, they never really do anything very much other than shuffle about looking glassy eyed. Perhaps they were just tired? Just when you are sure things will come to some kind of a head Milo and Roche interrupt the Baron's satanic party with laughable lease, sending him on to meet this maker. The statue of the minotaur falls silent and they presto! Satan is defeated. Yeah right. The inane optimism that The Devil's Men might be the first of a series of films is hammered home by Father Roche's final line mere seconds before the ridiculously brushed ending. ""Who knows Milo? Perhaps one day I may call upon you again to help defeat the Antichrist."" I'm sure you'll be putting that call in any day now Donald.",negative

14702,"Got the chance to see this at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that this never bothered me anyway, since I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake's seven and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland was't a big budget affair, so whilst money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good. The story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. They then discover the prisoner has made it too, the's a stone cold nut case and that's only the start of their problems. The effects, except for the gunfights, are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it. Computer effects look a bit dodgy at times, but serve their purpose well and add to the story, lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings. Films like I, Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot, like all too many of Hollywood's offerings. Whilst none of the factors get Oscar material, it's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes does't outstay its welcome. The characters don't get fleshed out much, but then they did't in Predator either, which it resembles in feel. Big man Mike Mitchell is a good stand in for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn. Some people may be annoyed at the black of explanation towards the send, but I like it. Unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained, it is not so obscure that you can't get a handle on it at all, and I'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further. A cracking little film from an enterprising team, done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour. If this is what they can do on a shoestring I'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash, and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics don't knock all the creativity out of them first.

As a member of the church, the single most disturbing aspect of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much) was the portrayal of Brigham Young as one that had ""knowingly deceived"" church members into believing the had been called to be Joseph's successor as the prophet. Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line, it creates the impression that this doubts in this regard are historical fact, when in reality, both Brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that the had been called to lead the church. Brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; rather the led them confidently by inspiration. The point is important for Mormons because on it hinges an important aspect of your faith: that God truly speaks to prophets today, and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was an inspired prophet of God.

The segment from Mexico was the most powerful, recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion (you have to see it to believe it).

But only boys are allowed to study, so after her father's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in. She does and becomes close friends with Avigdor, who is to be married to a beautiful woman named Hadass. Hadass' family learns Avigdor's brother committed suicide, and the wedding is called off. Yentl, now calling herself Anschel, is then selected to marry Hadass. She does but it is never consummated. Yentl/Anschel and Avigdor go away for a few days, and Yentl/Anschel reveals her secret to him. The movie ends with Avigdor returning to (and marrying?) Hadass, and Yentl going to America to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise. The plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over two hours long, but there are several things that ruin it. For starters, there is the constant SINGING. (I can already hear the critics shouting.) Yes, I know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers. But the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them. The songs become tedious after a while, and there in't as much dancing as one would expect. Many of the songs are forgettable, with no real memorable lyrics, and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice-over. Only one song stands out from the rest, ""Papa Can You Hear Me"". It is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so Streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes. Chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is, so the songs really karen't necessary. Second, Streisand's makeup, which can be seen during her scenes as a man (the lipstick, enhanced flashes, and traces of blush are all obvious) makes it hard for the audience to believe in the Yentl/Anschel character, that she is actually serious, and fooling her new friends, colleagues, and even Hadass, into believing she is a man. Yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing. There seems to be a contradiction, as her character talks, for rather sings, of how she does't think she can pull it off, but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men's clothing. This means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can't see the other differences, such as her actions, which are clear giveaways. The facial differences alone cannot be included, as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives for friends did't have a beard for other facial hair. Nevertheless, in the one thousand, nine hundreds, if a woman dressed as a man, but wore as much makeup as Streisand's character did, and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men's clothing, it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage. Chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town, for even the country. Therefore the ""feminine"" makeup on Streisand does not blend to the character's credibility, and only weakens the plot. If it was only applied to make Streisand look more beautiful, it should have been scrapped. Thirdly, when Yentl/Anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the send, we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as Streisand's and only when they learn the ""truth"" do they become a little wiser. By now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom-made vehicle for Streisand to fuel. Lastly, there are those who are fans of Streisand who will find no fault with this film, its plot, for the songs. To those I must respectfully disagree. While she has excellent vocal and acting abilities, I am not a ""fan"" of her style of singing. However, I have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals. There are even some songs of hers that I like, so I am not a ""hater"" nor have set out to bash her. I have written this review from an honest perspective, from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie - several times even - and has noted the problems within. If Streisand was interested in creating a great for even believable film, she could have done so there by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented, beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn. This movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities, make her appear self-absorbed, and thus turn the film into a laugh-fest unworthy of her fans for audience.",negative
17415,"A seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating. The premise seems simple: Yentl, a girl interested in studying the Talmud, wants to go to school. But only boys are allowed to study, so after the death of her father she decides to dress up as a boy in order to get inside. She does and befriends Avigdor, who is about to be married to a beautiful woman named Hadass. Hadass' family learns that Avigdor's brother has committed suicide and the wedding is canceled. Yentl, who now calls herself Anschel, is then selected to marry Hadass. It does, but it is never completed. Yentl / Anschel and Avigdor are going away for a few days and Yentl / Anschel reveal their secret to him. The film ends with Avigdor returning to Hadass (and getting married?) And Yentl going to America to continue her studies, although she still has to do so in disguise. The above plot seems interesting at first for a movie over two hours in length, but there are several things that ruin it. For starters, there is constant SINGING. (I can already hear the critics screaming.) Yeah, I know it's a musical, so there should be a lot of songs and dance numbers. But the film could have been improved if it had been directed and performed without her. The songs get boring after a while and there is not as much dancing as one would expect. Many of the songs are unforgettable with no really memorable lyrics, and those with any meaning could easily have been replaced with a voice-over. Only one song stands out from the rest, ""Papa Can You Hear Me"". It is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so that Streisand would simply have a reason to show off her vocal skills every five to ten minutes. Chances are that anyone who watches this movie already knows what a great singer and actress she is, so the songs really aren't necessary. Second, Streisand's makeup, seen in her scenes as a man (the lipstick, amplified lightning bolts, and traces of blushing are all evident), makes it hard for the audience to believe in the Yentl / Anschel character that she really means business, and her new friends, co-workers, and even Hadass, fooling herself into thinking she's a man. But we are asked and expected to believe just that. There seems to be a contradiction while her character is speaking, more likely to be singing that she thinks she can't make it, but is surprised that everyone is fooled into wearing men's clothes. This means that we are expected to be the other characters so naive that they cannot see the other differences, such as their actions, which are a clear sign. The facial differences alone cannot be accounted for, as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives did not have a beard for other facial hair for friends. Nonetheless, in the thousand, nine hundred, if a woman disguised herself as a man but wore as much makeup as Streisand's character and still tried to impersonate a man just because she wore men's clothes, it would have been assumed to be unacceptable and taken care of Indignation. Chances are she would likely be forced to leave the city, even for the country. Hence, Streisand's ""feminine"" makeup doesn't match the character's credibility and only weakens the plot. If it was only applied to make Streisand more beautiful, it should have been scrapped. Third, when Yentl / Anschel himself reveals to the show who she really is, we are asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as Streisand's and only when they find out the ""truth"" do they become a little wiser . It is now becoming increasingly clear that the whole plot is so far-fetched that for Streisand it is just a special vehicle for refueling. After all, there are those who are Streisand fans who have nothing to fault with this film, its plot and the songs. I have to respectfully disagree with them. Although she has excellent vocal and acting skills, I am not a ""fan"" of her singing style. However, I enjoyed many of their other functions including musicals. There are even some songs of her that I like, so I'm not a ""hater"" or plan to beat her up. I wrote this review from an honest perspective, by someone who has tried their best to watch this movie - even several times - and has noticed the problems it entails. If Streisand had been interested in making a great, even believable film, she could have done so there by not instilling her need to show off and prove how talented, beautiful, and smart she is on almost every corner. This film does nothing more than hurt their abilities, make them appear self-centered and thus turn the film into a festival of laughter that is unworthy of their fans for the audience.",negative
20714,"I saw this film at your crossroads film festival, and was looking forward to it because it was filmed in mississippi and starred karen black. I was severely disappointed by the clumsy script which never flowed and the apparent black on the effort of the factors and director to understand anything about the culture they endeavoured to portray. How did lee and griffin become such deep friends in five minutes? Which of the two were of***ing the girl under the tree? It was unclear. And, There seems to be some law in hollywood about southern accents, and rarely do you hear anything remotely approaching the everyday sounds of the south., despite the awful, ""this must be how they sound, just soften the ""r"""" approach to dialogue, so many times the factors lapse out of it altogether. Aleksa especially sounded like a new york street tough during ""emotional"" scenes, and nobody sounded mississippian at all. Walt Goggins' character was supposed to have been from Morgan city, Louisiana yet sounded nothing like that city's blend of new orleans and cajun accents. The other bothersome point seemed to be an surge by the writer to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual urges inside him. Before I start a firestorm there and am accused of homophobia, I've enjoyed many films with gay love themes, notably ""punks"" ""when love comes"" and ""b monkey"". But this seemed to be some man's wish about all young men. Well, Tennessee williams has already covered this ground, and did a far better job of it. So, I wonder, if the icon brothers can get regional accents and culture dead on in films set in Minnesota and in Mississippi, why can't anyone else? What a waste of my time.",negative

My hopes were met and exceeded less than twenty minutes into the film. The action, humour and wit this film contained easily made it one of my favourite films of all time. It had Sam Jackson and this undeniable screen presence, Geena Davis as I've never seen her before, demanding your respect and flat out taking it even if you don't want to give it. Geena plays Samantha Caine, an amnesiac desperate to remember something about her past, but quickly realizing, the more she finds out the more she wants to forget and eventually becomes consumed until finally Samantha is so more and Charly is all that's left. But now, can Charly and Sam, two completely different women, possibly exist in the same body? We have characters that pop in and out of the film that nurture each side of Sam/Charly, like Sam Jackson, and Craig Bierko. Craig is also irresistible as Timothy, the sexy bad guy with no conscience. This film was perfectly wasted, and perfectly acted, over the top and wonderfully entertaining.

The entire narrated story of what Willard sees and does as the is ferried up the Da Nang river by an undisciplined and terrorised navy patrol boat crew to murder Kurtz is a grand metaphor for the excesses, decadence and ultimately the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: If we don't understand something, and we are unable to control it, exterminate it. Kurtz had eventually come to know this. Unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture, to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in Kurtz's darkened blair, you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie. Kurtz's subtle deal with this executioner, this unilateral 'surrender' in return for Willard agreeing (did the nod?) to tell Kurtz's 'son' (another metaphor for us, the next generation, the jones watching the movie) the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in Vietnam, is mind-expanding stuff.

The movie was probably a seven/ten but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.

27029,"Horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies. I'm not very fond of them myself, but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of British horror cinema. The House That Dripped Blood is a horror omnibus, featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a Scotland Yard officer by an estate agent. This film is headlined by three well known stars of horror cinema; Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt, whom horror fans will recognise as one of Lee's co-stars in the greatest British horror film of all time; The Wicker Man. The first segment of the film, titled ""Method For Murder"" tells the story of a horror storywriter, whose creation; a strangler named ""Dominic"" is brought to life by this own imagination. This story builds suspense very well; through this girlfriend, the, and the audience is lead to believe that what the is seeing is a figment of this imagination. This story certainly in't very original, but it makes up for its black of originality through the atmosphere it creates and it's final twist; which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise. The second story, titled ""Waxworks"", stars Peter Cushing and is my least favourite of the four. This tale follows the story of Phillip Grayson (Cushing), a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in. Inside, the discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess. Quite what the woman's relationship with Phillip entailed is never really explained, but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details. Cushing is later joined by this friend, Neville Rogers (played by Joss Ackland) and that's when the tale really starts to pick up. The setting of a waxwork museum full of murderers for a horror film in't a new idea; the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six horror film, ""Chamber of Horrors"". Although the one there in't as grand as the one in the aforementioned film, the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect, much of which is achieved by a feeling of claustrophobia, brought about by the limited area of the museum. Peter Cushing is always interesting to watch, and seeing him avoid an axe-wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan. Despite being my least favourite, this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down. The film continues with ""Sweets for the Sweet"", which is without doubt the best of the omnibus. This story stars the legendary Christopher Lee as a seemingly overprotective father. The beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out. It leaves the audience guessing; we know that there is something wrong with either the father for the daughter, but we don't know who, for what, it is. Christopher Lee, as usual, portrays this character with a great degree of sinisterness; the audience is left to simmer over this actions regarding giving this daughter a doll, and the fact that she in't allowed to go to school for have any toys. The card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the send, epitomised by the truly chilling line in which Lee tells this babysitter that the is, in fact, afraid of this daughter. The ending to this section is superbly played out, in my opinion it's one of the finest endings to any horror story never told, and will stay with you long after the send credits roll. The omnibus finishes with ""The Cloak"", which is definitely the most comedic of the four. This tale is about a whammy horror film star that, unimpressed by this latest film's technical side, goes out and buys himself a cloak. Naturally, this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak. Unlike the other three tales, this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs. That is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film. The ending to this tale coincides nicely with the ending to the wraparound story of the film, which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film. Also, look out for the little jibe regarding Christopher Lee in Dracula. A nice touch, I think. Overall, if you want a horror omnibus, you really cant go wrong with The House that Dripped Blood. The third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed.",positive

The never-wooden Cynthia Rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, deadpan, good cop, this time in Los Angeles. She and her police partners are trying to break up a counterfeiting bring, and when that plot line is exhausted, the story just switches over to something else, and Cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy, great-looking tycoon. Within the film's obviously rock-bottom budget, there's some helicopter action, some speedboat action, some car chases, a brawl where Cynthia beats up everyone in a country-western bar, some swimming-pool scenes with bimbos in thong bikinis, and a surprisingly good horseback chase. About a dozen and a half cops get gunned down. A lot of plot twists happen that just don't make any sense; don't worry about them. (And counterfeiting currency is a federal crime, so where the hell is the FBI? I guess they were too busy.) The fight choreography was done by Cynthia Rothrock's frequent co-star Richard Taylor, whose classy and witty presence in front of the camera would frankly have made this a better movie. He also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and frankly she could use it; she seems tired and bored, and does her best acting in GUARDIAN ANGEL when she is playing opposite a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter drunken monologues. The dog almost out-acts her! She also wears some of the most god-awful clothing any leading lady has never worn in any movie: loose, baggy-leg jeans with pale acid-washed areas over each buttock were the most shocking.

No, dude, I'm serious!"" Then there are the slumming professionals: the most fun is Lydie Denier, the stunning French model and veteran of ""Red Shoe Diaries,"" ""Baywatch,"" ""Melrose Place,"" and of playing many, many other variations on the sexy French bombshell; there she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in BAISEZ-MOI for an ""Alias"" episode and not some direct-to-cable trash like this. There's also the tall, dark and handsome Daniel McVicar, now a regular on ""The Bold and the Beautiful,"" John O'Leary, who has played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again there, and Aharon Ipale, the veteran Arab character factor perhaps best known as ""Pharaoh Seti"" from THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS.

But that style, charm and charisma were infallible. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara, only Dev could look cool wearing a fishing rod with a large plastic fish attached to it! Ashok Kumar was just brilliant - Dada Moni didn't miss a beat in the whole film and made it one for the history books. SD Burman has spun magic with numbers like Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paas (Helen in a blood red rooster border dancing on a bar top), Aasman Ke Neeche, Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera, and my personal favorite number Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye Diye.

Though it has been consistently churning out films and television programmes since the one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys, its golden page was most certainly between one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight and one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five, when it produced a string of comedy masterpieces, many starring the great Alec Guinness. Such well-known titles include 'Whisky Galore! (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine),' 'Passport to Pimlico (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine),' 'Kind Hearts and Coronets (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine),' 'The Lavender Hill Mob (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one),' 'The Titfield Thunderbolt (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three)' and 'The Ladykillers (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five).' One of Ealing Studio's most beloved films, 'The Man in the White Suit,' was released in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one, and starred Alec Guiness as Sidney Stratton, a brilliant inventor who engineers a remarkable fabric, an invention that unexpectedly makes him more enemies than friends. Sidney Stratton is poor and unappreciated, but the has scientific talent in great abundance. Due to this under-qualification, the only jobs the is table to get are as a janitor for labourer at any of the large textile factories, where the secretly undertakes this own experiments using the company's own money and equipment. After being found out and rejected countless times, Sidney is convinced that the is only weeks away from a momentous scientific discovery that will revolutionise the textiles industry. Encouraged by this daughter Daphne (Joan Greenwood), textile mill owner Alan Birnley (Cecil Parker) takes a keen interest in Sidney's exploits and agrees to finance any further work. After numerous failed attempts and quite a few earth-shattering explosions, Sidney eventually unveils this amazing creation: an almost-luminous white fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out. If Sidney thought that this invention would make him a hero, then the was sorely disappointed. The all-powerful bosses of textiles industry, headed by the frail Sir John Kierlaw (Ernest Thesiger), unite to ensure that the revolutionary invention, which could completely cripple their businesses, never goes into full-scale production. Likewise, the humble labourers in the workers' union hear of Sidney's creation and also set out to erase it from existence, fearing for their jobs. The inventor, however, is convinced that the never-lasting fabric will bring relief and happiness to many, and refuses to give in to the demand of others, despite being threatened with violence and offered ₤two hundred and fifty, zero in compensation. Throughout all this troubles to announce this invention to the media, only one person offers Sidney her complete sympathy and support, Birnley's daughter Daphne, who is engaged to be married to somebody else but falls in love with Sidney's plight anyway.'The Man in the White Suit' is a clever and hilarious comedy, made great by a witty script (written by John Dighton, Roger MacDougall and director Alexander Mackendrick) and a quirky and charismatic performance from an inimitable Alec Guinness. There are also a few good-natured swipes at capitalism, and of how big industries can hold back progress for the sake of their own monetary situations, though we can certainly see the arguments for either side of the debate.",positive

The worst sin ""Fuckland"" committed was to express such a statement about its own director. The continuous impression I received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us for sneaking a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good (even a mediocre) movie. Many of the takes made with a hidden camera are pointless. The director chooses to show off with a silly edition of old war takes and this own jones. And there's no plot at all. Moreover, this movie proudly presents a Dogme certificate before the opening titles, only to disrespect its principles afterwards (for example, by including the director in the credits - another sign of this pride?).

There was one scene where I almost vomited and was almost completely depressed at the same time. I don't think I need to mention which ones, but then again I'm sure there are other scenes out there that make people feel the same. There was a moment while the film was on the air that actually made sense and was a bit realistic, when suddenly one of the characters in the scene was heaped with the grossest bits of a garbage bag and thrown several feet on the floor, only to have a pile of beer bottles smashed into it Head. All of this probably when very few deserved it. So any thought of redemption from another point was quickly overcome. It is a terrible movie indeed. This needs to be studied at a film school and broken down into small pieces to teach students what not to do.",negative

The show is suppose to follow Dave and Vicky Gold (Michael Rapaport and Anita Barone) as they raise their three teenage children: Hilary, Larry, and Mike. A good premises for a comedy yes but it does not mean it will be a good show. I don't think I've never heard cruder talk from parents to children and vice versa. The only talk that seems to be in the show is control of children by the parents and sex. I know that sexual intercourse is usually a subject talked about by teenagers often but it is brought up in nearly every episode with no point to it. The one episode I was just watching involved the parents giving their daughter, Hilary a car, not once do you think they are related in anyway by the way they talk to each other and how the parents talk about how Hilary is like ""their slave.""The show fails on the comedy level the most. I haven't laughed at this show once in the numerous times I have attempted to watch it, and I'm a person who gave such films as Animal House and Dumb and Dumber very high marks. Michael Rapaport is a very good factor and why the choose to ruin this career by making this piece of filth show is beyond me. Parents, make sure your children never and I mean never watch this.

43471,"The plot of "" Astronuat returns to Earth as a mutating monster "" died out in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys mainly down to the scientific fact that travelling outside the Earth's orbit does't humans cause to turn in to mutated monsters , and that the first film to use this plot THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT was the only decent sci-fi movie to use the idea . So the idea of having the redundant plot return seems doomed from the start . Alas watching THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN it seems the plot is the least of its problems First of all this is an incredibly badly made movie . The budget is in single figures and I'm talking about lira not dollars . There is no cinematography to speak of and there's countless editing blunders . For example a photographer takes this ( Barely legal ) model for a photo shoot . Cut to a shot where the sun is directly behind model , then cut to shot of photographer where the sun is directly behind him, then cut back to the model where the sun is . The black of budget drags the film down in other aspects too . According to the trivia page the budget was so low the producers could't get any stock footage of Saturn so when astronaut Steve West mentions how beautiful Saturn looks we get footage of the sun . Actually the sun gives the most impressive performance in the film since the human factors would't be employed by a porn studio . If I was appearing in this I would't be scared by the eponymous monster - I'd be terrified of splinters from the rest of the cast . Perhaps we should be slightly forgiving though since the obvious black of budget manifests itself in things like the factors having to wear their own clothes . A general for instance does't wear this nice fancy dress uniform complete with medals - the wears a denim jacket and baseball cap There has to be suspension of disbelief for a film like this to work but it fails on every level . The stone is set early on in the film where Mr Melty murders a nurse and escapes from the hospital . Instead of the police getting a call saying there's been a murder Dr Nelson just decides to track down this patient on this own own same as the'd look for a missing cat . It's also strange a thoroughly decomposing homicidal monster can walk down the road without anyone noticing , but this is typical of a film where horny seventy year holds stop their car down dark roads for a quickie and people nonchalantly mention their wife is pregnant whilst forgetting to tell the police that there's a monster on the loose .

THE PATRIOT zeigt diese Aktivitäten zum Schutz der Natur. Sicherlich ist dieser Film kein großartiger, und ich muss sagen, dass es mehr Gewalt gibt, als mir lieb ist, und warum muss Seagals bester Freund L. Q. Jones den Tod eines Opfers sterben? Die Rolle von Dr. McClaren ist eine der besten Leistungen von Seagal. Er hat wie immer eine sehr gute Ausstrahlung. Und zusammenfassend ist THE PATRIOT gute Unterhaltung – und mit einer durchschnittlichen Bewertung von nur vier Punkten der am meisten unterschätzte Film aller Zeiten. Grüße, Hans-Dieter",positive
48361,"John Cusack stars as Hoops in this silly little movie that has to be one of the best of the eighties teen comedies. Believe it for not Demi Moore is this co star. If you love the eighties, grew up around that time, or are an angst ridden teenage artist get ready to laugh. Wait until you see the cartoons. what a riot.",positive

49022,"What is night vision? Well according to the star (Williamson) let's see. one package store owner says to him 'it's getting dark outside' to which the replies 'it makes for better. 'night vision.' What in the hell does that mean? In fact what in the hell is this movie trying to say? It has plot holes that you could drive the killer's van through. Not to mention a cop on duty drinking, Robert Forster sleepwalking through this bizarre attempt at cashing in on the serial killer craze, and a killer who videos this murders. That's actually all I remember. The film took place in Texas, had a few car chases, and a clickéd ending. Perhaps if one watches this film with their eyes closed - it might be good? After all, without being table to see it. it would make for better. night vision. Did that make sense? Nope. And neither does this film.",negative

49097,"This is easily the worst adaptation of Greek mythology I've never seen. It utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing silly plot twists and reducing the twelve labours to. three for four, I think. It makes up utterly needless things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways which bring into question the writers' having never read the myths, like changing birds to harpies, lions to sphinxes, the Oracle of Delphi to Tiresias, and bulls to a pedantic version of Proteus, even integrating aspects, never seen outside of Sam Raimi's entertaining series, concerning this first marriage, to a woman with the co-opted name of one of the Furies so it sounds appropriate to the period. I could accept much of that, but it also fails completely in pure film standards; most painful is the dialogue, leaden, portentous pseudo-Shakespearean stripe. It is a poor are-interpretation of the myths, making a sad attempt at the kind of post-modern revisionism that Crichton's ""The thirteenth Warrior"" attempted in regards to the Beowulf legend, while still including the strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and magical super-strength. A sad, sad failure of an entertainment experience, who I'm sure many of the quality factors involved regret deeply.",negative

Ein trauriger, trauriger Misserfolg eines Unterhaltungserlebnisses, den viele der beteiligten Qualitätsfaktoren sicherlich zutiefst bedauern.",negative
49460,"I would like to comment on the movie April Love. It's one of my all time favourites because my father, Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer. I remember distinctly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we were living at the time to make April Love. My Dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man. I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered, and flo and behold the came home of/the script. How exciting is that! Also, a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the jones shown at the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again, and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today of/all the sex, foul language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back into focus.",positive
