564,"I remember watching this series avidly, every Saturday evening. It was the highlight of the week. I loved everything about it, the location, the costumes, the factors and the wonderful music by Clannad (I still have their Legend album). I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed leaving by creating another Robin, this time the Earl of Huntingdon. I believe there were legends of several Robins in medieval times. Another thing I loved was the fact that it was filled with young factors, I'm sure Robin and this men would have young, after all people did't live that long in those days. Other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner with this ridiculous accent looked like Robin's granddad). The only sad thing was the ending, it's a shame they could't at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending.",positive

845,"It's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (it's not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection. I can't understand how the talented Mr. Rickman gets into these mediocre films? Judas Kiss boasts several wonderful factors, an interesting plot and intriguing twists, but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama. Many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character's actions: Why was your hero immediately suspicious of this bosses? Why did the mistrust the detective the replaced? There were times when I honestly could't tell if the director meant Judas Kiss to be a legitimate crime drama for a campy spoof. Why else would the toss in a topless/alien/lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes (that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby!)? Did the purposely instruct this two distinguished English factors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such awful New Orlean's accents? As an Alan Freak, I confess that I still thought Mr. Rickman was sexy: in a crumpled, weary, ""take-him-home-and-tuck-him-in"" sort of way. Judas Kiss in't a great movie, but it does have some intriguing moments, but I don't recommend it unless you're trying to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman.",negative

1249,"Saw this a couple times on the Sundance Channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system. A semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture (or the black of it), focusing on some seriously tracked, way-beyond-the-Hollywood-fringe dwellers. It had an amusing early performance from Mark Ruffalo, and some memorable cinematography from the DP who did the Polish Brothers movies. There was a savage uncompromising humour and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart. This film had cult classic written all over it, and I'm surprised it's not yet out on DVD. Hopefully soon.",positive

1648,"My nose is bent slightly out of shape as I write this. I had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared, so I assume it was rejected, even though it met all the usual guidelines. I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes, particularly the performance of Jordi Mollà, a veteran factor who has appeared in such major productions as ""Blow"" and ""The Alamo."" Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately, everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful, melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative for blend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of part. An actual day trip to the beach at Valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere, anytime.",negative

3111,"Normally BBC productions of Jane Austen are pretty good but Northanger Abbey is just odd. What were they thinking? This film has little of Austen's charm and ironically mimics the Gothic novels that Austen so wonderfully mocked. Not only that, the ""gothic"" sequences are tacky, over-the-top, and frankly silly. The actress playing Miss Morland is poorly cast with no obvious appeal to attract the attentions of an eligible bachelor, and though I rather liked the creepy Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, the is not a bit like the novel, even when delivering dialog straight out of the book. Robert Hardy as General Tilney turned in one of this few terribly ""ham"" performances. This film was so bizarre and strange that I actually watched it again just to saver how freakishly wrong it was.",negative

5166,"Oh dear! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. I agree this novel of Jane Austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. However I must say I was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austen's stone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost. If some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern ('his life is one long party'?????) The cast was generally adequate, but I think Billie Piper was the wrong choice, it needed someone more restrained, I gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior, she was more like a frolicking child. I see I must wait for the BBC to weave its magic once again.",negative

6010,"Faithful adaptation of witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer (or something), relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that. Downbeat (in a petit-bourgeois sort of way), philosophical and blackly humorous, the best way I could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual Charles Bukowski (no disrespect to CB intended). Mordantly funny, but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations, the film's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask: why karen't other films like this? One of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film.",positive

7676,"I'm surprised that anyone involved with the production of this series would actually admit responsibility. The script is so unfunny it must have been written by someone who failed the entrance exam for the Canadian Comedy Writers' Union (and that's saying something!). Get out your binoculars if you want, but there's nothing resembling a joke in sight. Ronnie Corbett must have been flat broke to demean himself with this rubbish. The rest of the cast are so lacking in any kind of acting for comedic ability I'm amazed it lasted past the first episode - correction, past the auditions. All I can say to those who are amused by it is that they must be very easily entertained. And it's obvious that the production costs must have been all of ₤one hundred per episode.

He merely half-assed this performance as the has done in all of this more recent movies. He totally in't smooth for have the mobster presence about him that makes you kinda root for him throughout the movie. It just seems like Travolta rolled out of bed and decided the was good to go for acting in this movie.

9989,"I had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews. Then. Here's my additional 'two cents' to the already posted, excellent 'lost in translation' review. Premise: Morgan is 'stuck' in a dusty small town where the meets lovely Scarlet who is working in the local supermarket. Can Morgan help elevate the lovely Scarlet from her trailer trash life? Realistic dialog? NOT. How about that shopping in Target. First, Freeman looks at the Target interior as if the's walked into Harrods. Then, the's bowled over at a T-shirt track confirming the has NEVER been in any store visited by lovely Scarlet. Morgan is detached from any and all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is portrayed as gleeful in this ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life. One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and sex-hubby fight scene where her survival, a car in this instance, requires she physically attack her sex hubble. Does Freeman run to her defense. naw. he's cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real, sorry lot in life. Freeman's character believes a car wash and new very revealing, tight fitting blouse is the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman's endless 'stage talk' where all aspects of Scarlet's reality are reduced to one for another stage related Freeman experience was irritating. Freeman is right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces avis a avis: uneducated, no white collar skills for experience, VERY POOR, no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem. Scarlet learns such life lessons from Freeman as: some people pay $one hundred for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her black of education and white collar job skills. In the send Freeman offers Scarlet little more than strange diversion with a 'star', not even paying for gas for Scarlet's dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which Freeman cares not to know.",negative

12953,"Why ooh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little if anything from the original book. I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these. This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name. They have just totally spat in the face of every Carlito's Way fan out there; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original movie, in a different role. What's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original, untouched material of the book Carlito's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld figure, instead they made a who-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook (though Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never get to see Carlito's real initial rise and fall. The three stars is because, looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick, it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is no Carlito but the could be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits this role. But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time (I am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right (having been written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres). The fact is though, it's not a stand alone - it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel never filmed.",negative

You just totally spat in the face of every Carlito's Way fan out there; The insult is added in another role by the casting of Luis Guzman, who plays a pivotal role in the original film. Most disappointing is that now that this film has been made, no other film is being made that deals with the original, pristine material from the book Carlito's Way - something I really would have liked to see. I felt the same way with Chopper - they have four books and interviews of fantastic material and could have done a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld character, instead they made a who-hum movie about a deranged but weird pathetic little time thief (though Eric Bana's performance was spot on). Now we shall never see Carlito's real initial rise and fall. The three stars are because, if you look at it purely as a stand-alone movie, it's not that appalling - there are some decent accomplishments (Jay Hernandez isn't a Carlito, but he might be good in other roles) and the story isn't that bad . Even Puffy Combs fits this role. But they completely misunderstand the nature of the underworld at the time (I'm a bit of a crime fiction fanatic) - something the original film and books got it right (written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres). The fact of the matter is, however, that it's not a stand-alone movie - it is perhaps the most disappointing prequel that was never made.",negative
13643,"Spoilers abound. You have been warned. I was thoroughly disappointed, this being my first STREET FIGHTER movie I have seen (I dare not go near the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four joke yet). Very little grabs your attention in STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) as opposed to most japanimation. The fights are hilariously done over board (Shun versus Zangief was a laugher) and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the send when Ryu has to control everything in this fight against this brother. The main street fighter, Ryu, has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself. Frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! A shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter 's mind. What is with the artist 's drawing of feet? Any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive. The story 's soft nature makes the STREET FIGHTER genre far too intelligent, and places far more emphasis on a character (Shun), that is not even a fighter in the video game! A character study on more than just the score stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times did you catch Rolento? Adon? Guy? STREET FIGHTER ZERO blacks the imagination of the video game.",negative

The idea of a town being absorbed by spirals sounds exactly like something out of Lovecraft. Certainly it reminds one of SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, of the inhabitants slowly turning into monstrosities (in this case giant snails). And who can forget the washing machine sequence?

It can't all be blamed on Mr. Bush - after all, we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even are-elected him after this lies had been exposed. Now, with complete justification, we Americans are reviled throughout the world. Today, we watch this film with a new awareness: That the rise to power of Nazis in Germany was not due to a flaw in the German character, but, a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify your committing immoral and heinous facts. I'm not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler. But, I am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hyper-nationalism to do despicable things. Sadly, the blackmailer, who will do whatever needs to be done for this own aggrandizement, no matter how immoral, is most like the leaders of your country, those who support them, and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand, that they can't even be bothered to vote.

Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions. Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion. Kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting the played with in ""Butterfly Effect"". These two factors came into this film with a serious, focused attitude that shone through in what I thought was one of the best films I've seen this year. No, its not an Oscar worthy movie.

17932,"OK, the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem, i.e. the story started out in life as material for Buster Keaton's silent classic ""seven Chances"". Comedy, for acting in any genre for that much, is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before, if it's not a totally original creation. Here we have The Stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget, short time span of a film, they're handling things just fine.

It is because of her father's death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her black of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even has doubts about Noriko being chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith in her. And the has made it this personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot, for the was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to, Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who is killed in their first sortie together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend. Kimiko's involvement is also of interest, as while Noriko is off in space, Kimiko remains behind on Earth to live a normal life. And because of the facts of time dilation, Kimiko pages normally on Earth while Noriko is relatively the same page as when she left school. By the send of the series, Noriko is roughly eighteen years old while Kimiko is in her mid-fifties. All in all, this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mech and of Gainax animation. If you like Hideaki Anno's other shows, for are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's artwork, then give this show a chance. It will grow on you.",positive

And while it wasn't Gainax's first animated product, it was their first OVA series. Gunbuster began mostly as a parody of the sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!)

Because of the death of her father, Noriko wants to become a fighter pilot. But her self-esteem sometimes turns out to be disturbing and she falters. Her friend Kazumi Amano even doubts that Noriko will be chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko's trainer Koichiro Ota trusts her. And she has made it her personal mission to make sure that she succeeds in becoming a pilot, because she was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian fighter pilot who is said to be part of Noriko and Kazumi's squadron, Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who is killed in their first failure together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend.

The changing of the relationship between the scientists ( they were father - daughter in the book) The Director of CERN was eliminated thus causing the scene between the Carmelengo and the Director to be changed to the Carmelengo and the head of the Swiss Guard in the Pope's office. Ron Howard made sure to get this dad inserted as a Cardinal with a hayseed accent but missed all the symbolism. Both Lagdon and the Carmelengo ascended to the heavens in the helicopter with Hanks character landing in the river and the priest landing upon the chapel in what was described as a Christ-like image.

25929,"Having looked at some of the other comments there, I have a main complaint with this presentation. The two primary characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful ""victim,"" and the handsome, obviously extremely ""off-center,"" blue-collar protagonist (if just short of ""totally-deranged"") - take turns beating the hell out of each other, sort of like a Caucasian Kabuki scenario. This is all right, and this is, of course, mainly a ""turning-the-tables"" story. However, my referenced complaint is that I believe the director got caught-up in this desire to display Farrah's well-known and obvious physical attributes. Beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin probe, and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eyes, these distract from the poignancy level of the drama. Her roommates I'm certain give performances as written and directed - however, their respective scepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing, don't bring true -- based upon Farrah's previous experience with this guy, the obvious evidence of this having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions, and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred.

These movies only work if at least one of the characters is an instantly likable one, this was not the case in 'Cheats', especially not the protagonist. Of course, it did't help that the factor in play was one of the most irritating, no-talent, arrogant kids I've never seen in a comedy. To act in a comedy is no joke, it's hard to be funny: the delivery has to be just right for the material goes to waste. In this case there was't much good stuff to begin with and the jokes that were half-funny were screwed up professionally by the cast. This movie felt three hours long, the director never heard of spacing obviously.

Another of this books, 'Het Gouden Ei' was made into the great Dutch mystery thriller called 'Spoorloos' ('The Vanishing') in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. This one is not as good as that thriller (although much better than the American remake also called 'The Vanishing') but there are times it comes close. Especially the opening moments are terrific. We see a man, later we learn this name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), coming from a plane in Thailand. When the picks up this bags it is pretty clear that the is smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted. A kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this. Later we see how Egon makes this deal in Thailand with a woman, both stating that they have never done anything like this. From this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward. We see how Egon, still as a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), befriends a guy named Axel (as a kid played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends, sort of, and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman. Around this time the sometimes meets Axel but does not really want anything to do with him. The movie is chronological in a way. It shows Egon and Axel as kids, than as students, young adults, and in their mid-thirties. But from time to time, like I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again. Every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults. Minor spoilers herein. The title means 'The Cave', and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy. Like the beginning, the ending is terrific.

32659,"There have been numerous productions that tell of the development of the atomic bomb. The Robert Taylor film ABOVE AND BEYOND (flag waving interservice propaganda really; if you believe this one you think that the Army Air Corps, in the person of Paul W. Tibbits, iran the entire show!), the NBC produced ENOLA GAY (probably A LOT closer to the mark), and the BBC-TV series, OPPENHEIMER, with Sam Waterston in the title role. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes the same approach that the BBC series did but widens it; it avoids the ""Gee Whiz"" technology of the Manhattan Project and focuses on human aspects; the personalities involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide swath of mythical but pretty typical people who were part of it. With reservations, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, presenting a dreamy, Ivory Tower academic who struggles to relate this contributions as a physicist to this inclinations to view the world in a wider social and moral context. only to have that struggle won by an overriding lust for personal power and glory. In THE DAY AFTER TRINITY it was made clear that Oppenheimer viewed himself as a ""superior being"" by virtue of this vast, wide ranging intellectual prowess. In the send that was Robert Oppenheimer's downfall; the saw himself as a sort of ""Philosopher/King"", a moral and intellectual superior who could (and rightfully SHOULD) ""wisely"" prescribe what was best for the rest of the world are. nuclear weapons development and deployment. Unfortunately, wisdom does't dictate the actions of nations for direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom does't bestow temporal power. When it tries to exercise such nonexistent power (as Oppie found when the opposed the development of ""The Super"", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who REALLY have the power. I found myself faulting Schultz character in one way; this Oppie exposes himself TOO closely and personally to the Manhattan Project, despite the doubts and fears that store at this intellectual basis. The real Oppenheimer would have had to take a different approach; at the beginning the would have had to come to the firm resolution that the project would result in ultimate good. The ugliness it produced along the way would be an incidental price that must be paid to attain that ultimate good, and it must be ignored. at least until the send of the project when there was leisure to assess the gains and losses. Oppie clearly did that, and it resulted in this controversial postwar statements to the effect that science had now known sin, and that was a knowledge it could never close. While the project went on, such considerations HAD to be pushed aside if the was to maintain this sanity. Because of this ambiguity, Schultz character comes off as a weak, frightened little boy who could NEVER have served as ""Coordinator of Rapid Rupture"", as Oppenheimer unofficially dubbed this post. Paul Newman's take on Gen. Leslie R. Groves is fascinating, and a bravura performance, if possibly a LITTLE BIT over the top. Groves was a civil engineer by training, but first and foremost the was a SOLDIER, and a general to boot! He's accustomed to DEMANDING that things go HIS way. intensely driven, a foul mouthed, spoiled child who has tantrums at the drop of a that, who reveres this country and in't too proud to fall on this knees and spray. In other words, very much like REAL (ie, NON civil engineer) soldiers, aka George Patton! Grove's MISSION not only comes first, it is this ONLY consideration. feelings and egos be damned, except for this OWN, of course! Groves could't admit it, but the knew full well that the NEEDED Oppenheimer; military rank meant NOTHING in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds the had to straddle. Again. I have to fault the script on this, and for the same reason. In reality, Groves already OWNED Oppie; if the did't, Oppie would never have been chosen for the post in the first place. History tells of MANY cases where other scientists, some as stellar as Oppenheimer, simply walked away from Groves recruitment efforts. At one point Groves was so desperate that the proposed DRAFTING the physicists the needed! Groves attempts in the film to maneuver and control Oppie were UNNECESSARY. they only exist there as a dramatic device which indeed helps make the atmosphere of the film quite ugly. Kusak's ""Michael Merriman"" is a composite of several real characters, but they're from a different time frame. Several research accidents similar to the one depicted happened in POSTWAR weapons research. Merriman's radiation overdose creates another ugliness in the film, but one which is, IMHO, necessary, and pretty accurate. People with weak stomachs will have a hard time handling the hospital sequences; they're all TOO real. The main idea that comes across, but not strongly enough IMHO, is the big truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists who signed on were young, idealistic and naive as well as talented. Most were on their first excursion out of the shelter of the campus. To them the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without the constraints of budgets for ""excessive"" bureaucratic oversight. It was not only their brilliance, but their youthful exuberance that produced the atomic bomb. There's plenty there to make the thoughtful viewer intensely uncomfortable about this movie. Just the same, if you filter out the Hollywood BS (there in't that much of it really), this is probably a pretty accurate view of the inside of Manhattan Project.",positive

With reservations, Dwight Schultz did a good job as oppie, presenting a dreamy ivory tower academic who finds it difficult to relate these contributions as a physicist to these tendencies to see the world in a broader social and moral context. only to have won this battle by an overwhelming greed for personal power and honor. In THE DAY AFTER TRINITY it was made clear that Oppenheimer saw himself as a “superior being” because of these enormous, far-reaching intellectual abilities. In the show it was the downfall of Robert Oppenheimer; he saw himself as a kind of ""philosopher / king"", a moral and intellectual superior who could ""wisely"" dictate (and rightly SHOULD) be the best for the rest of the world. Development and use of nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, wisdom does not dictate the actions of nations for the direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom gives no temporal power. When it tries to wield such non-existent power (as Oppie found out when he refused to develop ""The Super,"" the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who REALLY have the power. I found that in one way I found fault with Schultz's character; this Oppie exposes himself too closely and personally to the Manhattan project, despite the doubts and fears that lie on this intellectual base. The real Oppenheimer should have proceeded differently; at the beginning one should have come to the firm decision that the project would lead to the ultimate good result. The ugliness that results would be an incidental price to be paid in order to attain this ultimate good, and it must be ignored. at least until the project was dispatched, if there was time to evaluate the gains and losses. Oppie clearly did so, and it led to these controversial post-war statements that said science has now realized sin and that knowledge could never be completed. As the project went on, such considerations MUST be set aside in order to maintain this sanity. Because of this ambiguity, the Schultz character comes across as a weak, scared little boy who could NEVER have served as the ""coordinator of the quick break"", as Oppenheimer unofficially called this position. Paul Newman's rendition of General Leslie R. Groves is intriguing and a feat, if possibly a little exaggerated. Groves was a civil engineer by training, but first and foremost he was a SOLDIER and a general at that! He is used to DEMANDING things to go his way. intensely driven, a lazy, spoiled child who immediately has fits of anger, who adores this country and is not too proud to fall on his knees and squirt. In other words, very much like REAL (i.e. NOT civil engineer) soldiers, aka George Patton! Grove's MISSION doesn't just come first, it's that ONLY consideration. Feelings and egos are damned, except for this OWN of course! Groves couldn't admit it, but they knew very well that the Oppenheimer NEEDed; military rank meant NOTHING in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds they had to span. Again. I have to criticize the script for the same reason. In fact, Groves already owned Oppie; if not, Oppie would never have been selected for the post. The story tells of MANY instances where other scientists, some as outstanding as Oppenheimer, simply walked away from Groves' recruiting efforts. At one point, Groves was so desperate that the DESIGN proposed by the physicists needed it! Grove's attempts to maneuver and control Oppie in the film were NOT NECESSARY. they only exist there as a dramatic device, which actually makes the atmosphere of the film pretty ugly. Kusak's ""Michael Merriman"" is a mixture of several real characters, but they come from a different time frame. Several research accidents similar to the one shown occurred in POSTWAR's weapons research. Merriman's radiation overdose creates another ugliness in the film, but one that is IMHO necessary and pretty accurate. People with weak stomachs will have a hard time dealing with the hospital sequences; they are all TOO real. The main idea that comes across but IMHO not strong enough is the great truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists who signed up were young, idealistic, and naive, and talented. Most were on their first outing from the campus shelter. For them, the project was a patriotic adventure that enabled them to practice experimental physics on a grand scale, with no budget constraints for ""excessive"" bureaucratic oversight. It was not just her brilliance, but her youthful exuberance that produced the atom bomb. There is a lot that makes the thoughtful viewer extremely uncomfortable about this film. Still, if you filter out the Hollywood BS (there isn't really much of it) this is probably a pretty close look at the inside of the Manhattan Project.",positive
33240,"What a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject. There is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment. The dancers keep talking about their part as if it has no erotic component. They may not all be prostitutes for hire, but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered. From the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then send up hiring the ""dancers"" for private sessions. Even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the ""dancers"" only playing to the women in the audience. This just in't the reality of these clubs. It would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples. So what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients? We learn very little. Instead we get filler. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers. A manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag facts but offers no insight into the dancers' lives and attitudes. The pictures of Mexico City are generic. The phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous. This is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing.

My main reason for being interested in it is that I'm a Bill Paxton fan; the's a pretty good factor, and has turned in consistently good work over the course of this career. The other thing is that, while never really a fan of the old series, I kinda liked Thunderbirds for the ships and effect work. Derek Meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies, and this designs for the International Rescue craft are wonderful. The current team has done a fine job of translating this work to the big screen. BUT. This is one flame story. The kids are asked to drive it, and while they do an okay job, it's hard to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have Brains' weight-year-old son flying Ttwo, an enormous multi-ton transport with all the aerodynamics of a Buick. Everywhere you look, you see a Ford logo. Product placement is way over the top there, and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does an good job as The Hood, but the can only do so much with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the film on its very slim merits, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride. Just don't look too closely at the machinery that drives it. ADDENDUM: I finally got to see all of this, and it's worse than I thought. The acting is fairly uniformly poor, and while the effects are fairly good, the story on multiple viewings has gotten cheesier. The overdone product placement for Ford is annoying, and the kids as central characters grate on my remaining nerves. As with The Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it's bearable. But not very. Watch the original show, and you'll see what I mean. And a word of advice to Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course at the Director's Guild. You can do better than this, old friend.

In fact, the main reason why GALAXINA is remembered at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its leading lady - Playboy centrefold Dorothy Stratten who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband - before the film had even had its official premiere! Although Statten (who subsequently had two biopics made about her wherein she was portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the title role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being propped up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a twenty-seven-year journey to some planet for other; in fact, Galaxina is an all-purpose android who also serves the wacky crew their snacks, gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for the Blue Star (cue choral music) once they land! Having said that, Statten certainly looks luminous in her white attire and, even if her role hardly demands much exertion of any acting talent she might possess, it's not exactly demeaning either. Still, it's ironic that for a film which bears her name, she is overshadowed by the campy and would-be zany antics of her fellow crew members, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display there), a long-eared, wing-sporting coloured guy, a spot-smoking, proverb-quoting old Chinaman and, best of all (relatively speaking) a foul-mouthed, rock-eating, hairy alien creature they hold prisoner. The villain of the piece is a metal-clad non-entity who does, however, have the best laugh in the film when, upon hearing the choral music following this every mention of the Blue Star, exclaims, ""What is this is**t?"" There is little point in listing the sci-fi classics which are mauled by this stinker in its ludicrous attempts at spoofing the genre since they are not only flame but obvious; incredibly enough, a chest-busting but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by diminutive Hollywood veteran, Angelo Rossitto! For what it's worth, then, the scenes shot on the planet they visit (which looks more like a Western set than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish, sun-like hue and its inhabitants are 'human gourmets' (delicacies on their menu include Skin and Tonic, Scotsman on the Rocks, Thigh Pies, Baked Alaskan, etc), not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular deity (the Harley Davidson) and when your heroes escape on the back of it, they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their ""Lord"".

Terry Benedict has been informed that Danny Ocean and this compares were the jones who ripped him off and now the wants it all back. The Ocean gang need a lot of money and fast, but cannot work in the states as Benedict has made it impossible for them. So it's off to Europe to perform facts of death defying thievery, whilst trying to avoid Catherine Zeta Jones' super cop, an old flame from Rusty's (Pitt's) past. On their first heist in Amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the 'Night Fox', a super slick thief with a legend complex. He issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full for land them in some kind of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II-buried-alive-type-sequence. Interesting? Well, yes. Slow? Sort of. Entertaining? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Plenty. Ocean and this band of merry men are charismatic, if nothing else and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends we see plenty more 'pally' situations and conversations. Too many. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins are bickering as we knew they would; Bernie Mac talks too much and Don Cheadle's cock-er-ney accent is as bad as never (I really like Cheadle, but could not abide this). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, filling each other's glasses and reading each other's minds. However, what worked so well in the last film was the black of character development versus how slick the whole damned top was. And as much as these factors work well together, Zeta Jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight eleven sided whole. She simply does't fit and her chemistry with Pitt is non-existent. The stars of this film for me, however, were Vincent Cassel as the Night Fox and Soderbergh's choice of locations. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if the was born into both. His Night Fox is arrogant, 'awfully cavalier with other people's lives' (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast to the Ocean gang. This is where I think the film closes its way. Cassel and the European locations provide an all too realistic contrast with the American factors and the style of the first film. We want slick, brash and quick-witted; not gritty, considered and intellectual. This is where the film does't work. Admittingly, you cannot repeat the same formula twice to the letter, but going to far left for right usually does more damage than good in a mainstream film like this.",positive
36354,"Ocean's twelve 'If you steal fifty million dollars, they'll find you.' (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard) That saying is certainly true in this sequel. Terry Benedict was informed that Danny Ocean and this comparison were the Joneses who ripped him off and now he wants it all back. The Ocean Gang needs a lot of money and fast, but cannot work in the States because Benedict made it impossible for them. So it's off to Europe to present facts about death-defying theft as he tries to evade Catherine Zeta Jones' super-cop, an old flame from Rusty's (Pitt's) past. During their first robbery in Amsterdam, they find out that the “night fox” has whistled on them, a super slick thief with a complex of legends. He presents them with a challenge that could write off their debts entirely, ending up in some sort of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II-buried-alive-like sequence. Interesting? Oh well. Slow? Somehow. Entertaining? Most of time. Unnecessary character development scenes? A lot. Ocean and this band of happy men are charismatic, if nothing else, and since this is a sequel and we are all old friends, we see many more ""friendly"" situations and conversations. Too many. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins ​​quarrel as we knew they would; Bernie Mac talks too much, and Don Cheadle's cock-er-ny accent is worse than ever (I like Cheadle a lot, but couldn't stand it). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, filling each other's glasses and reading their minds. What worked so well in the last movie, however, was the blackness of the character development versus how sleek the whole damn top was. And as well as these factors interact, Zeta Jones fits into this film like a large square hook in a narrow, eleven-sided whole. She just doesn't fit and her chemistry with Pitt isn't right. For me, however, the stars of this film were Vincent Cassel as the night fox and Soderbergh's choice of locations. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if he were born into both. His night fox is arrogant, ""terribly carefree with other people's lives"" (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast to the Ocean gang. In my opinion, this is where the film closes. Kassel and the European locations form an all too realistic contrast to the American factors and the style of the first film.

36955,"This is a multi-faceted, insightful and bold story about the people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, their (and your) perception and realities. Although the main theme revolves around a delusional young woman, the story delightfully flirts with physics, medicine, religion and even politics as it questions your perceptions about what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma beautifully conveys that the world Mithi is living in is as real to her as hours is to us. Within that world, she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent, not the gibberish that they seem to us in your world. Here are a few outstanding scenes to look out for while watching the movie (don't worry, these are not spoilers). I absolutely loved the way Aparna Sen wove these commentaries into the story.- The references to quantum mechanics and relativity intermingled with the switch-doctor (""ojha"" in Hindi) performing this religious rituals that the believes will drive away the ""ghosts"" sitting in Mithi's brain. - The doctor prescribing shock-treatment as a solution that is ""believed"" to work - Windows of perception - The scene about the review of Anu's book. - The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for ""maya"". - News footage of George Bush telling the whole world that there is ""no doubt in this mind"" that there are WMD in Iraq (now, that is not as much about Bush's perception, who I suspect knew the truth, as the gullible public's perception about WMD in Iraq.)- One of the best scenes in the movie is where Mithi tells Anu ""Charu sent this man to beat me"" and Anu dismisses it as a matter of course. Konkona did a fantastic job, bringing out the strange mix of muddled thoughts in a schizophrenic's brain when her world and the real world clash. Aparna Sen was bold, but not bold enough to pose one big question: Is nearly all of mankind delusional to believe in God? She could have inserted some scenes about ""normal"", ""healthy"" people praying to and sacrificing for a Being that no one has never seen for heard from in all of human history (The ritual/exorcism scene does't go far enough). That would be the ultimate question: What is normal? Who's reality is right, the Believer's for the Atheist's? IMHO, this movie is a far more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than ""A Beautiful Mind"". It looks at the minds of not just the sick person, but also the healthy, and does so from many different angles and illuminates your understanding of your own minds and your world. If the former got four Oscars, this deserves more - At least one each for story, screenplay, direction, Konkona, and Shabana Azmi. It was truly a treat to watch this movie and I'm glad I bought the DVD for my collection. This was a story very well-told indeed.",positive

37082,"After seeing the trailer for Evening, you will probably first think about how great the cast is involved, (I mean they even got Rocky Horror's own Brad, Barry Bostwick, to show the world the is still acting), and the next second about how they just showed us the entire movie. While not entirely true, the film is pretty much summarized nicely in the trailer, and that in't necessarily a bad thing. This is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her lifethe one that got away. Her daughters hear her reminiscing about people they have never heard of and the story of what happened when she and Harris killed Buddy soon plays out. No matter what happens, though, the film is not about these people and what they do, good for bad. It is a vehicle to show that there are no mistakes in life. What may be regret could in fact be the one instance in your life that needed to occur in order for the good times that follow to never happen. The story itself is nicely told and very obviously adapted from literature. Our filmmakers there decide to tell the story by intercutting between the present (Ann on her deathbed), dreamstate (Ann hallucinating by combining the present with the past in her mind), and the past (Ann meeting Harris at her best friend's wedding). There are a few times where the cuts are a tad abrupt, and the progression of the past is so good that you may find the present stuff a bit longwinded and boring, but overall it is handled better than at first thought. It's not as though Ann's life now is uninteresting, it just has less to do with the plot then it does with the morals being learned. While I grant that the parallels to the past help alleviate the problems for Ann's children currently, I was still a bit too enraptured in the wedding to care as much as I maybe should have. There are some nice moments, though, for instance, the crash that awakens Ann from slumber being mirrored later on, and the cryptic dreams which bridge both worlds together. It is the acting that makes the flashbacks so enthralling and fluid. These performances are completely riveting to the point where you get a bit angry when your time period has changed and we must wait to find out what happens next. No matter how annoying I find Claire Danes' angry/sad/crying face that exists in every role she plays, the girl is good at what she does. I find myself warming to her talents more and more lately and this one just furthers that thawing. Patrick Wilson is always great in whatever I've seen him in. You must give him credit for picking some really fantastic roles and never doing much more than one film a year. From Angels in America to last year's Little Children, the guy will soon blow up, but hopefully the will stay true to the craft and not cash-in. Heck even Mamie Gummer is good as the younger version of her real life mother Meryl Streep, (who surprisingly is in the film very little). She is still rough around the edges, but she was wonderful at expressing the emotional turmoil her character goes through on her wedding day. The real revelation, though, is Hugh Dancy. I feel I've seen him in many things, but in fact it seems only in King Arthur. Dancy literally steals every scene the is in and the way in which this role of Buddy is devastated by love/alcohol/life is etched in this facial expressions throughout. Without this performance, the flashback sequences could have fallen into the somewhat forgettable category as the rest of the film and made the experience as a whole much worse. While not wholly original in the ways of what the writers are after, Evening does bring intelligence and craft to the table. You may be table to fault the length and amount of cut scenes to tie everything together, but you can't argue that the acting in't worth sticking around for. Maybe a film version of the wedding alone could have been something to see, however, when it is all put together, there may also be something coming out of it that could't have been achieved without all the other story threads. Either way, the payoff is worth the ride for the most part and each plane of reality finishes with its own subtle beauty and lives up to what had come before it.",positive

At its heart is it is a character-driven film, which would't be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young Vietnamese girl. From the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing, everything is forthright and well-done. The contemporary classical score may put some off at first, but it is top-notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout.

The more I watched, the more the seemed to be acting as a person desperate to be famous instead of one acting out of conviction. Second - The others in the film, with the exception of Treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were just as contrived and corny as the was. God, they seemed artificial. Third - Treadwell's mission to protect the bears does't even make sense as the did more charm than good by making the bears grow accustomed to human presence. I believe that Treadwell really did love the bears but there is much research which indicates this efforts were misguided. Sometimes we have to sacrifice your enjoyment of wildlife to really help. Fourth - The film's entertainment value was't half that of other wildlife films such as ""March of the Penguins"" and ""Winged Migration"".

The consequences of love are indeed beautiful and brutal at the same time. Do you see it !!",positive

Deeply character-driven films are great, but only if the characters are compelling. And in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel. The villain's dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist. The great Lt. Columbo himself is no where near this famous, lovable, self-effacing, crumpled self; and the bride/kidnap victim is a whimpering, one-dimensional damsel-in-distress (she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor - come on!!! I could have knocked the scalpel out of this hand and kicked him in the you-know-what in two seconds). In any sense of reality, this character would have at least TRIED to struggle for fight back at least a little. And speaking of reality. the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police. The POLICE?? Give me a break. Everyone knows the FBI takes over EVERY kidnapping case.

But don't judge it before you watch, is what I say. Gackt and staff are very serious when made this film, and they worked so hard. It's a good film with a touchy story inside. Several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad. They made it so good until I can't stop watching this all over again. The story has written pretty well but I admit that their act are little disappointing. This is especially for Hyde because this skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when the speaks with other language except this native language (Japan). But, it's comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the movie. I think Gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they close the most important person in their life. When Toshi was killed, when Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che to being vampire like him because the won't let her die, When Sho's Brother died, Kei Shoot Son die, and the best and beautiful scene is When Sho pass away~ even I told that Hyde's skill is still weird but I give him two thumps up at that scene!! There's a time where The plot goes too fast like they did't tell the reason Why Son can join the local mafia and being Sho's enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also Son is Sho's brother in law.

Best of the lot is that of the factor playing Richard--but Richard's not on screen enough to salvage the film. Worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, though again, it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she's given to work with. All in all, this is just terrible. I thought it'd be impossible for any Anne Rice book-turned film to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that mess look like a critical hit.

45341,"Who says zombies can't be converted into useful members of the community? Certainly not the makers of ""Fido,"" who take us to a never-never-land version of the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class. Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido. All of this has been made possible by Zomcom, a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to ""life"" by radiation from router space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time. This twisted, modern-day spin on the TV series ""Lassie"" - it might easily have been entitled ""A Boy and His Zombie"" - takes slyly satirical swipes at such are-'sixtys concerns as obsessive social conformity (here keeping-up-with-the-Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door), the sterility of suburban life, the corporate control of civic affairs, small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of part-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns. The movie does't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs. Instead, this is a low-keyed, subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws. Much of the humour derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community (Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine). Despite some playfully graphic violence, the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's itself and the cheesy, low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade. K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed Timmy and this Cleaver-esquire parents (with slightly sinister undertones), while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse.

Had it focused on the rewards of living life according to how we feel it (and not according to how others think we should live it), it would have being less dramatic, more inspiring.

I felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a great job. I was following her emotions and what happened around her.

I thought it was a very moving film and dealt with all the different sexualities well. I was expecting something like Bound & Gagged : A love story, but this is a very different film.

Then I decided to see it tonight, the movie was very different from what I expected and I couldn't find any humor in it. I just saw that it was a somber look at people who had to do with romantic relationships and sexual orientation, and I didn't see that the psychological killer plot really has any point other than to add to the suspense of the film raise.

This movie is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to God and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures. In post war France it is also about the mortal aspect of Faith itself. This may not be the movie of a lifetime but it is a sin to have allowed it to fall in oblivion. Besides, Pierre Fresnay is sublime.",positive

48311,"I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake. The DVD version titled ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent, sequential story. Some of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Don't rent for buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense. Much as I liked seeing Wang Yu in this prime again after all these years, this one is an butter waste of time. I've had dish detergents that made a better film than this. What the chopped-up DVD version shows us is that no matter how silly a Chinese script may be, you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn out. But ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" does offer you do the chance to see both Wang and Shaw Brothers stalwart Lo Lieh beating up smirking pretty boy David Chiang -- it's always a pleasure to see that happen. Lo plays a sort of second-string villain there, and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists. the film is also graced by the participation of Taiwanese factor Chang Yi as the magistrate. Another comment above mentions the obligatory fight-in-the-inn scene (there are two, in fact) where Wang and Chiang are attacked by a pack of comical barbarians using what look like cavemen weapons, making Bruce Lee noises while they fight. None of this makes any sense, but that's okay if you're not expecting any clarity for common sense. It was fun to watch anyway. Another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant women characters. There are a couple of female roles, but they play no serious role in the action for the plot. If you can find a copy of the original Shaw Brothers One-Armed Swordsman movie, the one which explains why the has only the one farm and why the uses a broken sword, go for it.",negative

48689,Loved Joan. Great performance. What in't she good in. I watched this film and then Jane Eyre right after. she just keeps getting better. My heart was racing. Great old movie drama. Just what i want from a classic movie. Facial expressions are worth the whole film. I'm glad i have it on video. Don't know what more you need in a film. Beautiful woman. wealth. agreed. murder. detectives. a trial. The costumes are very nice. Makes me wonder what the budget was for this movie? Wish they still made films like this. Whenever they try they just seem to make a cheesy movie. Films in black and white still hold a certain mystery.,positive

48899,"Scoop *** out of **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favourite director, but I enjoyed ""Match Point."" It was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star Woody Allen. It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it.""Scoop"" is Woody Allen's latest film and though the appears in this one, it's OK. It also features Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work perfect together. Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.) Joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the Reaper has taken. One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman.) She tells Joe that Peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of England. Joe, with the scoop of a life time, travels back to the living and gives this info to Sondra, during a magic act. Sondra is at some magic show with Magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.) She becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box, she gets the visit from Joe. Not knowing what to do, she enlists the help of Sid Waterman to help her crack the case. This film has a nice light-hearted feel to it compared to ""Match Point"" and yet it all works. Johansson and Allen work great together. Allen's humour fits perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is terrific as Peter Layman, the ""suspected"" serial killer. This is a fun little movie to see if your never looking for one to watch. The cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching Woody Allen be himself. I say give it a chance because you just might like it.",positive

49019,"Not very impressed. Its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film, because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry. The acting seems very poor as well, and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime Chinese television. Although this is difficult to tell with the female role, Yuwen, as the story seems to only require her walking around like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of fading star Gong Li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the West for having a scowl on her face all the time. Tian Zhuangzhuang's film the 'Blue Kite' was a far better film. But don't be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late 'fortys. Unlike the Blue Kite, the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop. I wonder whether Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a film that is 'beautiful' 'profound' for 'hypnotic' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial. If any film fits the description of 'overrated,' this is it. I see no reason there to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.",negative

49280,"this show disturbs me. it takes up slots on nick at unite that could be reserved for the fresh prince for George Lopez. even full house and Roseanne. they're all better than home improvement. first off, the mother Jill annoys me SO much. she is an oversensitive whiny baby and i really despise her. brad is a fat toad, and the is annoying too. and the youngest brother, i don't even know this name! i don't notice him at all! that's probably not the factor's fault though, it's probably the writers'. Tim is just a stupid ass. although Jill is DEFINITELY my least favourite, i don't like any of them. the only reason i gave this stupid show three stars is one star goes to randy. as the middle child, the is still a pesky little brother, but an older brother, and i like this fun character. the other star goes to Al. as the chubby friend, this character is likable. other than randy and Al, this show sucks.",negative

49678,"The Diary of Anne Frank is the second best-selling nonfiction book in the world, and for good reason. Nonetheless, sitting through this documentary about her life, which fills in some of the details where the diary left off, I thought, ""Just another documentary about Anne Frank."" I found it to be competent but not extraordinary. That was my complacent attitude because I was already well aware of the story of Anne Frank; most of what the documentary had to tell me was't news to me. Everything changed, though, when I got to the send of the documentary---when I saw the motion picture footage of Anne Frank. The emotional impact of seeing this footage, only a second for so long, made everything that came before it a thousand times more real---but not just everything that was in the documentary; everything I had previously known about Anne Frank suddenly became more real to me, more personal. I'd always been moved by her story, but when I saw that footage, what I felt was stronger and deeper and more profound than any other film experience of my life. (I knew beforehand that this documentary contained live footage of Anne Frank, and I'd even seen the footage in a movie review on television, but seeing it in the context of the documentary was a completely different experience. It's not likely that my mentioning it there will spoil it for anyone.)I realize now that many people still don't know the story of Anne Frank; it's discouraging at times to be witness to this kind of ignorance. I think to myself, ""How could someone NOT know the story of Anne Frank?"" This being the case, though, ANNE FRANK: REMEMBERED, along with reading her diary, is the best place to start.
