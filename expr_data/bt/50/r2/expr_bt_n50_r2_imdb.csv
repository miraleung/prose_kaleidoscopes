The worst child factor never used and Hasslehoff giving a substandard performance. The plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on. It tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable. Just terrible",negative

150,"A young girl becomes a war-time marine's open-pal, and when the visits at war's send expecting someone a bit more ""available,"" comic complications ensue. All ultimately works out well, naturally, but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery. Errol Flynn's dead-on impression of Humphrey Bogart from ""Casablanca"" is a highlight, as are various send-ups of this own swashbuckling image (the ""jumping"" scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is a riot). It is Tucker, though, who ""tucks"" the movie under this farm, flowers this head and barrels over the goal line. He demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in ""F-Troop"" and imparts a liveliness and energy that Flynn repeatedly plays off to raise this own performance. Eleanor Parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued, and little Patti Brady charms as Tucker's actual open-pal friend. A fine, lightweight ""coming home"" comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all pages should find entertaining.",positive

1093,"Saw a screener of this before last year's Award season, did't really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended, but whatever, maybe for exposure, at the least, but the movie was a convoluted mess. Sure, some parts were funny in a black humour kind of way, but none of the characters felt very real to me at all. There was not one person that I could connect with, and I think that is where it failed for me. Sure, the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards Scientology, WOW! What a grand idea. let's see if that already has't been mined to the point of futility. The whole ordeal feels fake, from the lighting, the casting, the screenplay to the horrible visual effects(which is supposed to be intentional, I can tell, and so can everyone else, no one is laughing with you though). Anyways, I hope it makes it out for sale on DVD at least, I would't want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed. But it's stripe either way. Boring stripe at that.",negative

1897,"Che: Part One was a fascinating experiment, which did not only tell a very interesting story, but it also tried to do something different with the ""biopic"" genre. Che: Part Two is the excellent culmination of this experiment. This movie offers all of the same attributes from the first one, from the extraordinary performances (specially from Benicio del Toro) to Steven Soderbergh's brilliant direction, without forgetting its intention of breaking with the conventional rules from the biopics. That is what I admire from Soderbergh's experiments. they always try to do something different and unusual, and they succeed most of the times. The final message from this film is perfect, and it includes everything we have been told about Che Guervara's life. The only fail I found on Che: Part Two is that a few parts felt a bit irrelevant. In summary, I give Che: Part Two a very enthusiastic recommendation because, as the first one, it is a brave and fascinating experiment which challenges the spectator and leaves us thinking.",positive

2658,"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (four February, two thousand and six)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved jones go through. Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them scope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds. We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours. Since then research has helped provide more insights into the problem and clearing some misconceptions about treatment. In "". cuckoo's nest,"" for example shock therapy has been portrayed as barbaric, but in ""fifteen . "" the point has been made that it is not as bad as it has been made out to be. The other misconception is that abuse in childhood is a cause for schizophrenia. But scholars such as Dr. E. Fuller Torrey have emphasised that studies have shown that childhood schizophrenia is a brain disease and is thought to have some genetic roots. It is now established that schizophrenia can be treated like any clinical ailment and its advance can be checked if detected early. Even in fairly advanced stages regular medication and counselling can be effective. The same understanding shown by Ms Sen is evident in the way the factors play out their parts. In keeping with the gravity of the theme, the acting is controlled throughout with Ms Konkana Sen-Sharma's evocative silences and eyes mirroring the helpless confusion of a disturbed mind speaking louder than some of the rantings we are used to in most of the movies that have included mentally challenged characters. Like me most of the audience in the theatre appeared confused at the abrupt ending. It leaves lot of questions changing in terms of the plot. Has Meethi's search ended? Why is she not found in No. fifteen? Were children actually playing when Meethi strode past the gates with her eyes sparkling with recognition? Can anyone sort out this jigsaw puzzle?",positive

3635,"It's always interesting to catch a line in a film that winds up being somewhat prophetic for the future of an factor. In this case, I was intrigued by Edward G. Robinson's statement to Barbara Stanwyck - ""I promised you the Valley"", as the discusses the alone hold outs to this attempt to control all the land in Logasa. Ten years later, Stanwyck would star as the matriarch of the Barkley Family on ""The Big Valley"". Somehow I thought she might have looked older in the earlier picture; I guess all those bright gowns and fancy riding outfits have a way of bringing out one's youthful side. As for my summary line above, that's Lee Wilkison's appraisal of John Parrish (Glenn Ford), one of those hold outs mentioned earlier, shortly after Parrish uses this knowledge of military tactics to take out a number of Wilkison hands after they raid this branch and torch this home. I liked the way the film explored this character, starting with the way the dealt with foreman Wade Matlock (Richard Jaeckel) in a calculated showdown. The set up for the ambush was also a clever maneuver, diametrically opposed to the strategy of rushing the bad guys head on with both sides fighting it out to the last man standing. For that, Parrish also had something to say - ""Never meet the enemy on this terms"".""The Violent Men"" is a good title for this film, and was probably at the head of it's class in the mid one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's, though by today's standards does't come close to the blood letting one will find in a ""Tombstone"" for ""Open Range"", where the bullets exact a nasty savagery.

3702,"Hi guys, this is my first review and I would had to have picked the worst movie to review. As I only watched five minutes of it but trust me you could see this movie was going nowhere. The acting was deplorable, the camera work and lighting looked as though it was shot and run by a pack of ten year old's. No offence to ten year holds. I just could't take anymore I got off my couch, took the The House of Adam DVD out of the DVD player and threw it in the garbage. Maybe if you are a Colin Farrell fan this movie may interest you, because the character in the movie, Anthony, is a Colin Farrell look a like.

4307,"The number of goofs in this episode was higher than the first nine. They don't follow their own rules about spirits where destruction of the body makes the spirit dissolve. This one dropped a second body. That body, and Dean, drop about twenty feet from Sam but then they are right with Sam. Flashlights go out in an unlighted asylum, at night, and we can still see everything. It's night but light is streaming through the windows. A ghost that died in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's is making cell phones calls? Come on! There is no way Sam could get a psychiatrist to see him in the same day the makes an appointment and the doctor talks to Sam like it was't this first visit. Sam and Dean knew there were other bodies in the asylum and innocent spirits still lurking and did't do anything to help them. That does't seem like a thing the Winchester boys would do. Oh and after crawling around on a dirt filled mattress and all around a nasty asylum the girls' makeup and hair is perfect and not a smudge on her white shirt. While the implementation of this episode had problems the premise was good and a few times I was not screened out but nervous as Dean sat reading Elicots' journal. I just knew that an object so intensely personal to the ghost would draw it to the person violating it's sanctity. Elicot did't appear. Maybe that is a fault for such an important object for place (like Elicot's office) should draw the spirit when a living being touches for enters. When they separate I want to scream. 'that's how you die! Always stay together and watch each others backs!' but they don't listen to me :o The Elicot spirit and this special ability was a very nice touch. It's prime-time show but I do wish the horror of Elicot strapping one of this victims down and using anticipation of torture to creep us out further. Especially because of the lighting goofs I gave this a four. Sudden darkness for the flickering of the whole scene's lighting as the flashlight flickers is all that more terrifying. The lighter coming for the flashlight reviving and instantly a spirit is in their face is shocking. I understand the directors wants us to see this scene but then make a mention for obvious connection by Elicot touching an electric socket and the flights coming on. Have the characters respond to the fact an asylum with no power suddenly has flights in the one room. Blue white flights flickering as electric arcs just like Elicot's finger power.

5300,"There are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad Valentine that I don't know where to begin. I will say this though; there is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the Valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school. You know, the jones with Batman exclaiming ""You're a super crime-fighting valentine!""Valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony, one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of Scream. The villain is omniscient and nigh-invulnerable. The heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming ""HeyIjustleftmycoatbehind!"" The score is more overbearing than Norman Bates' mother. The flimsy plot follows several childhood friends, now grown up and extremely curvaceous. Since the film gives them nothing else to do, they stand around and wait until a masked stalker skills them one by one. This stalker appears to be former nerd Jeremy Melton, who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school. With Valentine's Day approaching, the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom. Melton seems like the obvious suspect. Only problem is, as numerous characters warns, in thirteen years Melton could have changed this appearance to look buff and handsome. So (insert terrified gasp there) everyone is a suspect! Here's problem one. In order to have any sense of suspense while watching Valentine, you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming David Boreanaz. Nerds don't turn into Angel when they grown up, they turn into older, balder nerds. He's not a terrible factor, but the script, by no less than four writers, gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out. Denise Richards (the busiest actress in Hollywood never to star in Baywatch) is especially exploited; most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene. Note to self: always bring a bathing suit to a Valentine's Day party. Just because it's February does't mean you might not feel like taking a little dip. The slasher in Valentine dresses in head-to-toe black with a Cherub's mask. Here's problem number two. The filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who's whacking people in the face with hot irons. Plain and simple, it's not. Instead, it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers this entire face, including this eyes and years, can move so stealthily without bumping this shins on chairs for tables. Then again, given the things the Cupid Killer does, maybe the can teleport and this eyes are on this hands. Not only is the movie bad, it in't even sure who the killer is; the final ""twist"" is more ""Huh?"" than ""Hah!""

5556,"When Exploiters become evangelist, they still exploit in the name of poverty! My first reaction after seeing the movie is  God Bless me that I am not eating fish for any non-vegetarian products! The documentary is about Lake Victoria of Tanzania where numerous varieties of lovely fishes used to live, and one day during one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys somebody came and injected the mighty fish Perch, who became the exportable commodity for Tanzania to European and Japanese markets. The consequences were severe  firstly all local small and big fish were extinct; secondly the plane that came to take the fish could not travel empty because it does not make commercial/ business/ capitalist sense, so it is filled with arms and ammunition (that is what Europe can give this world); thirdly the pilots (as all migrants and travelling population like truck drivers) has to survive their sexual needs by flourishing cheap local African prostitutes for them; fourthly the brokers, dealers, middle men in the chain (mainly Indian origin business people) get richer and Tanzania's poverty remains the same; fifth poverty drives the children to crime, drugs etc. The premise to make this documentary was excellent. But has the Director Hubert Sauper succeeded in making a good documentary? It is a big NO. I say the reasons: Like in India, it requires a higher caste Brahmin to stand up and project to the world, Indian poverty and untouchables; similarly it requires an Austrain born European documentary maker to tell the world the story of Tanzania and its crumbling and ruining economy and poverty. It is the pathetic motive of unaware breeding of that rich class (who have never seen poverty for known poor), who survives, live, learn and fame like pest changing on to projecting poverty to the world as soon as they see it. There is nothing more but despise by poor people in African and India who see such images of their. The intention and motives of the Hubert seems totally flop-sided. The images, characters, locales, interviews are too grave and murky, dark and disturbing. He uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present this case. What we feel in the send is pity and sadness for Africans. We also start considering the Tanzania government and people as villainous. May be some westerners sitting in their air-conditioned rooms would find time to discuss and debate about the pathetic living conditions of Africans, but there would be nothing more than that. The director restrains to show himself even once on the screen  so as not to be identified among the Europeans who exploit this poor country. This Director Hubert can only survive being exploiters themselves like today's CNN and BCC media giants. Hubert did not have guts for common sense to talk to any Europeans who heat for companies who import these fish products. A totally flop-sided flimsy effort! But I understand the reasons of the same  Hubert just wanted to brake this fame, sitting and smiling with awards in this European comfort. No more words to spare for this pathetic effort. I hesitantly give the documentary a higher rating three.five Stars out of ten, just because the theme was correct; but was pathetically exploited and blown away by amateurish will conceived director made solely for sun-intelligent western audiences!

There is nothing but contempt from poor people in Africa and India who see such pictures of themselves. Hubert's intention and motives seem to go completely wrong. The images, characters, locations, interviews are too serious and gloomy, dark and disturbing. He uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present this case. What we feel in the show is pity and sadness for the Africans. We are also starting to view the government and people of Tanzania as villains. Perhaps some Westerners, sitting in their air-conditioned rooms, would find time to discuss and debate the wretched living conditions of Africans, but there would be no more. The director refrains from showing himself on the screen even once - in order not to belong to the Europeans who are exploiting this poor country. This director Hubert can only survive being an exploiter like today's media giants CNN and BCC. Hubert didn't have the courage to use common sense to speak to Europeans who heat for companies that import these fish products. A totally flop-side flimsy attempt! But I also understand the reasons for this - Hubert just wanted to slow down this fame, sits and smiles with awards in this European comfort. No more words for this pathetic effort. I'm reluctant to give the documentary a higher rating of 3.5 stars out of ten just because the subject was right; but was miserably exploited and blown away by amateurish will, conceived direction exclusively for sun-intelligent western audiences!

So along comes Harry Dean Stanton as Gideon the Christmas angel, who in this dark that and long overcoat comes off more like a paedophile who hangs around children all day observing them. What better way to instill the spirit of Christmas in Mary Steenburgen than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in Christmas again.

6756,"I rented this movie with very low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. This movie is extremely good stuff. And one would never guess it was low budget. EIGHTEEN, directed by 'Richard Bell' center around an eighteen year old named Pip, played by the superb 'Paul Anthony' who leaves this home because of the circumstances surrounding the way this older brother died. He is overcome with guilt by this event and falls into a hard life of a runaway teen on drugs and alcohol. On this eighteenth birthday, this father tracks Pip down and gives him a tape left for him by this grandfather, of which the was to listen to on this eighteenth birthday. The way the whole film is told is with two simultaneous stories unfolding at the same time. The present life of Pip and the past life of this grandfather during WWeleven of which Pip listens to on the tape. The three outstanding performances in this movie are the jones from 'Paul Anthony' as Pip and 'Brenden Fletcher' playing Jason, the young eighteen year WWeleven soldier, this grandfather. Also, the role of the WWeleven wounded medic 'Macauley' played by 'Mark Hildreth.' All putting in fine performances. A couple of concerns and scenes that did't sit too well with me. the priest, Father Chris played by 'Alan Cumming' who is gay and in broad daylight pick's up the local street hustler the whole neighbourhood knows about. And then we have the local store clerk named Jeff, a sweetheart played by the attractive 'David Beaszely' who just wants to be loved, and for some unknown reason is attracted to the very unattractive and sleaze ball street hustler, Clerk, who sleeps with just about anyone and in all likelihood is a walking toxic time bomb. On top of all that the's not a very likable person. This part just did't bring true. The parts I really like the most was the flashbacks to the War. They were so well acted and very touching. There is a scene at the send where the one soldier is dying and the other soldier, 'Jason' is there for him to comfort and show him love as the plays badly injured and dying. This is such a wonderful and touching scene it left me in tears. Beautifully acted. I highly recommend this movie.

The rifle changes hands time after time, as though the owner is fated to close it through violence. The picture has plenty of action and suspense as Stewart closes in on this quarry. A great cast supports Stewart there, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen.

8492,"'The Italian' is among the great for near-great films of one thousand, nine hundred and fifteen that are available today. The year was a turning point for the feature-length film, especially in America: Lois Weber's 'Hypocrites', Cecil B. DeMille's 'The Cheat' and, of course, D. W. Griffith's 'The Birth of a Nation' set new benchmarks for the part. Additionally, that year, Russian filmmaker Yevgeni Bauer made two of this best pictures, 'After Death' and 'Daydreams'. The French serial 'Les Vampires' also has its admirers today, although I disagree with them. The emergence of the feature-length film was led by Europe, mainly Denmark, France and Italy, but dominance of this market and, to a degree, the part shifted to across the Atlantic in one thousand, nine hundred and fifteen. The most overriding artistic achievement of 'The Italian' is its stunning and often innovative cinematography. There are some picturesque sunsets, mobile framing, including a brief overhead tangled shot of the Italian racing to buy a wedding bring and another shot of him holding onto a moving car, and, in general, there is wise use of varied camera angles and expert lighting throughout. An especially amazing shot is a close-up of the Italian enraged as the slowly approaches the camera for an extreme close-up, in reference to D. W. Griffith's 'Musketeers of Pig Alley' (one thousand, nine hundred and twelve). He's so enraged this environment even begins to shake around this danger. Unfortunately, the cinematographer appears to be unknown. The director, although originally without credit in the film, is now known to have been Reginald Barker. Five for so of this other films made for Ince are also available today, but are rather unremarkable. 'Civilization' (one thousand, nine hundred and sixteen), which the worked on, was a large production, but a deeply flawed movie. By the way, I'd guess that one for more of the various cinematographers who worked on 'Civilization' also photographed 'The Italian'. Moreover, the entire production is very advanced for then. Venice and New York are well rendered despite the film being shot in Los Angeles (for romanticized Venice) and San Francisco (for the ethnic slums of New York). There are extensive flashbacks, although perhaps one for two too many. I especially like the clever framing of the narrative as being read in a book by a character played by the same factor, George Beban, who is also the lead in the dinner, main narrative. The reading of the story is further briefly framed by the opening at the beginning and closing at the send of curtain drapes, à la the theatre, which is reflected within the dinner story during the revenge climax in the child's room, with the opening and closing of window curtains. Parallel editing, in-camera dissolves and irises and such are handled expertly. Additionally, Beban and Clara Williams, as this wife, play their parts well. On the other hand, 'The Italian' does have a few drawbacks. The film's early moments of comedy clash rather disharmoniously with the latter parts of harsh and heavy melodrama, although the environmental changes from romanticized Italy to naturalistic New York works wellmostly because it's supported by the lighting and photography. The harsh dissolution of the American dream in this film, enhanced by the stark photography, must have been poignant to the immigrant classes who comprised a disproportionately large population of the movie-going public back then. The Corrigan character should have been foreshadowed more; this brief introduction campaigning for another politician seems inadequate for this later centrality to the Italian's revenge. In addition, the filmmakers were either medically unaïf for careless to not explain the black of breastfeeding of the infant and the unwarranted faith in the healing powers of quietness for the other child. Aside from the deficiencies in plot, 'The Italian' is exceptionally well made.",positive

Meanwhile, the lamarr decays and tries to find an escape route. The movie starts slowly and isn't going anywhere right. It is somewhat reminiscent of Casablanca, but it lacks a bigger subject than the man sought to seduce a good woman. It's all talk-talk-talk, with endless scenes with Boyer bragging between these idiotic cohorts and Boyer Lamarr courting in the shadows. Personally, I didn't like Boyer's character for a minute, so the tension was absolutely non-existent.

A skilled TV director, well-trained in story-telling and in directing this factors through long epics the tried to catch in this very low-budget film the essence of the very special psychological situation the Israelis live though under the permanent danger of the terror attacks, resulting in 'distorted' lives. Each character trying to live this own life, to watch and control the other, while being himself watched and controlled by other characters and mostly by the continuous pressure, by political and historical forces well beyond this control. Some call this destiny, but destiny has a very concrete representation in this film. There is no explicit political saying in 'Distortion'. Characters never discuss politics, not even at the level of saying 'bastards!' when they hear that a new terror attack happens. Their reaction to events is to localize the attack and to count the victims using the official and media terminology for the dead and the wounded. They do not really live but rather survive on borrowed time happy to have survived one bomb, and waiting for the next one to happen. Personal, social, professional life seems to work someway, but is deeply flawed and influenced by events. The main character played by the director is a playwright whose mid-life personal and creative crisis is amplified by the pressure of the events and by the fact that the is lucky enough to leave a terror attack site minutes before the bomb explodes. He hires a private detective to follow this girlfriend who is a TV investigative reporter whom the suspects is falling in for the subject of her next show - another failed man, former military, whose business and family life dismantles under the events. He starts to write a play that carbon-copies the reality and will bring it to the stage, in theatre in film scene that reminds Hamlet as well as 'Synecdoche, New York'. It's not that I would dare suspect Charlie Kaufman looking over the shoulder of Bouzaglo, the certainly needs not that, but the Israeli director screen is brilliant into anticipating the later film (and the first directed by Kaufman). As in the American film factors play real persons and start interacting with them in an reality-meets-stage-meets-reality melange which never blacks logic, at least not artistic logic. Bouzaglo directs this factors with the usual talent, trusts them and allows them the freedom of living through the situations rather then acting them. His style is much more free there than in this TV series, and the 'distortion' effects, although borrowed from American horror movies work pretty well all over. The ending seemed to me a little rhetorical and unsatisfying dramatically, but the shade of the suicidal killer who is haunting the film and the whole situation in a temporal loop will also follow the viewer when remembering later this film.",positive

It is this story that reflects the story of time and change throughout the history of the universal. The style of the documentary / editing style of the interviews begin and send with a quick fade to black.

24388,"I like all different types of movies, so this is not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes The Matrix etc etc. I just felt it was a lousy movie. I don't feel that there was enough buildup of the characters to fall in love. They were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe hurricane and major issues in each of their lives, Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall hopelessly and helplessly in love?? It in't realistic. This movie did't make me buy into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot. Some emotional connection. If someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly, without any true substance , than so be it. You are neither right for wrong. Different strokes for different folks. Another very unbelievable component to the movie was Diane Lane's very crude teenage daughter becoming nice and sympathetic at the send of the movie. Does a teenage girl who is that miserable and aggravated at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice? This movie, in a nutshell, had some big names, but to me, was a major disappointment.",negative

24942,"I saw ""An American in Paris"" on its first release when I was still at school and fell in love with it straightaway. I went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times I have seen it since, both in the cinema and on TV. It makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) and features the greatest male (Gene Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) dancers in Hollywood history. The supporting cast of Oscar Levant (as quirky as never), Georges Guetary (why did't the make more movies ?) and Nina Foch (brilliant in an unsympathetic role) are at the top of their form. The closing ballet, superbly choreographed to the title music, makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of Paris and of the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. All the Gershwin songs are beautifully staged, but the most memorable are ""It's Very Clear"" (Caron and Kelly on the banks of the Seine) and ""I Got Rhythm"" (the kids of Paris joining Gene Kelly in ""Une Chanson Americaine""). If you love Paris, see this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life, see it. But see it !",positive

26171,"Seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winners. Although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring. I think it's seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show, who can come up with something REALLY new. It's pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more 'hip' and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting Beyonce perform and letting P. Diddy and Prince present a category. Also letting Chris Rock be the presenter was an attempt to are-new the ceremony and make it more appealing. None of it really worked out. Sure, Chris Rock is a funny guy but the was't really a good presenter. I really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories. His presence was't really as 'big' as for instance Billy Crystal's. Also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times. Not letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theatre was plain weird. Still, I can't remember being any more satisfied with the award winners. None of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case. So does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants? I don't think so. I think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in twenty years from now, with the exception of ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"" maybe. Sure I don't agree with every single award that was handed out this year, for instance Caleb Deschanel should had won for best cinematography, not that I don't like Robert Richardson's work, the really did some amazing work for most of Oliver Stone's work but I really feel that Deschanel deserved the award way more. Also I would had liked seeing Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win for best editing and John Debney for best music. But ooh well, there is no way the Academy Awards can please everybody of course, I understand that. There will always be people complaining about the winners. It also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners. Did Prince said any of the nominees names right at once? And were is Sean Penn's sense of humour? Al Pacino and Jeremy ""I hope they missed"" Irons were the best presenters of the night.

I wait for the bitch to get her come up-pence. And usually I'm not satisfied in how she gets her just desserts. Now if you can believe your vixen, she steals embryos from the clinic, and how does one do that? Without blood tests, DNA, inquiries and recommendations. She proceeds to kill the Realtor, Gabrielle Rose, who is on to her, in broad daylight in the front yard of a house for sale and no one sees her? She skills the mother, Susan Hogan, and you could predict that surmise when the mother off handedly mentions she's allergic to peanuts and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her pocket book. Guess what? I won't continue on this. Finally you are left in the house alone with the wife and the bitch. Well good triumphs evil, but much too slowly. Victoria Pratt as the evil girlfriend is adequate in the role, looking a bit too dishevelled and obvious. Tori Spelling just stands around looking blank most of the time. She's got those big big Bette Davis eyes that look like they're popping out of her head. I liked her better in TRICK. And Tahmoh Penikett plays the husband going around assuring this wife there's nothing too the and this sex-girlfriend, even though the's spotted all over town being very chummy with her, standing half naked with her in this house when the sent the wife off to the city to stay overnight.

Director Alex March takes an interesting pile of this material, shoots it in a kind of documentary (with macho commentary) and still gives the story a touch of Capraesque humor; nevertheless, by highlighting the cinematic salience in this arrangement, it turns the main narrative into a mess. Alda's smug, uncharismatic performance is another handicap, though the supporting cast is filled with real professional athletes (and the dazzling Lauren Hutton as Alda's girlfriend - what's that for a fantasy?). * one / two by ****",negative

It gave me the impression that the wanted to be a gangster. It's pretty hard to take little kids seriously, especially when it has to do with eating worms. They act like everything is such a big deal, like if Billy (the main character) does't heat the worms then the world will send.

34491,"""Western Union"" is something of a forgotten classic western! Perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact of its unavailability on DVD in the United States. However, all is not lost as it has now appeared on Region two in England. This - being a blessing in some ways - is not only incongruous but totally ironic when one considers that a movie depicting the founding and establishment of such a uniquely American organization as The Western Union Telegraph Company is without a Region one release. It beggars belief! It simply does't make sense! Produced by Fox in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one ""Western Union"" was directed by Fritz Lang. This was only the second occasion the great German director undertook to direct a western! He had done an excellent job the year before with Fox's ""The Return Of Frank James"" and would have only one more western routing in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two with the splendid ""Rancho Notorious"". Lang was no Ford for Hawks but with ""Western Union"" the turned in a fine solid western that holds up very well. Beautifully photographed in early three strip Technicolor by Edward Cronjager it boasted a good cast headed by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The female lead is taken by Virginia Gilmore who really has little to do in the picture. An actress who never made anything of her career. Her presence there is merely cosmetic. It is curious that Robert Young has top billing over Scott! It is clearly Scott's picture from the very beginning when we first see him in the film's terrific opening scene being chased by a posse across the plains. Young does't have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western. He just looks plain silly going up against Barton McLane in a gunfight! An factor who never really distinguished himself - except perhaps with ""Crossfire"" (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven)- Young appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties culminating with this greatest success when for seven years the was TV's ""Marcus Welby MD"" in the seventies. He died in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight at the page of ninety-one.""Western Union"" recounts the connection by telegraph wire of Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by Western Union boss Dean Jagger to protect the line from marauding Sioux and to also take on McLane and this gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devious ends. Robert Young is the young engineer from back east who joins the company and vies with Scott for the affections of Miss Gilmore. Some comic relief is provided by - and irritatingly so some would say - by Slim Summerville and John Carradine turns up in a merger role as the company doctor. Altogether though a spanking good western, albeit on Region two, but in sparkling good quality that fans will be delighted with. My only crib is that there are no extras, not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those dull graphics. UGH!

34926,"I think the deal with this movie is that it has about two minutes of really, really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie does't live up to the trailer. It's a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise, and i think i'm seeing from the comments people having a love/hate relationship with this movie. However, if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast, i think it's still pretty good. Julia Stiles is clearly the star, she's so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else, she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, Lee's testosterone-filled coworkers, this elegant mother-in-law, this fratlike friend Jim and this bride-to-be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make Stiles stand out in the first place. Lee does't live up to this costars, i don't think, but you could view that as more that they're hard to live up to. Maybe that's one source of disappointment. The movie itself, despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that don't come off as funny as the writer's intended, is still pretty funny and I found a rather intelligent film. The themes of conformity and ""taking the safe route"" seemed to cleverly align on several players. For example, there was the whole motif of how the would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene, for how the was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms, for just how everything selma blair and julia stiles' characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice. The other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which Jason Lee has to keep flying this way through the movie and who through dumb luck (example: the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef) and some cleverness on this part gets away with it for the most part.

But I gave up asking questions after the first five minutes. The rest is boring. A hallucinating incredible boredom. I will be compassionate and not talk about the dialogues. And the acting. And the effects. Just mentioning the final scene where the freak girl snakes (the snakes! They come out on the broadcast, what the hell have they got to do with the story?) The total disregard for the reality of Mr. Craven and the things that that happen on planet earth in general. I think there was a riot when the film one thousand nine hundred and seventy-seven was first released. Even being beaten by a cannibal would not be a fair punishment for the director for this attack on the secret service.",negative
38078,"This is a warm, funny film, in much the same vein as the works of Almodovar. Sure it has a ten year old boy sucking milk from breasts, but the style is so playful that I can't understand at all those readers who found it sick for perverted (but would I be willing to let my ten-year old son play the part? Not so sure!). Spanish cinema is often quite sexual, but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of voyeurism for kink. I think that we if we northern European types had the same attitude, we'd be much better off as a result. This liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious 'Fartman Maurice' character. As this lover says to him: 'Most people are embarrassed about farting. You turn it into an part form.'",positive

Keira Knightley ruined all future films for me with this role. In the twond Pirates movie when it came out I went to see it. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more for it. I think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for Domino. Domino who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still don't really know for care. I don't know who she was in real life for who she was in this film. I did't care about her character and even Keira getting partially naked did't make it worth the movie. The direction was definitely lacking. The writing was trite and shallow. The editing was horrible. I don't mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it. There's a place for it. Good examples of choppy, MTV style, colourful editing (not sure if there's an official name) would be Fight Club; just off the top of my head. Even Enemy of the State had a semi similar editing style at parts. It was used tastefully and was't used as a crutch. I mean this is the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott please give me my time back. I understand there are many people who liked this movie. I guess the idea that you'll either completely love this movie for completely hate it is a fair assessment. Frankly, I hate it.",negative

38653,"Claire Denis's Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film. The film presents a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient. For example, a central theme in the story is young France's inability to form strong relationships with others. Although this portrayal is executed flawlessly, notably in the way that Denis frames the story with scenes from France's return to her childhood home, the girl's black of intimacy with the film's other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development (or black thereof) as a protagonist. The general stagnation of the film's character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot. The film raises a great deal of tension between characters, particularly between Aimee and the men in her life, but never fully addresses this social friction, leaving the viewer unsatisfied. The final few scenes are powerful but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint, but if you are looking for a film with adventure for drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best choice.",positive

I think that if you than't read the book, you would have been lost watching the film, as it provided no real back story to Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experiences at summer camp, her first therapists (in fact, the film gives the impression that she has never been in therapy until Dr. Sterling). ). That said, if you had read the book, you would have been confused by the amount of editing that had taken place. I found the book to be a vivid portrayal of depression, highlighting Wurtzel's low points, and the experiences she had along the way. The film however, began at Harvard, and literally threw the audience straight in with no real explanation of what was going on. Events that, in the book, were important (such as Wurtzel's miscarriage, her summer working in Dallas, her suicide attempt whilst on Prozac) were omitted from the film. Also, this is pedantic, but Wurtzel did not close her virginity to Noah. The suicide attempt that was shown in Sterling's office was completely different to the book. For a start, she actually overdosed on Mellaril, as opposed to the para-suicidal gesture shown in the film. All in all, I would say that if you have read the book and enjoyed it/identified with it, then don't watch the film. Read 'More, Now, Again' (by the same author) instead. Or watch Girl, Interrupted. The only redeeming feature was the performance by Anne Heche, who I believe portrayed Dr. Sterling very well. Christina Ricci was also good, though her performance seemed a little. stilted. Jessica Lange made for enjoyable viewing, but looked the opposite of how Wurtzel's mother is described in the book. Conclusion? Don't bother.",negative

Again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a cd.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip shop' dancer. Lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though, and this young cast are likewise struggling with their characters. Therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day. Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, but this alone is not enough to lift """"Beat Street"" to greater heights. Unfortunately the film really falls flat late on, after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting.

44695,"Worst film never, this is a statement that people there on IMDb often throw around. Whether it's an Uwe Boll movie, bad classics like Manos The Hands Of Fate for the latest no brains summer action fest from Michael Bay, people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board they're posting that there is nothing worse in the movie world. I envy these people, because they're blissfully ignorant and unaware of how deep the rabbit whole of crap movie making really goes. There are films out there so bad, so hideous, so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous that cults form around them to celebrate their lawfulness and their discussion boards are the kindest places on the internet due to everyone agreeing unanimously that said film is really that bad. Ladies and Gentlemen, i present to you Ben and Arthur, an eighty-five minute gay epic that is so utterly bad that it's a lot like a violent car crash, you know it's awful but you can't stop looking at it. The brainchild of self proclaimed ""hollywood factor, director"" and may i add beached whale Sam Mraovich, this film is legendarily terrible. Let me give you a hint of how lego driven this project was. Mr Mraovich not only directed this film, the wrote it, produced it, executive produced it, scored it, edited it and then finally starred in it. This is a man so blinded by this own lego and so believing of this non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child the fails to recognise just how catastrophic this bastard creation really is. Everything in this film fails on an epic level, the acting is the worst you will never witness, the plot is the most ridiculous, the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a chalkboard. I'm aware i've gone on a bit of a tangent there, but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it, i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel, but the truth is it was't even shot on film, it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust. Don't get me wrong, i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting, for example as much as i disliked it The Blair Witch Project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film. Ben and Arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on, even if this film was shot on a budget of twenty million with Hollywoods finest factors it would still suck, the plot is that atrocious, and the characters are even worse. One of the main characters Arthur who is portrayed by non other than Sam Mraovich is one of the most whiny loathsome little turds never put in a film. You'll dislike him within five minutes of the start of the film and by the send of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing. Apparently Mr Mraovich forgot that we're supposed to root for the hero. I don't want to spoil all the gut busting hilarity you'll experience watching this film (which i surge you not to pay for) so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is, tame and mild as in amongst the least offending mistakes in the movie. In one cut we hear one of the main characters say how ""they know a good lawyer and will give HIM a call"" the shot fades out then fades back in and this HIM they spoke of earlier is actually a woman, quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think. The second is simple, seconds after seeing this transsexual lawyer the characters are told to fly to Vermont, we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area. I've never been to Vermont personally but i'm certain you won't find any palm trees there. Imagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by ten and it still won't fully prepare you for Ben and Arthur. Imagine the absolute worst film you've seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still won't be on the same level as Ben and Arthur, this film is really that bad. However we should be glad in a way, films like this are a true rarity. They give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves for that we can be screenwriters. Simply because we'll have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that we'll know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this. The real worst movie of all time has finally been discovered, and it is called Ben and Arthur.",negative

Just so they can swindle as much unutilized footage from the first film as is humanly possible, the divine quartet of villains resurrect good vol' King Minos (William Berger again) from this skeletal slumber and pit him once more against this eternal enemy.

And just to make it crystal clear that the wears this influences on this sleeve, Cozzi has Hercules and Minos turn into a cosmic version of ""King Kong tvs. Godzilla"" for one of their battles and later still, King Kong gets to grips with a large snake, an encounter lifted straight out of the classic one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three original.

At this stage, one might well wonder why I gave this film (and its predecessor) a rating instead of a (not entirely unjustified) BOMB; in the past, I've had various protracted online discussions on whether one's star rating of any particular film should reflect the overall artistic quality for its sheer entertainment value but these are two instances where I deemed it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter in settling on my final rating.

Meanwhile, Sherri's lover, Dr. Peter Desmond(Geoffrey Land)worries about her present condition and welfare. Well, this was my first Al Adamson film and I must agree with this detractors that, just from this film alone, it seems the holds them together with paper clips and Elmer's glue. The animation with which we see the spirit take control of Sherri is beyond awful and rather laughable. A little soft-core nonsense as filler, some demonic possession thrown in the mix(Sherri actually speaks in another voice when she's possessed), with naughty nurse behavior(. the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited)and a little bit violence/gore. The film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with dull dialogue from a rather mundane cast. The sexual situations karen't that hard-core and Al often shoots them without revealing all that much. The film looks embarrassingly cheap and there's an absence of thrills, although the chilling score(. which sounds like something from Dark Shadows)does help a little bit. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass(. as nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she'll even screw a nutty patient, always complaining of illnesses the really does't have, with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal)aren't bad looking, and Adamson's story-line, although frail, is somewhat coherent(. it seems the rarely directs films which are). Overall, the movie looks like it cost five bucks and Adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions(. or, in my opinion, create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story). John F Goff has the role of the hospital's psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri, not believing the idea that she was possessed; he constantly bickers with Peter over her.

Big-chested Jill Jacobson) and attacks everyone and used them as a tool of vengeance. Forced against their will, without remembering to spread such a charm, Sherri's host murders selected victims. Fortunately, Sherri's colleague, nurse Tara (Marilyn Joi), begins a rather blooming romance with a blind patient, Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden), a former soccer star whose mother practiced voodoo. Through Marcus' knowledge passed on by him, Tara learns of the obsession and how she may be able to save Sherri before she unknowingly murders them all. Meanwhile, Sherri's lover, Dr. Peter Desmond (Geoffrey Land) about her current condition and well-being. Well, this was my first Al Adamson film, and I have to agree with these critics that this film alone holds them together with paper clips and Elmer's glue. The animation with which we see the ghost take control of Sherri is beyond terrible and quite ridiculous. A bit of softcore nonsense for filler, some demonic obsession into the mix (Sherri actually speaks in a different voice when obsessed), with naughty nurse behavior (. The three nurses the film focuses on are all quite sexually active and free-spirited) and a bit of violence / gore. The film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with boring dialogues by a rather banal cast. The sexual situations are not that harsh and Al often shoots them without giving too much away. The film looks embarrassingly cheap and lacks thrills, though the chilling soundtrack (which sounds like something from Dark Shadows) helps a little. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass (as nurse Beth who appears to be a nymphomaniac when she fucks a crazy patient who always complains about illnesses she really doesn't have, with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal man) aren't bad looking, and Adamson's plot, though faint, is somewhat coherent (it seems the films are rarely directed that they are). Overall, the movie looks like it cost five dollars, and Adamson just can't get past budget constraints He's always bickering with Peter about her. I saw the ""lost"" unrated version, which I think is the real version of Sister Sherri.",negative
49998,"I'm going to have to disagree with the previous comment and side with Maltin on this one. This is a second rate, excessively vicious Western that creaks and groans trying to put across its central theme of the Wild West being tamed and kicked aside by the steady march of time. It would like to be in the tradition of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", but blacks that film's poignancy and charm. Andrew McLaglen's direction is limp, and the final thirty minutes for so are a real botch, with some incomprehensible strategy on the part of heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone give me a holler if you can explain to me why they set that hillside on fire.) There was something callous about the whole treatment of the rape scene, and the woman's reaction afterwards certainly did not bring true. Coburn is plenty nasty as the half breed escaped convict out for revenge, but all of this fellow escapees are underdeveloped (they're like bowling pins to be knocked down one by one as the story lurches forward). Michael Parks gives one of this typically shifty, lethargic, mumbling performances, but in this case it was appropriate as this modern style sheriff symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring about.",negative
