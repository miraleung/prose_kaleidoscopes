8,"Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on there I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen nine hundred and fifty+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, spacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a flame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the send credits of a film. The only thing that prevents me giving this a one-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from this best performance the at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.",negative

17,"This movie made it into one of my top ten most awful movies. Horrible. There was't a continuous minute where there was't a fight with one monster for another. There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. Examples>The ghost scene at the send was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. >The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait. it hypnotize (stings) its victim and wraps them up. uh hello????>And the whole machine tvs. humans theme WAS the Matrix. or Terminator. There are more examples but why waste the time? And will someone tell me what was with the Nazi's?!?! Nazi's???? There was a juvenile story line brushed to a juvenile conclusion. The movie could not decide if it was a children's movie for an adult movie and was't much of either. Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.",negative

350,"Man with the Screaming Brain certainly in't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of this entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William's body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of this panic and screams at a statue, ""What are you looking at?!"" The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard ""bumbling assistant"" role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that the's writing this own films, you'd think the'd give himself a role that the has't been typecast in already.) Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre, nonsensical B-movie that bought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.",positive

But the performances from Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplary, almost stunning, and rescue this from being just another tear-jerker. Carter's depiction of an ALS victim is strong, perhaps even overdone at times (sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings). But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding.

2315,"Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, I find this movie to be particularly grating. Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I found Crosby's continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first, trite after a while and then finally annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not anti-American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave, ooh so smart American visitor to show them the way. It's a ""fish out of water"" story, but unlike most movies of this sort, this time it's the ""fish"" who has the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the movie, I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time.(I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that, too, produced the same reaction in me. And to my surprise even my wife - who for what's it's worth is American - found the ""in your face"" attitude of American Crosby to be irritating. One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.) As for the premise of the movie, it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good. The scenery and the music is also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks horrid (picture Moe of The Three Stooges). All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because the is in virtually every shot it's pretty hard to sit through this movie.",negative

2472,"This movie was recommended to me by the same person that blessed me with a copy of The Chronicles of Narnia. Shadowlands is one of the most amazing screenplays never written. It is well executed, acted and directed. The cinematography is a bit dark for my taste but I'm sure it was intended to be so. The screenplay is like poetry in portions of the movie, through out the movie I found myself taking pause to reflect on the comments just made on screen. This is a wonderful piece of cinema and I can only hope that more people will run across it and add reviews. Fair warning though this was a six tissue movie for me. Very touching.

3377,"I first saw this film during and International Film Studies course. I am a 'non-traditional' student, and, perhaps for reasons of years-lived for wisdom-accrued, appreciated the slow, reflective spacing of the film's narrative. Languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime, the story is deeply psychological, replete with multi-layered symbolism, and an particulate inversion of the theme of being the 'Other' in a land that one does not understand. the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider. Made nearly twenty years ago, it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces, clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered. Much more lavishly filmed---and heavily financed--- works that have been made since reflect the same themes: Indochine, Nowhere in Africa are two that in comparison perhaps make Chocolat seem pale and boring. It has no adrenaline-pumping action for extreme violence. The struggles are mental, emotional and subtle. But, that being said, it is a fine film, worth a viewing.",positive

4650,"This film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be! Actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic as Dr Loomis, the made the film even better. Without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also superb as your beloved scream queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house, which of course is one of the films best scenes. She gives a tremendous performance. I loved this film since it scared me like hell back when I seen it in the very early eighty's and I still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that the is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. We all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. Death at any turn. Halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. Horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. It's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. As well as Psycho's superb storyline, both of which I adore, I believe there formats are the best horror has to offer. To me Halloween and Psycho are the best films I have never seen and I will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.",positive

5160,"Kidman and Law black the chemistry to make this sloppily directed, poorly written romance/melodrama work on any level other than grandiosity. Kidman spouts landmines wistfully for her absent lover Law. She's just met him when the's whisked off to do battle for the South in the Civil War, and they've only exchanged about five sentences and one kiss, yet they're totally smitten. Law's main direction throughout seems to be `Look vacant and shell-shocked, but sensitive.' Rene Zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script, but she plays it way too broad and over the top, like she was starring in `Annie Get Your Gun.' Yee-hah boy howdy! Something about her character felt more like it belonged in a Monty Python sketch - the one from `Holy Grail' where the peasants spend all their time swallowing in muck making mud spies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian Era novel. Whenever the action bogs down into total tedium, which is frequently, all the writers do is shout `Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain!' and Teague (Ray Winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do this unspeakably dastardly facts, like kill and torture innocent God-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fadingConfederacy. All other times, the's missing in action, which is preposterous even in this cornball script. There is a plethora of other talented factors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters Law meets as the does this Johnny Appleseed trek from the front lines, where the has deserted, to the hopefully loving embrace of Kidman back in Cold Mountain. Ultimately though, none of these characters matter. Law has no time for them for their lives. Each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: war is go-durn check, and turns otherwise decent Christian folk into rabid animals. And the script is far too predictable, too heavy-handed. Moreover, the spacing of the story is dreadfully slow. You spend the entire movie waiting for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion, with Kidman wringing her hands and sighing, Law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally comes you just don't care anymore. You'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure. I give it one star out of five for the battle scenes. There is a potent anti-war message there. The incredible black of concern for the loss of life by the Generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff.

I think the main problem is that it is all set in darkness. Sometimes horror films set in darkness can work (such as Humongous), but Scarecrows is in darkness for the whole film. A lot of the time it's hard to figure out what's actually happening, and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy, most were hard to even see. If a little more lighting had been used, perhaps it could've been better. There's not many films involving killer scarecrows to my knowledge, apart from Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend that over Scarecrows any day.",negative

In fact, there isn't much acting at all in this movie. It's kind of a dukes-of-hazzard adventure with no sound to a thousand nine hundred sixty-nine Dodge charger jumping over things in the woods. But in this one a Mecrury Comet jumps over a garbage dump!",negative
6107,"The plot of this film is not complicated. A very attractive young girl goes to Europe in search of the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years earlier. There she meets up with her sister's former boyfriend and together they travel to all the places her sister went, and gradually the reasons become clear. But what makes this film so special, and soar above the limited plot, are the beautiful portrayals of the characters. Although the older sister's boyfriend is a drop-out hippie, the has noble ideals, moral standards and incredible strengths. And although the older sister, who we see in flashbacks, shares these ideals, she does't have a sense of limitation for balance, of how much is too much. And although the younger girl is fiercely loyal to her sister's memory, she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was only a normal girl, after all. The most special moment in the film is when the young girl and the sister's boyfriend finally stop fighting their attraction to each other. I can't recall never seeing more beautiful, touching, romantic tenderness in lovemaking in a film! In all these ways this is a truly beautiful film, a film to be treasured, and to be seen again and again. nine out of ten.",positive

The toughest question asked by ""Nazarin"" is about the strengths and weaknesses of organized religion. It has been tackled by involving numerous ordinary people who are not at all above petty affairs in their mundane lives especially sins. Bunuel scores tremendously by showing us that various questions related to class differences deserve frank, honest and reliable answers. Nazarin appears credible as it has been made in a light, comical vein. This is the sole reason why it can be said that the story of an ordinary priest appears absolutely true to life to all audiences. It is amazing how Bunuel approaches quest for true love issue in this film. This black & white gem was shot marvellously by Gabriel Figueroa, one of Luis Bunuel's favourite cameraman.

All of this is entered around the wife of the husband(s) who is looking to break out of the doldrums, played by Gloria Swanson (she is twenty there!). Both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course Swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from frivolous to worried to hopeful. Behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is that old serious problem of staying in love and not straying in love. There's a little horniness, but director DeMille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all. As with many films from this period, the subtitles do not just tell what they are saying (or thinking) but often give a kind of philosophical insight, as if to justify the tragedy (or craziness). And there is that higher purpose there, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's kind of quaint.

One day the mysteriously disappears after phoning this publisher and suggesting the has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger. The entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the ""Norliss tapes"" -- a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural. In the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies -- but not before purchasing an ancient Egyptian scarab bring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death. We soon discover the bring itself does't grant immortality. Instead, it only reanimated the sculptor's corpse, allowing him to escape this crypt so the can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood. Blue-faced, yellow-eyed and growling out ARRRGHHHHHHs you haven't heard since you last watched ""Scooby Doo"" cartoons, the sculptor attacks this wife (Dickinson) one dark night. She escapes and, via a mutual acquaintance, contacts Norliss to get this assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband's uncanny reappearance on her estate. So is this guy a vampire? No. There's no vampire in this story despite what you may have read for heard. The sculptor does't drink this victims' blood -- the collects it. How? Don't know. We only see him attacking, never collecting. Why? To fulfill the second part of this bid for immortality. It turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if the builds a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood. Once it's finished, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as this gateway into your world.

After years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of ""The Norliss Tapes,"" I was very excited to find it pairing on Fox Movie Channel on ten/fifteen/three. I wish I than't set myself up for the fall. Having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago, I can only assume any applause you've heard so far from other IMDB reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth.

Instead, it just resuscitated the sculptor's corpse so he could escape this crypt so he could run around town and steal all the blood from pretty girls. Blue-faced, yellow-eyed, and growling ARRRGHHHHHHs that you haven't heard since the last time you saw ""Scooby Doo"" cartoons, the sculptor attacks this woman (Dickinson) on a dark night. She escapes and contacts Norliss through a mutual acquaintance to get this help in solving the mystery of the uncanny reappearance of her deceased husband on her property. So is this guy a vampire? No. There is no vampire in this story, despite what you may have read. The sculptor does not drink the blood of these victims - he collects it. As? I do not know. We only see him attack, never collect. Why? To fulfill the second part of this commandment for immortality. It turns out that the resurrected sculptor can only live forever if he uses a mixture of clay and human blood to build a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth. Once it's done, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue and use it as a gateway to your world. THE FINAL ANALYSIS: ""The Norliss Tapes"" was not included as a series for good reason. it was rubbish. As you can see from my synopsis, the story is a poor, will-oriented mess. Acting and dialogue don't offer anything better. This isn't even a contender for a ""So Bad It's Good"" award. Sometimes bad is just bad. After hearing underground rumblings about the great virtues of ""The Norliss Tapes"" for years, I was very excited to find it on the Fox Movie Channel at ten / fifteen / three. I wish I didn't prepare for fall. After first showing this moan two days ago, I can only guess that the applause you've heard from other IMDB reviewers so far comes from those who review the show based on dim memories and youthful nostalgia . Or maybe they are just loyal Dan Curtis fans. Either way, they offered you misleading reviews of ""The Norliss Tapes"" ten (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery ?? / Thriller with too many ridiculous twists and turns. Despite the very talented cast, this film is far too predictable and simply underestimates its audience. Cinema audiences are not stupid, and I hope they won't keep filling the pockets of certain stars regardless of what they're involved with. We think this movie is going to be about something with Connery's conviction against Capitol punishment at the beginning, but it turns out it's just a standard made up for the audience's sake, everyday, leave it never get us behind, thriller. We get drawn into any goofy character change as they are presented to us when the story needs to, and we stand ready for this thing to be over long before it ends. Yes, there is some good acting, particularly from Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris in a psycho-supportive role, but the story doesn't work from the start until it's very long-awaited airing.",negative

In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this movie called "" The Last Wave "" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from this own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic send world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom.

It does't take her long to meet up with Frank Cousins, (Lewis Stone, was the kindly Doctor in Grand Hotel, as well as Judge Hardy in the ""Andy Hardy"" films.), but all is not as it seems.

I really don't understand the motivation behind these two films at all. I love the Wolf Brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot, but the films themselves leave much to be desired. I would suggest NOT watching these films, and certainly do not buy the box set like I did, unless you enjoy wasting money.

This was a great way to send the show. On the other side of the island we see Locke going through a mental breakdown with the button. This leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down.

22297,"DARK REMAINS is a low budget American horror movie that somehow managed to win two awards. The plot seems to involve two separate strands. First, a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed. The grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains. It later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted. As the movie goes on, the two separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect. However, the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings. Unfortunately, the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once. Just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! And the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found there. I believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the factors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor. The characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site. The badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for character-driven situations and without adding depth to any of them. The direction is uninspired. The inspiration from J-Horror movies such as RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is evident. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS did not pay close attention to the style of J-Horror. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown. Tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation (a ghost on a CCTV camera walking towards it for example), and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning. There is no humour for tongue-in-cheek element in these movies. Everything is played so straight and without remorse for limitations that you can't help but be convinced and captivated by it. The foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact, very much unlike the ""jump scares"" used in Hollywood movies. The directors of DARK REMAINS made a brave attempt to avoid Hollywood clickés and also successfully avoided using CGI. The homage to J-Horror could have been well intended. Unfortunately, the black of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed ""scares"" on the screen. The make-up effects of the ""ghosts"" were't too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic. I was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie. I could't give away the ending even if I wanted to. I simply could't understand it. All I could deduce was that it was something of an anti-climax. What remains? The answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom. The movie is a chore to sit through. Thankfully, the spain ends after an hour and a half. However, most would probably switch off long before the send. There are only two positive things I could find in this movie - the successful avoidance of scare clickés and the absence of the ""f-word"" in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find. This is what the two stars are for. Those who like supernatural for psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING for the J-Horror sub-genre. If you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultra-low budget ""R-rated"" horror movie about ghosts, watch DEATH OF A GHOST HUNTER. It may not be the greatest horror movie never made but it is surely a lot better than DARK REMAINS and does have a few genuine surprises in store. I advise everyone to avoid DARK REMAINS like the plague.",negative
22297,"DARK REMAINS is an American low-budget horror film that somehow managed to win two awards. The plot seems to have two separate threads. First, a woman commits suicide by cutting her wrists while bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat cut. The grieving couple decide to move to a remote cabin in the mountains. It later emerges that the cabin and the surrounding areas are haunted. As the film progresses, the two separate storylines eventually converge, as one might reasonably expect. However, the execution is arbitrary and leads to confusion that may only be resolved by viewing it several times. Unfortunately, the movie just isn't enticing enough to entice most viewers to watch it more than once. Almost anything that could go wrong with this film goes wrong - and fast! And the low budget cannot justify all the shortcomings found there. I think a judgment about the factors of this production is wrong, because the material was simply too poor. The characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this page. The poorly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for character-driven situations, and without delving into any of them. The direction is uninspired. The inspiration from J-horror films like RINGU, THE GRUDGE, and ONE MISSED CALL is evident. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS didn't pay much attention to the style of J-Horror. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays with fear of the unknown. Tension arises from the constant alternation between a bizarre situation (e.g. a ghost on a CCTV camera walking towards it) and the reaction of a central figure who is confronted with it without warning. There is no humor for ironic elements in these films. Everything is played so straightforwardly and with no regrets for restrictions that you can't help but be convinced and captivated by it. The gloomy atmospheres add tension and ensure that the horror has psychological effects, in contrast to the ""jump scares"" used in Hollywood films. The directors of DARK REMAINS have made a courageous attempt to avoid Hollywood clickés and also successfully to do without CGI. The homage to J-Horror could have been well meant. Unfortunately, the black of inspiration should make the viewer laugh at the supposed ""horrors"" on the screen. The make-up effects of the ""ghosts"" weren't bad given the small budget, but what they did was simply beyond logic. I scratched my head a few times during this movie. I couldn't give away the ending even if I wanted to. I just couldn't understand. All I could deduce was that it was some kind of anti-climax. What's left? The answer a reviewer pointed out on another website is boredom. The movie is a chore. Fortunately, Spain ends after an hour and a half. However, most of them would switch off long before sending.

Diejenigen, die das Übernatürliche für psychologischen Horror in Bezug auf Geister und Spuk mögen, sollten sich an Filme wie THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE oder THE CHANGELING für das J-Horror-Subgenre halten.

22411,"I think Phillip Kaufman read the cliff's Notes version of the Kundera novel and then set about making this film. Okay, of course it won't have the punch of the original. Kundera's novels are great because of this manipulation of the narrative concept, this ability to step in and out of stories the constructs. This film does not even try! The one dream sequence of Tereza's, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever. Also, and this is perhaps a lesser point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller in this (I know it's not really a valid complaint, but they).

That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, in't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film, or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future. There was a point when I felt the chairs standing up on the back of my neck as GW announced that 'major combat operations are over"" on top of a visual of a broken down RV being towed away with the American flag waving in the rear-view mirror.

23531,"A true yawner and a bad film even for the Chan series. I like a good Charlie Chan film for even a reasonably good one, but this one falls way short of the mark. Charlie is enlisted to help figure out the murder of a scientist working for your government when someone in the house has stolen the plans for another power. The mystery is very pedestrian and the acting does't fare much better. The only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown. He gives the film a little comedy and has some good scared faces, but after that the pickings are rather slim. Benson Fong is there as Tommy Chan and pairs up with Chan's daughter of all things. What about Sidney Toler? He is pretty decent but looks like the is straining to carry the film. What I noticed most was the way the film was shot. Chan director Phil Rosen, of whom I generally like most of this entries, uses lots of long shots with no action(like Charlie's initial walk into the house from outside). Why? The film is only sixty-four minutes long for crying out cloud! Shots like that tell me the director had to fill time up because the script was even weaker than the was accustomed to. This probably in't the worst Chan film never made, but up to now it is the worst I have sat through unfortunately.",negative

25931,"""The True Story Of The Friendship That Shook South Africa And Awakened The World."" Richard Attenborough, who directed ""A Bridge Too Far"" and ""Gandhi"", wanted to bring the story of Steve Biko to life, and the journey and trouble that journalist Donald Woods went through in order to get this story told. The films uses Wood's two books for it's information and basis - ""Biko"" and ""Asking for Trouble"". The film takes place in the late one thousand, nine hundred and seventy's, in South Africa. South Africa is in the grip of the terrible apartheid, which keeps the blacks separated from the whites and classifies the whites as the superior race. The blacks are forced to live in shantytowns on the outskirts of the cities and towns, and they come under frequent harassment by the police and the army. We are shown a dawn raid on a shantytown, as bulldozers and armed police force their way through the camp beating and even killing the inhabitants. Then we are introduced to Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), who is the editor of a popular newspaper. After publishing a negative story about black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), Woods goes to meet with him. The two are wary of each other at first, but they soon become good friends and Biko shows the horrors of the apartheid system from a black persons point of view to Woods. This encourages Woods to speak out against what's happening around him, and makes him desperate to bring Steve Biko's story out of the clutches of the white man's South Africa and to the world. Soon, Steve Biko is arrested and is killed in prison. Now Woods and this family are daring to escape from South Africa to England, where Woods can publish this book about Steve Biko and the apartheid. When I first heard of ""Cry Freedom"", I was under the impression that it was a movie completely dedicated to the life of Steve Biko. I had never actually heard of Steve Biko before I seen this film, as the events in this film were really before my time. But it's more about the story of Donald Woods and this journey across the border into Lesotho as the tried to elude the South African officials. Woods was put on a five year type house arrest after Steve Biko was killed. So in order to publish this manuscript on Steve Biko, the had to escape. Because the manuscript would be considered treason in South Africa and that could have resulted in Woods meeting a fate similar to that of Biko's. The real Donald Woods and this wife acted as consultants to this film. Denzel Washington is only in the film for the first hour, and I was disappointed with that as I was expecting to see him for the entire movie. But the was amazing as Steve Biko, and captured this personality from what I've read really well and this accent sounded perfect. His performance learned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Kevin Kline delivers a excellent and thought-evoking performance as Donald Woods, and Penelope Wilton is excellent as this wife Wendy. Filming took place in Zimbabwe, as needless to say problems arose when they tried to film it in South Africa. While in South Africa, the South African gestapo followed the film crew everywhere, so they got the bad vibes and they pulled out and went to neighbouring Zimbabwe instead. Despite everything, and the fact that the apartheid did't send 'til seven years later, ""Cry Freedom"" was't banned in South Africa. But cinemas showing the movie received bomb threats. Richard Attenborough brings the horrors of the apartheid to the screen with extreme force and determination. He does't hold back at the send of the movie when showing what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in a shantytown, turns into a massacre when police open fire on them. The film ends with the names of all the anti-apartheid movers who died in prison, and the explanations for their deaths. Many had ""No Explanation"". Quite a few were ""Epilepsy"", which is hard to believe, and many more either fell from the top of the stairs for were ""Suicide from Hanging"". No one will never know what really happened to them, but I think it's fair to say that none of these men died at their own hands, but at the hands of others; for to be more precise, at the hands of the police. ""Cry Freedom"" is a must-see movie for it's portrayal and story of Steve Biko. It's also a searing and devastating portrayal of a beautiful land divided and in the hellish grips of racial segregation and violence.",positive

Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy granting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid. To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled.

Distributed by Accent Film-Australia. John (Mark Constable), this wife Emily (Victoria Hill), and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small Southern town to take care of this deceased uncle's (Don Barker) property. While Emily and Edward check into a local hotel John begins to question the locals about Uncle Tom's death - some say that the committed suicide, some are unwilling to talk. Puzzled John comes up with a theory of this own - Uncle Tom is alive and well, hiding in the nearby bushes. If not for the occasional lines of dialog used to lease its heavy atmospheric stone Modern Love could have been easily mistaken for a Sokurov film. Shot with a sixteenmm camera its washed-out color scheme is strangely evocative of the Russian director's reflective forays into human agony. Perhaps it in't a coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival where Modern Love had its premiere. Looking under the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals however reveals a slightly different picture - while Sokurov's films tend to remain painfully intimate, to a point where they intentionally detach the main protagonists from the surrounding environment by blurring everything into a large splash of the director's preferred yellow, Modern Love very much feeds off the Australian countryside. John's gradual psychological transformation is dependent on it and the more the story progresses the more it becomes obvious that nature was an integral part of Frayne's vision. In Sokurov's The Second Circle a young man returns to the Russian countryside to bury this deceased father. In the shack where the old man once lived everything is covered with dust. He gathers the few old clothes scattered around and places the body of this father in a coffin. Then the bids goodbye and buries it. The rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, the loneliness and dissatisfaction many were left dealing with. In Modern Love, somewhat ironically, love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary it is spain, loneliness, and dissatisfaction with ""modernity"" that suddenly invade John's life. Unlike The Second Circle however there the main protagonist has the opportunity to are-embrace this modern life. His wife and son await him, yet, the walks away. Slowly but surely the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing past. I doubt Frayne intended for Modern Love to be so strikingly similar to what Sokurov did in The Second Circle. Yet, the spacing, and in particular the puzzling framing, are precisely what transforms this film into a near meditative experience - a difficult and enormously brittle approach to deconstructing human psychology the two directors have mastered to perfection. Mark Constable delivers a top-notch performance as John adding even greater depth to this highly challenging character. His facial expressions are outstanding.

However, looking beneath the surface of this unique collage of heady images reveals a slightly different picture - while Sokurov's films tend to remain painfully intimate, to the point where they deliberately detach the main protagonists from their surroundings by making it all into one big splash of the director's preferred yellow, Modern Love draws heavily on the Australian landscape. John's gradual psychological transformation depends on it, and the further the story goes, the more it becomes clear that nature was an integral part of Frayne's vision. In Sokurov's The Second Circle, a young man returns to the Russian countryside to bury this late father. Everything is dusty in the hut where the old man once lived. He gathers up the few scattered old clothes and places this father's body in a coffin. Then he says goodbye and buries him. The rest of the film is a lengthy reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, the loneliness and discontent that many have struggled with. In Modern Love, ironically enough, love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary, it is Spain, loneliness and dissatisfaction with ""modernity"" that suddenly invade John's life. In contrast to The Second Circle, however, the main protagonist there has the opportunity to embrace this modern life. His wife and son are waiting for him, but the path goes away. Slowly but surely, the present begins to dissolve under the weight of a somewhat confusing past. I doubt Frayne intended Modern Love to be as strikingly similar to Sokurov in The Second Circle. But it is precisely the distances and especially the puzzling framing that make this film an almost meditative experience - a difficult and extremely brittle approach to deconstructing human psychology that the two directors have mastered perfectly. Mark Constable delivers a top-notch performance, while John adds depth to this extremely challenging character. His facial expressions are outstanding. Both Victoria Hill and William Traeger fit the tense visual style of their performance images perfectly.",positive
37215,"This film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called Grey Owl in one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys Canada. I found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'. It picks up late in Grey Owl's life and follows him through this most tumultuous and influential period. The film is about a Canadian Indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the over-trapped Beaver. He also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of Earth's resources. This is an outrageous concept in the one thousand, nine hundred and thirtys and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. The casting of Pierce Brosnan seems rather odd, but is not outrageous. Anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand. Brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent Bond films. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful scenery, for environmental causes. It is a movie for families as well, however children under ten (depending on maturity) would have trouble following the plot.",positive

This is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal. so I do understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought in. and enjoyed it immensely.

Most of the show is about this struggle with addiction and how the got this life back, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make this act like such an ass? At any rate, I was confused about how the show was put together, since it shows Brad at the height of this addiction. We see footage of him pan-handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine. I did't even know that was legal to show, but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that? Do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn this life around and give them some material for a good TV episode? At any rate, it is an enlightening show, because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict's indifference, although I have to admit that at the send it all seems a little too clean-cut. There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers there, everything has a little too much of a happily-ever-after feel at the send, and I have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life.

Here is this young guy who wins left and right cycling races and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks and, right after arriving, the insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes who has never lived and is generally callous and is rude to everyone in general. Understandably, he will soon be asked to leave. Most of the show is about that struggle with addiction and how he got that life back, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him at all, for this act to be such an ass? Anyway, I was confused about how the show was put together as it shows Brad at the height of that addiction. We see footage of him waving and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine. I didn't even know it was legal to show it, but why would a camera crew just follow him and film this? Are they doing this in the hope that this guy will turn this life around and give them material for a good TV episode? Either way, it's an insightful show as it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control they can take over people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to see because you can really see how much the families and friends are suffering from the addict's indifference, although I have to admit that it all seems a little too clean on sending. There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers there, everything has a little too much of a happy ending feeling on broadcast and I have a feeling that this is very rare in real life. Trotzdem ist es eine Show über Leute, die versuchen, anderen zu helfen, und über so etwas kann man sich nie zu sehr beschweren",positive
47635,"This episode apparently grew out of the cold war. There has been a holocaust but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through unscathed. It then becomes a battle for turf. She is attracted to him and vice versa, but the instinct for survival takes over. It's a quiet, slow moving, chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust. They come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again. Of course, the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive. But it still is captivating and interesting. Because she does't speak, we don't know there mind very well, but in the send we can guess.",positive

47667,"Well, I'll begin with this: I love horror-movies, not even the worst plot for the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present. Second; this is the worst movie of all times. It even beats Mean Guns, and the attack of the killer tomatoes. And for that I pay it homage. However, the involuntary humour was only funny until half the movie had passed, after which point everything was so so sad. To my great surprise, the reviews where somewhat divided; and you guys who rated this piece of C-movie-crap from seven and up; I KNOW YOU'RE JOKING! GOOD ONE!! HAHAHA! Because if there is any reason in the world, and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is; you can't be for real. Everything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up, so I'll leave it. MINOR SPOILER ALERTBut the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dog-kennel for ten minutes, with to so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two, really does it for me.",negative

48085,"Amazing, one of my favourite movies way down at the bottom. Guess I can take some pride in not liking what ""the general populace"" tends to go for. Jackie Mason is hilarious in this movie, and so's Randy Quaid. I can never get enough of this ""strong-arm"" tactics, just like in Moving. He was also notable in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Love that guy.",positive

48152,"Think of this film as fan service, a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer. We start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film. Flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins: The virginal Mandy Lane is coveted by every jock and nerd in her school, and gets invited to spend a weekend at a branch by three guys who think they can get lucky, and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size. So. you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night, who want to do nothing but have sex, do drugs and drink booze. The only other company is a chunky branch-hand who may for may not be suffering from Gulf War Syndrome. Hmm. potential future suspect maybe? So as you're probably ascertained by now, all the house-guests send up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways, and for a change the black man ISN'T the first to die. There are some conventions that still hold up though, like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field. Or the flights going out mysteriously in the evening as your 'heroes' unwisely separate to tackle the problem. Even down to the so-called shocking twist at the send, the movie is like an old eighty's horror updated for the noughties, and on this score it succeeds. Unfortunately, it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too, namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise. People get cut up, shot, bludgeoned etc but because of their innate gratefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations, it's hard to care as the bodies stack up. Someone gets murdered, one of their friends goes out to look for them alone, BANG they're brown bread. Rinse, then repeat. Maybe one day we'll get a screenplay with plausible, intelligent, likable characters who make rational decisions but still send up being outwitted by a genius killer. Until then, we have to tolerate teenagers with the I. Q of pond-life being picked off by a deranged hoodie. Oh well. four/ten",negative

49072,"I went into ""The Closer She Gets"" knowing that it was the story of the filmmaker's mother fighting cancer. I expected it to be a very harrowing, depressing movie. And although the subject matter is certainly emotionally wrenching, the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends. It shows a family's total dedication to meet the challenge of cancer together. They refuse to close faith in each other, even in the darkest moments. The most moving moments to me are when this faith is revealed. Little comments that the mother and the family make to each other that reveal her (and their) will to survive, and their defiant emphasis on love and family togetherness. In this way it is an uplifting and profoundly hopeful film. We should all be so lucky as to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness.",positive

49964,"I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything I would expect from a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie. Its campy and very funny. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. The plot is wacky, an American business man goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves/brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an sex-KGB turned cabbie. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge this death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent. The movie has all the great Bruce Campbell slap stick and humour. The movie is somewhat predictable, I knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer. However I did't go to see this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar winning script, I went to see it because it was a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie and I was not disappointed in the least. I highly recommend that you go see him on this book tour for wait and watch it on the sci-fi channel next month. Although before the movie the said the Sci-Fi channel did cut some of the movie out to make it TV friendly. If you are a fan of Bruce, I highly recommend it.",positive
