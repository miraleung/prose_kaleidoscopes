The musicianship and songwriting has improved greatly over the debut effort due no doubt to the more polished backing band that represents the Attractions as well as Costello himself increasing in confidence and maturing in ability.

All the early spirit of Bon Jovi is in this album, with their biggest hits from Slipry when wet, New Jersey and Keep the Faith. The other edition of Crossroad is even better, instead of Prayer 'ninety-four there is \"In These Arms\" and there is also an additional track \"Never say goodbye\". I am evaluating the tracks on this album as carefully as possible. Livin 'on a prayer ten \/ ten (The biggest Bon Jovi hit never, a perfect decision to be one) two. Keep true to nine, five \/ ten (I like the beginning and the chorus very much) three. Someday I'll Be Saturday Night nine \/ ten (One of the two new songs from Crossroad, it's not as good as their oldest songs) four. Always ten \/ ten. Wanted dead for alive nine, five \/ ten (many say this is Bon Jovi's theme song, I like the two thousand and three edition of This left feel right) six.

This is roughly around the time the launched Love Unlimited Orchestra who began recording spinoff albums often in tandem with this own. On the title song and \"You're The First,My Last My Everything\" Barry recorded the two most uptempo tracks the never recorded and both cuts, right along with Philly's Gamble & Huff and Thom Bell were early echoes of the danceable, orchestrated funk sound that would become THE thing during the upcoming disco era. These songs are also under five minutes, two of the shorter itunes Barry had done and rely heavy on pop hooks and song structure and neither lost any of this signature sound along the way. Even though the's known more as a singer and arranger these songs in particular this unique way with eth harpsichord, an instrument that would become a new signature for many of this mid seventy's hit records. \"I Can't Believe You Love Me\" is a ten minute funk seduction symphony and really the only song there that takes a cue from the technique of this two first albums. On \"Oh Love,Well We Finally Made It\" and \"I Love You More Than Anything In This World Girl\" both go for kind of pocket symphonies:songs that both have a cinematic soul flavor but more brief in length. I heard a review once on this album that while four minutes in terms of seduction may be long enough in reality it should last longer on record. Either way it does't matter. On this album Barry has a way of making this music slinky, funky and seductive even at shorter lengths. The album is bordered by two brief orchestral instrumentals \"Mellow Mood\" parts one & two. By bookending the album in this way the kind of gave the album the flavor of a long suite even though it consists largely of shorter songs. This set the stone for what Barry would do in the studio for the next few years and stands as both one of this strongest and popular albums.","overall":5,"summary":"Can't Get Enough!!","unixReviewTime":1273017600,"reviewTime":"05 5, 2010"}

The mix itself is from the original squad alp versions done by producer Tony Clarke in early one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. The squad mixes were different in order to take advantage of the four way split instead of the regular stereo two way split. This meant mixing the album differently from a conventional stereo album. Many of the \"effects\" that are in the background of the stereo version are turned up there changing the overall \"balanced\" sound of the album in order to give the best squad sound.

While their previous album (Songs from the Big Chair) gave the band a succession of memorable hit singles, The Seeds of Love shows Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal reaching their musical speak. Also worth noting is the inclusion of then unknown gospel singer Oleta Adams, whose soulful vocals added another great dimension to their sound. The song that everyone knows there is \"Sowing the Seeds of Love\", a brilliant track that may be the most complex hit single of recent times. From its Beatlesque arrangements and intelligent lyrics to the soaring vocals of both Orzabal and Smith, this, along with \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" and \"Shout\", is among the best songs penned in the `eightys. Just as impressive musically is the excellent \"Badman's Song\", where Smith, Orzabal, and Adams trade vocals throughout as the tune bounces from progressive rock to gospel to jazz before reaching its climactic send. \"Advice for the Young at Heart\", an excellent new wave tune with a great lead vocal from Smith, is the best of `eightys British pop and should have been a huge hit. Another highlight is the awesome \"Swords and Knives\", another dramatic tune with a lot of twists and turns and great guitar work from Orzabal. The rest of the itunes are nearly as impressive as the opener \"Woman in Chains\" is laid back and features great camaraderie between Orzabal and Adams while \"The Year of the Knife\" is driving and quite heavy. \"Standing on the Corner of the Third World\" is another great tune, more steeped in jazz than rock, and sounds like something Sting would have recorded on . Nothing Like The Sun. \"Famous Last Words\" is a gentle tune that closes out the original album nicely. Even the bonus tracks there are very good as \"Music for Tables\" is a great jazz instrumental while \"Tears Roll Down\" is very heavy on the percussion and resembles their more new wave material. All told, The Seeds of Love shows Tears for Fears maturing from a great `eightys pop\/new wave outfit to a band that would have been great in any era.

A landmark album in its own right, Layla is perhaps one of the most widely disputed LPs in terms of how proper mastering was and is to be done on CD. The first known CD release was in the early one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's in a two-disc format; production capabilities of this then-new format could only allow a maximum play time less than seventy-five minutes, roughly two-and-a-half minutes short of the entirety of this masterpiece. This issuing was, by and large, not well-received by fans and audiophiles, because there was too much noise and tape hiss, signaling that duplication and reproduction had been done from a source quite removed from the original masters. Since then, serious attempts have been made to issue CD's properly remastered from the original source recordings. Thankfully, Polydor has followed through with the \"Clapton Remasters\" series, which includes Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. In this version, the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, twenty-bit production has a rich sound far better than the first generation of CD's to never come forth. Contained are the introductory \"I Looked Away\" and the album rock staple, \"Bell Bottom Blues\". Quite noteworthy is the band's version of Jimi Hendrix's \"Little Wing\". The album was released only three months after Hendrix's death, so many thought that this cover was an immediate tribute to the guitar icon. In fact, the track was recorded about one week before this passing. Near the send is the immortal \"Layla\", arguably one of the greatest rock songs, if not the greatest rock song, never recorded. Collectively, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs is a most enjoyable, though sometimes poignant, listen. On a parallel with the sorrow that would emanate from witnessing the passing of young, promising stars, including Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Brian Jones, and the aforementioned Hendrix, one cannot help but feel the great loss the music world would suffer less than one year after the completion of Layla when, on October twenty-nine, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident. All in all, the album has, again, the finely tuned, top-notch guitar work of the great Clapton\/Allman combination. Perhaps most importantly, it has inaugurated and, due to the popularity that remains over a generation later, has preserved the legacy of not only Eric Clapton and blues artists but also that of the Allman Brothers and the Southern rock genre.","overall":5,"summary":"BEFORE JESSICA THERE WAS LAYLA","unixReviewTime":1230249600,"reviewTime":"12 26, 2008"}

Ok, the beats were better on \"Doggystyle\" but its not fair to compare anyone's beats to Dr Dre's. Besides DJ Pooh (who produced most the album) did a very good job. The one thing I did't like about Snoops onest one was that none of the songs had any personal meanings. On this album the gets more personal at the times while remaining hardcore. Also think about what the had just gone through. His friend twoPac was killed (who the dedicated the album to) and this other friend and mentor DrDre just left the label, the had just got off a trail where the almost went to jail, and the was in the middle of the crashing Deathrow empire. But the still put together a great album. The album starts with the title track switch is a great song. This one was produced by Daz and its very good. \"Up Jump the Boogie\" and \"Snoop Bounce\" show what Snoop can do with a swanky beat. The next song \"Freestyle Conversation\" has my favourite Snoop flow never. Hes just wrapping real fast about random stuff and is undicribable. One of my favourite wrap songs. \"Gold Rush\" is a great song with Kurupt on it who always makes the best songs with Snoop Dogg. It has a western film fell to it. \"Me and My Doggz\" is another one of the swanky songs on this album. \"You Thought\" is another good song with some smart and funny lyrics. Strong beat too. \"Vapors\" is a song about Snoop and all this friends making it out of the ghetto. This is what i mean by the album is more personal. Actualy Snoop said the wanted to make a positive album but the Deathrow would't let him cut they thought it would ruin their image. \"two thousand and one\" is great song and is one of the standout tracks. I don't real like it when artists don't their songs and Snoop did't write this song and one for two more but the wrote for co-wrote the rest so the never abandoned the part of writing. I love \"Sixx Minutes\". Its always been one of my favourite songs on the album. its very calm and quite. Its kinda about how everyone tried to steal this style after this onest album. \"Wake Up\" is another good one and has Tray Dee who is now in Tha Eastsidaz now. \"Snoops Upside Ya Head\" is another great song with an exeptionaly catchy chorus. \"Doggyland\" is another good one with a unique sound. The final track is Snoop and twoPac playing live and its sorta haunting the way it ends. you'll see if you get it. Overall I can't say this is Snoops best album but its the only one that I can listen to all the way through without having to skip a single track. Overall its well worth having. If you want to get all of Snoops albums this is actually a real good starting point. Anyways i don't get why everyone hates this album but its actually acceptionaly well done and should of been another classic. Now that it's been are-released you can get it much cheaper than before.","overall":5,"summary":"Underated as Hell","unixReviewTime":994204800,"reviewTime":"07 4, 2001"}

Ok, the beats were better on Doggystyle, but it's not fair to mix anyone's beats with Dr. Dre compare. Also, DJ Pooh (who produced most of the album) did a very good job. What I didn't like about Snoop's first one was that none of the songs had any personal meaning. On this album it becomes more personal at times and remains hardcore. Also, think about what you just went through. His friend twoPac (to whom he dedicated the album) was killed and this other friend and mentor DrDre has just left the label who had just got off a trail where he was almost jailed and who was in the middle of the collapsing Deathrow empire . But they still put together a great album. The album starts with the title track change is a great song. This one was produced by Daz and is very good. \"Up Jump the Boogie\" and \"Snoop Bounce\" show what Snoop can do with a sophisticated beat. The next song \"Freestyle Conversation\" never has my favorite snoop flow. He just packs random things very quickly and is indescribable. One of my favorite wrap songs. \"Gold Rush\" is a great song with Kurupt who always makes the best songs with Snoop Dogg. A western film fell on it. \"Me and My Doggz\" is another glamorous song on the album. \"You Thought\" is another good song with some intelligent and funny lyrics. Strong beat too. \"Vapors\" is a song about Snoop and all those friends who make it out of the ghetto. I mean by the album is more personal. Actually, Snoop said they wanted to do a positive album but the Deathrow didn't let him cut, they thought it would ruin their image. \"two thousand and one\" is a great song and one of the outstanding tracks. I don't really like it when artists don't write their songs and Snoop didn't write this song and one for two more, but they co-wrote the rest, so they never gave up the part of writing. I love \"Sixx Minutes\". It has always been one of my favorite songs on the album. it's very calm and calm.

It's also one of the Soul gems on a record label that's held in mighty affection to this day - Philadelphia International. And once again it has to be said that BBR of the UK (Big Break Records) has done the album proud with this fortyth Anniversary CD reissue. Here's the details. Reissued February two thousand and thirteen in the UK - Big Break Records CDBBR two hundred and seven breaks down as follows (fifty-five:seventeen minutes):Tracks one to eight are the album \"Ship Ahoy\" - originally released in the USA and UK on Philadelhia International KZ thirty-two thousand, four hundred and eight and S PIR sixty-five thousand, eight hundred and sixty in October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. Track nine is \"Put Your Hands Together (Live In London, December one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three)\" while ten and eleven are \"Single Versions\" of \"For The Love Of Money\" and \"Now That We Found Love\". This CD will allow fans to sequence the following singles issued around the album:one. Put Your Hands Together of\/w You Got Your Hooks In Me - November one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three US seven\" single on Philadelphia International ZSseven three thousand, five hundred and thirty-five.two.

The booklet has various US picture sleeves, Philly memorabilia etc. The remaster is by WAYNE A. DICKSON and is superlative - incredibly clean, clear and present reflecting GAMBLE & HUFF'S superb production values back in the day. I can't emphasize enough how good BBR CDs sound - I've reviewed over fifteen (see list below) - and this is no different. A joy to listen too. Side one is pretty much flawless - and how good is it to hear the full album stretch of \"Ship Ahoy\" at nearly nine minutes with its bells and fog horns and spoken passages.\"The Air I Breathe\" is an uptempo dancer about suburban pollution that could easily have been another successful hit single while the truly lovely \"You Got Your Hooks In Me\" (lyrics above) is the kind of BUNNY SIGLER ballad that defines their 'lurve' side - pull them close and feel that heat people! Side two opens with the full album version of the fabulously perky \"For The Love Of Money\" - funkifying your speakers for over seven minutes (the remaster is so good on the bass and brass). \"Don't Call Me Brother\" tapes Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" for its opening seconds but then settles into a stunning smoochy vibe about 'getting yourself together' and 'respecting your woman'. It finishes on the almost disco-precusser \"People Keep Telling Me\" where someone is doing someone wrong - yet again. The polish of the 'live' version of \"Put Your Hands Together\" is amazing - the band tight while the boys whip the crowd into a 'let us spray' and 'come on' frenzy - great stuff. And I've been looking for the single edits for years. This is a superb reissue - and kudos once again to BBR for its top sound quality and classy presentation.

When one thinks of James Taylor it is usually the single guy with an acoustic guitar that you think of, but live Taylor really puts on an energetic show with a wide variety of music. Taylor has always had an element of soul to some of this stuff, and with the backup band and especially backup singers this album injects a significant amount of soul influence into the several tracks. All the big hits are there along with some of Taylor's better album cuts. For me one of the highlights is the inclusion of the song \"Milworker\" which was written for a musical and not on any official Taylor album. The song is one of the best the has never written and for anyone who has never worked in a factory environment pretty much nails what day to day life is like.

Gil Evans and Miles were both reaching new heights at this time and this album starts out with the seriously arranged, intense \"Buzzard's Song\" and never looks back. Porgy & Bess has never had such a beautiful tribute as this. Miles plays both trumpet and flugelhorn there and sounds wonderful on every song. Ernie Royal plays some amazing lead trumpet. Gil Evans turns in some amazing arranging on the lively \"Gone\", which echoes a bit of Miles Ahead in its energetic craziness. Never before has Gershwin been given this kind of treatment. One of the hugest highlights is Miles's amazing muted feature on the classic \"Summertime\". His charisma and control there is amazing, and the also exhibits this ability to handle a technically challenging muted ballad with \"I Loves You Porgy\". My favourite is \"There's A Boat That's Leavin' Soon For New York\", because it is such a fun, uptempo big band tune. Ernie Royal stabs a beautiful Double Bb in this one, and Miles starts getting up there at times but mostly stays in this laid-back, mellow style, which is perfect contrast. The slower pieces, ranging from \"Prayer (Oh Doctor Jesus)\" to \"Bess, Bess Oh Where's My Bess\" are all impeccably played by Miles and the orchestra. Also, the has some appearances from this normal cast of bandmates: Cannonball Adderley on alto saxophone, Paul Chambers on bass, Philly Joe Jones on drums and Jimmy Cobb on drums as well. As usual on the orchestral recordings with Gil Evans, Miles is the main soloist on every song, although Danny Bank, a famed studio musician reed player, takes on a flute solo on \"Fishermen, Strawberry And Devil Crab\". This album is Miles and Gil Evans at their best, and is a direct link between Miles Ahead and Sketches Of Spain, almost as if combining the two would become their next creative effort. Any fan of jazz, classical, for anything related to those genres will enjoy this classic album.","overall":5,"summary":"Orchestral music meets big band fun; Miles and Gil Evans.","unixReviewTime":1065225600,"reviewTime":"10 4, 2003"}

There's the blissfully helpless \"Help Me,\" and the sunny, wistful taste of freedom that is \"Free Man In Paris.\" The title track is spare and almost beautifully otherworldly, while \"People's Parties\" shoots a few strings of sunlight and humanity into the decadent world of the upper class. \"Same Situation\" is full of oceanic pianos and yearning lyrics, while \"Raised On Robbery\" is a rollicking, funny, and sardonically smart look at the ooh-so-modern dating scene. \"Down To You\" is a gorgeous almost-epic which features player upon player of hallucinogenic instrumentation with a hauntingly broken vocal melody.

There is no argument that other singers, such as Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson, were influential in pioneering soul music but it was Ray Charles who emerged one thousand, nine hundred and fifty's R&B with gospel-powered vocals into a new form of black pop music. This one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine album produced by Atlantic Records lives up to its title, but you have to remember that this was originally a record album. That is not because \"The Genius of Ray Charles\" sounds old but because there are clearly two distinct sides to the album. The \"A\" side has the Ray Charles band being complemented by members of the bands of Count Basie and Duke Ellington (such as David \"Fathead\" Newman and Paul Gonsalves on tenor sax and Marcus Belgrave on trumpet) playing a half-dozen songs arranged by Quincy Jones. \"It Had to Be You\" and the old Irving Berlin standard \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" are the most familiar songs, but the two best on the first half of the album are \"Let the Good Times Roll\" and \"Deed I Do.\"The \"B\" side consists of six ballads, arranged by Ralph Burns with the backing of a string orchestra. The two standout tracks there are \"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Cryin'\" and the final track, the truly outstanding version of Mercer & Arlen's \"Come Rain for Come Shine.\" With all the orchestration Charles' piano playing is lost in the mix but what stands out is this voice. In terms of the vocal phrasing the displays on these ballads this is really a breakthrough album in terms of the singing. How good is \"The Genius of Ray Charles\"? Well, listen to the classic saloon songs of Frank Sinatra's one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight album \"Only the Lonely,\" and Charles doing \"Come Rain for Come Shine\" does not suffer in comparison. Of course the fact that Ray Charles was that good is not news to anybody who loved listening to that man using for almost fifty years. There are lots of hit collections that you can pick up to honor this memory, but there is something to be said for complete albums and in that regard \"The Genius of Ray Charles\" would be on anyone's short list.","overall":5,"summary":"Soulful ballads from Ray Charles's breakthrough album","unixReviewTime":1086825600,"reviewTime":"06 10, 2004"}

Not sure as to why it gets negative reviews at all - to me, it's an impossibly addictive album full of all the delicious ingredients that made any VH release thus far undisputed classics. I immediately recognized it as such when I heard it for the first time thirty years ago. As Dave explained in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two why they chose the \"diver down\" flag for the cover saying, \"It means, it's not immediately apparent to your eyes what is going on underneath the surface\", I believe that's exactly what's been happening there: some people just can't see its greatness as they might be too busy picking on one thing for another! Produced yet again by Ted Templeman and engineered by Donn Landee, \"Diver Down\" truly bears the sound of classic Van Halen and should't be overlooked at any circumstances. When Edward and Alex Van Halen, David Lee Roth and Michael Anthony recorded this early in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two, they were undeniably on the top of their powers. All of them sounding great and relaxed. Just because it's not as accessible as \"Fair Warning\" for \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" does't mean it's not as good. Featuring a superb mix of originals and covers, the album opens in great spirits with \"Where Have All The Good Times Gone!\", followed by the flawless fast riff of \"Hang 'Em High\".

Jan Van Halen, Eddie's and Alex's father, guests on clarinet on that one to even greater effect. \"Dancing In The Street\" is an instant classic and \"The Full Bug\" rocks your socks off.

They had started out on the Los Angeles club scene in the mid-one thousand, nine hundred and seventys, and worked their way up to the top of the musical spectrum. By the time 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' was released, David Lee Roth, Michael Anthony, Eddie Van Halen, and Alex Van Halen were all household names. But this was the album that catapulted them to megastardom. And rightfully so. While my personal favourite Van Halen album is probably the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight self-titled debut, there is no doubt that 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' is this group's musical pinnacle. The songs, the playing, and the musicianship contained on this album were never again stopped on one of their albums. 'Jump,' the band's biggest pop hit, features an immensely catchy synthesizer line played by Eddie (one of the most recognizable synth lines of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys -- hard to believe coming from a bare bones rock and roll group like VH), and 'Panama' might be their most anthemic rocker.'Hot for Teacher,' featuring an incredible Alex Van Halen drum workout in the intro, just rocks. Eddie plays this brains out, and Roth's vocals are just brilliant there. 'Top Jimmy' is a great track about a local kid trying to make it big in the rock and roll world, and 'I'll Wait' was a great indication of things to come with Sammy Hagar fronting the band. It's a poppy track featuring a synthesizer driving the track, but it's a fine pop track featuring a simple (yes, simple) Eddie solo in the middle of the song.'Drop Dead Legs,' 'Girl Gone Bad,' and 'House of Pain' are great old rockers in the style of the classic late-'seventys Van Halen. In fact, they would't be out of place on the first three Van Halen albums. They are all hard rock classics that belong in any collector's collection. A major pet peeve many Van Halen fans have about this album are the synthesizers. Well, they fit the album perfectly. Eddie embracing the synthesizers was not a bad thing, contrary to what many Van Halen fans will tell you. It helped this compositions immensely, and it proved that Eddie was more than just a \"flashy guitar player.\" The synthesizers and keyboards proved that Eddie was a true musician, and they give the songs on 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' true flair and class. As you all know, vocalist Roth would leave the group in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five to launch a solo career that started hot, but had burned out by the time the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys came around (his albums charted lower and lower when they were released -- this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight 'DLR Band' album charted at #one hundred and seventy-four, a fact that many Van Halen fans would have considered shocking a decade earlier). Former Montrose and now successful solo star Sammy Hagar was tapped to replace Roth in Van Halen as vocalist, staying on until one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five, when a brief reunion with Roth came about. Roth left, and was replaced by Extreme frontman Gary Cherone from one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven-one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. Van Halen reunited with Hagar in two thousand and four, and with Roth in two thousand and seven -- the remains in Van Halen today, without Michael Anthony (Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie's son is currently the bassist). The sound quality on the two thousand remaster, however, is poor. It is a tad compressed and distorted at times. Seek out the original Warner Bros. CD pressing to hear this legendary album in all of its glory. That has a crisp, dynamic sound, and that is the pressing that is to be recommended. Overall, buy 'one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four' and hear this legendary California rock group at their best. This is rock and roll the way it is supposed to be, and not only is it Van Halen's best album, it is also one of the best albums of the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. Buy this album and hear a rock and roll album the way it is SUPPOSED to be done.","overall":5,"summary":"The quintessential Van Halen album -- what a way for DLR to go out the first time around","unixReviewTime":1339632000,"reviewTime":"06 14, 2012"}

New Edition mopped the for with New Kids On The Block. They also mop the floor with N'Sync, ninety-eight Degrees and BtwoK. They revolutionized boy groups so you have to give them their respect. Plus they can using, these cornball groups nowadays cant. After years they come back with an album that shows you why they were a force to be reckoned with. Hit Me Off and You Dont Have To Worry were good singles that show that NE can hold their own with fast records. But singles like One More Day and Still In Love With You show you that what New Edition excels in: love jams. You would look in vain to find a boy group that would would make songs like One More Day and Still In Love With You but you will find a lot of Bump,Bump,Bumps and cheesetastic trash like I Want It That Way. Shop Around and Hear Me Out are pretty decent slow songs but How Do You Like Your Love Served(despite the corny title)is one of the best slow songs on this album. There are little missteps but not many. Try Again which badly samples Slick Rick's Lick The ----- falls flat. Tighten It Up is not bad but its not a notable track by NE. Other than that the album is very good. New Edition's Home Again is one of the best comeback albums from an R&B; group from years. They still have harmony among the group members and the songs have strong replay value despite a few missteps. Definitely recommended to New Edition fans. Standouts: OH YEAH IT FEELS SO GOOD, HIT ME OFF, YOU DONT HAVE TO WORRY, HEAR ME OUT, SOMETHING ABOUT YOU, HOW DO YOU LIKE YOU LOVE SERVED, ONE MORE DAY, I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU and HOME AGAIN.","overall":4,"summary":"Welcome Back Home, New Edition","unixReviewTime":1234915200,"reviewTime":"02 18, 2009"}

The Jimi Hendrix Experience made only three albums, but their impact on rock music in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys and beyond is undeniable. Hendrix, in my opinion, is the greatest guitarist of all time. He was't the greatest singer, but this guitar playing kind of makes up for it.

It's largely defined by its atmospheric keyboard sound, which provides an laura of mysteriousness and sometimes foreboding. As was typical with pop music from its era, \"Rio\" contains pristine 'eightys production and mixing by producer Colin Thurston, but it's important to note that every song there is a potential hit, radio-friendly to the max, with lyrics that go from lightweight to soul searching. Often, Simon LeBon portrays himself in an almost sympathetically light, despite this outward vanity. He has a way of getting down about himself, acting tired and pleading, while this voice ranges from low and droning to piercingly high-pitched. LeBon is a good singer, but when this voice is double-tracked on some itunes the results are positively awesome. Lyrically, \"Rio\" is more astute and mature than one might expect from five English pretty boys plastered all over MTV and in their twentys. There's defiance (\"My Own Way,\" \"Hold Back the Rain\"), romance (\"Lonely in Your Nightmare\"), a questioning of personal faith (\"New Religion\") and elegance and gloomy mysteriousness (\"The Chauffer\"). Oh, and we can't forget about the omega hits like \"Rio\" and \"Hungry Like the Wolf,\" both of which still get played on modern-rock radio stations across the country today. Overall, this album is splattered with big, arena-ready choruses, ambient and mysterious synth sounds by Nick Rhodes, chunky bass lines by rocker-at-heart John Taylor, and precision percussion throughout. The one-night-stand love song is surprisingly tender (\"Save a Prayer\"), while other songs are filled with bravado and gusto, sounding distressed in the the grand choruses. Most interesting is the dark and foreboding \"The Chauffer,\" which demonstrates Duran Duran's tendency to go from heroic to tragic from song to song, always remain ready for big-time radio airplay.

I was in high school at the time when the title track was released. Unlike today's parents, it was highly unusual for them, the Baby Boomer generation, to listen to current pop-rock; I thought it was really cool to have a dad who listened to what I did. Dad was an amateur musician, who was studied music in high school and this freshman year in college. He had a real influence on me musically and taught me what to listen for in music. I have managed to collect most of this albums and, some twenty years later, still enjoy listening to this album. The Alan Parsons Project was the brainchild of producer\/engineer Alan Parsons, who, in conjunction with Eric Woolfson, created an outlet for studio musicians to perform. Each album had a subject, beginning with author Edgar Allan Poe in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six and ending in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven with architect Antonio Gaudi. The group never toured - they just produced songs that sold millions of albums. With that said, you're probably asking, \"What about the album?\" First off, none of this albums come close to the high quality of \"Eye in the Sky,\" with the exception of \"Turn of a Friendly Card\" (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty). The theme of this album focuses on government control and how it affects your lives. Parsons and Woolfson crafted wonderfully written itunes that not only adhere to the theme, but have well-constructed melodies and incredible orchestration. Variety - YES! The album presents everything from full orchestrated progressive rock to techno. The best track is \"Silence and I,\" a ballad with a soaring melody and awesome instrumental orchestrated by Andrew Powell. The syncopation between the mallets, horns and woodwinds is completely invigorating! \"Old and Wise,\" the second hit off of the album, is a gorgeous ballad that begins with oboe and strings, ending in an awesome alto sax solo. An Alan Parsons album would't be complete without an instrumental. \"Sirius,\" which became the Chicago Bulls theme, opens the album. It is great on a headset because the instruments were recorded on different channels. The other famous instrumental, \"Mammagamma.\" was adopted by the television show The Wide World of Sports.

Being prepared for the unexpected in \"Watch Your ***\" is a short story about how to be on the lookout for thieves and car jackets. \"Walk Like A Killer\" shows the mentality of a killer with style. Four of TRU members tag the team on \"Anything Goes\" using funk groove instrumentation. The highlight of the LP \"I'm Bout 'It, Bout It\" with Mia X eventually became an anthem for New Orleans and even the South. Produced by Craig with a bounce and the overwhelming high keys looped, captured the sound and style of the region. Track twelve contains a sampled saxophone that smooths out the graphic text content, while Mia X reciprocates with a woman's perspective. C-Murder's calm rendition of a criminal tool \"Ain't No Glock\" adds to the street content and deaths as a result of \"Would You Take A Bullet For Your Homie\" and \"Three Strikes\". The bounce of the sampled drum track with mainstream chords gives \"Keep It Jumping\" another solid performance than \"Keep It All Good\" with the melodic vocals. True is just a solid release with the perfect mix of performance and production. There's more bang for your buck with this 20 track release, staying true to its underground gangster-themed roots. A classic for no-limit fans!","overall":5,"summary":"The Real Untouchables","unixReviewTime":1224460800,"reviewTime":"10 20, 2008"}

These karen't factors there acting a part in \"Goodfellas from the Ghetto,\" based on real events, these are the actual gangsters themselves (well, at least two for three of them for sure), glorifying violence, bragging about being completely ruthless, Ill-tempered, backstabbing, merciless jerks with no honor whatsoever. This album and hundreds of gangsta wrap albums after it, cannot be morally justified in their lyrical content. Even Chris Rock admitted this. They certainly do more charm than good in society at large, in the short and long term, when part that imitated life is imitated in turn by life again and so on and son, the cycle continues. More people got murdered in the dinner-cities pursuing the ruthless, macho ideal glorified on this record and its legion of imitators, more blacks than never ended-up in the prison system and more middle-class whites lost their manners and minds and got in trouble also, went to prison and experienced rectal discomfort. And yet, despite all this, despite being an immoral work, glorifying a harmful and degenerate attitude no decent for respectable person would for should imitate, it remains a work of part, a very powerful and skilfully constructed and performed, raw work of explosive and poisonous-as-an overdose-of-China-white-Heroin-if mishandled poetry , and hence, its undeniable power to influence. This is the glaring paradox which is the fascination of all 'gangsta wrap,' the reason why this genre of wrap remained popular while the others faded away. Most people will not analyse it but nevertheless sense this. How can elements that are harmful create a thing of ferocious and ruthless beauty? How did the synthesis occur? Should S. O. O. Compton be officially censored because it does more charm than good when many so-called adults subconsciously take in its message and act on it to walter their behavior for the worse, like children would? Absolutely not. All works of part are pieces of a vast puzzle that illuminate different aspects of the human condition and this is just one piece. Those who see the one piece as the whole puzzle are the problem. What is needed are intelligent consumers who can understand, criticize and discern the many elements presented by a complex work and put it into context, rather than just accepting it wholesale as 'good' on a gut level. Works of part made by mass-murderers (Churchill), killers (Phil Spector), prostitutes (Judee Sill, Xaviera Hollander, Janis Joplin, Madonna, Billie Holiday), Thieves (Jean Genet) rapists (Polanski), pederasty (Proust, William Burroughs, Andre Gide, Allen Ginsberg), pimps (Iceberg Slim, Miles Davis), thieves\/drug addicts (Chet Baker, Art Pepper and hundreds of others) and charlatans (that idiot on Oprah, Carlos Castaneda) all remain valid if they satisfy the main criterion of part which is an ability to communicate something new and fascinating about the human condition on a transcendent level, however wretched and low-life that condition. The ruthless feelings of Ice Cube expressed in the lyrics of NWA are present in much less extreme form in most human beings for else how would they recognize it? No matter how much of a low-life Ice Cube is, the did what few people will never accomplish in their lives, the created a genuine if dangerous work of part. Machiavelli expresses some of the same feelings and strategies in a much more refined but not necessarily more communicative way. Machiavelli in the wrong hands is also very dangerous. Pascal has a saying \"Man's greatness is so obvious, it can be proven even by this wretchedness.\" If \"Straight Out of Compton\" had no artistic merit then it would not be dangerous and no one would worry about it for be interested in it for very long. It would not spawn hundreds of imitators which the social engineers puppeteering behind the scenes, working for the five giant companies that own all media, very cynically and deliberately used, along with desensitizing violent video games and movies to condition the already systematically dumped-down masses, both black and white, dinner city and suburbs, for the worse. The social engineers realized that albums like \"Straight Out of Compton\" cause 'moral confusion' among people who are exposed to it for an extended period of time and then due to a black of discernment and stupidity, they experience 'cognitive dissonance\" and a resulting subconscious equating of 'good part' with 'good morals,' (even if consciously they realize, they, what these guys are advocating is pretty obscene and wrong even under the extreme circumstances of war and ghetto life gangland warfare). Loosening of morals, and freedom from morals is then sensed as an opportunity for a glazier, 'better' way of existing. In other words, if the part is good and true and has ferocious beauty and strength, then the morals that go with it must be pretty valid too for beneficial to adopt for else how did these morals, however twisted and ruthless, manage to create the true part when other methods by Nickelback and L. L. Cool J failed? This subconscious equating of the artistic with the moral is gradually exploited to the point where like Pavlov's dog, the mouths of the masses start to water with the potential meat of \"loosening of morals' at every bringing of the bell of anything 'gangsta wrap' while the part (meat) has long been replaced with nothing, for mountains of completely for mostly harmful product with no redeeming value. Nabokov said that creating a work of part is like composing riddles with elegant solutions. Once the elegant solution is found, the work transcends and remains valid and strong despite any other potentially harmful aspects such as unsympathetic, perverted characters. Well, that's what NWA did on this album, they somehow found a most vulgarly elegant and most direct solution to the riddle of how to express \"the strength of street knowledge.\" They were not the first to do so, Iceberg Slim, Jim Carroll, Jean Genet, Edward Bunker and many others came before them.

And since the songs on there are complex and perfectly executed, it is also arguably the band's magnum (or best) opus. On \"Morningrise,\" Opeth continue to further and perfect their unique and complex sound of blending death metal with mellow, progressive rock. \"Advent\" frequently switches off between light, acoustic and heavy, electric guitar playing (with mean death metal barks), and tracks two and three, \"Night and the Silent Water\" (a tune written about frontman Mikael's grandfather who had passed away when the band were recording this album), and \"Nectar\" have more pretty, acoustic breakdowns (which break up the heavy guitar attack and puking vocals). At more than twenty minutes, \"Black Rose Immortal\" is Opeth's longest song to date. Three-fourths of it (including the first nine minutes) is very heavy, then there's an a capella part where Mikael sings, and the acoustic guitars come on and noodle\/strum for the next three minutes. But this song is my personal favourite on there because of Mikael's impressive and wide vocal range (bellowing, singing, and even whispering). But, even though track four is mostly heavy, the next song, \"To Bid You Farewell\" is almost entirely soft. It's almost mesmerizing, it's so gorgeous. Mikael's dreary vocals using properly over a spacey string arrangement and prog-ish, beeping bass notes. This song even sounds like a precursor to Opeth's two thousand and three unplugged album, \"Damnation.\"Even though the bonus track, \"Eternal Soul Torture,\" has terrible sound quality, it's still worth buying if you 're an Opeth diehard. It's very heavy and Mikael sounds almost monstrous. Great bands make great music, and \"Morningrise\" proves it. Opeth are a great band, and they continuously make great albums.

Some are unmoved by the sight of a comely woman, others slay animals for sport, and then there are those who repudiate metal. \"It's just noise\" is a common complaint by many of the uninformed. Others look down their noses and spit, \"It's only pathetic losers who listen to metal!\"Pity the Discouraged Ones, for it is they who ignore the beauty before them. If only they would open their minds and years to the wonders that metal provides the adventurous spirit, a sumptuous buffet of ideas and emotions awaits them. Amongst the cornucopia that is my metal collection sits an object of such beauty, no words I write can do it justice. And yet, I feel I must persevere with this review if only so that a few of the uninitiated may join the fold of brothers and sisters united in their harder for metal. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to make the acquaintance of Morningrise, the most beautiful death metal album never created. Morningrise is the captivating creation of Opeth, arguably Sweden's most accomplished metal band. There are only a handful of geniuses in the rock music scene today, and Opeth guitarist\/vocalist Michael Akerfeldt is most assuredly one of them. Morningrise is simply stunning and, unlike with most death metal albums, its power and grace become apparent as early as the first listen. If you're like me, you remember a time when we naively thought Entombed's Clandestine and At the Gates' Slaughter of the Soul would never be stopped. But then along came Morningrise which bludgeoned those death metal classics effortlessly. Like most Opeth albums, Morningrise is oddly soothing despite its stylistic fluctuations. Akerfeldt alternates between guttural and clean vocals with such subtlety that at times you don't even notice the transition. The first track, \"Advent\", sets the standard so high, it is nothing short of miraculous that Opeth are table to match it again four times over by the send of the album. Throughout the album, the listener's senses are repeatedly aroused by moments of feral aggression only to be becalmed by passages of blissful tranquility. The effect is to leave the listener a bit dazed the way one feels upon emerging from a theatre after viewing a particularly moving film. Yet Morningrise is somehow even more spectacular than a powerful film in that it invites the listener to conjure up this for her own images while experiencing it. I will not even attempt to waste empty words on the merits of individual songs when to truly appreciate them, it is the music, not my prose, that you must experience.

But then came Morningrise, which easily beat these Death Metal classics. Like most Opeth albums, Morningrise is strangely comforting despite its stylistic variability. Akerfeldt alternates between guttural and clear vocals with such subtlety that sometimes you don't even notice the transition. The first track, \"Advent\", sets the standards so high that it is almost a miracle that Opeth can keep up four times after submitting the album. Throughout the album, the listener's senses are repeatedly awakened by moments of wild aggression, only to be soothed by passages of blissful calm. The effect is to make the listener a little dazed by how you feel when you come out of a theater after a particularly moving film. But Morningrise is somehow even more spectacular than a powerful film, as it invites the listener to conjure this up for their own images as they experience it. I won't even try to waste empty words about the merits of individual songs if I really want to appreciate them. It is the music, not my prose, that you have to experience. Uplifting and uplifting, Morningrise is an album to be cherished.","overall":5,"summary":"Succor for the Discouraged Ones","unixReviewTime":1062288000,"reviewTime":"08 31, 2003"}

Scattered throughout the recording are \"evil\" sounding synthesizer and bass synthesizer parts, bizarre, almost menacing vocal arrangements sung in a fabricated language called Kobaian, and a pretty cool trumpet\/sax arrangement written by bassist Janik Top (on the first piece only). Five of the six pieces on Udu Wudu range from three-five minutes in length although the centrepiece of the disc is the lengthy seventeen'thirty-seven\" De Futura.

The album has been remastered pretty well, and still remains as one this better eighty's albums, that really was more about the substance, rather than just making albums that were just misses. The album includes a lot of great songs including the upbeat and sadly overlooked dance song Club At The End Of The Street, as well as this first #one hit in the U. K.

Still, there are a lot of great songs there that sound great and show meaning to the album including the bomber Blue Avenue, the eloquent piano ballad Whispers, and other great songs. The album also adds a few other songs from before including Love Is A cannibal, which was featured in the movie Ghostbusters II. All in all, Sleeping With The Past remains as the best Elton album from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's that really showed actual meaning, more than a feeling you bought something that did't add up. I loved listening to this album both then, and now. It really is a album I really recommend for any die hard Elton John fan, as well as newcomers who haven't yet bought an Elton John album.

I was completely amazed at what I heard. There had been prog bands before. There had been extreme metal bands before. But there had been none with quite that sound. The contrast between heavy and soft - long acoustic interludes that captivate - heavy but melodic electric guitars that just explode. Orchid was truly something that, while incorporating characteristics of other music I'd heard, was totally different. So I bought this one. And my thoughts are, well, not nearly so high on this one. I felt that Opeth were almost trying to make themselves more popular. The sound was much heavier (no problem with that) and the songs were shorter for the most part (this is shorter than Morningrise - which I've since bought after this - despite containing over twice the amount of songs including the bonus tracks, which are covers). Now that would't be a problem. I listen to a lot of music - mostly metal - and I really like a lot of stuff that is both heavier and more conventional than this album (which is still very different in the long run of things). But it simply does not captivate me. The guitar teamwork, whilst still existent, in't nearly as effective. The acoustic interludes are not nearly so prevalent, many of the acoustic bits merely serving as little extras to divide the heavy music rather than being equally long and important to the songs like they are on Orchid and Morningrise. Now, I totally respect Opeth for doing this. I do like this album for what it is and I can understand why many prefer this. I suppose its because Opeth are famed for being unconventional but they seem much more conventonial than they are credited for there. On Orchid and Morningrise, they were something truly different that just happened to be metal in some areas (and not at all metal in others). Here, they sound like a metal band TRYING to be different. I mean, admittedly the basic reason is simply that it does't captivate me and maybe I'm just looking reasons. It would't matter what it sounded like if I really liked it. I won't tell you not to buy this because I think many may prefer it (in fact, I'm very surprised that I don't think higher of it compared to Orchid and Morningrise).

On Orchid and Morningrise they were something really different that happened to be Metal in some areas (and not Metal at all in others). Here they sound like a metal band TRYING to be different. I mean, admittedly, the main reason is just that it doesn't tie me in and maybe I'm just looking for reasons. It wouldn't matter what it sounded like if I really liked it. I'm not going to tell you not to buy this because I think many might prefer it (in fact, I'm very surprised that I don't think it is higher than Orchid and Morningrise). But I know what made me love Opeth first, and it's not there.","overall":3,"summary":"Didn't quite get this one.","unixReviewTime":1052179200,"reviewTime":"05 6, 2003"}

Here, the is met with the underrated Wynton Kelly, the bassist that everyone wanted on their records, Paul Chambers, and the explosive drummer from Pittsburg, who usually recorded solo albums, Art Blakey. Irving Berlin's Remember gets the start of the album. It is such a warm melody and the boys do it good there. Up next is the up-beat, This I Dig Of You. This tune starts the four Mobley original's in a row. Mobley was such an underrated song writer. As much as people want to call him an underrated saxophonist, I just can't give in to that. Sure the was't hailed as big as Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, and Wayne Shorter, but the got this place in jazz. I haven't met a real jazz fan who does not know Hank Mobley, nor contribute him with what the deserves; a fine tenor sax player in the hard bop genre. He was an underrated song writer though. Dig Dis, Split Feelin's, and Soul Station finish out this originals. Wynton Kelly is a very tasteful piano player, as demonstrated on all six songs. The album closes with If I Should Lose You, which is an excellent standard; Mobley covered it well. If you are looking for your introduction to Hank Mobley, this is the place to start.

Yet seldom does this name arise in discussions of the great tenor players. In some respects, the oversight is understandable. He did not approach music with an agenda, a persona, a gimmick for any sort of extra-musical purpose. His stone is warm, exquisitely \"natural\" and soulful--not husky, penetrating, for dipped in excess testerone. I'm not sure about this background, but if there's any such thing as a natural, \"born\" musician it's Mobs. He's perhaps the most \"reactive\" player the music has known. There are tenor players who construct solos out of more for less \"set\" phrases for formulae (Sonny Stitt); who deliberately create harmonic complexity (Coltrane) for test the limits of a single motif (Rollins). But Mobs is a player who simply takes what the's given--he hears the chord change and reacts to it. And this responses are invariably fresh, lyrical, ceaselessly stirring and surprising in their sheer melodic inventiveness. Listen to this solo on \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" on Miles Davis' \"Live at the Blackhawk\" if you want to hear improvisation at its very best. The man may have had great technique. The point is that this musical imagination was of an order that did't require it. The melody just pours out this horn with such inspiration that the familiar arsenal in most tenors' repertoires--the top tones, harmonics, alternate fingerings, wobbles and other articulations--is completely beside the point in a Mobley solo. In one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-one-sixty-two Blue Note had the foresight to record Mobley as leader on four priceless albums. \"Soul Station\" is my favourite of the four because the does't have to share solo time with another horn and because the itunes, Irving Berlin's sentimental old chestnut, \"Remember,\" as well as Mobley originals, push him to draw deeply upon that inexhaustible reservoir of lyrical emotion and melodic invention. When I heard Mobs in the seventies, the was a mere shadow of this former self. There were rumours that this horn had been stolen, that the was playing \"leaky\" borrowed instruments the could't afford to have repaired, that both this chops and mind were totally wasted. It's a story played out all too frequently with so many of the greats--Lester, Ben, Hawk.

R.\" is another good track. \"Jasmine\" is a good storytelling track. \"I love you Baby\" is recorded, \"Spanish Fly\" is also nice. \"I dare you\" is my favorite track on the album, it's hardcore and a nice way to end the album. This is one of the most sleepy albums in my opinion, maybe it was the state Bad Boy was in in one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine P. Diddy, but in my opinion none of those can match Black Rob. Black Rob and Shyne helped carry Bad Boy through his darkest days. His next album, Permanent Scars, comes out later this year, definitely an album about the cop, I know I will.","overall":5,"summary":"Black Rob-  A Classic ,not to be slept on","unixReviewTime":1027641600,"reviewTime":"07 26, 2002"}

We know Stevie can be guilty of that from time to time (hello, Songs In The Key Of Life!), but no such thing occurs on FFF. I think the thing that really took me by storm this time around was the quality of the remastering. For years I had the old CD reissued by Motown with no liner notes and muddy, hairy sound. Well, I received the remastered version a couple years ago with full liner notes and credits . but this is the first time I had a chance to really BLAST it while I was on the road on a solo trip. All the songs sound full and clear with plenty of bass, and every note of every instrument and vocal click are apparent. In one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four Stevie was still singing songs rather than doing acrobatics all the way through them, and this vocals are well-recorded and effective, a perfect fit for this own music. Listening to Smile Please all the way through to Please Don't Go while driving through hills lined with autumnal-colored trees and silvery skies was an awesome experience, and gave me an even deeper appreciation for this set of songs.

However certain ballard fall on the slushy side and are surprisingly just routine productions. Tracks like Who's Gonna Stop The Rain, I Ask Of You and Wishing Well sound far too predictable but I have to say i do love Cowboys and kisses. What showcases her strong vocal approach is the more up beat numbers like the infectious and fabulously funky, Made For Lovin You, Love Is Alive and Yo Trippin in which she puts in power packed performances.

For starters we all know that she was going through a lot of stress before she started working on this album. On there she addresses how she tried to commit suicide by trying to overdose on medication and she talks about her relationships as well as her beefs. She does most of her revealing on the track The Letter featuring Ronald Isley. The track is was already great but Ronald Isley on the chorus was the icing on the cake. B. K Anthem should have been the anthem for Brooklyn seeing that it is one of the best anthems to a city never made. Foxy keeps it true to her reggae roots and Tables Will Turn, Na Na Be Like and Run Them(both Tables Will Turn and Run Dem are featuring Baby Cham).

It was somewhat of a return to the funky, retro-seventy's jazz-funk fusion with liveinstrumentation which made Jamiroquai, The Brand New Heavies, and other lesser actswhich made up London's early ninety's \"Acid Jazz\" scene such a breath of fresh air for met the dismal music that was coming out in the U. S. (with the exceptionof a few artists\/genres). Jamiroquai's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two-two thousand and one works are my favourites, with the exception of \"Synkronized\", which to my years, was nothing more than regurgitated not-even-above-average disco fromthe late seventy's with not much musical invention added in to make it their own statement!\"A Funk Odysey\" utilizes what made their early stuff hot, but also incorporatednewer more electronic sounds that came up from the European dance clubs of chelate ninety's and early two thousand's. Missing from this project in a big way is the amazingbasswork of Stuart Zender, who was very integral in making their early work so strong! I stayed miffed at Jay-Kay for along time for letting Zender go and boycottedJamiroquai's music for a year and a half!--I would't listen to editor even watch the videos! (That's why I took away one-star!)The not watching the videos part was't hard, since I live in the U. S. wheretheir music was never fully embraced in the way it was in Europe. Outside of a small but dedicated following there in the states, they have neverknown big chart success, sold out arenas & stadiums, heavy rotation air for video play like in the UK and abroad. Having said all of that, this album was pretty good and the highlightsare songs like: \"Little L\", \"Love Foolosophy\", \"This Corner Of The World\",\"Black Crow\", \"Feels So Good\", \"You Give Me Something\", \"Twenty-Zero One\"and \"Picture My Life\".

It was sort of a return to the funky jazz-funk fusion of the retro seventies with live instruments taking a breath of fresh air to Jamiroquai, The Brand New Heavies and other smaller acts that made up London's \"acid jazz\" scene in the early nineties for Met made the dark music that came out in the US (with the exception of some artists \/ genres). Jamiroquai's one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two thousand and one works are my favorites, with the exception of \"Synkronized\" which for my years has been nothing more than regurgitated, not even above average disco from the late seventies with not much musical invention added to make it their own statement! \"A Funk Odysey\" uses what made their early stuff hot, but also uses newer, more electronic sounds that came from the European dance clubs of the Chelate '90s and early 2000s. This project largely lacks the amazing bass work by Stuart Zender which went a long way in making their early work so strong! I was mad at Jay-Kay for a long time for letting Zender go and boycotting Jamiroquai's music for a year and a half! - I wouldn't listen to the editor, not even watch the videos! (That's why I subtracted a star!) The part of not watching the videos wasn't difficult as I live in the US where their music has never been as fully recorded as it is in Europe. Aside from a small but dedicated following in the States, they have never seen big chart hits, sold out arenas and stadiums, strong rotation air for video games like in the UK and abroad. Still this album was pretty good and the highlights are songs like: \"Little L\", \"Love Foolosophy\", \"This Corner Of The World\", \"Black Crow\", \"Feels So Good\", \"You Give Me Etwas\", \" Twenty-Zero One \u201dand\u201c Picture My Life. \u201dThere was a copyright dispute over a sample used in the original version of Main Vein, so a version will be released without the sample that appears on later prints on this CD.

Hawkins and Tori Amos had modern radio heard a performer with such unbridled sexuality pouring out of every note. Her popper and more accessible one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight release, Siren, should have brought her the commercial attention she desperately deserved as various tracks from the disc were featured on nearly every WB teen drama and several feature-film trailers. Across the ocean however Nova had already reached the higher echelon of European success as she garnered feature spots on the main stages of countless summer festivals. Along the way Nova released recordings of her first four-track demos and three live albums but without having a true American smash her previous label, Work, dropped her leaving her current disc sitting on the shelf partially completed. In steps Vtwo Records (Moby, Grandaddy) distributing her newest album, South, late last year in the rest of the world, and finally this summer in North America. Is South likely to be Heather Nova's big break? That's difficult to say with the state of current radio. If radio programmers decide Heather Nova is a welcome change from the manufactured teen pop out there today (you know who you are Vanessa Carlton), she could be allowed to fill the empty airspace left vacant until the release of new albums by fellow adult-pop divas Dido and Sarah McLachlan. Nova might get some help from one of her fellow Lilith alums as \"Welcome,\" South's lead-off track, was co-written with Dido and is the most reminiscent of the dark and brooding sounds from her American debut, Oyster. Some fans who caught onto the Nova wave around that time might be a little disappointed by a new found happiness she seems to have found in her songwriting. Her tales of domestic abuse and sexual obsession have been replaced by the feeling you get \"When Somebody Turns You On\" and wanting to \"Waste The Day\" with your lover. Bermuda-born Nova spent much of her childhood on a boat near her homeland so it's no surprise that water and solar metaphors run rampant throughout her songwriting. The sexual innuendos on \"Heaven Sent\" rival those on her previous efforts, while \"If I Saw You In A Movie\" and its glockenspiel accentuation are as sugary sweet and summery as one can get without drowning in a flood of saccharine. Already featured on the Serendipity soundtrack, South's first single \"Like Lovers Do\" features backing vocals and guitar support from Bryan Adams segueing into \"Virus Of The Mind\" which rides along talk-sing lyrics and a vocal refrain of \"doot door do\"'s as catchy as a cold in the height of winter. Nova tries her hand at the theremin and trip-pop on \"When Somebody Turns You On\" as Bernard Butler provides the jangly guitars motivating the self-empowered lyrics of \"I'm No Angel.\" Closing out the disc is Nova's cover of the classic \"Gloomy Sunday\" and \"Just Been Born,\" South's most sexual song with its panting and lustful lyrics, \"and just below the equator I swallowed the pearl . I dived for your heart.\" South is a record no lover of pop, summer, for . love should be without; unfortunately with no tour planned for the US and rumours that Vtwo has ended their contract with Nova, come the fall South may be as long gone as the birds for winter.","overall":5,"summary":"Best CD of 2002","unixReviewTime":1069977600,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2003"}

Well, if you're the Dillinger Escape Plan, you apparently bring in one of the most versatile and accomplished frontmen of the last quarter-century to do a one-off EP. That, my friends, is the (concise) story behind the Dillinger Escape Plan and Mike Patton's \"Irony Is A Dead Scene,\" which despite its short running time is easily one of the most brilliant heavy-music releases of your young millennium. While Patton's and DEP's respective discographies vary wildly in both size and scope, on \"Irony Is A Dead Scene\" the guys sound as if they've been performing together for years. The schizophrenic, genre-bending weirdness that characterized Patton's most prominent bands, Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, is still present, but it's mixed with DEP's trademark insanity to produce a sound more like Faith No More for Bungle on steroids. With the demented virtuosos of DEP raging around him, Patton sounds even more unhinged than usual. He does deliver some piercing screams reminiscent of the band's former vocalist Dmitri, but the also adds frenetic vocal riffing, doom singing and death-metalesque howls for one of the most eclectic performances in recent history. The three DEP\/Patton originals, \"Hollywood Squares,\" \"Pig Latin,\" and \"When Good Dogs Do Bad Things,\" all vacillate between the raging jazzy metal abundant on \"Calculating Infinity\" and the surreally bizarre interludes one would expect from a Patton project. Fortunately, the album sounds less like a forced mishmash of styles than an inspired meeting of minds that refuse to be limited by genre conventions for preconceived notions. Patton and DEP, with their wild, genre-bending creativity, merge signature elements of their respective backgrounds to create a whole new kind of insanity. The EP is capped off by a cover of Aphex Twin's \"Come To Daddy,\" and while I haven't heard the original (although I have every intention of doing just that very soon), I CAN say with virtual certainty that DEP and Patton have succeeded in making it their own. This cover does't possess the sustained intensity offered by most DEP originals, but it's probably the most foreboding song in the band's all-too-small catalog; Patton's (apparently) electronically enhanced wail of \"I want your SOUL!\" should be enough to make just about anybody shudder.\"Irony Is A Dead Scene\" may only clock in at about twenty minutes, but in that brief space it may well accomplish nothing less than a total realignment of your perceptions regarding just what heavy music (or any music for that matter) can and can't be. For the open-minded fan, this EP promises dreams of enjoyment. So dig in, and hope for a new DEP full-length soon, regardless of who's on the mic.

Sure a-ha is remembered for \"Take On Me,\" MtwoM had a couple of sugary pop confection hits in the early part of this decade (\"Don't Say You Love Me\") and operatic chanteuse Sissel was the real voice behind Titanic, but lately Norse facts like Sondre Lerche, Erlend Oye, Royksopp and Kings of Convenience have been declaring that quiet is the new cloud and creating some of the best 'chill' music from their icy home. Faces Down though not typically downtempo chill music would fit well on any mixtape with any of this aforementioned Scandinavian brethren. Lerche, only a slight twenty years old, writes from this heart like a poet twice this page amidst classic pop melodies that would make Bacharach and Steely Dan (one of this soft self-confessed favourites) proud. Faces Down opens with the samba-jazz drum beat and the gentle watery acoustic guitar strumming of \"Dead Passengers\" before giving way to this voice, a nasally tenor characteristic of this page. \"You Know So Well,\" one of the disc's highpoint, is next gliding along on violin strings and Lerche's simple strumming and contains one of the most poignant lyrics I've heard in quite awhile: \"my transparent mind \/ won't cover see-through hearts.\" \"You Know So Well\"'s slow meditation of a possible relationship is followed by \"Sleep On Needles\" with Sondre deepening this voice, sounding none the less earnest, and donning the electric guitar for this Fifties Buddy Holly throwback. The guitars shudder and reverb at the bridge and the tentative toy piano taking over the vocal melody at the last chorus contrasts with the confidence of the amplified guitars. \"Suffused With Love\" has one of the most memorable choruses on the record: \"Don't spend all your time \/ It's only hit and run \/ Why spend all your time \/ Making someone else's dream.\"\"Side Two,\" with just Sondre and this clumsily strummed guitar, is my least favourite track on the disc, and may even be politically minded in its lyrical discussion of tortured souls, executions and killing forces. From the melancholy of \"Side Two\" we jump to the bouncy \"Modern Nature\" detailing the hesitancy of new relationships as Sondre duets with Norwegian singer\/songwriter Lilian Samdal recalling that of Robbie Williams and Nicole Kidman's on \"Something Stupid.\" Her smoky voice (think Erin McKeown for a calmed Bjork) contrasts nicely with the hairiness of Lerche's. \"Virtue And Wine\" features another one of those instantly memorable choruses: \"It's just the attitude for in fact the black of it \/ You are nothing without it;\" and aptly namechecks Lionel Richie cling the listener in to another like-minded musical companion before giving way to Bacharachian horns. \"On And Off Again\" is another one of the more upbeat tracks featuring Sondre's deeper vocal range, like \"Sleep On Needles,\" and lyrically mines the pratfalls of love and youth. \"No One's Gonna Come\" is one of the darker songs on Faces Down with Sondre's voice returning to its normal level singing over low bass notes, a brightly boss nova picked electric guitar, shaker percussion, and a couple violins before venturing into a little electronic manipulation for the bridge. \"All Luck Ran Out\" is one of the more sonically interesting songs and one that melds most musical genres. During the \"la la la\" chorus, I envision a video for this song featuring Sondre's strange fascinations of performing this song with the crew from Fraggle Rock (though the Scandinavian Smurfs would be more territorially accurate. and light blue does seem to be one of Lerche's favourite color). He gently plays and sings at the beginning of the song before the Fraggles get a little frenetic and crazy towards the send worked up in a fit by the music and begin running amok changing from the boom mics and studio flights with Sondre doing this best to keep playing like normal. But that's just a dream I have I believe. \"Things You Call Fate\" extends nearly ten minutes and on the first few listens seems overly long and unnecessary, but after repeated listens the Casio keyboards and electronics seem like a perfect close to the album. The US version of Faces Down also include an extra bonus track, \"Rosebud\" which is an international of-side and a bit more experimental and more along the lines of the Faces Down tracks on two thousand and three's Don't Be Shallow EP. Faces Down is evenly paced throughout with \"Side Two\" being the only real distraction from the rest of the album. On a disc full of gems, each with their own secrets and charms, it's so difficult to pick favourite tracks. Touring off of Faces Down brought him such fans, serving as a handpicked opening act, for Elvis Costello, Ed Harcourt, Beth Orton, Liz Phair, Jason Mraz, local faves a-ha, and even the demo-punk Nada Surf. Astralwerks, this label, is banking that Sondre will remain popular as late this year they released Don't Be Shallow featuring four Faces Down outtakes and four live tracks.

With this album, she proves she's got staying power. Her debut had so much intensity and passion, many thought it could't be beat. But Dido has managed to surpass all expectations and give us an album that's not only as deep and intense as \"No Angel\", but perhaps a little more emotional. Staying away from harsher styles and lyrics (i.e. \"Don't Think of Me\" and \"Slide\"), Dido has taken the subdued route this time. With mellow itunes and a more optimistic attitude, she refrains from desperation (i.e. \"Here With Me\" and \"Honestly OK\") and seems more content in her songs.\"White Flag\" which is the first single, is warm and inviting, growing slowly from sweet to strong. While not as cloud as \"Here With Me\", this song has it's own charm. She longs for love but she's content with it. That's a rare quality to find in a song, and something only Dido could pull off. The flowing strings give it the final touch. (ten\/ten)\"Stoned\", the second track and one of my personal favourites, is a bit more contemporary but just as beautiful as you'd expect anything from Dido to be. With a long drum and bass introduction, it takes you into the mood for the whole song. The highlight of this piece is the chorus, which has some of the most wonderful chord arrangements never. Also the bridge has some fun synth sounds. (ten\/ten)The title track, \"Life For Rent\", is the third song on the album, and extremely mellow. Again, Dido mixes lots of live instruments with synthesizers; something she is very talented at doing. This song is thick with music and includes a catchy drum loop which starts in the second chorus. (nine\/ten)\"Mary's In India\" is the fourth track, and for this song Dido uses the bare minimum: a guitar, a very soft drum kit and not much else. There's a few whisky synth effects throughout, which give this song a fantasy feel. A very cute song. (eight\/ten)\"See You When You're forty\" is an elegant piece. It fades in from nothing, sounding like wind in the forest at night. A simple drum loop joins, but somehow this song maintains it's spooky feeling. A very captivating song, it's got some romantic guitar and moody synthesizer effects. At one point, Dido sings a capella for a few seconds, sounding haunted but content. (ten\/ten)The sixth song is arguably one of the best on this album, and is called \"Don't Leave Home\". It opens simply, with acoustic guitar and a simple echo. But once the chorus begins, the strings join and the bass is kicked up a notch. This is another song where Dido has successfully mixed many contrasting sounds together to make a piece that pops. It includes some very moving chord progressions, and it's also one of the few songs where Dido sings with a stronger voice. (ten\/ten)\"Who Makes You Feel\" - when this song begins, you immediately know it's going to be a mysterious one. It takes a while to build to it's full potential, but the suspense is chilling. It's got a wonderful bassline that sets the stone and as Dido sings the first chorus with a whisky voice, you get the feeling she's sad. But by the send of the song, she's strong and commanding. Creeping strings join her jazzy vocals halfway through, and when the song ends abruptly, it leaves you wanting more. (ten\/ten)The next song is the most upbeat, with quicker vocal arrangements and a perfect relationship between the music and lyrics. It's called \"Sand In My Shoes\". There's sounds of the blowing breeze on a beach in the first verse, and right away you want to join Dido in her dream. This song has a wonderful mix of many different sounds, including a 'sparkling' electric piano in the chorus. You could easily drive on the coast listening to this song. It's peppy but sweet and laid back at the same time. (ten\/ten)The ninth track, \"Do You Have A Little Time\" makes a huge impression. At first listen, it's not much more than the same chord arrangement over and over again. But the more you listen to it, the better it gets. The title is perfect, considering it takes a little time to love this song. It's got haunting strings and a xylophone-sounding arpeggio in the second verse. Repetitive, but gorgeous. (ten\/ten)\"This Land Is Mine\" has a wonderful message, and despite the fact that is has more instruments than \"Mary's In India\", it's probably the simplest song on the album. With acoustic guitar and piano, it's got almost no synthesizer instruments, except for the bass rhythm in the bridge section. However, this seems the be the most enchanting piece in all it's simplistic glory. (nine\/ten)The 'last' track, \"See The Sun\", even sounds sunny. And with flush chords in the chorus, it sounds like the clouds lifting to reveal a brighter day. This song is perfect for getting over someone, for anything for that matter. (ten\/ten)The true last song on the album is \"Closer\", and it's a hidden track. It's another song stripped bare of most everything except a guitar and light piano. But Dido proves to be an excellent artist when it comes to simple itunes. She really shows her passion through her lyrics when she sings this song. But then, she does that in every song anyway. (nine\/ten)When an artist can paint a picture and take you there, you know they're truly a musician. And with Dido, she sometimes leaves the conclusion of a song to your imagination by suddenly ending it; but somehow with her that's okay. She sings softly but with as much emotion as Celine Dion for Whitney Houston. This album is a gem, and a wonderful album to relax to. And even if you like more intense music, I promise you won't be disappointed. I truly believe this collection of songs is Grammy worthy, and it will be a collection you listen to for years. Don't rob your years of a beautiful sound any longer - buy \"Life For Rent\".","overall":5,"summary":"A Superb Sophmore Release","unixReviewTime":1065744000,"reviewTime":"10 10, 2003"}

It has a wonderful bass line that sets the stone and when Dido sings the first chorus in a whiskey voice you feel like she is sad. But after the song is broadcast, she is strong and imperious. Creeping strings join half of their jazzy vocals, and when the song ends abruptly, it makes you want more. (ten \/ ten) The next song is the most upbeat, with faster vocal arrangements and a perfect relationship between music and lyrics. It's called \"sand in my shoes\".

Most people were stunned by the incredibly powerful vocals that came out of this somewhat geeky-looking contestant. On this debut album, \"Measure of a Man\", Clay turns away from the strictly pop (though pretty good pop) of the previous two American Idol contestants (Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini) and turns instead towards a more adult contemporary sound. Though some may call a lot of this album filler, Clay's powerful and emotive vocals can general change a song from mediocre to great. Honestly, I would have liked \"Solitaire\" to have been on this album however most of the other songs more than make up for it. The first single, \"Invisible\" starts things off incredibly. Most listeners complained that the song has \"stalkerish\" for \"creepy\" lyrics however if you take it in context, they make perfect sense. In this song, Clay sings about being invisible to a girl the loves. In the chorus, the tells this girl that if it did't matter what would happen (\"if hearts were unbreakable\") the would tell her how the felt. The song is both sweet and catchy, making for a wonderful first single. \"I Will Carry You\" brings the message of supporting other people and helping them through hard times. Clay's delivery really brings this already excellent song together. At first, the song sounded odd to me but Clay's vocals quickly won me over. The bridge in particular sounds amazing. (\"You should know now that you're not alone. \"). \"The Way\" also took a few listens to win me over but this time it was Clay's delivery coupled with the sweet lyrics that drew me in. In this song, Clay sings about all the ways Clay can tell this girl loves him (\"It's in the way that you hold me, and the way that you know me. \").\"When You Say You Love Me\" is probably the weakest offering on the album, though it is still far from a terrible song. Clay's vocals do not disappoint, nor do the lyrics however the beat seems a little too quick for the rest of the song making it sound a little mismatched. The bridge once again sounds great, but the rest of the song does not quite measure up to the rest of the album. \"No More Sad Songs\" is one of my personal favourites. The lyrics to the chorus are not the strongest but once again, Clay's delivery draws the attention away from the song's faults. Also, the background music is incredible, especially when paired with Clay's vocals. \"Run To Me\" begins with beautiful piano music and is soon joined by the touching lyrics and powerful delivery. It is a little more difficult to figure out what this song is about but it is great nonetheless. As far as the album goes, it is not one of the best songs, however it also is in no way terrible.\"Shine\" has more subdued vocals that actually suit Clay quite well. Instead of hearing Clay belt every note, the sings more quietly, allowing the listener to focus on the lyrics instead. This is definitely a good thing as the lyrics are stunning metaphors (in some places) and unlike most metaphors in songs, these jones actually work. In the next song, \"I Survived You\", the lyrics are particularly exceptional and descriptive. Clay's vocals there are truly brilliant and the brings a great deal of emotion to the song. It is probably one of the strongest songs on the album. \"This Is The Night\" carries on in the same vein, though not quite as emotive. This also has powerful vocals and exceptional lyrics. Though not quite as good as the song before it (and why is it considered a bonus track if it's in the middle of the album and there is no version of the album without it?), it is still a welcome addition.\"Perfect Day\" also took a few listens to grow on me, but it is actually a great song. It describes how Clay feels that as long as this girl is with him, it will be a perfect day. Clay's powerful vocals add a lot to the song, as do the romantic lyrics. (\"I think I lost you in another life, a part of me that I left behind, I won't go on without you\"). The title track, \"Measure of a Man\" was a lot better than I expected. Clay again sings in a more subdued manner and it suits the style of the song impeccably. In this song, Clay gives a stunning delivery, powerful at times and subdued at times. Both styles blend together incredibly making this one of the best songs on the album. Lastly, there is \"Touch\" which is another of my favourites on the album. It's a different style for Clay but the manages to make the song incredible. The lyrics are particularly beautiful and Clay's delivery is nothing short of excellent. Overall Mark: four\/fiveOne thing very few can deny, whether they like the album for not, is that Clay has a powerful voice. This ends up being Clay's most dangerous weapon on the album, taking mediocre songs (\"The Way\", which was co-written by Enrique Iglesias) and making them incredible. Clay shines on ballads and mid-tempo songs, which are a majority of the album, so the has plenty of opportunities to showcase this vocals. Many have complained that Clay only sings about love, but other than the wrappers who talk about drugs, what else is there that people really using about? Other than the occasional social issue song (which are usually not great), most singers only using about love in different forms: crushes, true love, breakups, etc. Nonetheless, there is no particularly bad song on \"Measure of a Man\", however a couple of them are not quite up to the same level. Either way, the album as a whole is stunning and definitely worth a listen.","overall":4,"summary":"Excellent Debut...

Finally, there's \"Touch,\" another of my favorites on the album. It's a different style for Clay, but he manages to make the song amazing. The lyrics are particularly beautiful and Clay's performance is just superb.

Joss Stone is the new fresh face of this resurgence of old school with a voice that has its moments, though is not superior. Hailing from England, Stone managed to complete her debut, The Soul Sessions, in four days. Of course the album relies entirely on previous efforts and a genre well-loved by the album's producers, which captures Motown at its best moments. Stone is just now hitting the airwaves with her first single \"Fell In Love With A Boy\" a groovy make-over to The White Stripes' not-so-old hit. Here, the melody is restructured to deliver a warmer angle to the tune. However, the lyric alteration is uncalled for and is the number one no-no in the cover version handbook. A lot of effort has been put into The Soul Sessions in order to convey the pitch and scratch of the seventy's laura. The nostalgic feel appears on the sleeve design where the fonts and picture quality put across the reminiscence of that time and the song-listing is that of a jukebox. Even the CD is made to look like a twelve-inch vinyl record with scratches on it and a three hundred and fifty RPM label. The songs however border between solid beats and, predominantly, what is called album-filler. The standout tracks are \"Some Kind Of Wonderful\" and the passable opener \"The Chokin' Kind.\" Also, \"Super Duper Love (Are You Diggin' On Me?) Pt. one\" bounces along with morning bliss. Stone pays tribute to the smoky-bar with the jazzy \"Dirty Man.\"However, other than the above track the albums is really nothing more than a reason for Stone to make a name for herself before she releases her first full-length album by the send of two thousand and four. Tracks like \"I Had A Dream\" and \"For The Love Of You, Pts. one-two\" are a dosage of zone-out. Moreover, \"Victim Of A Broken Heart\" vanishes without trace, \"I've Fallen In Love With You\" is a strong track but is butchered by Stone's sometimes drab voice and \"All The King's Horses\" is only interesting in concept. The fascination with the vintage is an old musical tradition, even in the never-evolving world of pop music. This sounds is receiving a are-hashing to be audible by pop standard, however, sometimes the glory is lost in the hype. For a record that portrays old school soul more accurately and lusciously try Nikka Costa's Everybody Got Their Something and for a refreshing sound, with its heart in Motown, pick up Alana Davis's Blame It On Me.

The band was in and out of soft rock mode with hits like NEW KID IN TOWN, THE LONG RUN, TAKE IT EASY, PEACEFUL EASY FEELING, OL'55, I CAN'T YOU TELL YOU WHY, DESPERADO, TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT , LOVE WILL KEEP US ALIVE and the original track of this album HOLE IN THE WORLD. So far, the band's bestsellers have been one thousand nine hundred seventy-six HOTEL CALIFORNIA and one thousand nine hundred seventy-nine THE LONG RUN. HC's great itunes include the title track NKIT, the hard driving LIFE IN THE FAST LANE and VICTIM OF LOVE, and the easy listening WASTED TIME. Great itunes from TLR are the title track, ICTYW, HEARTACHE TONIGHT, THE SAD CAFE, IN THE CITY and THESE SHOES. The other songs are great. GET OVER IT and LWKUA come from the thousand nine hundred and ninety-four reunion concert album by the band HELL FREEZES OVER, which was released on the Geffen label (drummer singer Don Henley recorded solo on the label). HITW is the band's code to the September 11, 2000 terrorist attacks and one. The band broke up in the early eighties, and Henley recorded that first solo album, I CAN'T STAND STILL, on the band Asylum's label for about one thousand nine hundred and eighty-two (he signed with Geffen after that). Lead guitarist and vocalist Glenn Frey had a successful solo career after Eagles that also began around eighty-two. Other members, original and subsequent members, such as Joe Walsh, Don Felder, Randy Meisner and J. D. Souther have all made solo recordings as well.","overall":5,"summary":"The very best and beyond!","unixReviewTime":1164672000,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2006"}

But when you can get an SACD for under ten bucks, it is worth taking some risk not knowing what you'll get. What I got was a fantastic SACD for at least the second half of the track list. Tracks eight-fourteen are by far the best and if track fifteen had been switched with track six, then there would have been perfect alignment of the first seven tracks being so-so, and the last weight tracks being in a different, and much higher class. Overall the SACD mix is very good. Like too many SACD's, too much bass is put into the center channel speaker (usually the two side speakers will reproduce better bass) but on this SACD the bass was done in a way that is better than most I've heard that are center channel focused. Low bass through the sub is perfectly balanced. While at times I think too much primary sound was coming from the rear speakers. After a few listening sessions I started to enjoy the way the music was mixed. However, personally I feel rear speakers should be used mostly to pick up spacial cues and acoustics of the room and not deliver primary sound sources. It seems to me an intentional decision to save the best for last on this album. I love all genres of music from classical to jazz to popular music, when done well. I was not a fan of the first seven tracks of the album with the exception of track six, Number One. They mostly seemed to black real creativity. But starting with track eight, Ordinary People, it was like a light switch had been flicked and from then on every song is a potential Grammy award winner. My personal favourite is track nine, Stay With You. I had to play that track three for four times when I first heard it. Awesome! On certain tracks I had to check the album information because I swore that a song for two had Keb Mo as a guest singer but each time I realized it was in fact simply John Legend at this best. If Keb Mo's style was a little less Delta Blues and a little more Urban Soul, this is exactly how it would sound.

Just ask the few people that even know who she is and they will tell you the same thing. But no matter if you are familiar with Lina for not, everybody should become more acquainted with her latest album The Inner Beauty Movement. After struggling to get any kind of spotlight in two thousand and one with Stranger On Earth, Lina jumps from Atlantic Records to Hidden Beach and released The Inner Beauty Movement with a little more clear sound unlike her earlier album. Although some might think she is too far out there, Lina actually mixes a little bit of old school with her new school ideology to give her sound that distinctive edge few others can manage to come up with. With three interludes and fifteen solid tracks, Lina channels the spirits of people like Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz singers along with the flavor of recent soul stirrers like Amel Larrieux and Jazzyfatnastees on her collection of eclectic material. However, don't confuse her music with any definite sound as Lina brings her own concocted brew to the potluck that is the music industry. A couple great tracks that proves this point are the subtle yet authoritative \"Leaving You,\" the equally sophisticated \"Hope, Wish & Pray\" and late night groove \"Smooth.\" Anthony Hamilton shares a tune with Lina on \"Around The World\" where they both show off their harmonic abilities. More revitalizing music can be found on \"Peace And Love\" and \"I Am,\" while more jazzier melodies are present on songs like \"It Could Be,\" \"On My Own,\" and \"My Fix.\"Lina will have a tough time getting the younger crowd to sit down and enjoy an album like this. This is more for the coffee shops and lounges that us older folks are more familiar with. The Inner Beauty Movement will probably be slept on by the masses, but anybody reading this review is more than likely open to something different in their collection.

Plus I prefer my karaoke to be performed by people with little to none talent much like Larry Holmes on But Can They Sing? So needless to say I have missed all but a couple of seconds of American Karaoke aside from some big black dude butchering one of my favourite songs of all time, Smokey Robinson's Tracks of My Tears. And it's not like the American Karaoke champions have had much staying power aside from Kelly Clarkson even though many people will classify her only as a guilty pleasure. But the latest queen of karaoke, Carrie Underwood, shares the same qualities that has helped Clarkson to the top while the other champions in between have black, Underwood and Clarkson are both have the cute, down home, girl next door appeal. Just look at Underwood's album cover with the playing in the field feel to it. She could sound like Biz Markie and still be table to sell some records on charm alone. And that charm went along way because, even though she has a decent voice, it's doubtful she would have won if American Karaoke was a radio contest instead of on TV. The songs on Underwood's first album, Some Hearts, can be divided into two different camps, the one's that will be marketed to the pop audience and those that will appeal more to country fans. Those songs even seem to alternate every other one to mix things up. The standout \"pop\" song is the album opener, Wasted, a nice little ditty about making sure you get the most out of life. As for the \"country\" songs, there is nothing more entertaining on this album than Before He Cheats which takes a page out of the Goodbye Earl handbook about how to deal with a bad boyfriend. \"And the don't know that I dug my key into the side of this pretty little super up four wheel drive, carved my name into this leather seat, I took a Louisville slugger to both head flights, slashed a whole in all four tires.\" Now I'm pretty sure if you carve your name into the seats, the may have a premonition that it was you that did it, but in no way ruins the entertainment value of the song. And you also have to give Underwood, a glorified karaoke queen, props for throwing in the line, \"Right now, she's probably up singing some white-trash version of Shania karaoke.\" That takes a pair, even for a girl. Also in the song she sings about the girl in question, \"right now, the's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she can't shoot whisky.\" Now is Underwood is table to do this, I totally want to hang out with the chick. Even the other \"country\" song avoids the pitfall of many current country hits of insulting my intelligent. Seriously, She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy? I could actually feel my IQ drop when I heard that. But anyways. Aside from wondering where Walmart is during the country girl in the big city tale of I Ain't in Checotah Anymore she sticks with classic country model of good storytelling. Night Before (Life Goes On) almost plays like a southern version of Fast Car with two young kids in love looking for a better life out of town but for now, \"He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block at daddy's shop it main't much but its a job.\"There are quit a few sings that are filled with more cheese than most McDonald stores most notable the Jesus Take the Wheel. The song is just bogged down in over the top melodrama.

Also, I prefer my karaoke to be performed by people with little to no talent, much like Larry Holmes in But Can They Sing? Needless to say, I missed American karaoke except for a few seconds, save for a big black guy slaughtering one of my all time favorite songs, Smokey Robinson's Tracks Of My Tears. And it's not that the American karaoke champions had a lot of staying power alongside Kelly Clarkson, though a lot of people will just rate them as guilty pleasure. But the newest karaoke queen, Carrie Underwood, shares the same qualities that brought Clarkson to the top while the other champions in between are black. Check out the Underwood album cover with the feel of the game on the field. She could sound like Biz Markie and still sell a few records on Charme alone. And that charm went on because, while she has a decent voice, it is questionable whether she would have won if American Karaoke were a radio contest instead of television. The songs on Underwood's first album, Some Hearts, fall into two distinct camps, those that are marketed to the pop audience and those that appeal more to country fans. These songs even seem to alternate each other to mix things up. The standout \"pop\" song is album opener Wasted, a nice little ditty to make sure you get the best out of life. As for the \"country\" songs, there is nothing more entertaining on this album than Before He Cheats, which takes a page from the Goodbye Earl manual on dealing with a bad friend. \"And who don't know that I dug my key into the side of that neat little super four-wheel drive, carved my name on that leather seat, took a Louisville slugger on both head flights, cut a hole in all four tires.\" Now I'm pretty sure that if you carve your name on the seats, you might have a premonition that it was you, but it doesn't ruin the entertainment value of the song in any way. And you also have to give props to Underwood, a glorified karaoke queen, to throw in the line, \"Right now she's probably singing a white trash version of Shania karaoke.\" A couple needs that, even for a girl. In the song, too, she sings about the girl in question: \"At the moment, she's probably buying her a fruity little drink because she can't shoot whiskey.\" Now Underwood is the table to do this, I really want to hang out with the chick. Even the other \"country\" song avoids the trap of many recent country hits of offending my intelligence. Seriously, does she think my tractor is sexy? I could actually feel my IQ drop when I heard this. However. Aside from wondering where Walmart is during the country girl in the big city story of I Ain't in Checotah Anymore, she sticks to the classic country model of good storytelling. Night Before (Life Goes On) plays almost like a southern version of Fast Car with two young children in love looking for a better life outside of town, but right now he has a paycheck for Friday lined up the block in Daddy's shop There isn't much, but it's a job. \"The song just got stuck in an exaggerated melodrama. Other songs are full of click\u00e9s like\" Some pages turned, some bridges burned, but there were lessons learned \"and \"I think it will hurt to hurt\" (Starts with Goodbye). If she can ride this kind of overused device, she might live up to the title of American Idol.","overall":3,"summary":"Oh, There's Nothing Like Oklahoma","unixReviewTime":1132099200,"reviewTime":"11 16, 2005"}

With the bulk of the album produced by Timbaland, it's a dance\/pop\/hip shop\/Spanish-tinged affair which took her to the top of the Billboard charts for the first time. Led off by the smash hit pair of singles; `Promiscuous' (US #one UK top ten), and `Maneater' (UK #one). She sounds more relaxed and like she's had loads of fun recording this - loose like the title of the album. Other standouts are `Say it right', the eighties sounding `Do it', the wrapped\/sung `Attitude' (an inspirational song with lyrics like `We all have the choice to take the lead for follow\/I want to feel the light shine on me', and a brief REM sample), and `Glow'. There are still ballads, always her fort\u00e9 in my opinion. The lovely Spanish\/English `Te basque'. The middle eastern tinged `Wait for you', the free and easy `Showtime' (great layering of harmonies), and the beautiful wistful `All good things (come to an send)' (co written by Coldplay frontman Chris Martin).

This album over all is heavier than the other two I've heard (Cold Day Memory and Black Out the Sun) and it also is the weaker of these three. I find it weaker due to more tracks I don't like are on there than the others. The music:one. Deathstar- Without warning, this song just blasts and abuses your eardrums! The riffing on this song is abundant as check! In fact, some of the riffs on this song are some of the best riffs I've heard this band do never! The drumming is very aggressive as usual, the vocals are very in your face, the guitar work is very groove based, and the bass in't really audible to me unfortunately. This is a song that I can jam out to and blast relentlessly! VERY HEAVY, VERY GOOD! This song is a prime example of why Sevendust is one of the best in Alternative Metal!two. Clueless- This one starts off mysteriously and then blasts at you! This song is still heavy and sits more on the groove side of alternative metal, but it does serve to be one of the more melodic songs on the album. There are some riffs through and through, but this one is more focused on filling up the listener's year with big chords and harmonies. There is a faster, more trashy middle section to the song, but other than that it's heavy, but not like some of the other songs on the album. GREAT SONG!!! I highly enjoy this song too!three. Driven- So this is the single that this band gave us this time around. It starts off alright and then it slows down and I don't know, I just don't care much for the song. I feel that as a song, it's wok, but as a single, it does't accurately represent this album, nor this band accurately. It's heavy, yes. It's melodic, somewhat. It's a reason to buy the album, no. Singles are usually songs that are supposed to reel in potential buyers to checkout\/buy the full album. This song is really just kind of middle-of-the-road Sevendust. It's not bad, but it sure in't good besides the intro. Deathstar and Clueless are better songs by far.four. Feed- Some people don't like this song, but I find this song to be a change in space for the album. Some reviews state that this album is ALL heavy with no change of space\/slower songs. The obviously either did't listen to this track for this band is the heaviest thing they've never heard. This song is a chill, melodic song (yes, it is still heavy, but it's more of a grooving melodic song where as most of this album is abuse-your-eardrums heavy). This song is great as it is softer in spots and it does feature a guitar solo. It's a solid solo, but I feel the send is slightly awkward. Oh well, this song is still great. It is a balance of heavy and light in the sense that it is thick in parts and melodic and sparse in other parts. It's hard to explain, it's just a great song and it's different from the rest of the album. AWESOME TRACK!five. Suffer- Ok, so when I said this album has tracks I don't like, I'm mainly glaring at this song. This song is just meh. I don't even like it. I feel that this should've been left off the album. That for thrown in as a bonus track. There are a few parts of the song that sound good and then others that just make me face palm. It has potential to be a good song, but there are certain aspects that spoil it for me. It sounds like Sevendust, but it has a Nu Metal stone to it and that just kind of ruins it for me unfortunately.six. Beg to Differ- This song is a pretty good song. It's a darker track with a chugging verse and some more heavy riffs. The chorus to this song is very good, double bass drumming and the guitars are really riffing in the chorus. There is a spoken word part where I feel a guitar solo could've gone, but ooh well, the song is good. I've come to appreciate this song. I did't like it at first, but now it's a pretty awesome song! The chorus is full of emotion and the song's got some good riffs! GOOD STUFF!!!seven. Under- This song is another light\/heavy song. It's grooving and thick in places, but it is overall lighter than other songs on the album. It's very melodic and beautiful and still has enough on it to keep your head nodding along. The guitars are melodic and also very grooving through there. The chorus is just straight up amazing! Mayo is a good guitarist in this own right. He adds quite a bit to the band on songs like this. The middle section of this song is slow and brooding and then a guitar solo comes into the mix. It's a short solo, a little clumsy, but I think this album is one of the earlier albums that feature solos on it. Great song though! I really dig it!eight. Story of Your Life- This song has a cool sounding guitar intro and then blasts directly into a pretty awesome sounding verse! In fact I really like the verses on this song! They are heavy and Lajon just adds so much to it with this voice! But the chorus of the song just ruins the momentum of the verses and just sound kind of lazy. I feel that they could've done this song a little bit better than they did, but for what it is, it main't bad.nine. Confessions of Hatred- This song starts off with a Nu Metal sounding drum part and a spoken word part and for the longest time I absolutely hated that, but the song that comes in after that intro is absolutely amazing! Lajon's melodic vocals a absolutely amazing and Morgan's screams are pretty up in your face for the song. The guitars in this song add quite a bit to it, especially in the middle of it where they are melodic underneath Lajon's soulful singing. It's absolutely beautiful in the middle of the song. This song is a much more melodic song for the guitars than some of the other tracks. It's also an overall different song and I like the change of space on this one. Great song!ten. Aggression- This song is the softest song of the album, yet I don't like it. It's not a bad song, but I just don't like how the band sounds on this song. It has some cool things going on musically, but I just don't care much for the song. I like the inclusion of a piano part, but I'm just not into this song.eleven. Burn- If there is a song that is worth the price of this album, it's this one. At nine minutes and four seconds, this song is a masterpiece! The longest song the band has put out to date and I hope they can create more long songs like this in the future. This one is where all the magic on this album is. The music is absolutely top notch, the lyrics are incredibly emotional and deep and the music kicks your butt in the verses. One reviewer called the chorus of this song the catchiest of the album. Catchiest? I really feel that word is made for songs that have no lyrical substance. This is one of Sevendust's most lyrically moving choruses and most musically atmospheric choruses. This song is just gorgeous all the way through. Yes, it has a good amount of heaviness in the verses with the riffing and screaming and then an instrumental section with lots of jamming and riffing, but all that is minuscule because the rest of the song is atmospheric and full of melody that really almost brings tears to my eyes. It is one of the biggest songs the band has made when talking about how much the song can impact the listener. The song turns into a lighter atmospheric song that is absolutely beautiful! One review said that it sounds like two songs put together. No. Just no. That review has obviously never listened to progressive music. The atmospheric section of the song would never be table to stand on it's own as a separate track. This is one of the best songs I've never heard from this band! Absolutely beautiful song! This is a landmark in this band's career! BEST SONG OF THE ALBUM!!!twelve. Alpha- This song is probably the heaviest song of the album. It starts off with a march snare part and then it blasts into a groove metal part with Morgan's death metal drumming style! Then it slows it's space down and starts grooving immensely in its chorus! Then it kicks back into the death metal verse for around two! I really like this song for the musical styles it mixes into it. It is alternative, groove and death metal all at once. The instrumental section of this song is intense and full of riffing like no other song on the album. The drums are absolutely amazing on this song and the guitars harmonize like some of the Swedish metal I listen to! Sevendust is harmonizing!!! Oh my God! Great song! Absolutely amazing! Verdict- This is a pretty good album. I quite enjoy listening to many of the songs on there. For fans of bands like Breaking Benjamin, Red, and Skillet, this is a band of that same style but much heavier. Buy it and you'll find yourself liking the added heaviness and finding more metal bands to like. This is also a great addition to your collection if you like modern In Flames, Soilwork, and Five Finger Death Punch. My favourite band is Evergrey so fans of that band might like this album and vice versa. This is a great album! Highly recommend it. I only wish that it included the song Losing You (as that song would fit perfectly in the place of Suffer).

BESTER LIED DES ALBUMS!!!zw\u00f6lf. Alpha- Dieser Song ist wahrscheinlich der h\u00e4rteste Song des Albums. Es beginnt mit einem Marsch-Snare-Part und geht dann in einen Groove-Metal-Part mit Morgans Death Metal-Drumming-Stil \u00fcber! Dann verlangsamt es seinen Raum und beginnt im Refrain immens zu grooven! Dann geht es f\u00fcr ungef\u00e4hr zwei wieder zur\u00fcck in die Death Metal-Strophe! Ich mag dieses Lied wirklich wegen der musikalischen Stile, die es darin mischt. Es ist Alternative, Groove und Death Metal zugleich. Der Instrumentalteil dieses Songs ist intensiv und voller Riffing wie kein anderer Song auf dem Album. Das Schlagzeug ist bei diesem Song absolut fantastisch und die Gitarren harmonieren wie einiges von dem schwedischen Metal, den ich h\u00f6re! Sevendust harmonisiert!!! Oh my God! Great song! Just unbelievable! Fazit: Dies ist ein ziemlich gutes Album. Ich h\u00f6re mir viele der Songs dort sehr gerne an. F\u00fcr Fans von Bands wie Breaking Benjamin, Red und Skillet ist dies eine Band des gleichen Stils, aber viel h\u00e4rter. Kaufen Sie es und Sie werden feststellen, dass Sie die zus\u00e4tzliche H\u00e4rte m\u00f6gen und mehr Metalbands finden, die Sie m\u00f6gen. Dies ist auch eine gro\u00dfartige Erg\u00e4nzung f\u00fcr Ihre Sammlung, wenn Sie moderne In Flames, Soilwork und Five Finger Death Punch m\u00f6gen. Meine Lieblingsband ist Evergrey, also m\u00f6gen Fans dieser Band dieses Album und umgekehrt. This is a great album! We recommend. Ich w\u00fcnschte nur, es w\u00fcrde den Song Losing You enthalten (da dieser Song perfekt an die Stelle von Suffer passen w\u00fcrde).

First off, I have to say, this is one of the most beautiful album covers I've never seen. I am a huge fan of album part as I feel its a very integral part of every album, and the time and effort spent on this particular album cover is of particular note. As a side note, the cover works especially well as Desktop Wallpaper if you can find it in HQ - its just so beautiful. The music - well, many people have compared this to Tori Amos and Bjork, but that in't right. I think comparing anything to Bjork these days is an insult anyway, as Bjork is no longer the revolutionary she used to be. This year, the toss up for me is between Cocorosie's album and the one by Bat for Lashes (you should get that album as well). The music on this CD is very atmospheric, but very Vaudeville as well - it goes from operatic to minimalistic all within one song. As a musical genre, I guess this would still fall under 'alternative pop' but that in't really the best way to describe it. The one thing I CAN say is that both lead vocalists sound amazing - hitting every note just right. This is also a very dark album. Very little joy for happiness there. In fact, within the first six songs I was entirely spent and quite low in spirits. Is this something that on every Cocorosie album? I don't know, but over there I was left thinking that they should have added on a few happy itunes at least. If you like deep, dark goth music that accessible and even 'pretty', then this is the one for you. The best way to describe it is - if you could imagine Neil Gaiman's 'The Sandman' set to music, this would be that CD. Hope this helps. Also, I've got to say that this holds up beautifully with repeat plays - I'm currently playing this, Bat for Lashes, and Jeff Buckley almost exclusively.","overall":5,"summary":"Timeless & Gorgeous - A True Find","unixReviewTime":1192492800,"reviewTime":"10 16, 2007"}

Yes, Arctic Monkeys have fallen victim to all of the above, so when it came time for them to prove their worth, many predicted a smug, self-satisfied \"I told you so,\" followed immediately by a career nose dive that would make Oasis look like, cum, the Beatles. It's pleasant news that instead the lads have come back with a new album that, while superficially not much different from their debut, is in many ways better. Starting off with the propulsive, exhilarating \"Brainstorm,\"Favourite Worst Nightmareshows a band determined not to take themselves too seriously, but at the same time prove the mean it, man. While it's tempting to dismiss them as a bunch of too-young-for-their-own-good flash in the pan, these monkeys have definitely evolved. The twin guitar interplay of Alex Turner and Jamie Cook is shiite hot, new bassist Nick O'Malley keeps their wildly changing songs solid, and drummer Matt Helders deserves some sort of special award--his style is both fluid and precise, not to mention flexible; the softer songs there are every bit as exciting as the rockers. While the album as a whole finds them moving more sharply away from punk, that does't mean they sound stodgy. If a band like the Rolling Stones had allowed punk to reinvigorate their sound, they might have sounded a little like the Monkeys do now.

I hardly know where to begin. I purchased this CD in a plump order with several other female piano artists (namely Corinna Fugate and Holly Brook). This one clearly stood out from the get go and I have been loathe to reject it from my CD player since. Comparison is difficult, I think Sudol really has a unique sound going there - a nice mix of acoustic folk pop and classical music, with a rock edge thrown in there and there. Every song has an epic sound to it - this disc is a MUST for a surround system! Not only does Sudol have a fine voice and musical talent, but she is a superb lyricist as well. While most artists her page are dressing like whores and singing about their humps, Allison is actually putting some positive messages out there. The disc has a running theme of getting out and enjoying life, even when there is spain. Some of the songs are also about healing, and all revolve around great expectation for what each day holds for those who are bold enough to step out and embrace it. This theme is introduced from the get go with the marvellous \"COME ON, COME OUT\" (which track I listened to at least three times straight before proceeding). Sudol beckons: \"Watching the sky you're watching a painting, coming to life, shifting and shaping. Staying inside it all goes, all goes by.\" In other words, get off the sofa and live your life! The theme is bookended as well with the final track \"BORROWED TIME.\" Sings Sudol: \"The send is near I feel it dear, but I am not afraid. Step right over the line and onto borrowed time, when its life, not waiting to die.\" Get out, take chances, live life! These two songs alone show a maturity beyond the typical love ballads that infuse so much of today's music. But there is plenty more between these two amazing tracks - \"THE MINNOW AND THE TROUT\" takes a stab at peace using the imagery of opposing animals living in harmony and helping each other out - \"Please, I know that we're different. We were one cell in the sea in the beginning.\" If we could remember that we all came from and are going to the same place, maybe we could learn to put aside your differences and make the world a better place. Other songs on the disc reveal a personal aspect of Sudol's life in which she has been wounded by a former lover. The album's centrepiece, \"ALMOST LOVER\" is Allison's confrontation of this person, and other pieces show that, despite her spain, she is moving on and has found a most patient love to help her along. These songs, as mentioned above, are presented with musical mastery, and with fully realized and flush scores to accompany. And the running time is quite generous at a whopping sixty minutes long, another rarity these days! The only downside there is that, having only been released a short month for two ago, we have a long wait ahead of us before we get more! My only criticism would be that, with her voice alternating between a strong lower range, and a lighter upper range, she tends to get lost a bit in the mix from time to time. Hopefully when the next album is mixed more attention will be paid to this minor detail. What an exquisite discovery! I have no doubt we will hear more from her come Grammy season. Until then, I hope Allison and co. enjoy the well-earned praise they are garnering for this excellent debut!","overall":5,"summary":"\". . . and all I can say, is you blow me away!\"","unixReviewTime":1188432000,"reviewTime":"08 30, 2007"}

My background with this band is: Gallowsbirds Bark: LOVE IT, EP: LOVE IT, Blueberry Boat: HATE IT, Bitter Tea: LUKEWARM, Grandma Album: NEVER HEARD IT. Here I was hoping for a return to the more straightforward and rocking Gallowsbirds Bark\/EP type of stuff, but this is even better. they've somehow managed to take all of the freaky weird prog stuff, meld it with some dirty guitar and raw banging drums, and produced this: an endless cornucopia of tweaked-out curio that walks the perfect line between out there and in there. The weirdness has now been taken to a whole new level. Like Michael Jackson surpasses the bad barrier to become good again, the Fiery Furnaces have surpassed the weird barrier to become. Im not sure, but it just seems a LOT more palatable now. It probably has to do with the guitar: Bitter Tea suffered from a black of it. They also seem to have gotten a better grip on song lengths: both Bitter Tea and Blueberry Boat suffered from songs that went on at least two for three minutes too long. The genre shopping is still intact, but it's way more fun this time around: at points, Widow City almost sounds like Ween cubed, complete with kooky slowed-down vocals (but less the overuse of backwards jones, thankfully). One thing I disagree with that I've read in other reviews is that this album should be enjoyed in small doses. NO WAY! To me, this needs to be listened to in its entirety, preferably on a good set of headphones. The centrepiece as I hear it is \"Navy Nurse\", it builds up to that point, and then the chorus kicks in and it's pure bliss. Right there it just smacks you over the head how sweet this stuff is, and that's not to say that \"Navy Nurse\" is the best song. in fact, there really in't a weak song to be found there. My only complaint with Widow City is the way it ends.

The craziness has now been taken to a whole new level. Just as Michael Jackson crossed the bad barrier to get good, the Fiery Furnaces crossed the strange barrier to get good. I'm not sure, but it seems a lot tastier now. It must have something to do with the guitar: Bitter Tea suffered from a black from it. They also seem to have a better grip on the song lengths: Both Bitter Tea and Blueberry Boat suffered from songs that lasted at least two times three minutes too long. Genre shopping is still intact, but it's a lot more fun this time around: Widow City sounds almost like ween diced in some places, complete with crazy, slowed-down vocals (but less the overuse of Backward-Jones, thankfully). One thing that I disagree with in other reviews is that this album should be enjoyed in small doses. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE! For me, you have to listen to it in full, preferably through good headphones. The heart of the way I hear it is Navy Nurse, it builds up to that point and then the chorus kicks in and it's pure bliss. It just pounds over your head how cute this stuff is, and that's not to say that \"Navy Nurse\" is the best song. in fact, there is really no weak song to be found there. My only complaint with Widow City is the end. The abrupt end doesn't work for me there. a drawn out chord would have been better and would have had a few seconds to digest this feast of sound.","overall":5,"summary":"YES, just YES","unixReviewTime":1193356800,"reviewTime":"10 26, 2007"}

Add to this both this masterful violin-ery and what's left for the listener to contemplate is their jealousy that such an artist can combine such disparate elements within the sphere of rock in' roll and not only make it work, but elevate it to uncharted territory. Noble Beast is just another in an increasing line of infallible releases by Bird. Make no mistake, this sound is subtle, most likely unrewarding to the new and impatient listener. This may be due to the multitude of sonic layering that Bird incorporates into this music: sharp plucking over flowing yet abbreviated melodies from this violin while this sparse electric guitar charges the listener with some occasional voltage, all brought together with a usually muted though sweeping percussion provided by Martin Dosh. Vocally, Bird's voice is nearly as understated as Sam Beam's from Iron and Wine, but lyrically this songs and themes align more closely toward those of Modest Mouse. Alienation, isolation, and accelerated contemplation are Bird's main proclivities. Not much different from from this prior masterpieces The Mysterious Production of Eggs and Armchair Apocrypha, Noble Beast is yet another example of Bird's further ascent into infinity. Standout tracks include On Ho, Fitz and the Dizzyspells, Effigy, Tenuousness, Natural Disaster, The Privateers and Souverian.","overall":5,"summary":"Tenuously uncharted territory","unixReviewTime":1248998400,"reviewTime":"07 31, 2009"}

Noble Beast ist nur eine weitere in einer zunehmenden Reihe von unfehlbaren Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen von Bird. Machen Sie keinen Fehler, dieser Klang ist subtil und h\u00f6chstwahrscheinlich nicht lohnend f\u00fcr den neuen und ungeduldigen H\u00f6rer.

Stutheit \"Teyad\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Ex-frontman Layne Staley was cut down in the prime of life, passing away at the ripe old page of thirty-four back in the year two thousand and two, but the remaining members of Alice In Chains eventually pressed-on without him, releasing their fourth studio album, \"Black Gives Way To Blue,\" in two thousand and nine. It was their first album in fourteen whole, excruciating years, and the first on a new record label (Virgin\/EMI), and with a new producer (Nick Raskulinecz). And in Staley's spot is new lead vocalist William DuVall, and co-lead singer Jerry Cantrell (who has been with the band since their inception all the way back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety). Together the vocal duo does an overall excellent -- if not perfect -- job at filling in for Layne's now vacant shoes. But you, no doubt, already knew all that. What should come as an almost complete surprise, though, is the sound and style of the new album. Brutal and breathtaking, \"Black. \" is both AIC's heaviest and most experimental effort to date. It shuffles back and forth between no-holds-barred, headbanging doom metal and melodic, involved prog rock. And only occasionally does it are-venture back into the grungy sound of old.\"All Secrets Known\" is a terrifically dreamy, moaning, and progressive intro track with calm, distant, almost operatic-sounding backing clean vocals and other minor-key melodies. As such, it is made into a very atmospheric, bomber, and faintly docile opening mood enhancer. But immediately following this comes \"Check My Brain,\" a piece of almost pure doom metal with crunchy, meaty, repetitively lumbering, Black Sabbath-esque riffing and a thundering groove that even hints at some Meshuggah stuff. Some catchy vocals and random guitar shredding are also slipped into the background for good measure. Splitting the difference between these two above-described tracks is \"Last Of My Kind\" which begins with a stripey intro before slamming into a mean, meaty, muscularly churning riff iced with catchy, robotic-sounding vocals. And later on in the song, it uncork a surprisingly cloud and chaotic, shredding solo, and some whammy-bar-inflected lead work. Moving on down the line, \"Your Decision\" is a nice acoustic strummed with a solid, flowing, melodically humming bass groove, and a deliciously melodic, jazzy-sounding guitar solo. And the use of hooky, crooned vocals and really memorable lyrics make \"Your Decision\" practically scream out to become a hit single. This tune, however, is offset by the record's lead single, \"A Looking In View,\" which seems really thunderous, aggressive, and even brutal -- especially when compared to the song that preceded it. It plunges out of the speakers with a huge, nasty, doom-soaked riff slice that recalls the glory days of Sabbath, UFO, Ozzy Osbourne, and Deep Purple. And with a booming, bottom-heavy bottom-end added to the mix, the send result is a very, distinctly metallic number, and one that evokes some Neurosis and Sleep songs, thus making it quite possibly the heaviest moment to be found anywhere on this record. But then comes another down-tempo and subtly restrained jam in \"When The Sun Rose Again,\" which boasts a sweetly prog-ish, mildly-mannered acoustic guitar lead. It is also complete with nearly funky-sounding hand percussion, clean and kind of jazzy vocals, and a Southern rock-derived guitar solo. Back on the heavy side, though, is \"Acid Bubble,\" which comes next. An ominously dense and pounding, Tony Iommi-stylized grinding main riff comprises this song's backbone. It is a fairly simplistic, but nevertheless effective and memorable riff, and one that is accompanied by good, soaring vocals, and a strong, humming bass line. Then, a while later, \"Acid Bubble\" eventually grinds down to an ominous plod, before uncorking a lovely melodic solo section. But this nearly-seven-minute-long epic again returns to the same type of heavy, throbbing riff that was heard at its beginning, and is anchored by a flowing, grumbling bass bottom.\"Lesson Learned\" is another good, up-tempo hard rocker iced with soaring, exceptionally melodic singing and an equally-as-tasty and soaring melodic solo. Next up, \"Take Her Out\" is propelled forward by a great, muscular bass line; but the rest of the band is also of note in this song, too. See, the guitarists are heard trading-off some really great and epic soloing while Cantrell does this best Layne Staley impression, echoing the former frontman almost to the tee. \"Private Hell,\" then, is a really subdued, laid-back, restrained, and involved number, and one that boasts another beautiful melodic string arrangement alongside some majestic keyboard flourishes. And it is all capped off by an epic, wailing guitar solo, and some really huge and open choruses (with catchy, using-songy vocals). The album then concludes with its titular song, which proceeds in a manner similar to that described above, as another bomber and really atmospheric piece of mood enhancement with gobs of sweet guitar harmonies and dreamy keyboard runs. (Heck, it even branches off into a cool, angelic-sounding piano solo, there for a while.) And, of course, the closer does not forget to include plenty of warm and accomplished clean singing, too. Although \"Black Gives Way To Blue\" fails to match the brilliance achieved on such predecessors as Alice In Chains' self-titled affair, \"Dirt,\" and\/or \"Jar Of Flies,\" when taken on its own terms, it is an excellent album through and through. Furthermore, it is also definitely one of the highlights of two thousand and nine, as it is easily the best comeback not only of that year, but also of the decade. It is an album that is more-than-worthy of sample praise, which it, fortunately, has already received. Welcome back, boys; you have been sorely missed.","overall":5,"summary":"Superb!","unixReviewTime":1362960000,"reviewTime":"03 11, 2013"}

And with a booming, bottom-heavy bass end added to the mix, the send result is a very, distinctly metallic number that is reminiscent of some Neurosis and Sleep songs, which probably makes it the toughest moment you ever get can find this record. But then there's another down-tempo and subtly restrained jam on \"When The Sun Rose Again,\" which features a sweet prog-esque, meek acoustic guitar lead. It's also complete with almost funky sounding hand percussion, clear and somewhat jazzy vocals, and a guitar solo derived from Southern rock. Back on the heavy side, however, is \"Acid Bubble\" coming next. A menacingly dense and pounding main riff stylized by Tony Iommi forms the backbone of this song. It's a fairly simple, yet effective and memorable riff that is accompanied by good, soaring vocals and a strong, buzzing bass line. Then, a while later, \"Acid Bubble\" finally turns into an ominous bunch before uncorking a lovely melodic solo section. Aber dieses fast sieben Minuten lange Epos kehrt wieder zu demselben schweren, pochenden Riff zur\u00fcck, das zu Beginn geh\u00f6rt wurde, und wird von einem flie\u00dfenden, grummelnden Bassboden verankert. \"Lesson Learned\" ist ein weiteres gutes Up-Tempo Hardrocker vereist mit hochfliegendem, au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlich melodischem Gesang und einem ebenso leckeren wie hochfliegenden melodischen Solo. Als n\u00e4chstes wird \"Take Her Out\" von einer gro\u00dfartigen, muskul\u00f6sen Basslinie vorangetrieben; Aber auch der Rest der Band ist in diesem Song bemerkenswert. Sehen Sie, die Gitarristen tauschen einige wirklich gro\u00dfartige und epische Solos aus, w\u00e4hrend Cantrell diesen besten Layne Staley-Eindruck macht und den ehemaligen Frontmann fast bis zum Abschlag wiederholt. \"Private Hell\" ist also eine wirklich ged\u00e4mpfte, entspannte, zur\u00fcckhaltende und engagierte Nummer, die neben einigen majest\u00e4tischen Keyboard-Schn\u00f6rkeln ein weiteres wundersch\u00f6nes melodisches Streicherarrangement bietet. Und das Ganze wird durch ein episches, jammerndes Gitarrensolo und einige wirklich gro\u00dfe und offene Refrains (mit eing\u00e4ngigen, singenden Vocals) abgerundet. Das Album endet dann mit seinem Titelsong, der \u00e4hnlich wie oben beschrieben verl\u00e4uft, als weiterer Bomber und wirklich atmosph\u00e4rischer Stimmungsaufheller mit Klumpen s\u00fc\u00dfer Gitarrenharmonien und vertr\u00e4umten Keyboardl\u00e4ufen. (Verdammt, es verzweigt sich sogar in ein k\u00fchles, engelsgleich klingendes Piano-Solo, dort f\u00fcr eine Weile.) Und nat\u00fcrlich vergisst der Abschluss nicht, viel warmen und versierten Clean-Gesang zu enthalten. Obwohl \"Black Gives Way To Blue\" nicht an die Brillanz von Vorg\u00e4ngern wie Alice In Chains' selbstbetitelter Aff\u00e4re \"Dirt\" und\/oder \"Jar Of Flies\" heranreicht, ist es f\u00fcr sich genommen ein durch und durch ausgezeichnetes Album. Dar\u00fcber hinaus ist es definitiv auch eines der Highlights von zweitausendneun, da es mit Abstand das beste Comeback nicht nur dieses Jahres, sondern auch des Jahrzehnts ist.

Wafflestein \"The Music Collector\"","helpful":[3,8],"reviewText":"I was left with feelings of shock, awe, and pleasant surprise after my first listen of A Thousand Suns from front to back. I had set my expectations very low for this album after hearing Minutes to Midnight, but now I can say that this album has changed everything I had thought about Linkin Park again. If you felt like the band had had crashed and burned on Minutes to Midnight, then this album is the sound of them rising from the ashes like a glorious phoenix. True, none of the songs crunch with the gnu-metal tinged guitars of Hybrid Theory for Meteora, and Mike and Chester haven't returned back to taking turns wrapping and singing, but the songs there hit with the same level of power and energy (\"When They Come For Me\", \"Wretches and Kings\", and \"The Catalyst\" are all great examples). In fact, if you ask me, Linkin Park has never sounded better. They've even added variety to their song structures, something that I felt their early albums suffered a black of (the verses on \"Burning in the Skies\" are set to an unusual six\/four time signature, and still manage to flow smoothly and sound like a natural fit). There's more electronica influences scattered across the album as well, like the swaying dubstep beat on \"Robot Boy\", the nervous drill in bass styled kick drums on \"The Catalyst\", and and glitchy voice warping stutters in the bridge section of \"Blackout\". Lastly, the album seems to follow a continuous theme, both lyrically and musically. I've always found this album best when listened to in one sitting, which lets the album flow harmoniously like one long piece, and gives more meaning to its \"interludes\" like \"Jornada del Muerto\" and \"Wisdom, Justice, and Love\". The only song that feels out of place there is the album's closer, \"The Messenger\" which feels disconnected from the rest of the album with its earthy guitar ballad feel. I feel like it would have been much more climatic to close with the previous track \"The Catalyst\" and to exclude latter one altogether. A Thousand Suns may not be a return to their roots, but its a welcome step in the right direction. Here's hoping that Linkin Park keeps on exploring new possibilities in this style!","overall":5,"summary":"A Welcome Step in the Right Direction","unixReviewTime":1304726400,"reviewTime":"05 7, 2011"}

They both do not know how to expand their sound beyond a few changes. In McKennitt's case, she started Celtic and then gradually introduced Arabic folk to her sound with one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's \"The Visit\". But like Enya, McKennitt does not appear motivated to grow beyond that point, thus she has steadily refined what she already knows since \"The Visit\". Prior to that album you can hear how she continued to grow musically, but after her speak in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four with \"The Mask And Mirror\", she really has't grown much musically. So, like Enya, it's always pleasant to hear something new every few years, but there's nothing to get really excited about there. \"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\" is McKennitt are-visiting her Celtic roots for the first time in many years, this time with a mature, wiser perspective, but it just ends up sounding like a typical McKennitt album with nothing new. If McKennitt had not released this album I wonder if anyone would have truly minded. Every McKennitt album is good, no less than three stars, and each one has some good songs and some that are completely forgettable. Most of her albums are uneven in the sense that she rarely strikes gold and thoroughly fleshes out her songs, making each one stand on its own. You could literally exchange songs from different albums and you would not know any differently. So, for me, it was one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven, and my introduction to McKennitt was \"The Mummer's Dance\". It had hit the top forty radio in some freakish example of how popular radio can embrace all genres of music for a minute, but not support them later on down the road. Then she was gone for a decade, theoretically mourning the loss of her fiance in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. Understandable. I would not have been surprised if she had never returned to music at all, but in two thousand and six she came back, and never two years we are treated to her angelic voice.

I understand that as time changes, we must all change over time. Look, people are trying to get it. Eric Benet really doesn't have to change and even if that doesn't change over time, we will at least continue to hold onto one of the best voices and true singers of this generation. I never thought that the \"Hurricane\" could top it, but I think I was wrong. this is an excellent cd and i can warmly recommend this project to all of you. Stand out from this project. \"Always A Reason\", \"Never Want To Live Without You\", \"Sometimes I Cry\", \"Stir It Up\" and the title track \"Lost In Time\". His falsetto has to be one of the best in this business of fake studio singers and fools trying to get attention from what they didn't even leave the industry. (Trey Songs) Note. Note.","overall":5,"summary":"Another Great CD in this Era of Non Singing Fools!!!!","unixReviewTime":1291161600,"reviewTime":"12 1, 2010"}
