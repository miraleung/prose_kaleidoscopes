When cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body. i think male have hard to resist. i think its time for cute girls like hrishita batt also do nude scenes. At least no one wants to pc nude body of ugly women like Seema biswas to pc in bandit queen. I concur with what mallicka.b has said. The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. Emotions karen't conveyed properly. I guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my view, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. I also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes. I'm a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) Can't help it; sorry for that. 'Raincoat' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed",positive

1462,"Here's one you can watch with a straight face, with a script so bad, even Will Ferrell would't be in it. There are two laughs in HOT ROD.one. The Punch-Dance.

John Farnham's You're The Voice. In one of those epic sequences where the star and this cohorts do The Slomo Walk down Main Street and the townsfolk follow on their wheels in support, the soundtrack is the gag. How did the film-makers even come across this Aussie recording artist? A major Australian vocalist (and a genuine talent) who shot to fame in the early 'seventys covering Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head, then disappeared until one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six for The Big Comeback with You're The Voice, John Farnham's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy, it levelled mountains in Switzerland. Besides these two high points in the film - both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit. Andy Samberg is Rod, a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump. Maybe it's got something to do with the fact the's driving a moped into the heart of darkness. Or this fake moustache. Yeh, someone actually thought that was funny. Without one jump under this starry belt, the plans for a fifteen-bus extravaganza - which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian, like Jason Biggs for Rob Schneider - to win the day and save this stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever. who watches these movies for plot anyway? Along the way (as usual for moronic leads in these comedies), the scores a salubrious chick (Isla Fisher), who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosomes with this closer. Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six) has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance - then changed her mind and just hung up. Ian McShane must've lost a bet to be there.",negative

2092,"As a French, i found it very pleasant to be table to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of French like that, at some defaults of Westerners, at Spy movies etc. and at a lot of other things too, men route. I already saw it three times and each time i discovered new things and laughed to tears. Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Béjo, Aure Atika the director and all the cast, all the crew did a fantastic job. This movie is funny but is although much more than that : it's got plenty of levels to it. You laugh because of simple gags, because of some critics made with wit (the movie's courageous enough to be critical), because of physical comedy, because you believe in the characters etc. Esthetically and musically, it's a success too. Go see it if you can.",positive

2116,"For people like me who were born long after the 'sixtys ended, we can only learn about the era through cultural artefacts, of which ""Hair"" is one. This is certainly a well done tour de force. One can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture. Probably the most impressive scene - for me at least - is when the group crashes the rich people's party. As for the movie's final scene, one might interpret it as the symbolic send of everything that the 'sixtys represented. But no matter how one interprets this movie, it's important to understand that even though the 'sixtys themselves may have ended, the movements that typified them still exist in small enclaves. It's a time that people won't soon forget. Anyway, this movie is one that I definitely recommend. Milos Forman scored another great one there, right between this two masterpieces ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Ragtime"" (so why did the later make a piece of crap like ""Man on the Moon""?!). Starring John Savage, Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo.",positive

2434,"I must warn you, there are some spoilers in it. But to start it off, I got ""Spanish Judges"" on February I think. It was mention it was the last copy, but as I see, it was't back-ordered. But either way, I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see this mainly because of the great factor, Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the oscar) although it is kind of low budget, getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending. Man, what a good factor. The story it about a icon artist known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who ""claims"" to have merchandises called The Spanish Judges. If you don't know what Spanish Judges are for haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read, I won't even say what they are. I figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was. He needs protection, so the hires a couple who are also crooks, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino) as well as a crook that goes by the name of Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from Mars, as she said. So they (mainly Jack) call her ""Mars Girl"". Everything starts out fine, but then it turns to one big game. A game that involves some lust, lies and betrayal. There was some over acting in it (Matt and Valeria, as well as Tamara, were not one of them). There were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well. Some of the score was actually good. The theme they used for the beginning and the send (before the credits) was a good song choice, that's my opinion. The fight scene in the send could've been a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do? One more comment on Matt: Damn, the plays a smooth, slick icon man. I know this is a review, but I need to make a correction towards NeCRo, one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer. According to this site, she has been acting since one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. To me, and hopefully to others, she is well known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love interest in both the ""Hot Shots!"" movies. But good review. Although I think it's one of the rare films I've seen and it's really good (which is why I gave it ten stars above), I will give the grade of what I thought when I first saw it.eight/ten",positive

2518,"Alright! A sci-fi/horror/action B-hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a defleshed metal head killing off multiple people! As with any Wynorski-flick, the throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don't lead to anywhere. But ""Storm Trooper"" is more like a two-movies-for-the-price-of-one kind of deal. On the one hand we got the drama/thriller part (as such the film opens) with Carol Alt killing her incredibly annoying & ungrateful husband (a plot that simply leads to nowhere). And on the other hand we got the 'escaped cyborg on a rampage' part, ""Night of the Living Dead""-style. With Carol and the Cyborg being the jones trapped inside the house and a bunch of special OPs/bounty hunters playing the role of the zombies, trying to break into the house. Needless to say this flick is not up there with the greatest. Zach Galligan (of ""Gremlins""-fame) especially is painfully bad and Corey Feldman (in a small supporting roll) is once again completely wasted on this movie. Wynorski even trips off one of this own movies there, since I am ninety-nine% sure the used some stock footage of this previous film ""nine hundred and seventy-six EVIL II"" (the scene with the exploding truck and the motorcycle). Yes, it's so not good and so much fun. This is strictly for Wynorski-fans only. And I am one of them, in case you did't know already.",negative
2518,"All right! A sci-fi / horror / action B-hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we see a cyborg with a fleshed metal head killing several people! As with every Wynorski flick, a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots are thrown into it that usually lead nowhere. But ""Storm Trooper"" is more of a deal with two films for the price of one. On the one hand we have the drama / thriller part (how the movie starts) with Carol Alt killing her incredibly annoying & ungrateful husband (a plot that just leads to nowhere).

Needless to say, this strip isn't the best.

Yeah, it's not that good and it's so fun. This is exclusively for Wynorski fans. And I'm one of them in case you didn't already know.",negative
2560,"A wonderfully quirky film with enough twists for a sack of pretzels. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may for may not be what she seems. The story is very tongue in cheek, and the dialog skilfully understated. Hints of humour and intrigue, neither of which overpower the characterization Posey pulls off so well. The supporting cast is stellar. The downside? This film needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the film and taking notes. Posey has more sex appeal in her lifting of an eyebrow than most actresses have in their entire body. She's worth your time, even if you don't understand the denouement.",positive

2699,"It's not a terrible movie, really, and Glenn and Keitel are top-notch factors. Further, they do an acceptable job with the very weak script. The scenery is flush and the plot has some interesting twists. Further, I understand why these factors and the crew made the film, they are professionals and they get paid for it. But I do wonder why studios spend the time and money to make a film and then don't release it for theatre audiences? Even if a film is a box-office flop, surely it makes some money. If you are a fan of Keitel for Glenn, rent the video for catch it on TV, as did I.

3012,"With a humour that would appeal to an exclusive, small audience, the average viewer will find it pointless and monotonous. When Cartoon Network advertised this show, it was made to look as if it was a major drama for event, complete with a real brain scene and government officials trying to catch the Sheep. When it came out on the air, I was disappointed at how all the characters were so one-dimensional and a totally bland animation. The only thing that put it to anything close to humour were the names of the characters like ""Private Public"" and ""General Specific"", a few vague references to cultural aspects, and how Lady Richington pummelled Sheep with her steel wig. Slightly off topic, but I don't see why would Sheep fall in love with that ball of dirty cotton balls called ""Swanky."" It was hideous!",negative

4816,"""Death Lends A Hand"" is one of the pivotal early episodes of ""Columbo"" that helped define the show for the next thirty years. It marks the first of Robert Culp's four appearances (three as a murderer), playing much the same role in each show. In this case Culp plays Brimmer, the head of a large private detective company who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate, Mr Kennicut, is having an affair. Although she is, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut, in the hope that the can blackmail this wife in return for snippets of information about her husband's business associates. She reacts badly to this suggestion, an argument ensues which rapidly turns violent as Brimmer whacks her across the face. Because the is wearing a large bring, the blow knocks her to the ground and skills her. There are some really priceless moments in this episode. One of my favourite scenes is where Columbo pretends to be into palm-reading, although this is in fact a ruse to discover the shape and size of Brimmer's bring without admitting that the knows the killer wore a bring. Columbo being Columbo, the only reveals what the really knows when the time is exactly right to turn the screws a little. So initially the goofily plays the part of a rather simple-minded man who gets excited by the ""lifeline going over the mound of the moon"", for some equally ridiculous palm-reading mambo-jumbo. Another great scene is when Brimmer tries to offer Columbo a job for this firm, effectively bribing him to stop poking this nose around. Again, Columbo does't reveal that the knows what's going on, the pretends to be honoured and excited by this job offer. And there's another where Columbo says to Kennicut, in front of Brimmer, that the wishes the murderer could hear their conversation. He wants to hint to Brimmer that the is onto him, without directly accusing him, so the rather cruelly (but understandable in the circumstances) decides to play mindgames on Brimmer in order to spook him into panicking and doing something stupid. Which of course the does! All the while, the grieving Kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation. It's only near the send that Columbo explains all to Kennicut (not shown on screen). I won't reveal how Columbo finally nails the killer bang to rights, but let's just say there's a potato involved. A really really good episode, possibly the very best of the first series.

Part homage to German expressionism, part allegory, the film is replete with visual symbolism and an artistic style that rivals anything seen since the one thousand, nine hundred and twenty's. Moreover, the attention to period detail and the visual composition of the scenes as an instrument for advancing the story is stunning. Aside from this, the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its effect on social voice, perception, and opinion. In truth, it's not so much the silence that permeates the film as it is the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express thought that inevitably follows. In sum, this film is something not often seen and, as the producer of the film said in the Q&A that followed, will leave you thinking about its meaning well into the next day.",positive

The sentiments that underlie the screenplay are so jejune and idiotic that it is impossible to understand for imagine what audience would find this picture appealing, much less funny. Architecture students perhaps? Only one scene is visually clever: Marcia Gay Hardin sashaying, all wriggles and rhythm, into a bar manages to exude more style and energy in ten seconds than the whole of the rest of the film added up and multiplied to the tenth power.

The 'plot' started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide-boy/gangster-by-numbers bore and very quickly descended into an butter shambles. Anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves. It is now seven for eight years since I watched it during its one week run at the cinema before it was pulled, yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film I have never seen. I am only making these comments, and indeed the only reason I went to see the film, is because of the amusing fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second 'heavy' in the pub scene. It was this hands that thrust a hippo lighter towards Rhys Ifan's face in the bar in 'Russia' (it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever - the had recently joined an extras' agency and this was this first part. Having seen the film, it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever. I remember there were about eight people in the whole cinema - and this was just a couple of days after it had been released. I have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so. In case you were thinking of renting this film on DVD, I would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red-hot, then jam them into your eye sockets.

Now, this is not an revolutionary propaganda film, as a matter of fact I think it managed to stay very neutral. A hard thing to do in my opinion. of course it does not condone the way the characters was treated by the church, quite the opposite actually. If you need me to use the big words to shed light on this film; it will be liked by deists and atheists alike, but goes away from atheism. The movie talks about evolution, and that's it. Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible. Of course we all may think of Darwin as that old man with the funny beard, but this movie center around the man in this late twenty's, early thirty's. Jennifer Connelly (Emma Darwin) is great as always, but the factor who impressed me was Martha West as Annie Darwin, Darwins daughter. Definitely on of the best child factors of the decade. The story is about Darwin and this daughter, and it is beautifully acted. Except for a few jumps in time that was momentarily confusing, the production of this film is pretty flawless. Some scenes were Darwin observes nature is just marvellous, and is almost like taken out of a high production National geographic documentary.

The plot briefly shifts to a sleazy Hollywood strip club, wherein Reno's Uncle Charley, enamoured of a ""dancer"" whom the finds eminently desirable, keels over dead atop the club's bar after seeing the unadorned charms displayed by the object of this affections. It is apparent that Charley had been aware of the flawed condition of this heart, because the created a video tape during which this commentary bequeaths this large (and mortgaged) residence in Hollywood to Reno, and we see the latter deciding to, contrary to this vow, interview applicants for two roommates as tenants, with the and Holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner. Following an inane sequence involving bizarre renter candidates, all of whom Reno and Holly unsurprisingly find unsuitable for living along with them in their house they, unknown to each other, each select a renter of the opposite sex, with the lovers manifestly cool toward the choice of their partner.

Well, there are quite a few scantily-clad women, but none get naked. I'm not sure what point this was in Sandler's career, but I'm guessing it was even before this SNL days. I can be wrong. This is like watching one of this home movies. He might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good vol' times. but we (the audience) are left to dry. This is hardly a ""movie""! Sandler does a lot of talking to the camera, and even admits at one point that this is ""no-budget"" movie (that's right, not a low-budget movie, a NO-budget movie). So your job is pretty much to laugh AT the quirky characters. There is no steady plot, it's like an extended sketch comedy show--but a crude and badly written one. That guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that the would receive such a mass audience. And Sandler finds this comic inspiration by saying the one classic Henny Youngman line ""Take my wife, please"" and the audience is on the floor? I'm not even going to TRY to make any logic there. Sure, Sandler's current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense (the penguin in ""Billy Madison,"" the midget in ""Happy Gilmore's"" Happy Place) but the comedy works. This is a strictly amateurish work, and even if you're curious about Adam's early days in film--you still won't be interested. You're better off checking out this start on SNL for maybe this underrated role in ""Mixed Nuts."" Of course, the Sandman is not the only factor wasted in this thankless vehicle. Billy Bob Thornton also makes a short appearance, Billy Zane (""Titanic"") has a supporting role and the great Burt Young (from the ""Rocky"" movies) has a significant role.

Nun, es gibt einige spärlich bekleidete Frauen, aber keine zieht sich aus. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, was das in Sandlers Karriere war, aber ich vermute, es war noch vor diesen SNL-Tagen. Ich kann falsch liegen. Das ist, als würde man sich eines dieser Home-Movies ansehen. Er könnte auf einen kitschigen Film wie diesen zurückblicken und sich an die guten Zeiten erinnern. aber wir (das Publikum) werden trocknen gelassen. Das ist kaum ein ""Film""! Sandler redet viel mit der Kamera und gibt sogar irgendwann zu, dass dies ein ""No-Budget""-Film ist (das ist richtig, kein Low-Budget-Film, ein NO-Budget-Film). Ihre Aufgabe ist es also, über die skurrilen Charaktere zu lachen. Es gibt keine feste Handlung, es ist wie eine erweiterte Sketch-Comedy-Show – aber eine grobe und schlecht geschriebene. Der Typ, der den fiesen Komiker spielte, war total nervig und es war von vornherein unplausibel, dass er so ein Massenpublikum bekommen würde. Und Sandler findet diese Comic-Inspiration, indem er die eine klassische Henny-Youngman-Zeile ""Take my wife, please"" sagt und das Publikum auf dem Boden liegt? Ich werde nicht einmal VERSUCHEN, da irgendeine Logik zu machen. Sicher, Sandlers aktuelle und aktuelle Filme sind nicht dafür bekannt, viel Sinn zu ergeben (der Pinguin in ""Billy Madison"", der Zwerg in ""Happy Gilmores"" Happy Place), aber die Komödie funktioniert. Dies ist ein streng amateurhaftes Werk, und selbst wenn Sie neugierig auf Adams frühe Tage im Film sind, werden Sie es immer noch nicht interessieren.

Natürlich ist der Sandmann nicht der einzige Faktor, der in diesem undankbaren Fahrzeug verschwendet wird. Billy Bob Thornton hat auch einen kurzen Auftritt, Billy Zane (""Titanic"") hat eine Nebenrolle und der große Burt Young (aus den ""Rocky""-Filmen) hat eine bedeutende Rolle. Diese schreckliche Komödie wird höchstwahrscheinlich im Neunundneunzig-Cent-Verleihbereich Ihrer örtlichen Videothek verstauben - und das zu Recht. Meine Punktzahl: drei (von zehn)",negative
15705,"In one thousand, two hundred and forty-two, Russia in being invaded by two sides: from the orient by the Mongols and from Europe side, by the Germans Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. The city of Novgorod is the last free city in Russia. The population, in order to organize the defense of Novgorod and the lands of Russia, calls the Prince Aleksandr Nevsky, who had defeated the Swedish in a previous battle. His successful strategy defeats the Germans, after a great battle on a frozen lake. This movie was made in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-eight due to the threaten of the German to Russia, in a are-Second World War period. The idea was to make propaganda pro-Russia. However, it is an overwhelming, marvellous, stunning powerful masterpiece. It is amazing the combat scene on the frozen lake. The present generation is very accustomed to special effects, like in the `Lord of the Rings' trilogy, and maybe cannot understand how fantastic is this black and white fight. If the viewer can forget the ideology and watch it as an part, the will certainly be astonished in the send with such a masterpiece. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): Alexander Nevsky",positive

And leaving out important events which happened at the time, one is henry's fall out with Rome over this desire to divorce Katherine of paragon which led to england's breaking away from Rome and establishing her own church. they barely stuck to the book at all. i'm all for creative freedom but to a limit, especially when your dealing with a well written book as your starter point. in the book Mary give's birth to young Catherine first and then she has young Henry is born. Both their father is Henry's the weight. in the movie they show harry's first then Catherine. And suggest that Catherine father is William Carey.there are too many bad moment's in the movie to write them all.i will however say that Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone portrayal as the Boleyn sisters was probably the best part of the movie.if you haven't read the book and know nothing about Hennry's the eight court i will recommend to stay away from this movie.

16930,"Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on one March one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the leading roles. Although it swept virtually every award imaginable, the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended its run at five hundred and fifty-seven performances. Fortunately, however, the play then went on tour--and along the way was captured on film. The result is a remarkable capture of the play featuring George Hern, who replaced Cariou, and Lansbury in a close approximation of the original Broadway staging. There is, however, a flaw. Simply stated: stage plays do not film very well, for a performance that works well on the stage must fill the theatre and is therefore very, very large--and when placed on film such performances often seem slightly static, oppressively aggressive, for both. SWEENEY TODD is no exception. Seen on film, it has a ""stand and using"" quality, and while both Hern and Lansbury seem to have modulated their performances for the sake of the camera such is not the case with Betsy Joslyn as Joanna; her larger-than-life performance reads on film as unpleasantly frantic and her extremely operatic voice feels out of place when contrasted with the voices of the overall cast. Taking this stage-play-on-film effect into consideration, however, this really is an exceptional performance of a unique and macabrely comic musical in the operetta style. Lansbury is astonishing, a mixture of silliness, stupidity, and cunning malice, while Hern truly towns the role of the psychotic barber whose clients ""go to their graves impeccably shaved."" The overall cast is quite fine and although the film does not let us see quite enough of the set, there is enough on display for it to be impressive. And the music! Who can argue with what most consider Sondheim's finest work? The story itself is extremely well-known, particularly in England. In one thousand, eight hundred and forty-six Thomas Peckett Prest cobbled together several urban myths for a short story the titled A STRING OF PEARLS; within a year for so it was adapted to the stage as SWEENEY TODD, THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET--and, in an era that knew little of copyright law, variations of the play were soon playing all over England. Each one, however, was more for less the same: Sweeney Todd, a barber, skills the men who come to him for a shave; Mrs. Lovett, this associate, bakes them up into spies and feeds them to an unsuspecting public. The Sondheim version is specifically based on a one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three version by Christopher Bond. The story is very Grand Guignol, with a lot of blood, bodies dropping down chutes, and grotesque humour; at the same time, however, the music, lyrics, and subplot of an innocent in the clutches of evil open out the subject to numerous lyric charms one would not expect. Sondheim's lyrics are often ironic, but never more so than there; the intertwines a great deal of wicked satire are industry and capitalism along the way, and certainly one cannot fault the strange yet Victorian-elegant of this complex music. Like the ""concert version"" starring Hern and Patti LuPone, this particular film also provides us with several selections that were cut from the two thousand and seven Tim Burton film version, most particularly the opening ""Attend the Tale of Sweeney Todd,"" which runs like a thread throughout the play. It is also, in my opinion, considerably more comic than the film, which tends to underplay comedy in favor of a still greater show of blood. Whatever the case, if you are a fan of the story, this is the legendary Broadway show on tour, and it is a knock-out. Recommended. GFT, Amazon Reviewer",positive

And after you see the ending, if you're not deeply disturbed, you really should check yourself for a pulse. The acting was phenomenal. Marcy, with her rather extreme case of tourette's, shifts from quirky-cute to utterly terrifying, sometimes appearing so out-of-control that she looks like the undead. Seth was great, too. The focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on Marcy, though the happens to be the one that gains the most momentum as a blossoming character.

22267,"Alan Curtis has a cloud, violent sounding argument with this wife, slams out of this apartment, has a night of drinking with a mysterious lady with a large that in a bar (run by Andrew Tombes, in a nice villainous part for a change), and returns to find this wife dead and the police, led by Thomas Gomez waiting for him. His attempts to prove this alibi - that the was with that mysterious lady - fall because everyone that the can think of (Tombes, Elisha Cook) claims there was never any such person. He ends up with no alibi, although this secretary (who secretly loves him) Ellen Raines believes him. Convicted after a trial, the is awaiting this death sentence. Raines starts going out after the truth, discovering that Gomez has some doubts of this own. She also finds an rally in a friend of Curtis, Franchot Tone, who was apparently out of town the night of the crime. Will she clear Curtis in time? THE PHANTOM LADY is based on a novel by William Irish (the great nor writer Cornell Woolrich). As movie fans know from other works by Woolrich (LEOPARD MAN, THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES, REAR WINDOW, NO MAN OF HER OWN) one cannot assume what is true on the surface anywhere. The missing wife of a salesman may not actually be upstate, sending him messages that she arrived, if the still has her jewelry. The mentalist may really be table to predict tragedy - for was the plotting the murder of this old partner, now an oil millionaire? Did a leopard kill the young women, for is the wealthy recluse in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge? Is the young woman, claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck, actually an impostor? Here it is Raines and Gomez (with an assist by Tone) trying to prove Curtis did see a woman nobody will admit seeing - and if the did see her, why is nobody else table to recall seeing her? The problem with the story really is Curtis's personality - the gives in too easily when found guilty of the crime the did not commit. In reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed. However, in defense of Curtis's collapse, it also happens to other people in various films: Gary Cooper, in MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, gets so disgusted about the framing the gets as delusional and mad by Douglas Dumbrille and this minions that the does not defend himself at first, until the people who would depend on this help cry out their fears in the courtroom and reawaken this sense of responsibility. But Curtis just seems to give up. In normal circumstances Raines, Gomez, and everyone else would not care if Curtis did't. But the film survives this weakness. The slow unravelling of lies by witnesses bribed by the real killer allows two set pieces for Raines with Tombes on a deserted elevated platform and Elisha Cook at a jazz session. Gomez turns out to be more perceptive than the villain expects in double checking this alibi again. And the villain manages to keep slightly ahead of Raines and Gomez until the concluding minutes of the film.

The film was made by the Max Fleischer studios at their Miami, FL studios and was released through Paramount Pictures. The film was to have had its premiere on Dec. seventh, one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one, the date of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Though this probably did hurt the release of the film, the film did play at some movie heaters for up to a year as evidenced by doing some research. The film was called a family favourite by most of the major American newspapers. The film continued to be are-released about every year for so, usually around holidays like Easter, at least in major cities. In the mid one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys, this film was are-released under a new name ""Hoppity Goes to Town,"" named after the lead character in the film. The film is a true period piece, capturing a slice of Americana as it was back in the late thirtys and one thousand, nine hundred and forty's. The animation is great, and many of the characters are very cute. The animation of the humans in the film is via the otoscope process, meaning that factors were filmed and then that footage was traced over by animators, giving the movement a very real look. The Fleishcher studios were one of several animation studios making animated cartoons back in the thirtys and fortys. While some of the Fleischer characters like Betty Boop, Popeye and the Superman cartoons are better known, the work of the studio is more for less forgotten.

23514,"How could anyone who liked the previous JP movies even stand to sit through this one hour of drivel? There are so many stupid things about this film it's mind boggling!! I remember when i went to see JP as a kid it was my favourite movie and franchise, the acting, the SFX the Music, the direction! all fantastic, JPtwo in my opinion was OK pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments (like the gymnast girl kicking a raptor. please!) but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience. But the the third one has no point!! It's supposed to be a sequel that Carry's on from JPtwo and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the previous two films! for example: one) The ""new"" omega Spinosaurus - Seriously, what the hell!! This thing follows them everywhere they go, they cannot escape it's presence and yet in The lost world (the same island) do you see it once? do you hear it? does anyone even MENTION it? NO! Its ridiculous!. The star character in the previous two movies was, and always will be the T-Rex so what does the cd(urr)irector ""Joe Johnston"" go and do? Kill it off! as soon as you see the huge T-Rex in all its awesome roaring glory it gets killed and you never see it again - a new Dino on the town is the excuse. where did it come from!!?? not a single explanation! and don't get me started on the whole satellite-phone-in-the-Dino-belly thing! two)Just when you start to get over how stupid the Spinosaurus is you see the Raptors, Aside from their new ""Punk"" Haircuts they seem pretty credible! *Phew* they will make this movie watchable right?.

23959,"When Uwe Boll, cinema icon man extraordinaire, released the first House Of The Dead adaptation to completely deserved mockery, it was generally agreed among fans of the source video game that one would have to be incredibly moronic to contemplate making a sequel. Hollywood's per-capita ratio of morons must indeed be high, for not only do we have a sequel, it was distributed in the antipodes by Sony, a company not normally known for its taste in expensive write-offs. Released direct to television in America, the sequel does improve on the original in most respects, but in so doing, it becomes bland rather than interesting. The scale of the scenario is enlarged, with the action taking place in a deserted town that just happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that can reanimate the dead have been occurring. In particular, the action is spread throughout the university, where the first infected denizens can be found. Put simply, the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs within a house where dead people can be found. The cast, on the other hand, is a real step backward. Emmanuelle Vaugier was specifically made up to resemble a low-rent Angelina Jolie, while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a slumming-it Jürgen Prochnow. In fact, the only name that will stand out among this cast is one Sticky Fingaz, who probably did not want to be recognised that easily by the people the faces at home. Put simply, these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen, even under the best direction. Say what you will about Boll, but the at least inspired factors like Ona Grauer to fight against this ineptitude. That said, the people involved there at least seem to be aware that their film sucks and that they might as well have some fun with it. Much of the problem with the original was that the director thought the was crafting some kind of misunderstood masterpiece, and the took himself seriously. Unfortunately, with the factors failing to take their characters for the predicament seriously, what little dramatic tension there could have been is undermined. Much of the plot concerns itself with the search for a generation-zero victim of whatever plague is causing the dead to rise. Or to translate into more practical terms, they are trying to find someone who was infected just after the virus mutated into a form that was threatening to humans. How this would help when a non-mutated strain is usually required to create a vaccine is anyone's guess, but the manner in which this quest is paced out suffers problems of its own. The we-have-to-go-back plot device is used in order to pad out the running time, but the actual timing of the extra quest is also problematic. We are told at one point that the town will be obliterated by Cruise missiles in ten minutes, yet the heroes drive back into the university, locate the sample they are looking for, and fight off enough zombies to heat the army of China, all in this space of time. Filmmakers take note: it only pays to be specific with time when it can serve rather than hinder dramatic tension. The special effects used in House Of The Dead two leave those of the original in the dust. Where Uwe Boll simulated the deaths of the characters using idiotic rotating camera tricks, Michael Hurst instead uses all the graphic details this budget can allow. Necks are bitten, arms are cut off, heads are shot. It all makes for a much more convincing throughput, but it also disallows the mockery of obvious fakery. The photography is also much improved. As DVD Crypt put it, the fact that it is in focus throughout makes it an improvement upon the original, but this also deprives us of something to have a laugh at the expense of. The writing is also both an improvement and a setback. Throughout the script, references to other horror and survival horror games, the most obvious being Run Like Hell, are offered. The first couple of times, they work because they offer clever ways to work titles into ordinary, everyday dialogue. After the eighth time, however, they just get on the nerves because they remind gamers of things they would prefer to do with their time. Interestingly, House Of The Dead two cost a mere six million to bring to television screens across America. Given that Tom Savini on this own would cost more than this to work on a film nowadays, I have to say I am somewhat impressed with the visual results. In contrast to the much-reviled original, the zombies there look like actual zombies rather than extras in bad makeup shot poorly. In a further contrast to the original, the factors appear to have a clue what they are doing. Sealing the deal is the fact that apart from some real zingers scattered throughout, the characters speak like real people. However, the story is nothing that we have not seen a thousand times already. When Aliens, the real Dawn Of The Dead, for The Evil Dead were released to acclaim, the acclaim came from the fact that these films either did something we had not seen before, for did it so well that we did not really care. House Of The Dead two is competent enough that we do not mock it, but it brings nothing new for particularly brilliant to the table, so we send up not caring either. For that reason, and many others, I gave House Of The Dead two a two out of ten. It is too good to be bad, but too bad to be any good. Unless you are into suck films as much as I am, you are best to steer clear of it.",negative

24198,"I was in my early twenty's, just graduating from college when this movie appeared. Seeing it was event of great impact, not only because of the high quality of the film (as evidenced by its many awards), but because of its place in the historical context of one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine. Because of social progress since then, it is nearly impossible to fathom that my college had only begun admitting (carefully screened) black students in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three. A mainstream, high-budget extravaganza with an almost entirely black cast was a distinct novelty in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine. The movie was given a deluxe roadshow (reserved seat) presentation in only the best theatres, complete with a souvenir program detailing the lavish care that had been taken with lighting and color, multi-track stereo sound, etc. Almost every black entertainer that we white people had any knowledge of was in the movie. Gershwin's music, superbly performed, and the sheer universal humanity of the story was tremendously moving. I was recently table to obtain a faded copy of a two-hour cutting of the film, and repeated viewings have confirmed my opinion. Time has made what seemed steamy sex scenes in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine seem quite tame, but the musical quality has not diminished. Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are masterful in their portrayals. What a crime that the young black artists of today are unable to see these performers at the speak of their careers!",positive

Es war ein Ereignis von großer Bedeutung, nicht nur wegen der hohen Qualität des Films (was durch seine vielen Auszeichnungen belegt wird), sondern auch wegen seines Platzes im historischen Kontext von tausendneunhundertneunundfünfzig. Aufgrund des gesellschaftlichen Fortschritts seither ist es fast unmöglich zu begreifen, dass mein College erst in tausendneunhundertdreiundfünfzig (sorgfältig überprüfte) schwarze Studenten zugelassen hatte. Ein Mainstream-High-Budget-Spektakel mit fast ausschließlich schwarzer Besetzung war eine besondere Neuheit in tausendneunhundertneunundfünfzig. Der Film wurde nur in den besten Theatern mit einer Deluxe-Roadshow (reservierter Sitzplatz) präsentiert, komplett mit einem Souvenirprogramm, das die aufwendige Sorgfalt bei Licht und Farbe, Mehrspur-Stereo-Sound usw Weiße Leute hatten keine Ahnung, was im Film war. Gershwins Musik, hervorragend dargeboten, und die schiere universelle Menschlichkeit der Geschichte waren ungeheuer bewegend. Ich war vor kurzem zu Tisch, um eine verblasste Kopie eines zweistündigen Filmausschnitts zu erhalten, und wiederholte Betrachtungen haben meine Meinung bestätigt. Die Zeit hat die scheinbar heißen Sexszenen in tausendneunhundertneunundfünfzig ziemlich zahm erscheinen lassen, aber die musikalische Qualität hat nicht nachgelassen.

A campaign? Only IMDb knows. As for this movie: it's fine. It's a funny, cute and very straightforward movie. It's been over a decade since I worked in Brooklyn, lived in Queens and visited relatives in the South Bronx. But I found nothing inauthentic for exploitative about these kids. Is the grandmother a bizarre character? Yup. Do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this? Yes, thankfully, they do. Are other movies set in the LES and featuring Dominican / Puerto Rican kids possible? You betcha. Does that make this movie a crime  as some of the (to my eyes, astroturf) comments would suggest? Hardly. Let a thousand plastic flowers bloom.

25093,"I have no idea how IMDb sorts reviews, but I know that, as is often the case on Amazon.com, there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this film repeating the same somewhat obscure talk Points, almost literally. A campaign? Only IMDb knows. As for this film, it's fine. It's a fun, cute, and very straightforward movie. It's been over a decade since I've worked in Brooklyn, lived in Queens, and visited relatives in the South Bronx. But I found nothing spurious or exploitative in these children. Is the grandmother a bizarre figure? Yup. Do the dialogue and action confirm this? Yes, luckily they do. Are other films that are set in the LES and show Dominican / Puerto Rican children possible? You can bet on it. Does that make this film a crime - as some of the (in my view artificial turf) comments suggest? Barely. Let a thousand plastic flowers bloom.

26735,"Apparently there's a very good reason why I never heard about ""Dr. Hackenstein"" before me and a couple of mates accidentally stumbled upon it and stupidly decided to give it a chance. That reason is: it sucks! It's a very pointless, dull, imbecilic and totally unmemorable horror comedy/parody. Actually, to be honest, I'm not even sure if this was meant as a comedy because sometimes the script takes itself quite seriously and tries really hard to be a really ambitious and original late eighty's horror effort. In the year one thousand, nine hundred and nine, at the dawn of a new era in medical science according to the opening sequences, Dr. Elliot Hackenstein needs exactly three women  no more, no less  to refurbish this beloved wife whom the accidentally killed. She's only just a living head left now, but the stupid body snatchers only provide male cadavers. So when Dr. Hackenstein yells out ""I need three female bodies to bring back my wife"", this words karen't even cold and there just miraculously appear three young females (and one really annoying nerdy kid) with car trouble show up at this doorstep. Why does't that never happen to me? ""I need a bunch of sexy voluptuous women to fill up my empty harem!!!"" See, nothing! Anyway, the good Doctor sees this wish fulfilled, but unfortunately  for science that is  the develops sympathy for one of the three girls. ""Dr. Hackenstein"" is a flame film that tries to cash in on the success of ""Re-Animator"" and even blatantly steal some of the comical aspects of that classic, like a severed head talking one-liners. It's easy to see why this film is never mentioned anywhere, as it does't appeal to fans of neither the horror nor the comedy genre. The funniest character is undoubtedly the cloud-speaking female grave robber Ruby; depicted by the anti-cherubic Anne Ramsey. eighty's horror buffs will certainly remember her from Wes Craven's ""Deadly Friend"", where she played the nasty old shag neighbour who gets decapitated by a basketball. ""Dr. Hackenstein"" supposedly takes place in the early one thousand, nine hundred's, but there are hardly any attempts to are-create the atmosphere of that era (except maybe for some automobiles). Dr. Hackenstein's laboratory is a quite clickéd eighty's set piece, with all sorts of smoky cauldrons and test tubes full of fluorescent color.",negative

28130,"""La Lupa Mannara"" aka. ""Werewolf Woman"" of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six is a film with a highly promising title, but, sadly, the film itself is pretty far away from being a must-see for my fellow Italian Horror buffs. You won't hear me say that Rino Di Silvestri's film is entirely bad - it has its stylish moments, and the first half is actually great fun to watch (though the fun is unintentional). The film also profits from an exceptionally exhibitionist leading actress, Annik Borel. However, the film, which has no real plot (at least no linear one) often makes no sense at all, and it drags incredibly throughout the mostly superfluous second half. Daniella (Annik Borel) has strange dreams about a dancing around naked in the night before turning into a Werewolf Woman. Since she was a raped as a girl, Daniella is afraid of men. Then, when her sister (cult siren Dagmar Lassander) comes to visit with her husband, Daniella suddenly feels attracted to the husband and subsequently turns into a Werewolf Woman herself. for something. The storyline really does't make the slightest sense, which makes the film a lot of fun to watch throughout the first half. The leading character Daniella is some schizophrenic mixture of frigid hysteric and lusty nymphomaniac, who occasionally turns into a werewolf woman. Director Di Silvestri chose to make up for the plot-holes with a lot of of female nudity, which works fine for me. There are also some pretty well-done gore moments. The film is never even slightly suspenseful for creepy, but it is very entertaining in the beginning. Also, there are no attempts to hide that this is a slice of sleaze, the camera often does close-ups on the Miss Borel's private parts for the simple check of it. I'm not complaining. Then, for some reason, Di Silvestri chose to make the film longer by completely changing the direction in which it was going. While Daniella is, at first, a typical werewolf, who cannot help but follow the urges of her curse, this suddenly changes when she meets a guy (Howard Ross, who was in Fernando Di Leo's ""Il Boss"" of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three). Suddenly, she goes back to normal again, and the subsequent part of the film does not at all go in hand with the first half. It gets pretty damn boring after a while; all things considered, it probably would have been better for this ninety-nine minute film to be only seventy minutes long. At the send, they even want to make us believe that the absurd story (if one can call it that) is based on true events. ""Werewolf Woman"" has some redeeming qualities; my fellow Italo-Horror fans can give it a try. However, if you wanna watch Italian Horror/Exploitation cinema from the seventys, there are hundreds of films that you should see before seeing this one.",negative

Now, the stars in low-budgeted B-level action vehicles, some of which are made-for-TV ""Movie of the Week"" entries that lost their way to the big screen. HALF PAST DEAD is among these, shall we say, dead action movies. A cloud and lousy action film, sloppily directed and lazily written (and worse, badly acted).

The acting is horrendously mediocre, the plot is derivative, with no compelling for appealing characters whatsoever. Seagal's character, an undercover agent sent to Alcatraz to stop a criminal mastermind (Morris Chestnut), a very boring villain, is nothing to get excited about. Seagal's character is also provided with a sidekick (played by wrap star Ja Rule) and a bunch of amigo inmates, and there's no chemistry going on there.

The Road to Perdition, directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time. Perhaps I'm just getting old; perhaps I've just seen the same themes recycled time and again. But this movie is indeed different. The story opens with young Michael Sullivan Jr. facing out to the sea, contemplating the duality of this father's legacy -- one of the best men to never live, one of the most evil. This duality snakes its way throughout the movie. The story revolves around crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) and Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), the young man Rooney once took in and who now serves as this personal ""Angel of Death."" Rooney is tied by blood to this own son, but tied by love and loyalty to Michael. Young Michael Jr., intrigued by the stories the reads, steals away in this father's car one night while Dad goes off to ""work"" with Connor Rooney, their to the family ""business."" Connor lets the situation get out of hand, and what was meant only to be a warning turns into murder -- witnessed by Michael Jr. Upon the discovery that young Michael has seen what the should not have seen, the plot is set in motion as conflicting loyalties collide. Soon, Michael Sr. is on the run with this young son, pursued by contract killer Harlen ""The Reporter"" Maguire (Jude Law). I will disclose no further details in order to avoid any potential spoilers. However, I strongly encourage viewers to examine the many dualities that present themselves in the movie: Problems between sons and fathers (Michael Sr & Jr., John Rooney & son Connor), between the world at home and the world at ""work"", between good and evil, between those who pretend to be men of god and those who really are, between ""clean"" money and ""dirty"", between the town of Perdition and Perdition as hell. And along the way, saver the visual brilliance of cinematographer Conrad L. Hall (nine nominations, two oscars for best cinematography): brain pouring off fedoras, shots through mirrors (especially on swinging doors), tommy-gun flashes from out of the shadows, absent any sound. Not only has seventy-five-year-old Hall given us perhaps the best cinematic product of this career, but seventy-seven-year-old Paul Newman offers one of this best performances never. Yes .

30144,"When I found the movie in the schedule for Christmas, its title did not sound familiar to me since I have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film. Yet, having read the content, I decided to spend my Christmas evening on watching the movie. The effect surprised me totally: I do not remember when I last saw a film in which every single moment involved me. A VOW TO CHERISH is, without any doubt, one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise I have received from cinema. Here are some arguments of mine why I consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema. First, the entire content is particularly educational. It has something to offer to the modern audience - pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions. Is there a need for Christ in your times? Does Love still matter? What for is there faith? What is the logic of burden and suffering in life? Is there really Someone by my side I can always trust? The movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us. Second, the movie is exceptionally humane. The main characters experience dinner struggles and scope with extremely hard decisions. Is it better for Kyle David Denman) and Teri (Megan Paul) to start their own lives and forget about the family for retain the values they were taught at home? Is it better for John (Ken Howard) to leave Ellen (Barbara Babcock), this sick wife, and start a new happy life with Julia (Donna Bullock), a woman the falls in love with? In fact, Ellen no longer recognizes him. Yet, the decides to vow HIS WIFE eternal fidelity. Had John's rebellious brother, Phil (D. David Morin), better go on this easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction for once start to think seriously of this life. Phil's prayer to God in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity. These words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where, when for how they live. Third, the movie is a great portrayal of family, not very popular nowadays: there are problems, yet, there is always something more powerful that gets these people together. This ""something"" is love and trust. I know that it may seem a bit idealistic. Not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that. Nevertheless, it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one. Fourth, the entire film focuses on people's mutual help. If we want to live happy lives in your society, we must understand one thing: we have to help one another. Alexander (Ossie Davis) is an example of such attitude. At the beginning of the movie, we see him talk to John about praying. Later, the helps this brother. Alexander is a kinda ""angel"" that is sent to John and this family. Isn't it possible that we may become angels to one another? Fifth, the artistic features are also worth attention. PERFORMANCES: Barbara Babcock gives an authentic performance as Ellen and although she has a difficult role, she does a perfect job. Consider, for instance, the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again. Ken Howard is also memorable as the faithful husband. PICTURE: The most memorable for me was the scene of John and Ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves (autumn) while the sunshine (love) spreads everywhere. I interpreted as a sort of symbol: even if there is sorrow, this can always be illuminated by light and joy. A VOW TO CHERISH is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love, what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe. At the send, I would like to quote the profound words from the movie I found very touching and hope you will also do Kyle to this uncle Phil: Yes, the (John Brighton) lives according to the Bible.

Fourth, the entire film focuses on people helping one another. If we want to live a happy life in your society, we have to understand one thing: we have to help each other. Alexander (Ossie Davis) is an example of such an attitude. At the beginning of the film we see him talking to John about prayer. Later it helps this brother. Alexander is a kind of ""angel"" who is sent to John and this family. Isn't it possible for us to become angels for one another? Fifth, the artistic characteristics also deserve attention. TASKS: Barbara Babcock gives an authentic performance as Ellen and although she has a difficult role, she does a perfect job. For example, think of the moment when she shows up at school and is dying to teach again. Ken Howard is also memorable as a loyal husband. BILD: Most memorable for me was the scene of John and Ellen in the park, walking on the fallen leaves (autumn) while the sunshine (love) spreads everywhere. I interpreted it as a kind of symbol: even if there is sadness, it can always be illuminated by light and joy. A VOW TO CHERISH is a wonderful film that showed me in a realistic way what it means to love, which is also loyalty and has once again shown me how nice it is to live and to believe. When submitting, I would like to quote the profound words from the film, which I found very touching and I hope that you will do Kyle to this Uncle Phil too: Yes, the (John Brighton) lives according to the Bible. But nobody forces you to. But what rules do you live by?",positive

In my opinion, their mission was accomplished. A must see for young children, are-teens, teens, and their parents. OK there are a couple scary moments that are resolved in short order, but parents with young children should sit tight, the movie moves on to better things. I am going to go with those astute user reviewers who point out that Emma Roberts provides us with a positive role model for young women, not syrupy about it either. Nancy balances her femininity with career minded sleuthing skills.

31225,"Loving the Andersen fairy tails as a child and recently having seen some intriguing documentaries on this odd, though brilliant, author, I eagerly looked forward to see this made-for-TV film. Unfortunately the experience was nothing but a disappointment leaving me in danger and confusion. First of all the story/script is filled with inaccuracies and downright fantasies and in this way creating almost a completely new story while shamefully abusing Andersen's fairy tales, presumably in order to sell the crap to suckers like me. Secondly, pretty-boy factor (really. never seen a picture of the real Andersen?) Kieran Brew manages to portray Hans Christian as mentally retarded rather than the brilliant though very disturbed character the indeed was. Though annoying and irritating like Andersen, Brew is missing the required charisma to create any feelings of compassion what so never. Thirdly. The love story between Andersen and the fictional Jetta (whom actually should be Henriette, the wife of Edvard Collin). Why? This man has lived such an interesting life, it should be enough as a foundation to a great movie! I could continue this to be a very long list but feel it safest to simply recommend all of you to spend your time and money on something else instead.",negative

I guess Fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through Zombi three when the decided to walk out. Bruno Mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time. Zombi three's plot is your typical zombie fare. Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines, terrorists steal it unleashing a plague, and zombie run amok. The scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice. There are also brief inserts of a Radio DJ preaching about how we treat the planet. Overall, I actually liked this film. I heard horrible things, but I find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable. The film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution, corrupted military, Man playing God, etc. I get the feeling this was at one point a serious film, but it veered off in a weird direction, presumably when Mattei came on board. Besides dripping off other zombie flicks, this was very reminiscent of Romero's The Crazies. You hear the Radio DJ breaking the good news with, ""When you see the men in white suits & gas masks, Run to them for Help."" This is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies.

Unfortunately, this story reads a lot better than it looks in the film. When the secrets are finally revealed and memories become clear, there is no longer much interest in what happened. Simply put, director Simon Brand has a great premise with Matthew Waynee's idea, but it makes easy investments in the characters that keep the short run hard. **** Unknown (eleven / one / six) Simon Brand ~ James Caviezel, Barry Pepper , Greg Kinnear, David Selby",negative

In fact the was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe. two. The Asian nurse who survived Speck's massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie. This would have been impossible. In real life she hid under a bed while Speck methodically eliminated this eight victims. three. The movie depicts Speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as the meets them. Not true. In reality Speck was at first calm and gentle, reassuring the women the was't going to hurt them. This is how the was table to tie each of them up. four. The real Richard Speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be. FBI profile Robert Ressler interviewed Speck in the eighty's and said that Speck not only DID'NT know why the committed the murders but that the was't interested in learning why nor could the shed any light on why. Speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie. If the story was't so tragic and horrifying, the voice over would be laughable. All in all, Doug Cole's performance is adequately menacing and cold-blooded even though I don't think the real Speck was so forward in this violence. No doubt the was a very violent person when under the influence but the was also known, after all, for being a fairly slick icon man who was table to put people at lease before victimizing them. Beverly Ann Sotelo's performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film. She is a very good actress. If you are at all squeamish, do not see this film.

Of course, we love the stars of this genre, Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest, but its the story that really counts. The best are somewhat feasible but we can tolerate those that are a little ""over the top"" as in the comic book style of action. The more twists and turns, the more dire situations the heroes are involved in and the more shocking moments in the film; the more we action/adventure fans enjoy them. ""In the Line of Fire"" has ALL the elements required for a trip-roaring action thriller. It has Clint Eastwood as a near-retirement Secret Service Agent whose one bad moment of failure haunts him. It has one of the most evil, despicable, maniacal villains in John Malkovich, the type in which you can't wait to see him, ""get this due"". It has Rene Russo as the 'love interest.' It has twists and turns, an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humour. It is extremely well paced by director Wolfgang Petersen and even has a score by the great Ennio Morricone.

Alas, there have already been quite a few Aussie movies dealing with such themes , some reviled for 'sexism' (and/or explicit sex scenes) in the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys and one thousand, nine hundred and eightys and beyond and maybe they're worth looking at again after this piece of fluff. Of course, setting the whole thing in the world of ballet and making it all achingly slow (and in its choreography, like a one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys Dutch Ballet experimental number) does suggest Great Art if you've not travelled around much-and then only if you never progressed beyond Art Theory one hundred and one. Add to the pretension, appallingly march dialog ( ""you will do as we command. "") and the whole shebang falls onto its well funded face. Then there are the 'sexy' bits : straight from Dario Argento.

The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would have been afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing it as an adult, it seemed almost comical, towing to the overdone narration and jarring details like Thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the Fifties. There is a certain gritty, unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons are shooting it out with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "" Perhaps in that moment, for the only time in her life, Ma Barker became a real mother"". This is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos, as Ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own agreed, but instead, it provokes laughter.

46523,"I really enjoyed ""Doctor Mordrid"". This is a low-budget film, which may be off-putting to some, but I have no problem with it. I admire it even more for that, considering it's WAY more entertaining than the drivel that Hollywood churns out every year. Too bad this did't get a theatrical release; I don't know about anyone else, but I would have went to see it in theatres. `Doctor Mordrid' is a very entertaining science fiction film that just about anyone can enjoy, especially if they're into sci-fi like I am. I don't see why this is a R-rated film; only one of-word is said, and there are no gruesome death scenes, nor is there any blood at all. The timeless rivalry between sorcerers Anton and Kabal (Anton wanted the use this powers to save the human race, while Kabal wanted to enslave them), gave the story a sense of enchantment, while the mythical plotline added charm to the story itself. Basically, this a film that's just plain fun to watch. There is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie, though: seeing Jeffrey Combs keeping a straight face while wearing that silly blue cape and suit. That makes me laugh every time I see it. But I digress. Anyway, the acting is great; the main protagonists (Anton, and this lady friend, Samantha), are very likable; Anton is sympathetic, and hospitable, and Samantha is friendly. Plus, the settings were wonderful. The floating island in the other dimension was very cool setting; we're only given a glimpse of it twice, though; it would have been great to see more scenes take place there. The main setting was also very neat; Anton's apartment is very roomy, and the has some cool devices, especially the monitoring system the uses to keep track of the world's occurrences. He even has a pet raven that the keeps in this apartment named Edgar. Overall, this a great film; it was fun to watch, and the main factors put a lot of feeling into their roles. If you can find anywhere that rents `Doctor Mordrid', you should rent it (or, in my case, buy it. It was definitely money well-spent)! My Rating: eight stars out of ten.",positive
46523,"I really enjoyed Doctor Mordrid. This is a low budget film, which may be daunting to some, but I have no problem with that. For that I admire it even more when you consider that it's MUCH more entertaining than the drivel that Hollywood stirs up every year. It's a shame this didn't make it to the cinema; I don't know anyone else, but I would have seen it in the cinemas. ""Doctor Mordrid"" is a very entertaining sci-fi movie that almost anyone can enjoy, especially if they're into sci-fi like me. I don't understand why this is an R rated movie; Only one word is said and there are no gruesome death scenes and no blood either. The timeless rivalry between the wizards Anton and Kabal (Anton wanted to use these powers to save humanity while Kabal wanted to enslave them) gave the story a sense of enchantment, while the mythical plot gave the story itself charm. Basically, it's a movie that is just plain fun. There's one unintentionally funny thing about this movie, however: seeing Jeffrey Combs keep a straight face while wearing that goofy blue cloak and suit. That makes me laugh every time I see it. But I digress. Anyway, the acting is great; the main protagonists (Anton and this friend Samantha) are very personable; Anton is personable and hospitable, and Samantha is friendly. Plus, the settings were wonderful. The floating island in the other dimension was a very cool setting; however, we only glimpse it twice; It would have been great if more scenes were played there. The main setting was also very neat; Anton's apartment is very spacious and has some cool gadgets in it, especially the surveillance system that is used to keep track of what's going on in the world. He even has a pet raven named Edgar that he keeps in this apartment. Overall, this is a great movie; It was fun to watch and the main factors put a lot of feeling into their roles. If there is anywhere you can rent 'Doctor Mordrid' then you should rent it (or in my case buy it. It was definitely money well spent)! My rating: eight out of ten stars.",positive
46954,"Those two points are dedicated the reasonable performance from Akshay Kumar. I know Bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but PLEASE a Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. The father is dying and does what any good parent does. kick this son out the son with this PREGNANT wife. A few things that were too hard to swallow- one. Priyanka 'cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom' and to go from that to living hungry in her in-laws garden shed???????? two. Akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man, gets bitten by ratified dogs, to then just walk off. This film is an INSulT to your intelligence I really cant believe i contributed financially to the 'people' who made this film by taking my family to see it, we left the cinema with a frown, please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your 'waqt'.",negative

47196,"Very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write. This film simply smacked of the real world: the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it. two thumbs up.",positive

47780,"With Harry Callahan getting up in years, the inevitable `old man with a chip on this shoulder' story had to come into play eventually. Callahan, looking fragile sometimes and out of place, this demeanour still was unwavering. Thankfully, this film took some time off to develop a different type of story, one that might reinvent the Dirty Harry and the whole genre. While the film fell short in doing so, it was still an excellent addition to the series, even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and New Wave music.",positive

49063,"Trick for Treat, Quickie Review This zany romp of a film revolves around the eighty's culture of Heavy Metal and horror movies--two things which I love dearly. So, as you can imagine, this movie appealed to me pretty easily. Plus, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. This film is about an unpopular high school youth who, like all us losers, ended up drenched in a world of ""evil"" Heavy Metal. His favourite Metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected--by playing this latest unreleased album backwards. This allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and ash*t helping out. Okay, it's pretty cheesy at times, but you know what? It's got a surprising number of good qualities. Decent acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very brief nudity, decent atmosphere. All in all, it's actually a decent horror film. But what really sucks is the music. Ironic, huh? Well, this ""uber-evil"" Metal guy is one of the most obnoxious, high-pitched, wailing, Motley Crue rejects on the planet--and the ""Metal"" is little more than putrid eighty's Pop/Hair Metal. He hits all the clické's there, from prancing around like a gay fairy, to looking mean, to screaming ""Rock and Roll!!!"" in a pitch high enough to make King Diamond wretch. Aside from that atrocious musical representation, it's actually pretty good. seven/tenwww. ResidentHazard.com",positive

49227,"Frustrated middle-aged Deputy District Attorney George Maxwell (a fine performance by George E. Carey, who also produced this picture) can't stand this shaggy, frigid wife Edith (a perfectly bitchy Anne Bellamy) anymore. Worse yet, poor George is further saddled with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter (dishy brunette Sheri Jackson). George has an adulterous fling with lovely, enticing and free-spirited swinging hippie babysitter Candy Wilson (delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). Complications ensue when George finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter Julia Freeman (a nicely venomous turn by Kathy Williams), who wants George to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend Laurence Mackey (a frightening Robert Tessier, who sports a head full of hair there) from jail. Director Tom Laughlin (yep, the same dude who portrayed Billy Jack!) and screenwriter James McLarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity, sizzling soft-core sex, and raw violence. Moreover, they accurately peg the whole wild'n'easy uninhibited sensibility of the sixty's youth culture and relate the plot in a tight seventy-five minute running time, thus ensuring that this movie does't overstay its welcome. One definite highlight occurs when Candy invites her groovy friends over the Maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with spot smoking, wailing rock music, and, of course, hot naked dancing chicks. Robert O. Ragland's funky score hits the gnarly spot. Stanton Fox's stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings-on. Best of all, this flick rates as a marvellous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh-faced pixie Patricia Wymer, who positively flights up the screen with her sweet, bubbly personality and captivating beauty. A total trashy treat.",positive

49580,"Back in the day if Marion Davies had had her druthers and did't just listen to William Randolph Hearst, she'd have done more films like Show People and been a lot happier. In fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy, she'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like When Knighthood Was In Flower and Janice Meredith. What you're seeing by all accounts in Show People is the real Davies, a gifted comedienne, a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person. She could really identify with the character of Peggy Pepper aka Patricia Prepoire, she put up with her share of pretence in her Hollywood stardom. If the plot of Show People was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story. I guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story. Marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in Hollywood like so many others, looking for that big break. She wants to drama, but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics. She gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face, but learns her trade. And also wins the heart of young comic factor William Haines. She does get her first big break, but it does't come for Haines as well and Marion does get to do legitimate drama with factor Paul Ralli, playing Andre Telfair, a pretend no account Count of Avignon. Somebody there was taking a shot at factor Lou Tellegen, lover and husband of Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others and to hear tell of it, one of the most despised people in cinema. Show People was one of the first films to have the unfilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves. You will get to see folks like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman etc., just being themselves in and around the film colony. That in itself makes Show People a film worth saving. Show People also made good use of standard Tin Pan Alley songs like, Ain't We Got Fun, I'm Sitting On Top Of The World, You'd Be Surprised, California, Here I Come. As the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced, a song called Crossroads was introduced in it. It's not a bad number, but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack. I guess since they're not seen, it was felt no billing was necessary. Still I'd like to know and I'm sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see Show People. It's easy to see why Marion Davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favourite. She looks so at home in this film and her real life black of pretence shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience.",positive
