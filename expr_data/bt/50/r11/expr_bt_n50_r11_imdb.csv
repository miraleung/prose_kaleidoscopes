42678,"This movie was funny from START to FINISH. Everyone in the cinema was laughing out cloud throughout the film!! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, the girl from Will and Grace) and Tanya the manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best attitudes etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was really funny, she really played it well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters were't as funny even though the movie focused around them. All in all, this is a great movie to go and see with your girls (yes guys, it's a girlie movie through and through!). Enjoy!!!",positive

21239,"This film got roasted by the boys at MSTthreeK, but it's actually a neat and nasty piece of low-budget film nor. The plot is tight, the characters are believable (within the good-boy-gets-obsessed-with-bad-girl genre), the spacing is solid, the climax is well-handled, and the cast is bolstered by several fine character factors. True, most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick, but the's actually quite effectively creepy when the plays the mastermind. The scenes between him and this dad are quite powerful, in a minimalist kind of way. Sure it's depressing, but that's the point. Good movie.",positive

3423,"Without Kirsten Miller this project need't have been completed. However with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend it. It looked as if the other factors were only playing to her strong performance. Wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but this few scenes did't detract from being entertained. Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster. The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable. She plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen but alas I was fortunate to rent it before it was lost.",positive

32729,"I watched this film because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I would give their sister a try, Rain Phoenix. I regret checking it out. She was embarrassing and the film just has this weird plot if that what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains, whats going on? I have never been so unsatisfied in my life. It was just total rubbish. I can't believe that the factors agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. Have Sissy being 'beautiful' didst get to me. I thought she was everything but that. Those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? WHATS THE POINT??? zero out of ten, shame the poll doesnt have a zero, doesnt even deserve a one. Hopefully, Rain is better in other films, I forgive her for this one performance, I mean I wouldn't do much better with that film.",negative

21995,"This was a very nice soft-core movie for both men and women. Plenty of nudity/sex, but without the overall branch you'll usually find. They could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning. Trust me guys, if you want to get your woman in the mood, get something with Bobby Johnston in it! And I'm sure lovely Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual male. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do, please PM me! I'd love to know. The photography was much better than usual. So was the story. Predictable, but nice, sweet natured and romantic. At the very least it was not one of those annoying predictable murder mysteries full of bottle blonde women with huge fake breasts. I give this seven/ten!",positive

31378,"There are certain scenes in this film (like the hero's first meeting with super-villainess Shirley Eaton) where it seems to be on the edge of breaking sexual taboos and doing its premise (females want to rule the world by making men slaves) justice, but it never dares to. The result is a film with no sexuality and some tame violence. Despite the choppy plot, the film is not overly bad until its climax, where its amateurishness runs rampant (terrible editing, overuse of stock footage). Worth seeing only as a curio.

13860,"This has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films I have never seen. Merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence, sex, and a minimalist retelling of the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and thick player of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times, but the use of texture, combined with the extreme contrast, create an incredible viewing experience. This film is not for everyone. I think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content, which if extremely rough, but does make a fairly important statement about creation, god and humanity. Whether this film is a work of part, for shock value trash is open to discussion.",positive

I laughed so hard that I just found any other comedy shows unfunny. The unique confessions of each characters is a great original technique that just makes the show funny and very humorous. You may think that this is an average comedy show about hard life with a family. That's what I thought at first but I found out that it holds new and unique techniques that completely sets it apart from any other average comedy show. Michael Rapaport is a star.

If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film. unfortunately those ingredients had gone off! The acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just terrible, yes I know, bad writing. but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film. Sorry, Im even wondering why I am bothering to review this movie at all. I will send with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! DISAPPOINTING!",negative

19315,"This was a first feature for Clinton, I was there, while the shot this mess back in Adelaide around ninety-eight. Although I was't involved directly in the production, I was witness to the typically delusional behavior, post set, that went down,: the parties, the drugs, the illusionary glamour, really an example of what not to do when making a film, but also a byproduct of young, talented people getting caught up in classic ideologies of fame & worldly position. I like Clinton, we had a curious friendship, the deserves to have another crack with a more mature script. there the problems play, and I'm sure a much better job will be done, if there's a next time around.!

One scene a ""singing"" scene with Rose McGowan is far to well done and genius for this film and could have only been stumbled on by mistake by this director. So besides this Quinton inspiration and Rose McGowan and her one good scene this film sucked. Some of the crappiest dialogue I have never heard, I'm willing to bet why McGowan does't speak much is because of how crappy her dialogue would have been. Tries to be funny, never is, tries to be dark and in't, tries to be stylish and is just bland.

Network television has degenerated into shows that are clones of clones for are reality based shows featuring some often unreal people.

The film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were well paired together. The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks. In a way it's curious how carson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right there in New York.

The script and music made it worth the buy, and you also see Thaw playing the morgan. Amazing!

If you take it as a western, it's a darned good show. We discover how your characters in 'Lonesome Dove' wind up in the situations they start up in (Such as: Why do two Texas Rangers, who live on adventure, wind up in a dead town? And how did Gus manage to close the love of this life?) The performances are very good, and we see the exact same mannerisms the characters will have down the road. The factors did a very good job. The cinematography was superb, and while the music did't live up to the legendary score of nearly two decades past, that was an impossible task, and it was still fine. It also helped that we had three episodes, which you just don't see in a miniseries anymore. Heck, it's downright impossible to see a two part telefilm these days.

Though not as good as ""Toto the Hero"", which will always remain on my favourites list, the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions. Daniel Auteil, from two thousand and one's flavorless ""The Closet"" downplays this part, afraid to overact (rightfully so, the role could have easily been ruined if the factor was overly dramatic). However, I felt the part needed a bit more realism to it, focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the character's growth. Don't walk into this movie expecting the dark humour and unexpected twists that you got from ""Toto the Hero"" because you will be disappointed.

There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was dreadful and this entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than to make it longer.

There was a little excitement when we found out that Angie wasn't really pregnant, then find out she was, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot into a movie, was terrible and this whole character wasn't even nearly as important as this movie, except to make it longer.

I also did not like Robert Bourbage who played Henry Crawford. I could not imagine him being interested in Fanny for her cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood who played Mary Crawford was okay but the wig she wore was so ugly. I lost interested in her acting and I kept staring at her wig. I kept expecting it would drop off her head.

They constantly reference a movie called ""Get Leo"" which is the movie-in-a-movie version of get shorty. Every time they do this, you will be really angry. Travolta in't very cool, neither is Keitel. However, The Rock and Vince Vaughn are hilarious. They karen't the kind of funny you would expect to see in an Elmore Leonard movie though. If you haven't seen get shorty, you will probably like be cool. If you liked get shorty, you will leave the theatre wanting to kill the director and screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.",negative

12509,"""Such a Long Journey"" is a well crafted film, a good shoot, and a showcase for some good performances. However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots and master of none. Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoteric of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in one.seven hours. Recommended for those with an interest in India.",positive

I'm glad my expectations were low because the movie was't nothing close to good, but it manages to keep you interested. What really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the factors. The movie is overlong, has't no ""nice"" shots and no scares, the dialog are dumb and the special effects are crap.

I felt all warm and tingly when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) set out to get revenge on the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. To me, she deserved to have Rainbow Brite and Krys seek revenge on him. However, I liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. In addition, I thought that Lurky (voiec of Pat Fraley) and Murky (voiec of Peter Cullen) were diabolical. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has scored a big hit. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to everyone who has't seen it, especially die-hard fans of the TV series. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.",positive

Julie Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch. Ben's character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes the goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint, I would definitely say the has a future in acting after Harry Potter. Laura Linney is quite good in her role as Ben's over protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too. Villain-y. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast to this mother, and in the send the is quite honourable too. The only character i was't keen on was Bryony, she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thought. Overall this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch. one of my favourite films of the year easily.",positive

The two outstanding functions are dialogue and action. Great cast. The premise is actually well executed and there are too many weak moments. I guess what surprised me the most was how many times you thought the wheels were coming out of the car, and instead, the car just benched the curves, so to speak, and the movie keeps flying. There are some nice little side plots, especially the relationship that develops between the character played by the former Conan-Songkick Andy Richter. I would also like to mention that the music was good.",positive
5136,"The original story and funny compelling characters went over well for a teen girls slumber party movie (two times now). I loved it, it was fun and moved quickly, no boring drawn out scenes. It is violent and has a little language (though most of it is covered up). Its a great movie. David Strickland was a terrific factor. Ron Eldard gave a wonderful performance. I watch it with the girls every time.",positive

46581,"I've never watched a file in a language I don't understand just because I wanted to see the movie and I could't find it with English subs. I don't know how much I missed but it was't much. Probably just specific details which sounds silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together. I want to mention to The Diceman from Germany there's no reason to feel that the 'sucks' when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. Like I said, I don't understand Japanese -or at least only the very small amount I came away with from reading the very lengthy novel -pro- baby my favourite all time book which I could not put down & took the next day off from work just to finish reading! I don't know if there's an English dubbed for subbed version but if the film but if there is I'd love to see it. The film was incredible in Japanese anything better is icing of the cake!!
