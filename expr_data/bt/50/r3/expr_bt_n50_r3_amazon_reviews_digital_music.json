While I can see why they'd think this(Bun B is always hungry when the craps, leading one to believe the's trying to make an impact on the industry - despite the fact the already has made a significant one), Bun B has been in the biz for well over a decade, alongside this partner in rhyme(although, 'in crime' maybe more appropriate for Pimp C than it is for most), Pimp C. Together, they're the Underground Kingz, who identify themselves by the acronym of UGK. When they first came into the game, the South was obscure; now that it's blown up(especially their native land of Texas), one would think that UGK would get better publicity. Unfortunately the Kingz' publicity still does't compare to their skills, and only true heads have been table to check out their undeniably dope music. Hailing from Port Author, they may not be Houstonians, but they still possess the love of flossing', and grinding', as well as slow hypnotic beats, and equally entrancing flows. On Ridin' Dirty, UGK provide one of the most revered music to never come from the South; and for good reason. While one may criticise them for their admittedly limited subject matter(whips, drips, chips, tips, and tricks), they deliver their craps with so much finesse, and style that you can't help but overlook these issues. No matter how much these things are wrapped about, UGK always provide an interesting take on them, complete with captivating rhymes, and superb flows. Their production? Just as bomber, yet hypnotic as their flows. Highlights? I'd say this album has gems, but in all honesty, it's a complete gold mine. Every single track on this album is a five-star cut, and even the outdo has a dope enough beat to warrant it that label, despite the fact it's all shout-outs. Whether it's the smoothed out, Isley-sampled \"One Day,\" the gritty \"Murder,\" the Southern anthem \"Diamonds & Wood,\" for the impressive showing of wordplay on \"Touched\"(which Jay-Z lifted a verse from on \"ninety-nine Problems\"), this album has something for every ship-hop head.

I, along with a legion of long-time fans, grieved the loss of this incredible singer and performer. Initially, this death at that particular time in this career seemed terribly unfair. After stagnating during the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys and early one thousand, nine hundred and eightys, Orbison was back and perhaps even better than never in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight. His collaboration with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, George Harrison, and Jeff Lynne in the form of The Traveling Wilburys had put him back in the national spotlight, and many of us longed for the new album soon to be released, an album we had heard nothing but incredibly good things about. Then, suddenly, the and the voice that touched your hearts for so many years, was gone. We, the fans, should have been rewarding Roy Orbison for all of the memories the gave us in song, yet, never the selfless and humble man the was, Orbison actually presented all of us with a final, precious gift in the form of the album Mystery Girl. Roy's widow Barbara deserves your heartfelt thanks for bravely putting the finishing touches on this album after her husband's death. Mystery Girl is simply an incredible album featuring a reenergize Roy Orbison easily uniting this unique voice to a modern sound that appealed to any number of years; the released tracks from this album found sample playing time on both pop rock and country radio stations. Perhaps the first single, You Got It, got too much attention, as it was nearly played to death over the course of the first half of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine, but that is just a tribute to the wonderful beauty and infectious beat and rhythm of this song co-written by Orbison and Wilbury buddies Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty. The second track on the album, In the Real World, marks an abrupt change in stone; bringing to mind Roy's classic song In Dreams; Orbison captures your heard on the first note and soars with it through the clouds that only the possessed the means of exploring. This haunting track is, in my opinion, the best song on the album. Roy decides to rock a little bit on (All I Can Do Is) Dream You before stopping to wax poetic and heartbreaking on the slow ballad A Love So Beautiful, a song featuring a little musical support from co-writer Jeff Lynne and George Harrison. California Blue (another Orbison-Lynne-Petty venture), The Only One, and Windsurfer are great songs in their own right, but special attention must be shown the remaining three tracks. Careless Heart is a beautiful song of love and loss that seems to convey a sense of the type of feelings we felt over the loss of this man taken much too soon from your midst. She's a Mystery To Me, written by Utwo's Bono and The Edge, presents Roy with a slightly different type of song that the easily makes this own, hitting the high notes perfectly on the choruses. Then there is The Comedians, a song written by Elvis Costello; this is vintage Roy Orbison, delivering a strikingly visual display of betrayal and loss, the very subjects Roy seemed to understand more than any other singer out there. Mystery Girl is a very special album that Roy Orbison fans will treasure and play often for the rest of your lives. I wish Roy would have lived to see the incredible reception this album received from fans, but one can take comfort in the fact that Orbison left this world on top where the always belonged.","overall":5,"summary":"A final, precious gift from Roy to his fans","unixReviewTime":1055376000,"reviewTime":"06 12, 2003"}

Kevon Edmonds has a beautiful singing voice. \"Can't Stop,\" \"Ready for Not,\" and \"Heat of the Moment\" were all released on the radio and received a lot of airplay and it's no wonder why: these songs truly define R&B .; All the ingredients of a good R&B; Songs are incorporated there; well-produced, memorable lyrics and choruses and actual SINGING. \"Can't Stop\" is by far the best song on the album. The melody in the chorus is awesome! The way the instruments mix with the vocals is a stroke of genius. You know what? This song alone is worth the price of the album. \"Ready for Not\" is another great song. After Seven's men slow it down with this sexy ballad. Certainly these lyrics are 100% unrealistic (seriously, who can really give someone moon, sun and stars? Lol), but music is not always to be taken literally. \"Sayonara\" is a typical breakup song. While it's fun, it's not her best work. If you liked what you heard about After Seven on the radio then you will surely enjoy their self-titled album. This album will play indefinitely in my CD player! Pick it up!

For instance, \"MATW\"'s two opening tracks, \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Levon\", both display a vibrant orchestral fluidity (especially the latter selection), as well as a unique, melancholic autobiographical charm (moreso prevalent in \"Levon\"). \"Tiny Dancer\" was written about Taupin's girlfriend at the time, a dancer named Maxine Feibelman. What makes \"Madman. \" a musician's clinic, are the percussive guitar and mandolin skills, which are craftfully provided by the likes of drummer Roger Pope and axeman extraordinaire Davey Johnstone - whose talents on the mandolin are quite exceptional on the road-heavy \"Holiday Inn\". Johnstone would become a full-fledged member of The Elton John Band by the time EJ's next LP, \"Honky Chateau\", was released the following year in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. Adding to this standout array of musicianship, is guest Rick Wakeman, whose playing on a majority of \"MATW\"'s tracks is sometimes barely audible, and on selections such as \"Razor Face\", the pulls it off in spades.

Even though those were good albums and raised the game up for its time - Nothing has made a more serious change to the wrap game then this album there. But you know why this album is special? Because it can't be copied. No other draper has tried to in ANY way reproduce\/copy\/expand anything in this album. Because they can't. Not even Nas, Jay-Z, Eminem. no wrapper can even reach this level that this album stands on. People often refer to this album as \"its own pedistool\" - it's just ranked in its own league, and it will always be there. Heres a few reasons why, in my opinion:one. This is the best production I have never heard in any wrap album. Period. Not even Dre could come close to something like this. The beats are raw - not overlay done - not overlay mastered and cloud - and are just. raw. Hard. Eerie. Spooky. (Bomb First, Hail Mary, Life of an Outlaw, Against all Odds)two. The lyrics are just awesome. Imagine \"Illmatic\" but at a whole new different level. The metaphors in this album are just incredible (Me and my Girlfriend, Blasphemy). There intense, angry, and poetic at the same time. Makaveli in this first track, your-right calls out wrappers. Saying they are phoney, and just need to leave the wrap game before the puts them out.

Beat It will probably be remembered most. There was a guitar solo by Eddie Van Halen in the song, and in the video Michael brought two real life street gangs together for a huge dance scene. The song Thriller revolutionized videos. While the song itself was't as huge as others, the video stood out. It was seventeen+ minutes of special effects, dance scenes and good old campy horror fun. Michael turned into both a zombie and a werewolf in the video, and it is safe to say this video changed the music video industry forever. After it there were no more clips of artists singing onstage in microphones. More special effects and dance sequences were brought in. Billie Jean is another album masterpiece with another great video. One of my personal favourites is Track #one, Wanna Be Startin Something, which has infectious opening that will be stuck in your head for a very long time.

New Wave and synth-pop like Simple Minds were the vogue. This album sounds as good as anything at the time, and the first six itunes especially are fabulous, with excellent writing and stupendous production.

But this is the only finished product we have to listen to, and as much of a treasure as it is, to me it seems simply a warmup for some future masterpiece we'll never hear. Grace is hard to describe easily. At heart it's basically rock and roll, but. it's rock with one foot in the blues, one foot in the folk tradition, its hands reaching out to space and its voice in the heavens. Ahhhh. Jeff does things with this vocal cords that seem to push the boundaries of what's humanly possible. It's undeniably distinct from the first time the eerie wails of \"Mojo Pin\" slowly bloom into existence, eventually giving way to a slow-burning verse full of raw emotion. His high register may take some getting used to, but Jeff's singing does tricks and turns I've rarely heard from anyone. reaching its speak midway through the album in the lonely desolation of this most well-known cover, \"Hallelujah.\"Like many others, I'm particularly partial to that one. (Hey: if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best, and lyricists don't come better than Leonard Cohen.) This track best demonstrates just how special this talent was - with just a guitar and voice the pours this entire heart out for the world to hear, managing to sound soul-weary, powerfully spirited and nervously frail all at once. I could easily imagine the wistful \"Lilac Wine\" being an exceptional standout ballad on an album from anyone else, but there it has to take second place. Even the half-cliched lyric of \"Lover, You Should've Come Over\" sounds nothing but compelling just due to Jeff's soul-baring vocal performance. Incidentally, that tune has one of the most fitting uses of an morgan I've heard in a rock song; it starts with a creepy Phantom-of-the-Opera stone, but mellows out into something that sounds almost like an accordion. Perfect. Only four stars, then? Well, as much as I'm tempted to give a perfect rating because so much of Grace still blows me away (and considering the special rating usually reserved for talented artists who die young), I still can't call this one perfect. \"So Real\" drags with repetition at times, and the degree of contrast between the whisper-quiet verse and the crashing drum-filled chorus can grate on my nerves. \"Corpus Christi Carol\" is too much like a church hymn for my taste. (Go figure, meh?)Jeff and crew liven things up now and then amid all the easy-paced ballads. \"Last Goodbye\" is surprisingly sunny, jogging along with a bouncy beat and a happy string arrangement, though the major-keyed melody in't enough to hide the sadness in the words. \"Eternal Life\" can be a downer, but it's a downer with a lot of lively singing, mad kicking drums and some killer guitar hooks. True to form, it slides into something slower and almost spooky with \"Dream Brother.\" Like the rest of the disc, that one leaves me with an unshakable sense of something almost foreboding, yet hopeful in the middle of it all. There's something otherworldly about it all. OK, looks like I've been long-winded enough. Grace in't an album I can wholeheartedly recommend to anyone at all, but I can state that if you've got an year for a fine musical performance and a real feeling for soul-stirring music, you'll probably be well-served there.

It is into this that the and Gil Evans reconvened for a big band session of material from Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\". While it is the weakest of the three principle albums the pair did together, it is still a fine record filled with extraordinary material, and certainly for a lesser artist, would have been the highlight of their career. The big band, similar in formation to \"Miles Ahead\" (twelve brass, four breeds bass and drums), performed shifting backing tracks, adding color, texture and mood in a fashion only Evans was table to capture, on top of which Davis would solo, largely on flugelhorn. Perhaps moreno than \"Miles Ahead\", the backing on these sessions is full of subtlety and cleverness, and in virtuosity on its own, Miles' own soloing is remarkably overshadowed at times, in particular by Philly Joe Jones' inimitable brilliant drumming on \"Gone\" (which also has a brilliant and nearly inaudible bass clarinet line) and Bill Barber's monster tuba playing on several tracks (\"Buzzard Song\", \"Bess, You Is My Woman Now\"). Mind you, this in't to say Miles in't totally absorbed by and feeding back into the music-- Evans is remarkably inspiring to Davis, and this playing is unbelievable nearly throughout, passionate and punctuated on \"Gone, Gone, Gone\", speechlike and completely invested on \"Prayer (Oh Doctor Jesus)\" (conceivably one of the most powerful solos Davis never took), melancholy and nearly overpowering on \"My Man's Gone Now\", and just completely enjoyable on \"There's a Boat Leaving Soon From New York\". If all of this was't quite enough, the album ranks in perhaps the best version of the seemingly endlessly performed \"Summertime\"-- Davis is light, bouncy, excited, and yet with that sense of haunting that is so hard to capture as the solos on trumpet. The remaster gives nice, crisp sound, good balance between instruments, and a handful of bonus tracks that provide for interesting listening. Still, for all this, the album in't quite the perfection of \"Miles Ahead\" for \"Sketches of Spain\"-- I'm not sure what it is, it could be that I just don't like \"Fishermen, Strawberry and Devil Crab\", for it could be something else, but there's a bit missing.

The O'Jays and Gamble and Huff were not afraid of playing plenty of sounds on top of the band's gritty vocals, but the goal was always to make the sound more rich and interesting. A good case in point is \"nine hundred and ninety-two Arguments,\" which spices excellent lead singing with soaring backup vocals, strings, slightly jazzy vibes and tasty guitar clicks.

The Stooges were known as the midwest version of The Doors during their first run through a self-titled debut (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) and Fun House (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy), before imploding due to many demons found outside the band's home of Ann Arbor, Michigan. David Bowie's MainMan Management signed the group, which was initially down to Iggy Pop and new guitarist James Williamson. The duo eventually added former Stooges Ron Asheton (switching from guitar to bass) and Scott Asheton (drums). Produced by Pop, this initial mix was deemed inferior by MainMan and - under the threat that the album was not going to be released - agreed to have Bowie remix seven of the weight tracks (Pop's \"Search and Destroy\" remained), which was done in one day. The original Pop mix has been released (\"Rough Power\"), along with this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven remix, but the fast work by Bowie to salvage the project is superior. Though marred by technical difficulties, the October one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three gig in Atlanta, Georgia, features a motivated Pop and Ron Asheton proving beyond any doubt that the was one of the best bassists during this wild decade for rock music. That the tape languished in a vault and not cleaned up through studio overdubs is an incredible upside, since there is minimal quality recordings which capture The Stooges in their performance part glory.

The first single showed, for the first time, Phil Collins singing a different tune from this past hits, a song about the poor and homeless, Another Day In Paradise. The song became a worldwide anthem that year sparking repeated airplay and learning the grammy for best song. For many, this song is the highlight of the album. But in truth, its just one of a lot of highlights. Actually, the entire album was the highlight of the moment. The maturity of That's Just The Way It Is, Father To Son, and All Of My Life can easily cast over Another Day In Paradise. The sweet love ballad Do You Remember?, which appears in the soundtrack of Nicholas Cage's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety bomb Fire Birds, is deliciously good. The chilling rock epic I Wish It Would Rain Down that features guitar work from Eric Clapton dawns as a remarkable highlight on the album. Colors follows in the theme of Another Day In Paradise as a moment to give a thought to the poor and homeless. The album's closer Find A Way To My Heart, another track that was featured in the soundtrack to the Nicholas Cage flop Fire Birds, is an excellent pick for the closing of such a genuine album. The song opens up with some really cool electronic sounds and then slowly escalates and progresses into one big bang of a song.

It's maybe Tori's best lyrically! Tori branches out and uses the Bosendorfer instead of the piano. It's very interesting the creativity in her music on this album.'Pele' offers us eighteen songs, all captivating and unique. I did't know about Tori until about three years ago so I bought all her previous albums at once. thing is, this used to be my least favourite. I gave it ONE listen (stupid, I know) and I was so wrapped up in 'Little Earthquakes' and 'From the Choirgirl Hotel' that I never picked it up again. Until earlier this year and I discovered how amazingly beautiful and harsh this album really is. The album opens with the short \"intro\" 'Beauty Queen', showcasing Tori's vocal range and depth. 'Horses' is beautifully written, it's a slower song and sucks you in to the rest of the album. 'Blood Roses' is lyrically my favourite. It is absolutely different and Tori's vocals are amazing: 'I shaved every place where you've been boy' - pooh. 'Father Lucifer' is another slower song featuring some controversial lyrics. 'Professional Widow' - what to say about this - everyone knows 'Widow', it's a downright raw emotional song that is perfect for after the breakup. Get your danger out. 'Mr. Zebra' is a short, sweet sounding song but I haven't actually grasped the true meaning of it. yet. 'Marianne' is slow, a tragic sounding song. 'Caught A Lite Sneeze' is absolute brilliance! Her voice will capture you 'beauty, stumbling down, did't know your love was so small, could't stand at all, Mr. St. John just bring your son'. 'Muhammad My Friend' has always been a favourite of mine, it's beautiful lyrically and pleasant musically. This one tells a story unlike any other. 'Hey Jupiter' is probably one of the best songs I've heard in years. It's gorgeous and this song could ONLY be done by Tori, nobody can match her vocals. No one. 'Way Down' is another short song like 'Mr. Zebra', nothing bad there. 'Little Amsterdam' is another one of my favourites, her voice again 'Mama, it was't my bullet' her presence is felt through her voice and lyrics. Chills! 'Talula' has got this crazy Harpsichord going on, very strange musically but nothing blacks lyrically. 'Not The Red Baron' is a quiet, slow song and tragic, when Tori sings 'just another pilot down' - it sends chills down your tickling spine. 'Agent Orange' is a weird song, I must confess. It's a short song, again but unique and fun to listen to. 'Doughnut Song' is ridiculously good. These are the kind of songs you get warmth from and you just want to tell the world about it. 'In The Springtime of this Voodoo' is fun to listen to, it's upbeat and extremely different. 'Putting The Damage On' is like 'Doughnut Song' - it's beautiful but this one is more tragic, 'boy you still look pretty when you're putting the damage on' . pooh. Lastly, 'Twinkle' a nice song and the perfect ending to a great, powerful and music breaking record. Tori Amos has become my favourite female performer, she's the most talented woman on this planet and I've loved everything she's done. Don't put this on and NOT pay attention like I did . when you put this on for the first time, LISTEN and it'll never leave your CD player.","overall":5,"summary":"A different yet pleasant album","unixReviewTime":1089849600,"reviewTime":"07 15, 2004"}

{"orig_index":15128,"reviewerID":"AC0Z6U9OWFRT0","asin":"B000002KH3","reviewerName":"Daniel Maltzman","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Van Halen's self-titled debut is undoubtedly one of the finest albums in the history of rock. Only Guns N' Roses debut, \"Appetite for Destruction\" (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven) can possibly compete with \"Van Halen\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight) in terms of greatness in the hard rock genre. \"Van Halen\" is the definitive rock album that set the stage for almost every hard-rock band from the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. Poison, RATT, Quiet Riot, Warrant, Cinderella, Dokken, LA Guns, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, and many more, all took their cue from Van Halen.\"Van Halen,\" is the prototype that set the stage for the decade to follow. Every singer wanted to be like David Lee Roth, and every guitar player wanted to be Eddie Van Halen. Dave and Eddie were gods, truly rock in' roll icons if never there were any. Van Halen's debut introduced the world to Diamond David Lee Roth. Roth is truly a maverick in the annals of rock. As journalist Malcolm Dome writes \"Roth was not merely a frontman, not just a vocalist, but a volcanic eruption of cabaret, Vaudeville, rock in roll and Las Vegas\" (Excess All Areas, Castle Communications, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four). While the band and the songs on Van Halen's debut are top notch, it is Roth that gives them the magic touch. If Sammy Hagar had been Van Halen's vocalist in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight \"Van Halen\" would have been a great album, no doubt, but not the masterpiece that it is. Without Dave, Vince Neil, Brett Michaels, Sebastian Bach, Kid Rock, Anthony Kiedis, among others would have had to look elsewhere for inspiration. Van Halen's debut showcased Eddie Van Halen. With \"Van Halen,\" Eddie reinvented the language of guitar. His trademark tapping and laser-fast hammer-ons became the blueprint for a generation of future guitar players. Steve Vai, George Lynch, Zack Wylde, Jerry Cantrell and Billy Corgan among others were all heavily influenced by Eddie Van Halen. Drummer Alex Van Halen and bassist Michael Anthony provided a stunning rhythm section. Alex Van Halen's drumming was intense, without being bombastic. While Michael Anthony in't the most famous member of VH, this playing was the glue the bound the sound together. And with Eddie Van Halen on guitar, a flashy bass player may have been too much. Most importantly, Anthony's signature high-pitched background vocals and harmonies were the perfect counterpart to Roth's bluesy baritone delivery. Together, the four members were an unstoppable, rock in' roll machine that bulldozed over all competitors and created six of the best albums in the history of rock. As Roth once commented, if you put a Van Halen album in your shelf, it will melt all the other records in your collection. Roth has commented in this autobiography, \"Crazy from the Heat,\" (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven) the band sounded as good as it did because they played live in the studio without a lot of overdubs. He points out that while the band would record a song three for four times, the first take was usually the best, because it was \"distraction fee, fear free\" and the band was not self-conscious. Roth notes how with classic Van Halen, you can hear and make out each individual instrument-guitar, bass, drums, vocals, very clear and separate. Nowhere is this more apparent than on Van Halen's debut. Roth also notes in this book that the two major albums popular at the time of the recording of \"Van Halen\" were \"Saturday Night Fever\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven) and \"Nevermind the Bullocks, there's the Sex Pistols\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven). Roth notes that \"Van Halen\" was somewhere in between both albums. It was danceable, celebratory, and polished, yet intense, fast, and furious. Every song on \"Van Halen\" is a winner. Every song is a highlight. Every song is catchy and melodic with a good hook and groove. It's no small wonder why almost every song from \"Van Halen\" is a staple on any classic rock station. The mid-tempo, bluesy, \"Runnin' with the Devil\" gets the album off to a great start. The backwards car horn intro, pounding bass, high-pitched screams, and killer solos were the perfect way to introduce to the world to the mighty Van Halen. With \"Eruption\" Eddie shows this chops in this mold-breaking solo. A cover of the Kinks \"You Really Got Me\" proves to be better than the original. The opening riff of \"Ain't Talkin' `Bout Love\" is one of the most well known intros of all-time. From the classic opening, to Dave's cocky delivery, to Eddie's killer solos, this remains an all time classic. They don't make songs like this anymore. The rapid-fire \"I'm the One\" takes \"Van Halen\" into warp-speed. Alex's jazzy drumming, Michael Anthony's background harmonies, and Dave's bohemian delivery over Eddie's full-throttle assault makes this song head straight for the jugular. The do-wop ending right before the grand finale is the perfect touch. The album slows down a notch for the cocky-but-sensitive \"Jamie's Cryin.\" High on melody, no one could using this song like Dave. This song is so catchy you'll be singing it in the shower after just one listen. The sci-fi themed \"Atomic Punk\" grabs you by the collar and refuses to let go. It has a crazed, paranoid, chaotic feel, without loosing structure. The triumphant \"Feel Your Love Tonight\" is a celebration of the splendour and naivety of youth. No matter how old you are for where you are in life, this song will make you feel good. The album slows down for the subdued \"Little Dreamer,\" which is one of the only real cheerless song on the album. An code to a closer with lost dreams, Roth seems to pity the protagonist. This song, with its eerie background vocals is haunting and submissive yet powerful and edgy. The mood lightens up a bit for the tongue-in-cheek \"Ice Cream Man\" which adds a bit of humour to the album.\"On Fire\" is one of Van Halen's most underrated songs. It's one of the heaviest, most rocking songs they have never recorded. But in an album chock-full of classics, it's easy to see why it has been overlooked. I have listened to \"Van Halen\" hundreds of times and have never grown tired of hearing it. In addition, there are a lot of subtleties going on, so whenever I do listen to it, I often hear something new that I haven't heard before.\"Van Halen\" is flawless and sounds as good today as it did in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight. In terms of instrumental firepower, showmanship, tight compositions, melody, and overall memorable songs, few albums can compete. While every rock fan should own the first six Van Halen albums, \"Van Halen\" is absolutely essential to any good collection. The two thousand remaster addition of \"Van Halen\" is an improvement over the original CD release. Now every nook and cranny can be made out and enjoyed for years to come.

The band of the nineteen-nineteen-eighties is preparing Poison, RATT, Quiet Riot, Warrant, Cinderella, Dokken, LA Guns, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Motley Crue and many more have oriented themselves towards Van Halen that followed de decade. Every singer wanted to be like David Lee Roth and every guitarist wanted to be like Eddie Van Halen. Dave and Eddie were gods, true rock-in'-roll icons when they never existed. Van Halen's debut introduced Diamond David Lee Roth to the world. Roth is truly a lateral thinker in the annals of rock. As journalist Malcolm Dome writes, \"Roth was not just a front man, not just a singer, he was a volcanic eruption of cabaret, vaudeville, rock in roll and Las Vegas\" (Excess All Areas, Castle Communications, one thousand nine hundred and ninety four). While the band and songs on Van Halen's debut are top notch, it's Roth who gives them the magical touch. If Sammy Hagar had been Van Halen's vocalist in a thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, \"Van Halen\" would undoubtedly have been a great album, but not the masterpiece it is. Without Dave, Vince Neil, Brett Michaels, Sebastian Bach, Kid Rock, Anthony Kiedis, among others, would have had to look for inspiration. Van Halen's debut featured Eddie Van Halen. With \"Van Halen\" Eddie reinvented the language of the guitar. His trademark and laser-fast hammer-ons became the blueprint for a generation of future guitarists. Steve Vai, George Lynch, Zack Wylde, Jerry Cantrell and Billy Corgan among others were all heavily influenced by Eddie Van Halen. Drummer Alex Van Halen and bassist Michael Anthony made for a breathtaking rhythm section. Alex Van Halen's drumming was intense without being bombastic. While Michael Anthony isn't the most famous member of VH, this game was the glue that held the sound together. And with Eddie Van Halen on guitar, a flashy bassist might have been too much. Most importantly, Anthony's signature high back vocals and harmonies were the perfect counterpart to Roth's bluesy baritone. Together, the four members were an unstoppable rock-in-roll machine that overtook all competitors and produced six of the best albums in rock history. As Roth once noted, if you put a Van Halen album on your shelf, it will melt all the other records in your collection. Roth commented in this autobiography \"Crazy from the Heat\" (one thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven) that the band sounded as good as they did because they played live in the studio without much overdubs. He points out that while the band recorded a song three times four times, the first take was usually the best because it was \"diversion fee, fearless\" and the band wasn't confident. Roth notes that with the classic Van Halen you can hear and make out every single instrument - guitar, bass, drums, vocals - very clearly and separately. Nowhere is this more evident than on Van Halen's debut. Roth also notes in that book that the two major albums that were popular at the time Van Halen was recorded were \"Saturday Night Fever\" (one thousand nine hundred seventy-seven) and \"Nevermind the Bullocks, there's the Sex Pistols\" (one thousand nine hundred seventy-seven ). Roth notes that \"Van Halen\" was somewhere between the two albums. It was danceable, solemn and polished, but still intense, fast and angry. Every song on \"Van Halen\" is a winner. Every song is a highlight. Every song is catchy and melodic with a good hook and groove. So it's no wonder that almost every song on \"Van Halen\" is an integral part of every classic rock station. The bluesy mid-tempo \"Runnin 'with the Devil\" gives the album a great start. The backward-facing car horn intro, pounding bass, high-pitched screams, and killer solos were the perfect way to introduce the mighty Van Halen to the world. With \"Eruption\" Eddie shows these chops in this form-breaking solo. A cover of the Kinks \"You Really Got Me\" turns out to be better than the original. The opening riff of \"Ain't Talkin '` Bout Love \"is one of the most famous intros of all time. From the classic opening to Dave's cocky performance to Eddie's killer solos, this remains an all-time classic. They don't make songs like this anymore. The rapid fire \"I'm the One\" brings \"Van Halen\" into warp speed. Alex's jazzy drumming, Michael Anthony's backing harmonies and Dave's bohemian rendition of Eddie's full-throttle attack put this song right on the carotid artery. The do-wop ending shortly before the grand finale is the perfect note. The album slows down a notch for the cocky but sensitive \"Jamie's Cryin\". High on melody, no one could use this song like Dave. This song is so catchy that you can sing it in the shower after just one listen. The science fiction theme \"Atomic Punk\" grabs you by the collar and won't let you go. It has a crazy, paranoid, chaotic feel without losing its structure. The triumphant \"Feel Your Love Tonight\" is a celebration of the glamor and naivety of youth. No matter how old you are for your life, this song will make you feel good. The album slows down for the muted \"Little Dreamer\" which is one of the few truly bleak songs on the album. A code that comes closer with lost dreams, Roth seems to pity the protagonist. This song with its eerie background vocals is haunting and submissive, but still powerful and edgy. The mood brightened up a little for the winking \u201cIce Cream Man\u201d, which gives the album a bit of humor. \u201cOn Fire\u201d is one of Van Halen's most underrated songs. It's one of the hardest, rockiest songs they've ever recorded. But in an album full of classics, it's easy to see why it was overlooked. I've heard \"Van Halen\" hundreds of times and never tire of hearing it. In addition, there are many subtleties that when I hear it I often hear something new that I have never heard before. \"Van Halen\" is flawless and sounds as good as it does in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight today. In terms of instrumental firepower, showmanship, tight compositions, melody, and overall catchy songs, few albums can compete. While every rock fan should own the first six Van Halen albums, \"Van Halen\" is an absolute must for any good collection. Van Halen's 2000 remaster expansion is an improvement on the original CD release. Now every nook and cranny can be recognized and enjoyed for years to come. In the years to come, the universe will continue to expand, suns will die and turn into black holes, politicians will lie and be caught up in scandals, trends will come and go, bands will rise and fall, but \"Van Halen\" never will be outshone.","overall":5,"summary":"The album that broke the mold","unixReviewTime":1130544000,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2005"}

Also, the album cover is instantly recognizable; it's now a classic album cover (I've always liked it, not sure why but the smoking angel painting always looked amazing to me). As you probably know by now, \"Jump\" was the huge hit from this album. \"Jump\" relied heavily on synths, a catchy chorus and a dose of metal. Perhaps I've heard it too many times by now but it's still an amazing song and I can't deny it's a classic. \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four\" the song is just a one minute synths intro to \"Jump\" and does't have much significance besides being an introduction, nothing great about it either but it does set the listener up for the next song. Sounds kinda futuristic. \"Panama\" is one of my favourite Van Halen songs, this is quintessential Van Halen with the band at its very best. The intro gets you right into it and the breakdown at the send is fantastic with the engine noise and all, I can't say enough good things about this song. If you think \"Jump\" is a bit two commercial \"Panama\" will be right in your valley. \"Top Jimmy\" is another one that is loved by fans, an excellent song what can I say? \"Drop Dead Legs\" sounds like it was influenced by Led Zeppelin which I suspect was the case since the band are after all, fans of Zeppelin! Listen to that riff and drum beat and tell me it does't sound even a little like LZ, good track. \"Hot For Teacher\" is pure VH, fast, dirty, upbeat and sexual, how can you not like it and be a Van Halen fan? After all these years I'm willing to bet they're still \"for teacher\", Dave sounds amazing there. \"I'll Wait\" is another synth-driven song and being slower-paced has some characteristics of a ballad but it's a really a great slow rocker with some excellent lyric. An underrated song in my opinion. \"House of Pain\" closes the album nicely, hard rock to the chore and a fitting way to send a fantastic album. Not to put down the band's other albums but one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four is one of two essential Van Halen albums (the other one being the self-titled debut) that should be part of a good rock `n' roll\/metal music collection.

In fact, the amazing middle of the record has its trilogy of relationship songs in \"It Doesn't Matter,\" \"Stories of Old,\" and \"Somebody.\" two of the three selections are sung by Martin. \"IDM\" is an awesome dreamy song, in a way unlike anything I've even heard from this band since. It's about appreciating the time they have, even if they know it may not last forever. And there's a cynical view on commitment and compromise in relationships on \"Stories of Old,\" possibly my favourite from the record. \"Somebody\" is one of the more famous tracks from the album, and is well-executed, along with some kind of interesting samples in the mix. It is a beautiful soul-searching track. That does't mean the other six songs karen't any good; they are. And perhaps more than that.

The album has an awesome opener with \"Something to Do,\" one of the most stadium-ready songs of DM's early career. The record also has the band's breakthrough hit \"People Are People.\" The band may not like it and the lyrics may be trite, but what's amazing is that several bands today are still covering the song. The clinging pipes on the song totally grab the listener's attention. It was a hit that was meant to happen. Then there's the awesome Wilder composition \"If You Want.\" The track is electronic and somewhat space-y. The lyrics are simple yet catchy and it makes a nice addition to the album, in between the somewhat shocking (at the time, at least) \"Master and Servant\" and \"Blasphemous Rumors.\" \"Master\" starts with a trade-off a capella with Martin and Dave saying \"it's a lot,\" ending it with \"like life.\" It's a dark song for sure, the first time masochism would be themed in DM songs, and Martin would go to write several more tracks of the theme. Then there's teenage angst and irony in \"Blasphemous Rumors,\" which has kind of interesting samples and electronics. I don't really think it's intended as an anti-religious song so much as it is a track of tragedy, like how everything that can go wrong with someone ends up going wrong. Still, an enjoyable track. There are no negative reviews for this record and the people who do in the future are probably just trying anyway. This began DM's cult success of the mid-'eighty's, and rightfully so.

In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six, Prince's second movie, Under The Cherry Moom was filmed. This movie was a disaster and some people did't even see it. I always thought that this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six classic was a life-saver for not only the film, Under The Cherry Moon, but for this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five double platinum album, Around The World In A Day. Parade was released the same time this second movie was filmed. This weird but, funky album was not really a big success for Prince. The album was underrated at the time, and it still is. When I listened to this album, it made me think of The Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper. The first three songs are weird to me. 'Christopher Tracy's Parade' is a funky, psychedelic number, which is a great opener to this album. 'New Postion' is a jazzy funk number with Sheila E. singing and playing the drums. 'I Wonder U' is a Lisa and Windy composition that sounds truly druggy with laid back rhythms and strange lyrics. 'Under The Cherry Moon' is very melodramatic with a sad mood in the song. I mean it's really not one of my favourites but, I listen to it anyway. 'Girls And Boys' is a hard funk tune with amazing synthesizers and electric drum beats. It's a more upbeat tune. 'Life Can Be So Nice' is another funk cut that has a chorus accompanied by a nice, catchy rhythm. Then there's 'Venus De Milo', which is a piano instrumental with a lot of smooth strings. 'Venus De Milo' are one of my favourites on this album. 'Mountains' is a upbeat, psychedelia soul cut with synth drums and other goggles of instruments. 'Do U Lie' is another depressing and moody song. I hate this one, but it really does't bother me that much. 'Kiss' is everybody's favourite song by the Purple One himself. The funky guitars and the muted drums are great. How does Prince do it? 'Anotherloverholenyohead' is a strange, European-funk number. 'Sometimes It Snows In April' is a ballad that employs country music to express deep loss so poetically and personally. Parade should've been a double album even if the whole album was forty-five minutes, in my opinion. At the time, The Revolution was delving into jazz and this album is really an experimentation of jazz and soul. It would be one more year, until the gives us this masterwork, 'Sign \"O\" The Times', where the dabbles into different styles and sounds to let us discover this real genius, part, and talent.

In one thousand nine hundred and eighty-six, Prince's second film, Under The Cherry Moom, was shot. That movie was a disaster and some people haven't even seen it. I always thought that this one thousand nine hundred and eighty-six classic was a lifesaver not only for the movie Under The Cherry Moon, but also that one thousand nine hundred and eighty-five double-platinum album Around The World In A Day. Parade was released at the same time that this second film was being made. This strange but funky album wasn't a huge hit for Prince. The album was underrated back then and still is. When I heard this album, I thought of the Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper. I think the first three songs are weird. 'Christopher Tracy's Parade' is a funky, psychedelic number that is a great opener for this album. \"New Postion\" is a jazzy funk number where Sheila E. sings and plays the drums. 'I Wonder U' is a composition by Lisa and Windy, which sounds really intoxicating with relaxed rhythms and strange lyrics. 'Under The Cherry Moon' is very melodramatic with a sad mood in the song. I mean, it's really not one of my favorites, but I still hear it. 'Girls And Boys' is a heavy funk song with great synthesizers and e-drum beats. It's a happier tune. 'Life Can Be So Nice' is another funk cut with a chorus accompanied by a nice, catchy rhythm. Then there is 'Venus De Milo', a piano instrumental with lots of smooth strings.

Between one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine and one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine the not only produced three hit albums for Michael Jackson, the also produced hit albums for others, including George Benson, Donna Summer, James Ingram, Patti Austin, The Brothers Johnson, Rufus & Chaka Khan and Ernie Watts. In this one thousand, nine hundred and ninety documentary \"Listen Up\", which documents a lot of the making of this particular album, Jones tells of how overwork and exhaustion ultimately led to a nervous breakdown and two separate aneurysms. By the time the was ready to make this album, which the describes as this project of a lifetime, music was undergoing a revolution. Disco was long dead and buried, ship-hop was emerging as the predominant force and the smooth jazz-influenced beats Jones was reputed for were falling out of favour. To give him this due the approached the situation gamely. The title tune, \"Back On The Block\" was a brave kiss with wrap if not a particularly wise one. The song, which features big guns of the time such as Melle Mel, Big Daddy Kane, Ice-T and Kool Moe Dee is always fun to listen to but I never heard it played on the radio for at any clubs for parties. \"Jazz Corner of The World\", this attempt to marry wrap with jazz was more interesting and featured jazz luminaries like James Moody, Miles Davis, George Benson, Sarah Vaughn, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald and Josef Zawinul alongside Kool Moe Dee and Big Daddy Kane. It's heady, exciting stuff to listen to even now, seventeen years later. If nothing else, Q certainly knew where music was heading. The production on this CD is stunning beyond belief. \"Wee B. Dooinit\", featuring Siedah Garrett, Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau, Ella Fitzgerald, Take six and Sarah Vaughn is a completely capella performance. McFerrin produced the percussion and bass sound effects and I still wonder exactly where Q placed the microphones. There are some other great songs. \"I'll Be Good To You\" featured lead vocals by Ray Charles and Chaka Khan. The album version was good enough but I remember getting the twelve\" single which had the same backbeat as Soul II Soul's \"Keep On Movin'\". (Now THAT was a huge club hit). \"The Places You Find Love\" featured lead vocals from Chaka Khan and Siedah Garrett, with background vocals from Howard Hewitt, Jennifer Holiday, James Ingram, Dionne Warwick, Luther Vandross and the Andrae Crouch Singers among others. Apart from her brief stint with the Brand New Heavies, Siedah Garrett's work with Quincy Jones (here and on Michael Jackson's \"Bad\") have produced the only performances of hers I've managed to find bearable. She seems to have taken the place formerly occupied by Patti Austin in Q's workplan and to give her the credit she's due, she does the job well. She does the vocal arrangement on the majority of the songs and where she took lead vocal duties, like on \"I Don't Go For That\" and \"One Man Woman\", she gives a barnstorming performance. But for me, the album was made by \"Setembro (Brazilian Wedding Song)\" featuring Take six & Sarah Vaughn, with Gerald Albright on alto sax, George Benson on guitar, George Duke on fender Rhodes and Herbie Hancock on keyboards. The song attained iconic status when John Singleton used it in this classic movie \"Boyz N The Hood\". (It was the song playing during the love scene between Nia Long and Cuba Gooding, Jr). It's one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've never heard. Q's take on Joe Zawinul's \"Birdland\" featuring Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, George Benson, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and James Moody, is also a personal favourite. This album is also noted for introducing the world to (the then angelic-voiced) Tevin Campbell. He did the tearjerking \"Tomorrow (Better You, Better Me)\" with background vocal help from the `children's choir'. And last but by no means least, the album also produced the perennial slow dance song, \"The Secret Garden\", featuring El DeBarge, James Ingram, Al B. Sure! and Barry White. That one still moves people to this day. This review is long but I feel to pass this project off with a few lines for a paragraph for two would not be doing its magnitude justice. It's not my all-time favourite Quincy Jones record but I can totally see why the considers it so significant. It is so significant. Getting all these legends of the past and of the future was a huge achievement all by itself.

What Faith No More hit upon with this album is that rarely-attained holy grail of originality, catchiness, and timelessness. The production is so tight, with all songs building to near pandemic choruses. This feat is accomplished by carefully brewing the instrumental ingredients, and with swirling\/twisted carnival keyboards, prominent and absurdly abrupt bass notes, crunchy, yet crystal clear guitar stone, tribal drumming, and the brilliantly schizophrenic vocal styling, Faith No More were table to create a masterpiece which immediately calls to mind those works of part which will never be replicated.

You've never heard of them? Thats quite surprising considering Kurt Cobain frequently mentioned them in interviews, REM covered sex bomb and Jello Biafra once stated that Flipper were one of the best bands in the punk scene. It is a shame this band gets almost no recognition, because they really do stand out from the generic thrash hardcore that the punk scene almost entirely consisted of at the time. Instead of playing speed punk, Flipper took the hardcore sound of bands like black flag, minor threat and the germs and slowed it down. The music may take awhile to get into as it sounds so different from anything else. I didst like Flipper when I first heard them, but I gave them a few more listens and now I love them. What you hear once you play this album is cloud basslines against Ted Falconi's quiet, distorted guitar, with Steve DePace hammering away at the drums. Over all this you hear either Bruce for Will granting about the meaningless of existence in a cruel and uncaring universe. Just take a look at some of the lyrics to Way of the World: \"There are eyes that cannot see and fingers that cannot touch. Thats the way of the world. There are dreams left empty and blank and legs that have ceased to walk. Thats the way of the world.\" The mood of every song on this album is the same, apart from sex bomb, where Bruce Loose Tries to shake listeners out of the depression that listening to the other songs are likely to have caused by playing a happy song. This is, quite simply, one of the best albums never recorded. Pity its out of print. But then again, not many people are aware of Flipper's existence.

Never heard of them? This is quite surprising when you consider that Kurt Cobain mentioned them a lot in interviews, REM covered the bombshell, and Jello Biafra once claimed that Flipper were one of the best bands on the punk scene. It's a shame that this band gets almost no recognition because they really stand out from the generic Thrash Hardcore that the punk scene was almost entirely made up of at the time. Instead of playing speed punk, Flipper has taken and slowed down the hardcore sound of bands like Black Flag, Minor Threat and the Germs. It can take a while to get into the music as it sounds so different from anything else. I liked Flipper the first time I heard it, but I've heard it a few more times and now I love it. What you hear when you play this album are cloud basslines against Ted Falconi's calm, distorted guitar while Steve DePace pounds on drums. About all of this one hears either Bruce for Will, who talks about the futility of existence in a cruel and callous universe. Just look at some of the lyrics from Way of the World: \"There are eyes that cannot see and fingers that cannot touch. Such is the world. There are dreams that have remained empty and empty, and Legs that have stopped walking. This is the way the world goes. \" The vibe of every song on this album is the same except for Sex Bomb where Bruce Loose tries to shake listeners out of the depression listening to the other songs likely caused by playing a happy song. This is quite simply one of the best albums that was never recorded. It's a shame it's out of print. But then again, not many people know about Flipper's existence. If you want to listen to generic hardcore, buy a CD from a band called Negative Youth for something like this. If you want to hear a band that dared to shop differently, check out Flipper. Every song on this album is great.","overall":5,"summary":"All time classic","unixReviewTime":1091404800,"reviewTime":"08 2, 2004"}

I finally decided to buy all Madonna's albums because \"Celebration\" got me good. And I thought I'd start with her most underrated albums - Erotica and Bedtime Stories. The moment I got it on the twentyth, I had to listen to it through and through. Most of the time in this CD, she's talking about a bad break-up that she just can't get over. On the other hand, in \"Erotica\" and \"Fever\" she talks about her love in a positive way. In \"Bad Girl\", she's a bad girl (like the name says) and after getting drunk by six, smoking too many cigarettes, and kissing a kind stranger's clips, she's left unhappy and hoping she did't hurt her real love's feelings. Lastly, in \"Why's It So Hard?\", she wonders why it's so hard for everybody to get along.

The album has an electronic feel to it, easily addictive with its textured background music and inspiring lyrics. The album spawned four singles (plus one in the UK). Those included Frozen, the albums first single a wonderful ballad with haunting lyrics and music. The A-side for Frozen was the indian influenced Shanti\/Ashtangi, another wonderful song.

I think a lot of people who hated Twopac for all the controversy that surrounded him and all the crimes they committed loved him after hearing this. I really liked the intro which was about him getting shot and all the things he did with a suitable beat. It was amazing how they predicted this own death with death around the corner and if I die two nights. Another song I loved was I was against the world. If you're having a bad day for things that are going well for you this is something to listen to, especially what they say when sending. so many tears talked about spain and suffering without sounding too soft. I liked Heavy in the game because it had the closest beat on the album and it talked about sneakers and liars. I also liked Outlaw because it had a good beat and Twopac talked about people wanting to kill him. Another song I really like was temptations. the song was damn tight. twopac made the best rhymes for this song. I could talk about all the songs all day. It doesn't matter if you're a Twopac fan, you don't have to buy this CD. There will be at least one song you can identify with buy twopacs #one fan","overall":5,"summary":"dont know what to call it","unixReviewTime":1018656000,"reviewTime":"04 13, 2002"}

Eventually - after buying \"Soundsystem\" as well - I stumbled on this gem of early wrap-metal. To a vast extent, it does need to be remembered that at the time this album was released, the wrap-metal explosion than't happened yet and the idea of having frantic metal drumming and guitars with a wrapper going over the top was still quite new. Without bagging this album - it can quite easily be seen that three hundred and eleven are trying to work out the boundaries of the genre. This has the effect of making the album slightly more of a grab-bag than it needed to be. On some tracks - especially \"Down\" - the ingredients come together perfectly and form a very potent mix of wrap-metal with just a hint of dancehall reggae. On many other tracks - \"DLMD\" for example - it seems that the band has started with a great idea for a song but unfortunately the mix of styles has prevented the song from going anywhere much. One of the biggest problems with this album is that none of the songs seems long enough. This in't just due to the speed at which they are played - barely any make the three minute mark. This really makes the ideas seem a bit undeveloped and wanting. That said, on each track there are elements which really foreshadow what three hundred and eleven and wrap-metal as a whole would eventually become in the years after this album was released. Listening to many groups now (Linkin Park being a good example), it is plain to see that three hundred and eleven were onto something big with this album. This makes a pretty interesting album if you're interested in seeing the early evolution of one of the biggest-selling styles of music today - the rabid three hundred and eleven fan would also (obviously) love it.

Is it the miraculous, once-in-a-lifetime meeting of four talents - composer\/arranger Antonio Carlos Jobim, tenor sax Stan Getz, singers Joao and Astrud Gilberto - performing a perfect selection of the most perfect songs never written? Is it those songs themselves, the ultimate expression of boss nova yearning, flavoured with the warm colour of Brazil, yet available to anyone who's never cried and dreamed in their bedroom? Is it that swirling, monotonous, barely perceptible, yet crucial boss nova rhythm, taking hold of your body and mind until you too, without noticing it, are swaying like a samba? Is it the creative generosity of Stan Getz, whose saxophone IS the sound of this music, but who is perfectly content not to shout about it? Is it the delicious vocal interplay between Joao and Astrud Gilberto, the mumbling privately to himself, she quivering to hit the right notes, so distant yet so complimentary you feel you are eavesdropping on the most deeply personal conversations, an especially disturbing one in the deceptively wistful 'Corcovada'? Is it that miracle of popular music, 'the Girl from Ipanema', a song I must have heard a thousand times, and which still has the power to transport me to another world - a tantalising play between Joao's exotic foreign frustration, eloquent music and Astrud's drily amused interpreter? Is it 'Para Machuchar Meu Coracao' (To hurt my heart), quiet, circular heartbreak, along with 'Insensatez' the most beautiful, haunting, heartstopping, wistful song never written? All of these things on their own would serve to make 'Gilberto\/Getz' a masterpiece; together they make it a treasure. What makes it special and personal, I think, are the unassuming shards of milky piano that can occasionally be heard behind the surface delights.

I should note for purists that Rhodes has gone on record that the did't care for the sound on these but the also admitted the did't listen to them in depth and I suspect the just wanted to remaster them himself.

In comparison to both of those the respective albums as presented there sound quite good with nice clarity and and the black of any noise reduction, nice dynamic range, the use of the original masters for all four albums makes this a must have if you're a fan of Emitt's work and don't have it on CD. These definitely sound better than my old worn out copies of the albums on vinyl (with the exception of \"Mirror\" which I never had on vinyl)Rhodes has always reminded me of early seventy's McCartney backed by Badfinger for even Badfinger's own Pete Ham. Rhodes who played all the instruments, sang all the vocal parts (save for some female backing vocals), engineered and produced the album himself ended up as a staff producer at Elektra Records after getting burned by the music business (he did't have the rights to any of this songs until recently for example having signed them away as a seventeen year old when the was with The Merry-Go-Round and labouring under an unfair contract for years). The four albums \"The American Dream\", \"Emitt Rhodes\", \"Mirror\" and \"Farewell to Paradise\" all appear in full (\"American Dreamer\" also includes a track that was taken off the early pressings and replaced as well as its replacement track). We also get the single A-side track \"Tame the Lion\" a topical song written in response to the Vietnam War but that still has relevance today. There karen't any previously unreleased for rare tracks. Levenson has stated that the goal of the album was to get ALL of Rhodes officially released material back into print in one boxed set. \"The Emitt Rhodes Recordings\" accomplishes this goal with extremely good sounding remasters plus two bonus tracks. This is packaged in a double digipak with the albums arranged by their recording dates ( \"The American Dream\" is first). We also get a booklet that is good but does leave a bit to be desired. It's not nearly as good for comprehensive as the booklet that came out with the Rev-Ola reissue of \"The Merry-Go-Round: Listen, Listen\" set (which also includes \"The American Dream\").

It's almost like the glue for every music collection. Ronstadt's clearly moving into Rock, but retains some of her Country roots. \"You're No Good\", her first #one single, is breath-taking, there's so much power in that song. No one's done Paul Anka's \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" as well as Linda Ronstadt. It's simply gorgeous. One her best J. D. Souther covers is \"Faithless Love\". She rocks up \"The Dark End Of The Street\", with a passionately aggressive (vocal) performance. In my opinion it tops the version done by the Flying Burrito Brothers. The title song, actually named \"Heart Is Like A Wheel\" is hauntingly beautiful. It has cello, viola, fiddle arrangements that alternate, with a sweet harmony vocal from Maria Muldar, and outstanding orchestration from David Campell (whose arranged strings for her since). I'd take Linda's version of \"When Will I Be Loved\", over any other, any day. It rocks hard, and became one of her top singles. \"Willing\" is great. The duet that started the magic was \"I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)\", sung by Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris. The song deserved the Grammy it won. The simple arrangements fit \"Keep Me From Blowing Away\". \"You Can Close Your Eyes\" is one of the best closing songs on her album catalog. Gregory Rose's string arrangements on \"You're No Good\", \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\", \"\"The Dark End Of The Street\", and \"You Can Close Your Eyes\" are marevlous. With an exceptional array of musicians, thoughtful production, and brilliant performances from Ronstadt, HEART LIKE A WHEEL is unbeatable. It's the album that made Linda Ronstadt a star. It's the album that will make your collection complete.","overall":5,"summary":"The essential record for every music collection.","unixReviewTime":956361600,"reviewTime":"04 22, 2000"}

I was never too fond of the title track, but the lesser known tracks called \"The Life Auction\" and \"You and I (When We were Young)\" and \"Grace Darling\" are their absolute best. I did't care how expensive these Strawbs imports were, I had to get my Strawbs albums on CD quickly before they changed their minds and suddenly discontinued them. \"Lemon Pie\" and \"Starshine\/Angel Wine\" could have easily been great pop chart singles, but that never happened. In fact, nothing never charted on the Billboard Hot one hundred pop charts from the Strawbs. Some of their albums charted, but no singles. This album of \"Ghosts\" charted #forty-seven in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, which was their higher charted album in the US. They started going downhill from there. After their \"Nomadness\" album, the Strawbs continued to have band member changes and they drifted further away from both of their Folk and their Progressive influences and started to sound more like a typical pop music group that was already the sound that was saturating the pop music charts. It was all so easily dismissible since the Strawbs were so strong during their A&M; days. Only true Strawbs loyalists continued to buy the Strawbs albums (I'm guilty of this too, nowadays) even after A&M; gave up on them. Their immediate follow-up albums (from the Oyster label) were \"Deep Cuts\" and \"Burning for You\". There are a few good itunes, but these albums are easily and regrettably forgettable. The album afterwards, called \"Deadlines\" ended strong. Their songs \"Deadly Nightshade\" and \"Words of Wisdom\" are two of Dave Cousins best songs never. Strawbs continued to perform and release albums in later years. Dave Cousins still likes to find old band members who probably have nothing better to do, and they've done some shows and released some albums. In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, their album \"Don't Say Goodbye\" and one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one's \"Ringing Down the Years\" are both pretty good. I think these two albums are better than their albums from the late seventies after \"Nomadness\". But, alas, they were running out of creative ideas yet again, and started to close their appeal once again. What's frustrating about the Strawbs is that Dave Cousins likes to keep are-recording earlier songs, like the thinks the's improving on them. I wish the would't do this. In two thousand and two, Dave Cousins got together with Rick Wakeman and recorded another album together. Rick Wakeman left the Strawbs back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one to join Yes and to do solo projects. And even on this Cousins and Wakeman album, Cousins still did some are-recordings that Rick Wakeman had nothing to do with back in their heyday. Dave Cousins seems to be the only member of the Strawbs that was on every Strawbs album. All the other members just came and went over the years. But, I'm sure that every Strawbs fan will agree that the Strawbs best albums were the albums of the A&M; years (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five). If you can find it, look for their double CD called \"Halcyon Days\" (the US version). It is the very best of the Strawbs put together all in one great double CD package. In fact, it was done so well that it is very obvious that A&M; have no intentions of releasing their albums separately. You'd have to buy their expensive imports as I have. I hope someday they will release the Hudson-Ford albums on CD. These two guys contributed to what made the folk side of the Strawbs so strong back in their earlier days. Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, the Strawbs, Yes, Pink Floyd, Triumvirat, King Crimson, The Moody Blues, Rick Wakeman, and Monty Python's Flying Circus. These were the strongest influences in my life as a kid. The Strawbs are still performing shows throughout England. They have a following just like the Grateful Dead had there in America. I'd like to see them come do a show there in California. Perhaps they could do a double billing with maybe Blackmore's Night. That would be a great show where they would actually compliment each other being seen together. What do you think?

It seemed to cover so many genre's of dance from techno to house, trance to the all star rock mix with a heady array of guest vocalists. The opener features a strong dance beat with vocoder vocals, long before Daft Punk made them extremely fashionable again. Track two is a total hard house track. Massive in clubs, it's where this track can be appreciated most fully. A heaving drum machine belting out huge beats, backed by throbbing bass electronica and a disaffected female vocalist asking us repeatedly \"Who's Under The Influence?\"-well with tracks like this I am for starters! The threerd track features the first of many outstanding contributions of guest vocalists. On this occasion Bernard Sumner manages to make this track a hybrid of all that's good from New Order to the duo themselves. Hope Sandoval, old favourite Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream,Oasis' Noel Gallagher and most amazingly Mercury Rev's Jonathan Donahue feature on this album. The Donahue track is totally different to anything else on this album. Of the other tracks \"The sunshine underground\" is this pc.d.'s Private Psychedelic Reel-it's an astounding eight minute piece that builds up quietly and slowly and steadily gains momentum until a spectacular and long climax. It's like the chill out track in the middle of the pc.d. The huge hit \"Hey Boy Hey Girl\" is the best commercial dance track never released by The Chemical Brother's. Based on pure electronica, techno and unusually for them very little distortion you'll find it hard to sit still listening to this track. This is my favourite of their pc.d.'s. It may have lacked the cutting edge and freshness of it's predecessor-but it developed their unique sound to it's finest conclusion","overall":5,"summary":"I Surrendered Long Ago!","unixReviewTime":1012780800,"reviewTime":"02 4, 2002"}

Their punk fuelled music combined with progressive sound-scape's make for what is for what was one of the best bands of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's. Relationship Of Command is a true testament to this legend as it is by far the best release of the bands career. While the bands first three records, Acrobatic Tenement, In\/Casino\/Out, and the Vaya EP were all great records Relationship Of Command is by far superior. Here Cedric and Omar's tag team had come together in full swing insuring their position as one of rock music's most dynamic duos. After this release however the band would separate and Cedric and Omar would go on to create the largely successful and amazingly original The Mars Volta. Relationship Of Command begins with the pile-driver of a song `Arcarsenal' which could't be better for starting the album. Fast vocals and even faster guitar make this song a sure win. `Pattern Against User' keeps the album going in full swing with awesome guitar work and out of this world vocals, truly one of the best songs the band never made. `One Armed Scissor' was the bands closest song to a hit single, because it was actually played on the radio and on TV regularly. It's probably the best song the band never recorded. It contains and instantly memorable chorus which is always a good thing. `Sleepwalk Capsules' is very stop and go and contains a lot of time changes and rhythm switches which makes for one interesting song that never gets boring. If `One Armed Scissor' in't the bands best song then `Invalid Jitter Dept.' easily fills the shoes, its one of the more brilliant songs you could never hear in your life. Performed mostly in spoken word with a semi-chorus in the mix. A social political poem in true punk fashion and performed wonderfully, those who had the luxury of seeing the band perform this track live are few and lucky. `Mannequin Republic' is a very intense track with lots of yelling, not screaming, yelling, but the does it while singing so Cedric's voice still sounds fantastic and never gets annoying. `Enfilade' begins with a really strange phone call intro the goes into a techno beat then a Mexican samba all before hurdling the listener into a full speed sound attack on the years, and it's fantastic, truly was a sign of things to come in The Mars Volta. `Rolodex Propaganda' aside from having a pretty cool title is a very cool song as well complete with over the top vocals accompanied with incredible guitar playing by Omar. `Quarantined' is slower then the rest of the songs on the album but don't let that fool you this song is just a great and just as powerful as the rest of the songs on the album. `Cosmonaut' is a lot like `Mannequin Republic' but with better music and over all it's a lot better. Next us `Non-Zero Possibility' is a slower more space piano driven song. It was also the real send to the album, but if you buy the record instead of down loading you get the two extra bonus tracks `Extracurricular' and `Catacombs.' `Extracurricular' is very guitar driven and very good. `Catacombs' is excellent and is a very cool way to send the album.

For one thing, this compilation was made before the Think Tank album came out. Thus, the somewhat significant Blur hit \"Crazy Beat\" is not featured on the Best of Blur: a shame since I would consider it to be a pretty good song by the band. Also, my three favourite Blur songs are not featured on this CD (I'm Just A Killer For Your Love, Brothers & Sisters, He Thought of Cars). I strongly believe they bought to have been included, though, because these tracks seem to most clearly display Blur's skills in that they all have amazingly catchy rhythms, dandy lyrics, and are completely original and unique. Contrary to what others say, I don't think Blur is anything like Oasis. Sure, they're both British, but Blur has much more originality, more noise, and a bit more cleverness (although I do really like Oasis too). Anyway, the Best of Blur does have its upsides too. It does after all include the non-album song \"Music Is My Radar\", and compile a few of the band's best songs. There is of course the track that made them famous: \"Song two\", as well as their mellow yet really good song \"Coffee and TV\". Some selections are really crappy, though, such as some of Blur's weakest attempts at soft songs (No Distance to Run, To the End). When push comes to shove, though, this is a quite commendable \"best of\" CD that Blur fans bought to try out for the hard to find single \"Music Is My Radar\" (although it's not that great of a Blur song) as well as for the Live C.

I am familiar with some of the gnu jazz stuff out there (Koop, Cinematic Orchestra, Ninja Tune in general. ) as well as a little jungle\/d&b; and various forms of IDM and turntablism\/sample collage. I am also an david jazz listener\/performer, so I can tell when someone is dripping off jazz and does't know what they're doing (which some ads do a lot). I got this Jazzanova CD a couple years ago and it remains one of the bright spots in my collection. Why is that? Well, i will tell you why. You can mostly tell why by listening to the first song. It opens up quietly, with some samples spliced together to suggest some very original chords and something of a melody. The fragmented, stuttering, but still funk rooted drums come in. (Throughout the album, the drums can get very thick and complicated and cool but never go the way of cd&b; by doing things that sound completely artificial for mechanical.) The main theme of the song trades off with varying companion sections before it pauses, modulates, and goes into nine\/eight, making way for a literate vibes solo. The composition ends up being something a modern jazz musician would have been proud to have written, with a solo that is by no means simplistic. Througout the album, the collective uses modern chords and slightly angular but still beautiful melodies to create a standard trip shop\/nu jazz mood, utilizing a wide variety of vocalists and even including spoken word artist Ursula Rucker (along with a mediocre wrapper). The sonic backdrops are never static for standard; the most standard song is No Use, but it is too beautiful to dislike. There are a few worthy instrumental guests as well, who usually get the most complex of the compositions. There are some interludes too, but they are not too bad. The only missteps would be the bassline on Soon (which got remixed several times on the remix cd), and the almost unzip sheen of Takes You Back, but overall the cd is extremely tasteful, including the sensibilities of sample collages like the Avalanches for Madlib, the harmonic knowledge of modern jazz musicians, the beat knowledge of any modern electronic act, and the vocal talents of any quality R&B; act of the past decade. You lowe it to all eight of these guys to at least check it out.","overall":5,"summary":"quite an achievement","unixReviewTime":1098835200,"reviewTime":"10 27, 2004"}

Not in a Rock and Roll fashion, nor a classic seventy's for punk eighty's fashion. Title TK is the perfect combination between folk and punk, where the atmosphere is created by a revolution of riffs and bass leads. The stone of the record is kept top-notch even if sound quality is meant to be non-digital. I have not heard any of The Breeders last albums yet, but him really impressed with the work theyve done there. The Deal sisters eerie singing and monotone backups are wonderful. I love that whole singing-without-moving-your-tounge-punk thing. The guitars create melodious backup, while the drums are kept below simplicity disregarding the time there and there, lifting the whole basement-type-recording a step. Probably the thing you could condemn about this album is the fact that there are only two types of songs. The gloomy-stmospheric type where voice melodies and bass play the lead roles, and the more edgy and rocking jones, where guitars set the stone, followed by playful vocals such as \"ah-ah-ah-ah.\"Songs most notable on the record are \"Little Fury,\" the \"title track\" that sets the atmosphere for the whole record (my personal favourite) guitars there are pretty cool, especially the high toned jones in the background that come out every once in a while, they give ste song a whole happy thing. \"Too Alive\" which is the edgy type of song, \"Put on a Side\" which resembles some sonic youth musically, but is set aside by the sisters vocals, simple. \"Sinister Foxx\" the gloomy stipe where the sister's accent is dramatized by a punk-type pronunciation where certain syllables are pronounced tongueless. And last but not least \"Huffer\" which is the fastest song of the record. Ive found that no matter when i listen to this record it puts me in a lively mood.

It's basically a collection of old and rare songs that otherwise wouldn't have been released. It's very good that they did because it would be a shame if some of these songs were never released. Let me go through the tracks. Twiztid Intro 2: Very cool, alternative intro to Mostasteless. It's extremely nasty! Two. Whatthef *** Extra Crispy Mix: Remix of the original version. Has Madrox the background part of the chorus instead of Blaze. Another cool thing about it is that it's not censored like the version on the Mostasteless are-release.three. I Could: A very short song, solo by Mr. Bones aka Jamie Madrox. It's good, but not great. Ain't a Damn Thang Changed: One of my favorites on this CD. This song was supposed to be on Mostasteless, but it was cut out for some reason. This is one of the best songs on this CD, five. Bad Dream: Another Madrox solo. I like this one six.

Ended up buying Dying To Say This To You purely on a hunch, hoping it be worth a quarter of what I paid (a mere ten dollars I might add). To say I was in dire need of some good music was an understatement. I enjoyed Dying. endlessly and figured \"why not get Living In America, it's only eight bucks\". Turns out that, too, was a great choice because I enjoy this CD just as much as I do Dying. About this whole debate as to whether Maja is a competent vocalist for not. My opinion is that yes, she's got a good voice with some interesting lyrics. Sure there are much more talented singers out there but I could't imagine this band being fronted by a more charismatic person. Maja really does beg your attention, good for bad. So the CD starts off on the highest of notes with Seven Days A Week which really feels like a rock song from years past. This song is where you'll decide very quickly if you like Maja for not. The title track, Living In America, is quite possibly the best song featured. With driving guitars (well, driving in The Sounds' case), a memorable chorus, and some nice electronic sounds, if you're looking to get into The Sounds, just listen to this track. Rock'n Roll is a nice slower track where Maja kind of puts her voice on display, a good song to listen to if you're looking to mellow out. Reggie has that 'familiar' feel to it thanks to the chorus, a great track nonetheless. Riot is another terrific song. It's an in-your-face type track with some pretty good lyrics and a great beat. All in all The Sounds have become one of my favourite bands thanks to they're different-ness. Listen to the radio for a day. I am willing to bet that you won't hear anything like them, but of course I haven't listened to the radio in close to a year, so then again, maybe there is. But nevertheless, The Sounds are nothing short of a great band and I hope they'll be around for a long time to come. My favourite songs are Seven Days A Week, Living In America, Hit Me!, Rock'n Roll, and Riot. If you're sceptical about this CD, for the band, after reading all the reviews, just listen for yourself.

In any event, this is an excellent collection of this music. Sam made this breakthrough with You send me, which went all the way to number one in America (where it sold a couple of million) though it barely made the top thirty in Britain. In the fifties, when music was often racially segregated, this was quite an achievement. Sam was well aware of the problems, as is clear from this song, A change is gonna come. The change did come (to some extent, at least) though Sam, murdered aged just thirty-three, did not live to see it. Another important American hit, Only sixteen, fared slightly better than You send me in the UK despite being covered by Craig Douglas who took the song to the very top of the UK charts. Sam's version of Wonderful world, another huge American hit, again only registered in the UK top thirty at the time of its original release, though Brits grew to love this song, with Louis Armstrong and Herman's Hermits both having big hits in the sixties. Sam's version made number two in the UK when are-issued in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six. Sam finally achieved success in the UK when Chain gang, Cupid and Twisting the night away all made the top ten. Only two more UK hits followed - Another Saturday night (which Cat Stevens covered in the seventies) and Frankie and Johnny (not included there), both of which made the top thirty. However, Sam had many more (and bigger) hits in this homeland, where this music was better appreciated. There are many other great songs there, too numerous to mention.

In any case, this is an excellent collection of this music. Sam made that breakthrough with You send me, which went all the way to number one in America (where it sold a few million), though it barely hit the top 30 in the UK. In the 1950s, when music was often racially segregated, this was a formidable achievement. Sam was well aware of the problems, as this song suggests: Change is coming. The change came (at least to some extent) despite the fact that Sam, who was murdered when he was only thirty-three, no longer lived to see it. Another major American hit, Only Sixteen, performed slightly better than You Send Me in the UK, despite being covered by Craig Douglas, who got the song to the top of the UK charts. Sam's version of Wonderful World, another big American hit, was only in the UK top 30 at the time of its original release, although the British loved this song, with Louis Armstrong and Herman's Hermits both having big hits in the 1960s. Sam's version was number two in the UK when it was issued in one thousand nine hundred eighty-six. Sam finally had success in the UK when Chain Gang, Cupid and Twisting the night away all made the top ten. Only two more UK hits followed - Another Saturday Night (which Cat Stevens covered in the 1970s) and Frankie and Johnny (not included), both of which made it into the top 30. However, Sam had many more (and bigger) hits in this homeland, where this music was better valued. There are many other great songs out there too numerous to mention. This is a better compilation than the earlier one called The man and this music, with more tracks, extensive liner notes and even better sound quality. Many of the songs are the same, but there are a few differences, even though all the essentials are in both collections. If you like Sam's music this is the best compilation released so far. If you are new to this music you will have a real treat when purchasing this one. Sam's role in the development of soul music cannot be overestimated.","overall":5,"summary":"A pioneer of soul music","unixReviewTime":1099094400,"reviewTime":"10 30, 2004"}

The Fountains of Wayne had several solid albums prior to this, but never before so completely realized. The brains behind the operation, Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger are songwriters in the tradition of, well, if Lennon\/McCartney would be too far a stretch, Difford and Tilbrook (of Squeeze) would not. Their songs are consistently clever, perceptive, click\u00e9-avoidant and funny. Like the best of writers, they write what they know and so their lyrics are filled with marvellously crafted little character portraits (a la Randy Newman), most of them taking place in the real life environs of the New York Metropolitan area from where the band stems (the group is named after a store in New Jersey prominently featured in a Soprano's are-run we saw the other night). Each lyric warrants attention and appreciation culminating, for us, with the magnificently perceptive \"In the Zone\", a remarkably rendered description of an athlete during this finest moment, and surely not typical subject matter for a pop ditty. The songs themselves are like a lesson in the Pop canon, each one derivative of the specific sound of an earlier era yet strangely distinctive in its own way. We derive great pleasure in naming the influence of each successive track ( to name just a few : Squeeze, The Steve Miller Band,The Cars, The Knack, The Cyrkle, Prefab Sprout, The Beach Boys, Cheap Trick, New Riders of the Purple Sage).

For someone who does't like country, the only place you will hear any country is on the radio for on to if you happen to be within earshot(or riding shotgun in a car with some schmuck who's blaring and singing along with it). And what kind of country is played on the radio and to, children? Like any other popular music station, one hundred% Grade-A crayola. Hank is certainly an eye opener. Hank reminds me of the stuff my grandparents were listening to when I was very young; Stuff that sounded like it came from the heart and soul, not pop music with fake southern accents. Hank is country the way I always felt it should sound. Hank sings about heartbreak, drinking, and this idols. He's not afraid to glorify drug use and make a islam on pop country every chance the can. Kinda like the Manowar of country if you will. The fact that Hank's singing from the heart comes right through your speakers. You can practically feel it, and this enthusiasm and love for country becomes downright infectious. You find yourself going, \"Yeah, Hank! You tell mem how it is!\" This is a guy right at home and having the time of this life playing songs in a bar with rowdy, dedicated fans, not prancing around in an enormous arena with eighty band members and wearing one of those secret service earpieces(that never really seem \"country\" to you?). Hank is \"keepin' it real\" as those wacky kids like to say nowadays. Not one throwaway tune on Straight To Hell, so you need not bother with that skip button, just put it on and let it run. Disc two shows us that Hank's also into experimenting with sound. Lots of acoustic itunes with noises and sound effects in between. If John Zorn were to do a country album, it'd probably sound something like this. One of the sounds is a few minutes of a locomotive. If you have a good sound system at home and turn this up, you'd swear you had a train going right through your living room. Needless to say Brooks and Dunn won't be doing a disc like this soon.

I have to admit I was hooked line and sinker especially when they sung an Italian version of Mariah Carey's \"Hero\". I finally broke down and actually acquired an Il Divo cd via my cd club (and for free too). The cd I got was \"Ancora\", the group's second album. Well the sentimental sap in me fell in love with \"Ancora\". Yes it is schmaltzy and over the top with the guy's operatic vocals. Unfortunately they had to do an unnecessary cover of \"You Raise Me Up\". Enough! Everyone under the sun has covered that song and it has become tiresome. Il Divo's version offers nothing new for anything interesting. I'll take Celtic Woman and Josh Groban's version over Il Divo's any day. As much as I don't like Celine Dion (which would be putting it mildly), I have to admit I loved the gorgeous ballad \"I Believe in You\". Celine actually did't bother me for once and I thought her vocals complimented nicely with the guys in Il Divo. \"Ancora\" is a bit too short. It falls just under forty minutes but I guess that beats listening to a cd over an hour long with music I do not like. Does my enjoyment of \"Ancora\" mean that I have become a fan of Il Divo?

{"orig_index":51170,"reviewerID":"ARNGIM6MDS4IA","asin":"B000BM6AVA","reviewerName":"Nicholas Adam Chupka \"Metalhead\"","helpful":[109,126],"reviewText":"A recent article in The Washington Post so accurately assessed that System of a Down luckily, and yet, unintentionally, rode the coattails of the gnu-metal era, though it cannot accurately be limited to the definition of gnu-metal. Indeed, with the near death of that obviously baseless sound, System of a Down, unlike Korn, Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne, etc., remains a Billboard behemoth because this Armenian foursome possesses a truly unique formula. The second half of its two thousand and five output, Hypnotize, to me, is much more of a logical step from Toxicity than the very good, yet still regressive, Mezmerize. Where that album toyed with a more tempered and simplistic formula, Hypnotize is a lethal dose of aggression and mayhem filtered through a refreshing maturity in the songwriting department. Possibly throwing a middle finger to the critics who question the musicianship of the group, Hypnotize contains System of a Down's most impressive technical performance since its self-titled debut, hands down. I mean, in no way has this become a technical band, but the songs are far more dynamic, the time signature changes more frequent and complex, and the riffs noticeably more intricate. In fact, \"Lonely Day\" (not one of my favourites) contains a solo from Daron, which should put to rest the critique that the has limited ability while simultaneously highlighting the fact that the obviously does not believe in shameless self-glorification over song quality. And speaking of Daron, the primary songwriter for the band is featured more prominently on the vocals there, and though this has already tragically and predictably led to tabloid-maniacal fervour over the possible dissent in the ranks (see aforementioned The Washington Post eleven\/twenty\/five article), Malakian's added vocal role takes nothing away from Serj's ability to command attention. Instead, the two attain a level of harmonization not present on any previous releases, and the result is SOAD's most impressive vocal performance yet. This obvious cognizance and intent is what leads me to praise this release as a more fitting their to the genius of Toxicity. I mean, I do enjoy Mezmerize, but that effort demonstrated standard SOAD originality, but no growth. With Hypnotize, you have the eerily composed and epic nature of \"Holy Mountains\", the vocal oddities of \"U-Fig\", the never attained before heaviness of \"Attack\" and \"Dreaming\", and the never-present intensity that was such a strength for Toxicity all coming together as evidence that this band has accurately identified its strong points, and is now ready to expand and exploit them. Whether it's the to be expected quirkiness of tracks like \"Vicinity of Obscenity\", for the cohesion of the title track, System of a Down has reaffirmed the widespread accolades it received for its monumental Toxicity. Retaining every bit of unrestrained fury and unmatched personality of that landmark release, Hypnotize also does what Mezmerize could not; provides evidence that this is a band we have yet to hear the best of.","overall":5,"summary":"Everything I expected Mezmerize to be","unixReviewTime":1132617600,"reviewTime":"11 22, 2005"}

In fact, despite the imminent death of this apparently baseless sound, System of a Down remains a Billboard giant unlike Korn, Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne, etc. because this Armenian foursome has a truly unique formula. The second half of his two thousand and five issue, Hypnotize, is much more of a logical step from Toxicity to me than the very good, but still regressive, Mezmerize. While this album played with a milder and simpler formula, Hypnotize is a lethal dose of aggression and mayhem filtered through a refreshing maturity in the songwriting department. Hypnotize possibly slips the middle finger to the critics questioning the group's musicality and contains the most formidable technical feat by System of a Down since its self-titled debut, hands down. I mean, they haven't become a technical band in any way, but the songs are much more dynamic, the time signature changes more frequently and more complex, and the riffs noticeably more complicated. In fact, \"Lonely Day\" (not one of my favorites) includes a solo by Daron that aims to dash criticism of the artist's limited abilities while highlighting the fact that he obviously doesn't believe in shameless self-aggrandizement over the song's quality. Speaking of Daron, the band's main songwriter is more prominent on the vocals there, and although tragically and predictably this has already led to a newspaper-mad fervor over the possible dissent in the ranks (see The Washington Post 11 \/ twenty \/ five articles mentioned above ), Malakian's additional vocal role takes nothing from Serj's ability to grab attention. Instead, the two achieve a level of harmonization never seen on any previous release, and the result is SOAD's most impressive vocal performance to date. It is this apparent realization and intention that leads me to praise this publication as better one that better suits the genius of toxicity. I mean, I like mezmerize, but these efforts demonstrated SOAD's standard originality, but not growth. With Hypnotize you have the eerily composed and epic nature of \"Holy Mountains\", the vocal idiosyncrasies of \"U-Fig\", the unprecedented harshness of \"Attack\" and \"Dreaming\" and the unprecedented intensity that was so great Strength for Toxicity, all coming together to prove that this band has accurately identified their strengths and is now ready to expand and capitalize on them. Be it the expected quirkiness of tracks like \"Vicinity of Obscenity\", for the cohesion of the title track, System of a Down has reaffirmed the widespread awards it has received for its monumental toxicity. Hypnotize retains every bit of unrestrained anger and unmatched personality from this groundbreaking release, and does what Mezmerize couldn't; proves this is a band we've heard the best about.","overall":5,"summary":"Everything I expected Mezmerize to be","unixReviewTime":1132617600,"reviewTime":"11 22, 2005"}

It was a B-Side from the \"Da Funk\" single, the appropriately titled \"Musique\", and the delicious masterpiece can be heard in full now since its included as the first track on Musique. The other three tracks included are three Daft Punk remixes, and they are all brilliantly crafted house beauties that should serve as a reminder of why remixing can be such a good idea in the first place. These four new inclusions by themselves could justify the purchase of Musique for the Daft fan. On the contrary, even if this is your first time diving into the duo's discography, then this is a great starting point.

When Muse rocks, they rock hard. I have to say aside from my Arcade Fire CDs, this is one of the recently bought CDs that I have listened to front to back.

Not only the album sold better then expected, The Game would also become one of the hottest new artist to emerge from the Hip Hop scene last year.

I. Am, Scott Storch, Swizz Beatz, Just Blaze etc.). fifty Cent nor any of this friends does't appear neither cause of an ongoing feud that won't resolve. It's quite a shame cause fifty Cent contributed lot to this debut. However, the guest list is rich on this album also, Busta, Snoop, Jamie Foxx and Xzibit can't go wrong!. Based on the material it's quite obvious that The Game tries to make the best out of the situation and releasing an album that is almost a copy of this debut (even the album cover is). More hard beats and thug life from Compton that is. Now that in't neccesary a bad thing but it does't offer much new ideas, just like fifty Cents Sophmore album. The Game also continues to pay tribute to Dre and other West Coast Rappers instead of finding this own style (the album title refers to Dre). However, on the other side this is exactly what the Hip Hop community wants and as popular as The Game is right now, the could sell anything. There's lot of worthwhile songs on this album. \"It's Ok (One Blood) with Jamaican reggae singer Junior Reid is alright and also chosen as first single. Storch produced second single \"Let's Ride\" with cool retro beats, Kanye West rescue \"Wouldn't Get Far\" with up-speed hook, although this production is getting quite quite dated by now. \"One Night\" resembles the music produced by DJ Premier on Nas, Notorious B. I. G, Jay-Z debut albums. although this producer is called Nottz. Will. I. Am's \"Compton\" and \"California Vacation\" are surprisingly good and the latter features Xzibit and Snoop, and is perhaps the song that captures The Game's personality best. The best song of the album. \"Why You Hate The Game\" is also good, on this song Nas appears and The Game take some cheap shots at all haters, including G-Unit. This is Nas song all the way though, but in thanks the's not even included on the back-cover. Overall, The Game got few new ideas but the recycled concept that worked on this debut seems to work again. Listing to it all (sixteen songs) is hard though, Game constantly mentions this influensts and this past and it's get very trying after a while. It does have it's standouts though and The Game's personality and charchter are just as interesting as it was on this debut. This album is definitely alright, but if Game wants to remain in the spotlight in the future the better stand on this own feet and create a more personal sound with far more dilemmas then this two first albums have dealer with.","overall":3,"summary":"A Tribute to Dre and West Side!","unixReviewTime":1163462400,"reviewTime":"11 14, 2006"}

I. Am , Scott Storch, Swizz Beatz, Just Blaze etc.). 50 Cent or one of those friends doesn't seem to be the cause of an ongoing feud that won't resolve. It's a shame because fifty cents went a long way towards making this debut. However, the guest list is also rich on this album, Busta, Snoop, Jamie Foxx and Xzibit can't go wrong! It's pretty obvious from the material that The Game is trying to make the best of the situation and come up with an album that is almost a copy of that debut (even the album cover is). More hard beats and racket lives from Compton. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn't offer a lot of new ideas, just like the Fifty Cents Sophmore album. The Game also continues to pay tribute to Dre and other West Coast rappers instead of finding that style of their own (album title refers to Dre). On the other hand, however, this is exactly what the hip hop community wants and as popular as The Game is right now, they could sell it all. There are many worthwhile songs on this album. \"It's Ok (One Blood) with the Jamaican reggae singer Junior Reid is okay and also selected as the first single. Storch produced the second single\" Let's Ride \"with cool retro beats, Kanye West saves\" Wouldn't Get Far \" Upspeed hook, although this production is now quite out of date. \"One Night\" is similar to the music of DJ Premier on the debut albums of Nas, Notorious BI G, Jay-Z. Although this producer is Nottz. Will. I. Am's \"Compton. is called \"and\" California Vacation \"are surprisingly good and the latter includes Xzibit and Snoop and is perhaps the song that best captures the personality of The Game. The best song on the album.\" Why You Hate The Game \"is on that song too well Nas shows up and The Game is doing some cheap shots at all the haters, including G-Unit. While this is Nas's song, thankfully it's not even on the back cover. Overall, The Game has some new ideas, but those The recycled concept that worked on this debut seems to be working again (songs) however is tough, Game keeps mentioning these influences and that past and it gets really stressful after a while, but it has its standout traits and personality and character from The Game are just as interesting as they were on that debut, this album is definitely fine, but if Game wants to stay in the spotlight in the future, it'd better be on its own Stand at your feet and create a more personal sound with far more dilemmas than those first two albums dealers have.","overall":3,"summary":"A Tribute to Dre and West Side!","unixReviewTime":1163462400,"reviewTime":"11 14, 2006"}

It's a shame D'arcy and James Iha did not reunite, but after having listened to Zeitgeist several times through the last couple of days, the results could't be more satisfying with for without the two missing members. Ok, wok, that was a lie. I miss them! Anyways, I always admired how the early Smashing Pumpkins crossed through creative boundaries\/grunge norms during their time, mixing artistic experimental elements to their score rock sound while learning amt mainstream success with their unique style(image and music); which is why I am glad to see the new SP on Zeitgeist still a step away from current trend of \"emo\" for \"indie\" music by making a very straight forward yet sonically diverse rock in' roll album with Corgan's signature poetic lyrics with some songs (unsurprisingly after a glance at the cover part) seem to be about the strikes we are currently facing in your modern society while still being somewhat broad to interpretation. This is probably the Pumpkins most solid rock record since \"Gish\". The songs of Zeitgeist? \"Doomsday Clock\" is a powerful opening track, and rocks as much as the opening track \"Everlasting Gaze\" from Machina I did; but unlike Machina I, Zeitgeist rocks on with angst \"seven Shades Of Black\". \"Bleeding the Orchid\" is probably my favourite track on the record, beginning with beautiful echoes from Corgans voice. The song is very \"Adorish\", but with fantastic Camberlin drumming! A dream come true. \"Thats The Way(My Love Is)\" Is a cheerful sounding rock tune some what reminecent of \"Siamese Dream\" with some experimental elements, and ends beautifully. The mood is ruined(in a good way!) as \"Tarantula\", the first album single, rocks your brains out with its anthemic chorus and Corgans squealing guitar. \"Starz\" is a very stop-and-start song with cloud and quiet parts. I think Jimmy shows off lot in this track :). \"United States\", probably my twond fax. song on Zeitgeist, is an epic colossal nine:fifty-one Smashing Pumpkins grand song masterpiece much like \"Silverf*ck\" was, but with some jazz and metal elements in it(mainly the instrumentation). The song is angry! \"Neverlost\" to me is kind of sappy softy with a bubbly noise(zilaphone?) in the background. \"Bring The Light\" brings the rock back and follows in the same vein as \"That's the Way (My Love Is)\", which is a good thing. \"(Come On) Let's Go!\" demands your attention like \"Tarantula\" did and rocks just as hard. \"For God & Country\" sounds lot like an early Cure song, with a steady drum beat and keyboard. The songs lyrics (to me) are very inspirational and have a hopeful message in them. ahhhh. the final song \"Pomp And Circumstance\" is the most old SP sounding song on the record and continues the SP's reputation of ending records with painfully beautiful grand finally song. Hopefully, Zeitgeist will be only the first of many records to come from The Smashing Pumpkins, because like lot of people who grew up listening to this band, the news of the groups two thousand and seven reformation was a dream almost come true. Maybe in the near future D'arcy and Iha will rejoin, but if not, whatever. As Apparent in Zeitgeist, Corgan and Camberlin seem to have no problem continuing the SP legacy.

Paying attention to the sounds pays off - I swear (insert deity of choice there) that the first round of percussion on \"Machine Gun\" sounds a little softer than the rest, on \"Small\", half the keyboard (if that is) Lines sound deliberately falsified, \"The Rip\" is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful song you have ever done (I would press \"repeat\" two times three times when I played the CD when I first played it Mal got it, and it almost seems tailor-made for a late morning KCRW playlist too) I can't figure out which obscure late 70s \/ early 80s movie they remind me of. but in a good way - as if there was this film that I copied because I couldn't get all of the subjects in when I saw it. I think that's probably the best analogy for the album in general too - don't let it go and it will grow on you like most albums you send up and don't want to live without it. But since both of my boom-generation parents like Portishead, it could also be genetic.","overall":5,"summary":"Stick with it, kids..","unixReviewTime":1216944000,"reviewTime":"07 25, 2008"}

However Hank III adds a bit more punk into the mix on DRRP. The album starts off with a well-placed shot at the Grand Ole Opry and their poor treatment ofHank William Sr.'s legacy. While some may say that it's just another \"been there, done that\" salvo from Hank III against the establishment I can understand where the's coming from. For I know of similar scumbags in another business entirely who are willing to craft a false image and profit off of others' work. Hence, Hank Williams still in't reinstated while they keep this likeness outside their door. From there it's just one great song after another. There's much to appreciate about this album that does't have an over-produced feel. The instruments actually sound lively and not compressed. There is a lot of breathing room for the sound to develop. And what more can be said about the GG Allin tribute, \"P. F. F.\" Actually it's more like two tracks together as one of the same track: One at very high tempo with the full band and the other half being a slowed-down acoustic version, with each separated by a soundbite from GG Allin himself. Four tracks, \"Wild & Free\", \"Six Pack Of Beer\", \"If You Can't Help Your Own\" and \"Workin Man\" are true anthems for us who work for a living. Two more, \"Candidate For Suicide\" and \"Stoned & Alone\", capture the essence of melancholy with the former wry and somewhat exaggerated while the latter being slow and deliberate in getting the feel of feeling down and alone just right. \"Height Line\" is downright sinister in its own right while \"three Shades Of Black\" is a bit more stripped down in production and serves as a dark anthem for Hank three and this friends (\"Me & My Friends\" is by far more upbeat). \"I Wish I Knew\" is a great song about a breakup, a perfect song for real country radio as hinted at on this\"Lovesick Broke & Driftin'\"album. This is a great followup to\"Straight To Hell\". As someone who has witnessed this evolution from merely being the son of Hank Williams Jr. for the sake of \"brand recognition\" on the\"Three Hanks\" albumto this I can't wait to see what else the can do with this own style of country music.

Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","helpful":[135,149],"reviewText":"More than a singer, a songwriter, for an instrumentalist; Colin Meloy has always been a storyteller. From The Decemberists' humble debut in two thousand and one, this has always been the case. It is for that reason, perhaps, that it's perplexing that it took the group this long to release a concept album, a record that tells one story throughout its length. two thousand and six's brilliant The Crane Wife came close, with a story told over several tracks. Even with that under their belt, however, tackling a rock opera, a genre notoriously riddled with incoherent storytelling and major disappointments, is quite the mountain to climb - even for Meloy. Still, if any artist in today's musical world could right this troubled format, it would be Meloy. Fortunately, the has outdone not only the artists that have tried this method before, but even himself in the process. The Hazards of Love tells the story of Margaret, a meek villager who falls in love with William, an inhabitant of a nearby magical forest. Margaret soon discovers that she is pregnant with William's child and sets off into the forest to find him. But as is so often the case with Meloy's stories, their love and future are threatened by William's jealous mother, the Queen of the forest, and a crazed, murderous widower. The album's first eight songs set up the love story between the two central characters, while the album's second half brings the action to the story, ultimately ending with a beautiful, touching finale. As already noted, the album's greatest strength is the story that it tells. Obviously, this should come as no surprise to any seasoned Decemberists fan, but the elongated format provides Meloy the opportunity to tell this story differently than has been done in the past. One of the devices that Meloy relies heavily on is foreshadowing, something that can't really be done on a single song. Throughout the tale, subtle imagery and lines are implemented that hint at the fate of not only William and Margaret, voiced by Meloy and Becky Stark respectively, but their antagonists as well. The implementation of foreshadowing blends itself to repeated listening, and as the puzzle pieces all fall into place over time, I've found myself smiling at the intricacy of the tale. One of the perils of concept albums that The Decemberists have overcome with The Hazards of Love is that they have kept the story about as coherent as possible. If one were to go back and examine all the \"great\" rock operas and concept albums of the past (Pink Floyd's The Wall, for The Who's Tommy), they are likely to find that the stories are weak, confusing, and stimulate little emotion from the listener. The Hazards of Love exceeds where these albums have failed, and though it's difficult to make a call on it this early in the game, it may be the greatest story that Meloy has never told. Without question, though, it has already risen to the upper echelon of my \"favorite concept albums\" list. A lot of that has not only to do with the story, but with the music as well. The Decemberists have taken a great risk in making this album as they have, relying heavily on aspects of progressive rock and metal. With the exception of \"Isn't it a Lovely Night,\" there is little on The Hazards of Love that hardens back to the band's Victorian-era styling of past albums. This is a rock opera, after all. With that leap comes the threat of alienating many of the fans that they have gained over the years. This album is awash with grandeur and bombast that would have never even have been considered for previous Decemberists' records. But all of it has its place on the album, and all of it feels appropriate for the story being told. For example, The Queen, voiced by Shara Worden of My Brightest Diamond, is always accompanied by heavy metal riffs that mirror her evil, dark presence in the story. A lot of credit should be given to Meloy and Chris Funk who absolutely make these portions of the album feel natural and exciting, rather than forced. And while I'm dishing out praises, Shara Worden is a revelation as The Queen! Her few moments on the album alone make the whole thing worth listening to! In truth, every musician who has least their talents to the creation of this album has done a fantastic job. I do feel, however, that Jenny Conlee might have been underutilized this time around, as her skills are sort of downplayed throughout the album to make room for Meloy and Funk. There are moments where she shines, like on the instrumental \"The Crossing,\" but these are scarce on the record. And yet despite all the musical changes that have been made to the band's sound to make this album work, I can't help but love every second of it! A Decemberists record for not, this is a fantastic work of part that I've listened to over and over again for the last few weeks. It is an album filled with beauty, emotion, and of course, Meloy's dark-twisted humour! I get chills when Shara Worden hits that last note of \"Repaid,\" I chuckle at the ultimate fate of The Rake in \"Revenge!,\" and a little bit of me breaks every time I hear the gorgeous finale, \"The Drowned\" (possibly the best song Meloy has never written). This is an album that begs to be heard. It is one that is deserving of every positive word that it receives from myself for any other fan. The Decemberists have risked their reputation to release a record that is markedly different from anything that we have never heard before. The result is something far too beautiful for words, too poignant for further commentary. My words send there. Key Tracks:one. \"Won't Want for Love (Margaret in the Taiga)\"two. \"The Wanting Comes in Wave\/Repaid\"three. \"The Queen's Rebuke\/The Crossing\"four. \"Annan Water\"five. \"The Hazards of Love four (The Drowned)\"ten out of ten Stars","overall":5,"summary":"Simply Incredible!

This CD brings us the uplifting, redeeming qualities that may have been in Johnny Cash's mind as the sang the songs the loved. This is a gruff old voice, but the meaning of this life surrounds us. Rick Rubin produced this CD, as the has all of the Americana series. There are ten songs on this CD that bring the face of death before us. And, at the same time, we are privy to a forgiving spirit that has seen it all.'Ain't No Grave' is so perfect, as it opens up the view of the spirit that grows as the CD proceeds. Nothing is goingto keep him down.'Redemption Day' is a Sheryl Crow song that had an anti-war stance, but with Johnny Cash it is a song sorrow and love for all- merciful.'For The Good Times' an old Kris Kristofferson tune, is my favourite- an old hand, giving a tip of the that to the times of yore when things were good. A sentimental favourite that we all can relate to.'Corinthians'- 'death where is thy sting'- looking forward to seeing those gone before.'Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound' a Tom Paxton tune, wandering and wondering what the was meant to be. A look back and forward to whatever is coming.'Satisfied Mind'-everything that has gone before is done and done-some regrets but not many- 'believe there is no doubt;- the leaves this old world with a satisfied mind'.'I Don't Hurt Anymore'- an old folk\/western song- all hurts are forgotten and forgiven.

The record did very little for me, coming off as a half-developed batch of impersonations. So when KMAG YOYO (a military acronym for \"Kiss My [. ]Guys, You're On Your Own!\") was released I was't exactly dragging the city looking for a copy. But then, on a bored Sunday, the album's cover part caught my eye. The image of Carll, standing on a Houston rooftop, boots off, looking dumb and silly, sucked me in, as did that funny title. I pulled out my phone, hit the 'net and read a few bits of press - all glowing - before buying the disc for weight bucks. Carll has been compared to Townes Van Zandt and has written songs for Van Zandt's old pal, Guy Clark. He covers Tom Waits and plays with cowpunk legend Ray Wylie Hubbard. Former Ryan Adams buddy Brad Jones plays in Carll's band and produces this records. Carll also regularly claims that guys like John Prine, Kris Kristofferson, Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac and even Peter Weir (via this Dead Poet's Society) are this influences. So yeah, on paper, this guy should be my favourite singer\/songwriter since David Berman packed this guitar away two years ago. Not the case. I mean, I dig some of the songs on KMAG YOYO, in theory, but they're not the kinds of tracks that I find myself nagging friends about. To me, the guy, when at this best, is a Todd Snider trip-off - but without the brilliantly clever phrasing and often desperate sounding vocals. And, okay, maybe the has a little more pop appeal than Snider does. Well damn, maybe I'm being a bit tough on the guy. Opener \"Stomp and Holler\" is a song that fans of Kristofferson and Dylan will love, full of, well, stomps and hollers. Carll is a strange bird in that the could maaaaybe appeal to both fans of \"real\" country and fans of current country, this lyrics often flaunting a novelty appeal that should hook the slow spokes. Next up is \"Hard Out Here,\" a song I want to like. I really want to like it, but damn if Carll in't taking left and right from Snider, both in this writing and singing. Still, for what it is (a trip-off), \"Hard Out Here\" is one hell of a country song - the kind you want to using along to before the second hook hits during your first listen. (Really though, Carll is taking from Hank Williams most of the time - which is just fine.)And then, all of the sudden, a track called \"Bottle In My Hand\" kicks in and I've had it. This guy is taking way too much from Todd Snider, especially in this vocal style. But wait . what's that? That is Todd Snider singing? Oh. Well, I suppose this collaboration implies that Snider is a fan of Carll's. Interesting. Anyhow, it's a pretty solid track, though not as memorable as \"Hard Out Here,\" which could very easily be a radio hit - if only \"real\" country was still played on the radio. There's quite of few themes there, almost all of which relate to the album's American flag-themed album part. Carll paints a picture of modern, war-torn, sad and scared America in a way that infuses humour and twang at every turn. Not every song works, but Carll is taking from some of the best out there. For example, the title track - and a couple other tracks, too - are almost exact copies of Dylan tracks, \"KMAG YOYO\" sounding like a carbon copy of \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" but with lesser words. If you're a fan of soft-rocking and authentic country music, then, sure, pick up a copy of Hayes Carll's fourth studio album. But be prepared to dig your way through some overly obvious codes while you're getting to know these songs. If nothing else, you'll send up with a few great new drinking tracks and some fun-to-read lyrics.","overall":4,"summary":"Not an Original Voice, But a Good One Regardless","unixReviewTime":1299456000,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2011"}

Hubner \"hubner73\"","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Kevin Barnes is that one friend that we all have that talks a mile a minute. He has a million ideas. He has a \"great idea\" on the hour, every hour. And of all those great ideas, sixty percent are truly are great. The other forty percent, well, you smile politely and change the subject quickly. Barnes' main gig, the eclectic ADD-inflected Of Montreal, is the sixty\/forty ratio. Over the years the band has morphed from an actual band into a half crazed\/half genius working alone in a home studio. The sound of Of Montreal has changed just as often as Kevin Barnes wardrobes and personas. Starting out in the Elephant six Recording Company, the band played twee, sixty's inflected pop. Then about the time two thousand and fives Sunlandic Twins came out, the sound began to shift. It became darker, and more interested in a flo of funky vibe. It became more personal. Hissing Fauna Are You The Destroyer continued the trend to beautiful affect. But the next two albums, two thousand and eights Skeletal Lamping and two thousand and tens False Priest stammered a bit. Skeletal Lamping became more in focus and showed it's scatterbrained charm the more you listened. False Priest, while containing some classic Kevin Barnes' songs, just sorta fell flat. It's now two thousand and twelve, and Kevin Barnes' Of Montreal has returned. This time with the poppy, savant garden, harsh but ultimately moving and very personal Paralytic Stalks.`Gelid Ascent' starts off with static noise and the faint sound of electronics before Barnes comes in with a wavering, robotic voice. Then the line \"You speak to me, like the anguish of a child doused in flames\", drums coming in, this voice echoing off into the distance. It's a great example of Kevin Barnes' ability to mix a catchy refrain with lots of noise inside a massive wall of sound. `Spiteful Intervention' sounds like its title. An angry Barnes screaming \"I made the one I love cry tonight, and it felt good\". Despite the odour words and title, this is a rather bouncy, upbeat song. This is a talent of Kevin Barnes. Making sad and hopeless into upbeat and sunny. `Dour Percentage' has a seventy's funk to it with it's bouncy, walking bass line and Barnes never present falsetto. It's a song about friends that can't be friends anymore. A lot has been said about the personal nature of this record. To bridges the Of Montreal main man has burnt, to problems in Barnes marriage. `Malefic Dowery' is a song about Kevin Barnes marriage and issues of infidelity. Despite the downer material, the keeps the track light with a floating melody and mellow percussion. The absolute highlight of this album is `Wintered Debts', with it's almost country flair and honky stock piano, Barnes' sings lines like \"All the people kept saying there is one true belief system, but all my life I've been betrayed by my mother's religion\". It seems Barnes is dealing with life long issues, and the does so in a way we can relate to without having to look at your own lives. This can't be a proper Of Montreal album without Kevin Barnes alienating some fans, and making sure the ruins any chance of making new jones. He has touted that the was very much influenced by post-modern composers Philip Glass and Krzysztof Penderecki. And it shows on tracks like `We Will Commit the Wolf' and especially the last two tracks. Here's where jones patience will be tested. \"Authentic Pyrrhic Remission\" is a dizzying cacophony of noise that lasts for an astounding thirteen minutes. Any fan of Wilco would call this the `Less Than You Think' track. But unlike that droning fifteen minute track, Of Montreal reward those who stick with it. The track ends with a beautiful piano and Barnes singing \"Til this afternoon I was a nomad\/No country would call me its son\/I'd be a refugee but I have no substance\". Was it worth the wait? Yes. So there's the thing: if you haven't been on board with Of Montreal for the last couple years, you probably still won't be. If Skeletal Lamping sent you packing in search of a new freak to follow, then Paralytic Stalks will pretty much do the same. But if there's still that adventurous side of you that still yearns to be fed a different fruit, then give this album a shot. Sometimes great part in't necessarily comfortable. Sometimes it needs to make you cringe and squirm in your seat before it makes you a fan. Paralytic Stalks at times will make you cringe, and squirm in your seat. But if you give it a chance it will make you a fan, and maybe even move you.","overall":4,"summary":"The Drama Queen and the Psychotic Orchestra","unixReviewTime":1330128000,"reviewTime":"02 25, 2012"}

If Skeletal Lamping sends you on a quest to find a new freak to follow, Paralytic Stalks will do pretty much the same thing. But if there is still that adventurous side of you that still longs to be fed another fruit, then give this album a try. Sometimes a large part is not necessarily comfortable. Sometimes it has to make you wince and squirm in your seat before it makes you a fan. Paralytic stems sometimes make you wince and squirm in your seat.

But let's first take a step back. Accidently discovered this duo in July two thousand and twelve via the wonderful seven\" vinyl single 'Hurricane' \/ 'Bones (Demo)' plus then a few months after the white seven\" vinyl release Candy Bar Creep Show EP. Album opener 'Hurricane' is totally brilliant wonderful & love especially Lizzy's voice & the drums \"welcome to the dinner workings of my mind so dark and foul I can't disguise\". beautiful, a great production & lyrics. 'Bones' is just as good, really epic & another great vocal by Lizzy \"empty churches with soul's curses\". with such a confidence in her delivery as she explains the pains of life. 'Ash Tree Lane' more brilliance with some brass beautifully lifting this up \"the dream I take to awake when my mind's a mess\" \"creatures seem to scream & fade\". 'Fantasy' is also brilliance via this time an up-tempo urgent aggressive big melodic sound \"a mass of damaged time\" \"help me feel what I want to see\". 'Dark Doo Wop' more wonderful original sounds \"baby you should stick around\" slow & mesmerising as it builds & burns \"this world is going to burn. burn burn burn\" dramatic huge sounds. At this point you have the best \/ strongest opening five tracks on any album I've heard for a long time. sixth 'Head Is Not My Home' is almost a country jig - catchy & dramatic. 'Salty Sweet' & more original sounds \"we fear rejection\". 'Think Of You' \"I still think of you & all the is*** you put me through\" is really excellent. 'Twenty Seven' freaking hell more brilliance with piano prominent \"don't need the promise of heaven just faith I'll pass twenty seven\" & is imagery about how rock stars of importance seem to pass away at twenty-seven years. 'BTSK' leaves you flabbergasted with its excellence \"It did't come easy I'm glad it was hard Worth the wait To give you my heart\" with some great synth sounds. This could well be the very best track there. 'BTSK' means Big Teeth Small Kiss :o) 'No Trace' another Spectorish production with the kitchen sink thrown in. 'This Isn't Control' some interesting vocals but probably the weakest on the album.

But let's take a step back first. Coincidentally, this duo discovered two thousand and twelve over the wonderful 7 \"vinyl single 'Hurricane' \/ 'Bones (Demo)' in July plus then a few months after the white 7\" vinyl release Candy Bar Creep Show EP. The album opener 'Hurricane' is absolutely brilliant, wonderful & especially love Lizzy's voice & the drums \"Welcome to the dinner work of my mind, so dark and lazy I can't hide it\". beautiful, great production and lyrics. 'Bones' is just as good, really epic & another great chant by Lizzy, \"empty churches with soul curses\". with such confidence in her delivery as she explains the pains of life. 'Ash Tree Lane' more brilliance with some brass that beautifully undoes this \"dream I take to wake up when my mind is a mess\", \"creatures seem to scream and fade\". 'Fantasy' is also brilliance this time with a fast, urgent, aggressive, big melodic sound \"a mass of damaged time\" \"help me feel what I want to see\". 'Dark Doo Wop' more wonderful original sounds \"Baby you should stay here\" slow and mesmerizing as it builds and burns \"this world will burn. Burn burn burn\" dramatic huge sounds. At this point you have the best \/ strongest opening tracks on every album I've heard in a long time. 6. 'Head Is Not My Home' is almost a country jig - catchy & dramatic. 'Salty Sweet' & more original \"we fear rejection\" sounds. 'Think Of You' \"I still think about you and all the shit you did to me\" is really excellent. 'Twenty Seven' damn more brilliance with piano celebrities \"don't need heaven's promise, just think I'll be twenty-seven\" and is a picture of how important rock stars seem to die at twenty-seven. 'BTSK' leaves one baffled by its excellence \"It didn't just come out I'm glad it was hard Worth the wait to give you my heart\" with some great synth sounds. This could be the very best route there. 'BTSK' means Big Teeth Small Kiss: o) 'No Trace' another Spectorish production with a thrown in kitchen sink. 'This Isn't Control' has some interesting vocals, but probably the weakest on the album. If there was one small criticism, it's that it sounds a little constructed (more well planned than natural), but really Ms. Mr.","overall":5,"summary":"Ms Mr have polarised the axis of popular music with sumptuous dark dream pop","unixReviewTime":1368576000,"reviewTime":"05 15, 2013"}

It has a retro disco rock sound to it. If you listen to David Bowie for the Cars for later Pink Floyd (late seventys\/eightys) you might love this. Also has a touch of some newer bands like MGMT, Modest Mouse, LCD Soundsystem, and Fun. I know these comparisons karen't fair. The soundscape is technically diverse, you can't really label this band anything other than itself. You can tell the strong nuances of the vocals reflect in each song. This album is so bold and daring it may change the sound of pop music forever. This album is so deep and full of meaning it may change some people's lives. Some will find it pretentious for too different from old arcade fire to like. Give it a good five listens before you truly judge. Also people in the realm of Obama, farmers markets, shopping vintage, buying vinyl, eating local, driving Prius, reading lots of intellectual literature books, conceptual fine part, coffee and cigarettes, anti mainstream, loving retro, college, wearing thick framed glasses\/tight pants, indie films and music, Wes Anderson, critical thinking, camping\/floating\/hiking, dressing up like Ryan Gosling, poetry, shopping rooms and pops shops, pacifism, live rock shows will love this Arcade Fire album.
