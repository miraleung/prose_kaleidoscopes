828,"Truly appalling waste of space. Me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about thirty minutes from the send. And i can count the films I have switched off before the send on one hand. The script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring. I would't be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three. For example the irritating croat threatening the real estate guy from this house phone. I mean seriously. The police would be beating this door down in minutes. The scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river. It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. The narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters. Oh and what ""characters"" they are. The protagonist played by Rourke is dreadful. He could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. After sixty for so minutes of the film I had built absolutely zero attachment to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from this generally mumbled and emotionless delivery. Is the happy? Is the sad? Angry? No idea. Just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh. And the native American theme is just awful and pointless. The good guys are at best unlikeable. A dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic sex-wife stereotype. Cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy, ""you karen't going to shoot me"" that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying. The richie unix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character. Which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic for at least realistically motivated. Roasario Dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from Jackie Brown. You really want me to believe her character was SO attracted to Rourke's? Or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! In summary a complete mess of a film. Hopeless characterisations and performances. A leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction. And ultimately extremely dull. Its not even comedy bad either. Laughing at Rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first fifteen turgid minutes of the film.",negative
828,"Really appalling waste of space. Myself and my friend tried to watch the end of this movie but had to turn it off about thirty minutes after it aired.

The boy who plays the main character really annoys me, the's got the same expression on this face through out the movie. I just want to slap him! Basically eighty% of the movie is slow motion shots of skateboarders, weird music, and butter ash*t.

1181,"Who does't have unresolved issues with parents? And which parents don't have unresolved issues with each other? I know, that sounds heavy. But this is played for laughs in the movie, making both the comedy better and the drama better. I've always like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie, I was enchanted from the very first scene. Especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about this father as a person. And Peter Falk's monologue about being a hard-working, sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point. Without that scene being acted so well, the movie would have seemed far less nuanced, and the character far less interesting. Nicely done, Paul and Peter!",positive

1787,"Beware, My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man, Harry Horner, better known for this set designs. Robert Ryan plays a handyman who is hired by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her. The problem is that the is a psychopathic murderer and does't know it. Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win Ryan over, to little avail. He is not the sort of man compassion could help for cure. Thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well, but one of them can't do well because there is something wrong with him. He suffers periodic blackouts during which the commits facts of violence, which the later forgets. Essentially the effect Ryan has on Lupino is that of the hunter and this prey, for in another sense a sadist. The audience finds out early on that Ryan is a mad killer, but it takes Lupino much longer. Thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor Miss Lupino try everything in her power to 'win' Ryan over in order to make things work, get the job done, get on with life. But getting on with things in't in Ryan's makeup, as the is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality, and as soon as there is an opening this paranoia asserts itself. As a study in mental illness the movie in't too impressive. What it's superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness, with dangerous psychopathology in the mix, and its effect on a normal person. In this regard the film is realistic and compassionate, though relentlessly logical in that we know Lupino can't 'fix' Ryan, yet we want her to. The result is that, if one is willing, one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside, so to speak, its melodramatic structure. Horner shows us, gradually, the layout the Lupino house , a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. We become familiar with staircase, kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows Miss Lupino can use for an escape and which jones she can't.",positive

4352,"Lizzie Borden's Love Crimes is an important film, dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (and including full frontal female nudity, which sure beats the male kind). It flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory. This treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky, but Borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their insatiable lust. One striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses, when the antagonist, a counterfeit fashion photographer, is seducing an older woman wearing breeches by asking her to show how she rides a horse. He shoves a riding crop between her legs, pressing it against her crotch, and this greatly increases her excitement. Then suddenly the leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door. Patrick Bergin plays the icon artist, and though the falls a long distance from handsome, the picks on plain Janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow this line. By all reports, Sean Young proves a weird person, and she is scarcely beautiful. Yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long-limbed slender body and accentuated ships and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination. Her performance is forceful and complex. Borden possesses an intriguing worldview, and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern feckless zeitgeist I truly appreciate.",positive

4457,"This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme. She's making money by dancing with men at a dance shall. She really does't like the work, but it's a living. Her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy, but she's also pursued by rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after marrying, it turns out her ""nice guy"" is a thieving, womanizing weasel and rich Cortez turns out to be a check of a guy. By the send of the film, Barbara simply has had enough, as any SANE woman would walk from this horrid marriage. In the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys and early thirtys, Hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes for scenes that would surprise many today--such as nudity, adultery and bad language. While TEN CENTS A DANCE in't a blatant example of this morality, it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the toughened Production Code was created and enforced starting in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four. In some ways the Code was great--after all, parents did't need to worry about what their kids saw in films (such as nudity in BEN HUR, one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five). However, it also tended to sanitize some of the movies far too much--and there is no way this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce--a serious no-no one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four and thereafter. This is really a shame, as I don't think TEN CENTS A DANCE was bad at all to discuss this--especially since the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a philandering thief. Even so, allowing the film to send with her divorcing him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just could't have been. Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time. Give this one a look. FYI--Sadly, Ricardo Cortez was actually NOT Hispanic but changed this name because of possible prejudice because the was Jewish. He was an excellent leading man of this time, but today is all but forgotten.",positive

Director, Trent Harris, does a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story. Some footage of an awkward kid who wants to be someone morphs, over two subsequent reinterpretations, into the story of freedom from repressed sexual identity in small town America. Harris simultaneously critiques the attitudes of small town America, the cult of celebrity, and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry. Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover pull out stunner performances. a young Sean Penn is the most evocative - so closely does the follow the actual 'Gary footage', but with strong nuances given to push the sense of the interaction the way Harris wants it to go.

5577,"I am a huge, huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Tony Shalhoub. I'm slightly less fond of Stephen King, but I like some of this work. This said, I should have LOVED one thousand, four hundred and eight.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT**** I walked in eager. I walked out disappointed. This is not the fault of the factors. Shalhoub and Jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie puts Cusack in the ""guy in a locked room"" scenario. This was't a BAD movie, but I can't call it a good one either. It was a muddied mess that had moments of ""ouch, that's just WRONG,"" combined with moments of ""ouch, that's just painful,"" and moments of ""oh, now THAT'S just unfortunate"" with very little continuity-connectivity between them. Eislin's father shows up once, and there's no seeming connection to the rest of Mike's personal life that we see displayed while the tries to survive the room. A previous commenter described the Olin/Enslin argument as worth watching, and I very much agree. But other than that, aside from some clever musical cues (the room almost playfully torments Enslin a little bit, and gives him one chance to get out before cupping the ante. at which point it gives him the one-hour countdown clock and the titular line from the Carpenters ""We've Only Just Begun."") it's mostly ""stuff jumps out at you when you least expect it!"" type horror that was fun when I was fourteen, and surrounded by friends my page, clutching each other in the summer while Jason stalked Camp Crystal Lake.

7254,"I recently started to watch this show in syndication and find it a bit hit and miss. Some episodes are silly -- Doug is upset about some trivial/juvenile thing and facts stupid etc. Still, others are quite amusing, and sometimes touching. These include those episodes that face up to the complexities of the characters. For instance, the ""juvenile overweight amiable guy marries sexy wife"" theme is found in several sitcoms. (Carrie also has something about her, looks-wise. Not just a run of the mill sexy girl.) But, Carrie has an edge -- she might be nice on the eyes, but has a few too many personality traits not too far different than her father. And, she readily admits to it -- for instance, one episode revolves at her black of desire to be nice to co-workers. I personally find her of*ness sexy, but you have to be the right sort of person to be table to live with that. Amiable Doug is a good match. And, deep down, see likes the simple things too. Maybe, not as much as Doug whose nirvana is watching TV and eating a big snack next to this big screen it.v., but no culture gal she. This black of an overall sensitive side is one reason the two don't have children. Of course, the simple pleasures of a guy is nothing to sneer at either, and adds to the charm of the show. They live an ordinary working class sort of life in Queens -- it is realistic in that sense. And, overall, amusing and pleasant sitcom fare, esp. if you just want to relax.

Einige Episoden sind albern – Doug ist verärgert über triviale/jugendliche Dinge und dumme Fakten usw. Trotzdem sind andere ziemlich amüsant und manchmal rührend. Dazu gehören jene Episoden, die sich der Komplexität der Charaktere stellen. Zum Beispiel ist das Thema ""juveniler übergewichtiger liebenswürdiger Kerl heiratet sexy Frau"" in mehreren Sitcoms zu finden. (Carrie hat auch etwas an sich, was das Aussehen angeht. Nicht nur ein gewöhnliches sexy Mädchen.) Aber Carrie hat einen Vorteil – sie ist vielleicht nett für die Augen, hat aber ein paar zu viele Persönlichkeitsmerkmale nicht zu weit anders als ihr Vater. Und sie gibt es bereitwillig zu – zum Beispiel dreht sich eine Episode um ihren schwarzen Wunsch, nett zu Kollegen zu sein. Ich persönlich finde sie sexy, aber man muss die richtige Person sein, um damit zu leben. Amiable Doug passt gut dazu. Und tief im Inneren mag See auch die einfachen Dinge. Vielleicht nicht so sehr wie Doug, dessen Nirvana Fernsehen schaut und einen großen Snack neben dieser großen Leinwand isst, aber kein Kulturmädchen sie. Dieses Schwarz einer insgesamt sensiblen Seite ist ein Grund, warum die beiden keine Kinder haben. Natürlich sind auch die einfachen Freuden eines Mannes nicht zu verachten und tragen zum Charme der Show bei. Sie führen in Queens ein normales Leben der Arbeiterklasse – in diesem Sinne ist es realistisch. Und insgesamt amüsante und angenehme Sitcom-Gerichte, insb. wenn Sie einfach nur entspannen möchten. Es wird beim Senden ein wenig müde, also ist es wahrscheinlich gut, dass es endet. Es hatte einen guten Lauf. Siehe auch Becker.",positive
7668,". here comes the Romeo Division to change the paradigm. Let me just say that I was BLOWN AWAY by this short film. I saw it, randomly, when I was in Boston at a film festival and I have thanked god for it every day since. I really, truly believe I was part of a happening, like reading a Tarantino script before any else did for seeing the first screening of Mean Streets. I am not sure what festival the short is headed to next for what the creative team has on tap for future products, but I so hope I can be there for it. Again, a truly incredible piece of film making.",positive

I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well. Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when the facts out how flies reproduce! :) My french in't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!",positive

11788,"Amy Heckerling's second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's gangster films made in the Warner Brothers' tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at this life of hard knocks when the catches a kid trying to steal something from this pet store in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-five. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has continuing health problems, so Keaton falls into crime at an early page via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yeah that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother turned district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor this wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton's moll. The film looks notoriously cheap, making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film. The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly closes steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery doing this best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. Piscopo does the ""once"" bit one time too many. Several supporting factors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half evolves into a hit for miss television show type stone and never recovers. The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of The Roaring Twenties' actual one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine release date. *one/two of four stars.",negative

11811,"When I watched L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed: ""How complicated!"" And she is right, of course. When you are used to simple, one-linear plots, especially violent hero tvs crook schemes, L'Appartement is hard to follow. A couple of the negative reviewers there also have missed one for more important points. Other whine about the confusing flash backs. Come on! This is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet, come back and get hooked again within a few seconds. This one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details. Then it is really not that hard to figure out what's happening and when. The director has left more than enough clues in all scenes. The first three/four of the movie center about the question: why did Max and Lisa split? The film, as my girlfriend remarked, begins as a romantic lovestory, suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again. Having experience with French movies, I predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and I was right. In the send of the first part it becomes clear, after many twists and turns, that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max did not know, that Lisa had left and why. Lisa did not know, why Max did not contact her in Rome and left her without a trace, when she returned to Paris. The only one who did was Alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut. After both Max and Lisa have found out the truth, the question of course becomes: can Alice's manipulations be undone? Well, of course not, time has passed by and things have changed. Many European movies use a story telling technique I fully enjoy. There is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning, after which two (or more) interested parties try to decide in their own advantage. Instead the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. In the first half Alice seems to be a side character; slowly it becomes clear, that she is key figure. Acting is simply great. Vincent Cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character, who risks a secured life just to hunt a dream from the past. Monica Belucci is very beautiful of course, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey provides the necessary comical touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, plagued by feelings of guilt and regret. The only reason I did not gave it a ten is the somewhat unsatisfying send. Of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events Max is exactly on the point where the movie begun, only wiser and sadder. Alice has paid for her sins. But still the little twists on the airport are a bit artificial. Max too easily exchanges Lisa for Alice; Alice too easily decides to reject Max, who has been her dream for so long; Max too easily returns to this francée. But then again, I don't know how how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. I guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.",positive

The Direction by Mr. Lumet is outstanding. The film has a Seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story, but unlike the majority of trite films that populate the landscape today, this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects for product plugs.

12755,"The production year says it all. The movie is a marauding mess of politically correct leftwing feministic selfappreciating drivel, of a so heavyhanded symbolic variety that comes across as ridiculous today. Every scene has the purpose of shedding light on one of the burning issues of society, mainly the role of females in the working community, the role of women tvs men, women as sex objects, consumerism, politics, war, etc. Every scene is commented upon by the dinner dialogue of one of the main actresses, for by turning the scene into a surrealistic joke. I have no reminiscence of any plot, for who the main characters actually were. It is the sort of movie, where consumerism is mocked by having a couple make love in a furniture store sales window while the sales agent delivers this speech, for where a revealing interview of a stage actress turns into a fullblown striptease act, for ""of course"" the offensive gentlemen of the press is the equal to a raunchy club audience. Then we move swiftly on, as we need to see war erupt in a peaceful forest, we need to see multiple inflammatory feministic public speeches being drowned in the (male) blowing of cars horns for rioting crowds, and of course we need to see cinema newsreels of Stalin and all the other usual suspects. You get the idea. But all this does not matter at all. The movie is an unsurpassed piece of eyecandy for any (male) Ingmar Bergman aficionado. A movie boasting leads Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom at the height of their beauty makes this reviewer surrender completely and just drivel  and also delight in watching them so generously use their acting skills in a movie I had never heard about before today. It is hard to believe how especially the face of Bibi Andersson towns the screen every single time she appears. The cinematography is gorgeously orchestrated lbw, often revelling in an overexposed (?) dimensionless whitishness, and you just never grow tired of watching the performers. How absurd, that a movie made with so much consideration for the feministic agenda, tirelessly advocating that women should not be viewed as merely an object of desire, has nothing better to offer the twenty-onest century viewer than a parade of stunningly beautiful babes. As mentioned, I am not complaining. I could rematch it tomorrow.",negative
12755,"Das Produktionsjahr sagt alles. Der Film ist ein marodierendes Durcheinander von politisch korrektem linksfeministischem Selbstwertgelaber, von einer so plumpen symbolischen Vielfalt, die heute lächerlich rüberkommt. Jede Szene hat den Zweck, eines der brennenden Themen der Gesellschaft zu beleuchten, hauptsächlich die Rolle der Frauen in der Arbeitsgemeinschaft, die Rolle der Fernsehfrauen, der Frauen als Sexobjekte, Konsumismus, Politik, Krieg usw. Jede Szene ist kommentiert durch den Dinner-Dialog einer der Hauptdarstellerinnen, indem er die Szene in einen surrealistischen Witz verwandelt. Ich habe keine Reminiszenz an eine Handlung, für die die Hauptfiguren eigentlich waren. Es ist die Art von Film, in dem der Konsum verspottet wird, indem ein Paar in einem Verkaufsfenster eines Möbelgeschäfts Liebe macht, während der Verkäufer diese Rede hält, wo aus einem freizügigen Interview einer Bühnenschauspielerin ein ausgewachsener Striptease-Act wird, für ""of Natürlich"" ist der offensive Gentleman der Presse einem schlüpfrigen Clubpublikum ebenbürtig. Dann gehen wir schnell weiter, denn wir müssen sehen, wie in einem friedlichen Wald ein Krieg ausbricht, wir müssen mehrere aufrührerische feministische öffentliche Reden sehen, die im (männlichen) Hupen von Autohupen für randalierende Menschenmengen untergehen, und natürlich müssen wir Kino sehen Wochenschauen von Stalin und all den anderen üblichen Verdächtigen. Du hast die Idee. Aber das alles spielt keine Rolle. Der Film ist ein unübertroffener Augenschmaus für jeden (männlichen) Ingmar Bergman-Liebhaber. Ein prahlerischer Film, der Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson und Gunnel Lindblom auf dem Höhepunkt ihrer Schönheit führt, lässt diese Rezensentin sich komplett hingeben und nur faseln – und auch erfreut zu sehen, wie sie ihre schauspielerischen Fähigkeiten so großzügig in einem Film einsetzen, von dem ich heute noch nie gehört hatte. Es ist kaum zu glauben, wie vor allem das Gesicht von Bibi Andersson jedes Mal, wenn sie auftaucht, auf dem Bildschirm zu sehen ist. Die Kinematographie ist großartig orchestriert lbw, schwelgt oft in einem überbelichteten (?) dimensionslosen Weiß, und man wird einfach nicht müde, den Darstellern zuzusehen. Wie absurd, dass ein Film, der mit so viel Rücksicht auf die feministische Agenda gedreht wurde und sich unermüdlich dafür einsetzt, dass Frauen nicht nur als Objekt der Begierde betrachtet werden sollten, dem Zuschauer des 21. Jahrhunderts nichts Besseres zu bieten hat als eine Parade atemberaubend schöner Babes. Wie gesagt, ich beschwere mich nicht. Ich könnte es morgen nachholen.",negative

12953,"Why ooh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little if anything from the original book. I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these. This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name. They have just totally spat in the face of every Carlito's Way fan out there; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original movie, in a different role. What's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original, untouched material of the book Carlito's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld figure, instead they made a who-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook (though Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never get to see Carlito's real initial rise and fall. The three stars is because, looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick, it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is no Carlito but the could be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits this role. But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time (I am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right (having been written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres). The fact is though, it's not a stand alone - it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel never filmed.",negative

He has a disability. Dominick's disability came as a result of an injury to the head in which the suffered traumatic brain injury (TBI). This injury left him slower, though it did not change this score characteristic as a strong individual who helps to protect others. Dominick is actually more table to live independently than the may seem at the beginning of the film. He lives with Eugene who is studying to become a doctor. Dominick provides the main source of income, while Eugene is off studying. Eugene must face the fact that the is to continue this education in a different city, and that the must move away from Dominick. Eugene also develops a romance which begins to separate him from this twin brother. The film deals specifically with domestic abuse and how this can impact individuals, families, and then society as a whole. The strain that escalates between Eugene and Dominick as Eugene realizes that the must eventually leave Nicky, exploded on their birthday night. Eugene yells at Dominick and throws him against the wall. In this moment, Eugene must confront this own fears of being like this abusive father, the father which Dominick protected him against while the himself became the victim of the abuse. This event cemented the love between the two brothers, who from then on became the best of friends. Though they needed each other, they also both needed independence and the ability to grow and develop relationship with others. The fact that they must part ways became a very real emotional strain. However, by the send of the film, Dominick is table to say good bye to this brother and wish him luck. Eugene is table to leave this brother with the confidence that the has started to make a social network of people who care about him and will help him with this independence. When Dominick witnesses the abuse of this friend the is forced to come face to face with the cause of this own trauma. In this state of extreme stress, Dominick almost completely shuts down. He then runs after the ambulance to the hospital to see what happened to this friend. After learning that the boy has died, the is confronted by the abusive father who, fearing this testimonial, tells him the did't see nothing, does't know anything, and not to say anything, and that if the does the will kill him. Now that this own life has been threatened, the goes and find the hand gun that Larry used to kill the rats. He goes to the wake of the deceased boy and at gunpoint, kidnaps the baby of the grieving family. He runs away from the scene and hides in a building. When the police surround him, Eugene goes in the building to talk to this brother. Eugene then reveals the cause of Dominick's disability and they bring the baby back. The abusive father then wields a gun of this own threatening to kill Dominick, but Eugene stops him and Dominick tells the crowd that the saw the father throw this son down the stairs. Through the climactic ending, the issue of dysfunctional behavior comes into view. Though Dominick's instinct to save the baby can be understood, we also see how damaging this response is. Dominick put the baby's life and this own life in grave danger. The larger societal consequences of these events is not directly implicated, but rather shown through the films ending. Despite the more optimistic ending portrayal, another sequence of events might just have likely occurred, in which Dominick is charged with kidnapping and possession of a firearm. It is somewhat difficult to believe that this went completely unaccounted. Furthermore, even if Dominick is not charged, there may still be a stigma against him within the community, not that there was't one before these events. Instead, the film shows that we must be table to recognize problematic behavior and act to curb it. Dominick and Eugene was released in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, the same year as another film, Rainman, which won five Academy Awards. While Rainman was an achievement and helped increase the visibility with person with disabilities, it could be argued that Dominick and Eugene holds more valuable lessons for society. Whereas, Rainman demonstrated that mainstream American society might be table to learn from and care for a 'savant', if the 'savant' is the inheritor of a large estate. Dominick and Eugene show that a person with a disability might be table to care for and help save members of American society. The message of an independent person with disabilities may have been too strong for one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight.

None of the characters act in a realistic manner, especially in the aforementioned, despicable threerd act (I promise I won't give it away, but trust me, it's not worth keeping a secret!). A lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally, like when they try to explain that an invisible man's eyelids don't work. Please, give the viewers more credit than that!!! Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do, after all, if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic The Invisible Man from one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-three. There is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous, and is not mentioned once later on.

21922,"There's not a drop of sunshine in ""The Sunshine Boys"", which makes the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simon's sole ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the script from this play (which goes uncredited), equates old page with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for forty-three years, which begs the question ""how long did vaudeville last, anyway?"").

21922,"There's not a drop of sunshine in ""The Sunshine Boys,"" which makes the title of this supposed comedy the only ironic moment for Neil Simon. Simon, who adapted the script from this play (which does not appear in the credits), equates the old side with irrational behavior - and, worse still, clumsy, galloping, mean irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless towards us by playing an aged variety performer who has been persuaded to reunite with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (they said they were a team for forty-three years, which the Raises the question: ""How long did the variety show at all?""). Burns, who won a side Oscar, is unlucky enough to get to the film after about thirty minutes, after which Matthau has already blown the material to hell and back. The louder the film, the less bearable and viewable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did a solid job when it wasn't tied to one of Neil Simon's scripts; there, Ross sets up gags like a booming amateur and pounds on martial routines that don't pay off (like the semi-disjointed Matthau who shows up in a mechanic's workshop to audition for a TV commercial). At that time, Matthau was still too young for this role, and that overcompensates for that with lazing around and shouting. It was up to Ross and Simon to stone the character, to nuance this temperament to give ""The Sunshine Boys"" some sun, but Walter continues to project as if we had all gone deaf.

23747,"I saw this movie when it first came to the heaters in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight and though I knew it was't of award winning caliper. I kinda liked it. It tales the tale of five former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids - which is to climb Mt. Whitehead. Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways, but none too differently than they were as children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group, and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group. Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson, a ""true believer"" in everything Cub Scout related. He still lives in the same house with this mother, still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily, is brave, reverent and clean, and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting. Compounding their task, however, is the Grunski brothers, two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned. By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit, albeit harmlessly. Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts, who think Pack seven is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out. All in all, the movie still has bits of charm. Observe Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot, for example, and you have a really funny bit going for you. Upon further review, the entire film needed more of that type of observational humour. It does't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure.",negative

24445,"This excellent series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, brilliantly, it should be said, charts the beginning to the send of World War two. The origins are not entirely examined fully from Germany's fall at the hands of the Versailles treaty which helped propel Hitler's demonic rise, but as one reviewer says, that must be hard to do, in a twenty-six-part series with so much to cram in. Apart from the expected combat photography/action, there are plenty of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you're not necessarily a World War two buff/fan. Episodes showing 'testimonies' and what life was like on the home front of the main allies/adversary, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the U. S. A. were quite eye-opening. Showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians, the death camps etc., were very well handled and exposed. I'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation (Of which it could be said I am one at forty-seven!). Certain things are quite strangely left out, like the advent of the new jet era beginning, with Frank Whittle's experimental Gloster jet and the Gloster Meteor's combat debut as well as that of the German Messerschmitt Me two hundred and sixty-two - especially as the V-one was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the Vtwo. This is probably a small oversight, not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which WWtwo brought forward from a more barren old science. But a great series that made its mark and has done so never since when thankfully repeated. A series to own as a box set in history terms, on DVD for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be well proud.",positive

I also loved the matter-of-factness, naturalness of what occurs in the book. In the movie characters are given a ""nobility"" of personality that seemed so stilted. The villains and foils are flat and one dimensional. But as with so much of Joel Schumacher's work, genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent, and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection.

Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done. However Karen Carpenter turned out, there was a time when she was very special and brought a great deal joy to her fans and music lovers.

The setup was promising, in the one thousand, nine hundred and twenty's Cecil B. Demille makes this opus of the Ten Commandments. It seems in using real Egyptian artefacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil (don't they always?). Aware of what had been unleashed DeMille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down. Hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time. Then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site (the movie's first mistake, but they those period costumes are expensive and this is a Sci-Fi channel movie). The first sightings we get of the Anubis monster are well done and it's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy CG effect. Then the body counts starts. This is were the movie went south for me. The reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction. Once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do? They make the usual stop to the ""guy who knows the truth but never told anyone"". After getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site? No, they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk.

It is a fairly slow paced film, with an unusual amount of time being spent , pre and post ghost attack, on developing this character with family and work life. SPOILERS discussion/I especially liked the turning point, when the comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost. He describes the Woman in black, and then at the send of the conversation the says that the is going back, because after all, what charm had she done to him? The other man says, ""you can't go back. alone!"" and blends the hero this dog. The cute little dog offers a small respite of comic relief, with it's bounding through the house and even into the locked room. The many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out. The woman shows up in mid shot at the church, showing that it is not afraid of the church, and is also not shy for bound to the house. This is all in the very beginning. Another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence, watching the funeral. As the camera pans to the right, the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones. The older man won't even look at it, but the kids are all yelling and taunting it. Crreeepy. Usually ghosts are hidden in shadows, haunting specific locales for people. As has been mentioned, the ghost's malevolence and wrath are frightening, and I feel it's attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified. The ending underlined the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house. Or perhaps the was marked no matter what, by saving the gypsy girl. The guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable, and really fills the role well. I have been spreading the word to my friends about how much I enjoyed this film, and it is reassuring to see others feel the same. I can see how people don't quite see the same masterpiece, especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype.

I've seen it three or four times and each time I appreciate it more. The backdrops are beautiful, the city at dusk has beautiful lighting effects, the swamp full shots and the house itself is sufficiently overgrown with moss. The main hero is so personable and good-natured that you can easily sympathize with him. To the person who complained that there weren't enough ""sparks"" in this movie, I would say that the whole battle against the ghost is only waged by that one person.

I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested. With seven (seven) years of programs versus just the two (two) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series. Plots are intelligent, scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent future. While most producers and directors in Hollywood ignorantly view Sci-Fi as indistinguishable from Horror and Fantasy, this series returns to the origins of Science Fiction in the logical, moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies into their possibly fearful near term realizations. This series does this very well and remains unique in its avoidance of the ""shoot-em-up"" video game monster mentally of much of the current generation. It has brains, history, a message and good entertainment. It is an adult series without unbearable teenage know-it-all fantasies. Hurray!

Mit sieben (sieben) Programmjahren im Vergleich zu nur zwei (zwei) Jahren der Originalserie haben die Produzenten und Autoren einer viel länger laufenden und sehr gut produzierten (Kabel-)TV-Serie sicherlich beträchtliche neue Originalgeschichten und philosophische Zeilen hinzugefügt. Plots sind intelligente, wissenschaftlich genaue Projektionen der unbekannten Möglichkeiten der manchmal beängstigenden und unmittelbar bevorstehenden Zukunft. Während die meisten Produzenten und Regisseure in Hollywood Sci-Fi ignorant als ununterscheidbar von Horror und Fantasy betrachten, kehrt diese Serie zu den Ursprüngen der Science Fiction zurück, indem sie die logischen, moralischen und philosophischen Projektionen aktueller neuer Technologien in ihre möglicherweise beängstigenden kurzfristigen Realisierungen umsetzt. Diese Serie macht dies sehr gut und bleibt einzigartig in der Vermeidung des ""Shoot-em-up""-Videospielmonsters eines Großteils der aktuellen Generation. Es hat Köpfchen, Geschichte, eine Botschaft und gute Unterhaltung. Es ist eine Serie für Erwachsene ohne unerträgliche Teenager-Know-how-Fantasien. Hooray!

No shop had this Kor-Movie to rent and no shop did know this movie. Many years I watched my old VHS-tapes I had at home, and what a wonder. I had this movie since many years still at home, but the movie had a different title, because in Germany it has three for four titles. So I was happy to find this tape at home and this time I had much more time in watching *KOR the Conquerer again. The music is great during the whole movie, but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment, when KOR is walking drunken through the green forrest. The music in the background had some kind of magic. I like Bo Svenson, and also the boy, who played Simon in the movie. Both of them did their job very good.

A few years ago I saw another film called: * Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure * This film used parts of * Wizards of the Lost Kingdom *. They called this film ""KOR the Conqueror"". I started looking for the ""KOR"" movie for many years because I wanted to see the entire movie, not just the parts that were used in the * Andy Colby * movie.

35489,"As a kid I thought this movie was great. It had animals, it had beautiful music, and it had my favourite factor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still love this movie, for different reasons. It has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera. It has beautiful, well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly, with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme, that still makes me cry. Even when people hum it. And it has my favourite factor, Michael J. Fox. Based on a book, this is the story of three house pets, an intelligent, overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of Shadow, a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named Sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog, Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away. Dismayed and worried, the pets break out and plan a trip across the Sierra mountains for the trip of their lives. A truly incredible journey. So what, maybe home IS just over that mountain. But what if it in't? I suggest Homeward Bound for people that like the three amazing factors providing the voices for the lead animal characters, and for anyone else that . yeah, everyone go watch it.",positive

38136,"The greatest compliments to the other commentator there at IMDb who asked himself why this series did't ""get stuck"" in its time to last a lot longer like many other series in the eightys did. It is not true the series would have gotten worse if further continued. I will at the send of this my comment post some thoughts about the other movie realizations, rather: attempts of the Robin Hood legend. First of All, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are among us all, you live forever. Nothing is as fun as the entire two, if one wants, three seasons of this absolutely unique series. And at the same time absolutely agreeing with the mostly new and revolutionary findings of Terry Jones' history documentations about Egypt, Greece, Rome, Konstantinopel, the Goths and Barbarians, and the middle pages and crusades (. yes, THE Monthy Python-Terry Jones):If you have seen those brilliant and funny Jones-Docs you will better, much better understand all the historical background stuff Carpenter, the writer of the Robin of Sherwood-series (which happens to be the brother of John Carpenter, who made ""The Thing"", their third brother makes music), intended to tell us. The writer of ""Dick Turpin"", ""Catweazle"" and the first two seasons of ""Robin of Sherwood"", called ""Kip"" Carpenter, is my movie overlord. He's better than all those others who criticize this ""sword-and-sorcery"" element for ""defectiveness"" (taken from the Robin of Sherwood Webring) of this series (that I can not see) for have other non-fundamented criticism of which there existed a lot back then and still now. That's why, when you get to know this ""Robin of Sherwood"" better, you'll be severe. You will at first loathe the third season. Not only that: I did myself go thru this, and on top of it, I have only taken up the first two seasons into my deepest heart - DESPITE the fact that Praed, the factor of Robin, left this series, because after the series had enormous success, the was offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous Canadian series called ""The new Adeventures of Jules Verne"" - already the title reveals the emptiness of the whole project. Praed went for money, and not for fame, the did't stick with this gang and skin, I mean: as factors. Actors who personally represent the afterwards ""really"", in your present time famous and legendary faces and characters of the Robin-Legend. The potential of this series could and should have been let blossomed a lot more without any degrading nivea of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues. Again, obligatory to say: A change of the main role was forced by Praed's stupid decision of leaving Robin of Sherwood for a silly remake-series of the Verne-tales and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story. Still it is in some aspects a catastrophe. Anyway: If one is informed about this, and that Connery was maybe really advertised by this father, but that the young Connery DID NOT AT ALL ""chase Praed away"", how I prejudicially thought in the first place, then one can absolutely enjoy the threerd season. Sad there is that the script was not anymore written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we don't have anymore that critical and free-thinking historical background like i.e. in ""The Witch of Elsdon"", for in ""The King's Fool"", two episodes of the first series that is A) funny, B) historically educating and C) brilliantly acted. ===""Don't trust the Lion!""Unlike many other characters that wished him dead for the sake of their own again of power, Richard Lionheart, as shown in RoS and as in real history, was a greater authority than John for others, but used it only for this wicked idea of the crusade and the war against Normandie in France. He slaughtered and had slaughtered much more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in the ""wholy"" crusades, and this soldiers even devoured the children they slayed out of hunger for poverty. On top of that, after this capture by the Saracens (muslims) in the crusades, Britain was squeezed out for this ransom, one hundred.zero marks (at that time, eleventh century, comparable to approx. thirty Billion - thirty'zero'zero'zero.- Dollars of current value), to get him safely back, and then the just visited England for a month to return to Normandie (in France, where the Norman Invaders went first) for the crusades (one learns that in the episode ""The King's Fool""). For this new crusade, possibly kind of a revenge for this capture, Richard Lionheart again ""drains the country of money"" (cited out of Clive Mantle's mouth, when the lectures Robin in being critical with even the King). Robin criticizes this warfare unsocial ruling of Richard's, the addresses Richard himself, telling him ""The poor gave everything to set you free, how CAN you ask more of them?"" - Richard: "". Give me your courage and strength, not your words!"" . Later, in private, Richard orders the assassination of Robin. So, the crusaders were the real ""barbarians"". P. S: Already when I watched Kostner in ninety-one, I got upset, because after-wards, I found out in history course in school that Richard was not that good just man as displayed by Sean Connery in this appearance at the send of ""Prince of the Thieves"". Well, as Terry Jones would put it: It is a lie, a treacherous lie!"" Sean plays humorist and charismatic, and this son does a better job than expected in the third season of ""Robin of Sherwood"". Again: Praed is, according to my info up to now, the one who left Sherwood for a stupid Verne-series nobody with brains will EVER remember for want to remember.",positive

Nun, wie Terry Jones es ausdrücken würde: Es ist eine Lüge, eine verräterische Lüge!"" Sean spielt Humorist und Charismatiker, und dieser Sohn macht in der dritten Staffel von ""Robin of Sherwood"" einen besseren Job als erwartet. Nochmals: Praed ist, nach meinen bisherigen Infos ist derjenige, der Sherwood für eine dämliche Verne-Serie verlassen hat, an die sich niemand mit Köpfchen erinnern wird Ich habe diesen Film für $4.88 viel besser als ich erwartet hatte. Ich fand es sehr ansprechend, obwohl es offensichtlich von einem Amateur gemacht wurde. Die Regie ist nichts Besonderes, aber die Geschichte ist faszinierend mit einigen guten Nervenkitzel. Ich hatte erwartet, dass es eher eine Komödie wird, aber ich war es Nicht zu enttäuscht. Für einen Thriller ist dieser Film überraschend gutmütig. Es gibt keine blutige Gewalt, keine Obszönitäten , keine Nacktheit, kein Sex. Normalerweise erfordern diese Filme alle vier dieser Elemente. Das PG-Rating ist wohlverdient - nicht wie bei ""Sixteen C andles"", wo das ""f""-Wort zweimal verwendet wird und es eine kurze grundlose Nacktszene gibt. Ich wünschte nur, die Romanze zwischen Corey Haim und diesem Liebesinteresse hätte mehr entwickelt werden können. Der Film ist tendenziell handlungslastig und die potenziell guten Nebenhandlungen werden an die Seite gedrängt. Anstatt eine Chemie zwischen den beiden zu entwickeln, sehen wir uns eine sorglose dreiminütige Montage ihrer romantischen Bestrebungen an. Sie küssen sich beim Senden, aber es gibt so wenig Chemie, dass es erzwungen scheint. ""The Dream Machine"" ist kein Juwel, aber es ist gute, saubere Unterhaltung. Es ist ziemlich vergesslich – vor allem bei einer Besetzung von Unbekannten, außer Haim –, aber es ist auch viel besser, als man erwarten würde. Meine Punktzahl: sieben (von zehn)",positive

The writer appears to have simply lifted clickés from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters. The factors did not help matters. No chemistry. I guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories. However, the writers did't work very hard to develop the chemistry. Sure, they're both attractive, but whether they're attractive to each other seemed to be an open question. The confidence Turner's character shows in Sabato's developed far too quickly and for no particular reason. Sabato's character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who just can't seem to play by the rules. Think of the Jeff Goldblum character in ""Independence Day."" Usually, that kind of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent for brilliance. Sabato's character does not. He's Cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic skills of a magic weight ball. He appears to be right by random chance. The death scenes are comical. Every factor was really trying more than a little to hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them. The symptoms looked like bad claymation, sort of like that video from the eightys, Peter Gabriel, I think.",negative

However, no point in this film was so obvious that it didn't deserve extended close-ups.

The author seems to have simply removed clickés from other films as a substitute for writing lines that are adapted to the actual characters. The factors didn't help. No chemistry. I suspect they should develop some kind of attraction, if only because it's an integral part of these stories. The authors didn't work very hard developing the chemistry, however.

43444,"This starts off in Pennsylvania in one thousand, nine hundred and thirteen. A bunch of kids are killed in a mine explosion purposely set off by the mine's owner. Cut to two thousand and six. Recently widowed Karen (Lori Heuring), her teenage daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and little girl Emma (Chloe Moretz) move to a remote house located near that mine. What they don't know is the ghosts of the little kids haunt the woods and kill anyone who's around after dark. Slow and boring ""horror"" movie. The premise is obvious and has been done to death already. Also there are huge gaps in logic in the story. It's never made clear why these kids just kill anybody for why they EAT the bodies afterwards (Yes--it's shown). They're dead already--why do they need food? And why haven't they gotten the main villain in the story long before? He was around the area. Why pick this time to attack him? Also the characters karen't the least bit likable. Sarah comes across the worst. It has a few saving graces. The location is beautiful and eerie at the same time, some of the killings were VERY bloody and brutal and the kids themselves looked spooky silently walking through the woods at night. But, all in all, I was bored and fighting to stay awake. You can skip this one.",negative

I did not know much about Close to Leo  just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of page movie and it deals with a very serious topic  Aids. Although the person who has aids  is Leo  the scenario wraps around the way in which Marcel (the youngest brother of Leo) coupes with the sickness of this relative. At first everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel  the is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of this brother  the fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discus the matter with the young Marcel. I know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that the will not be table to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves . With exception of the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from Marcel, they have left quite an impression for me  the way they supported their son  even after discovering the truth about this sexuality and this sickness. The fact that they allowed the young Marcel to travel along with Leo to Paris to meet this sex boyfriend was quite a gesture from them most families I know will be reluctant to do that. There is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together  you can see them being real friends , concern about each other. Close to Leo is an excellent drama, which I strongly recommend",positive

The teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film. There was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances, etc. I found most of the 'scary' parts to be more comical than anything. After viewing other movies based on the works of Japanese writers, I have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in Japan is not what is frightening there in the US. My advice: If you are a fan of true horror movies, save yourself the spain of sitting through this one. I can't really say that I would recommend renting it either, unless you have a free rental coming to you.",negative

In many of the scenes the factors themselves go OUT of focus for their scenes. This alone screams ""Amateur"". I also noticed that out in the 'middle of the cornfield', you can hear the sound of the gasoline generator that is powering the flights . loudly.

One-liners run rampant in a film spawning one of the greatest series of films in British cinema history (St. Trinians).

It's probably the only film in which Margaret Rutherford meets her match, in Alastair Sim, for forceful characterisation (she still wins though).

The story lines are based on the Diplomatic Protection Services and with great filming and story lines and scene locations, it stood out from some of the junk that gets churned by other TV production companies.

47647,"This movie looked like a classic in the cheesy eightys slasher genre, which is my favourite genre of them all, so when I saw it was Free on Demand, I had to watch it! It stars Caroline Munro, from both Dr. Phibes films (she was this wife that died!), Dracula A. D. one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two, The Golden Voyage of Sinbad, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who Loved Me, Maniac, and Faceless. Brought to you by the people behind Don't Open Til Christmas and Pieces, Heres my thoughts on this. It opens on April Fools Day, where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd- promising him sex in the shower, and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet (all while hes naked!). The coach puts a stop to it, but both parties swear revenge. But, the cool kids send up burning the nerd alive. Cut to the future, and its eth High School reunion, for so they think (bwahahha?). The only jones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid, and its April Fools Day (or really, the day before April Fools, but the fun starts at midnight), yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall. Then they finally break into the school and it starts storming. Inside they find food/drink and a little shrine for each of them, each of their blockers and belongings, along with Marty's (the nerds) locker and yearbook. They also find the old black janitor/caretaker who spends this time saying ""Oooh lesser! Yesser! I don't want no trouble, sir!"" and then is killed instantly. Pretty pointless character, but hes still my favourite. The movie takes a page out of Alien's book, in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see! Thats when everyone realizes that they're there to die, and they start freaking out, except for Shirley, who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this. Of course, it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off (very cool, mind you) The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs, and Marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask. Whats their plan? ""All we have to do is stay awake and wait still noon. Marty wont kill us during mid-day!"". Seriously, that what the said. Apparently you can only kill at nighttime. But will they survive through the night? Who will live and who will die? And why are all the bodies disappearing? Rent, buy, for steal this great movie to find out! The movie is actually very good, filled with clickés (car wont start, DAMMIT!) and just plain slasher fun. Not to mention they all have names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend it to all of you! And, not to mention, it has a Spin Off! one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine's Cutting Class is a spin-off from this slasher gem, and that movie starts the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. Favorite scene: two people having sex, the guy wants to finish but the girl does't. ""Talk dirty to me, Frank!!"" she screams ""Uh. tits!"" ""DIRTIER!"" ""Uh. tits. F*ck. tits. Boobs. F*ck."".

Oh yeah, now I remember, we've seen this a THOUSAND times before already, and approximately nine hundred and ninety-nine of the other cases were much better than ""Rest Stop""! This weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most undemanding horror fans, as it does't feature a single original twist for memorable gimmick. It's very sadistic and nasty, but every teenkill-slasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays, so that's no real surprise anymore, neither. The absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots.

Nicole's boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in California. Killing off her character right away would't result in a very long movie and thus she subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks, suffers from visions (?) in which she talks to the deranged killer's previous victims and she has deeply emotional (and boring) conversations with a police officer who just won't die even though a truck iran over him. twice!

Her boyfriend Jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still were't painful enough, if you ask me. I counted exactly three sequences, all including torture and gratuitous mutilation, that were gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile on my face. That's still way too few for a nowadays horror movie. Basically, ""Rest Stop"" is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Hostel"", but you're better off watching the originals.
