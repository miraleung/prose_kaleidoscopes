1705,"Yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you'll thank me for it. This is the worst film I've seen in quite some time. I came to this board expecting to see the same response I had, but inexplicably, there are several people who love this film and Spacey's performance in particular. Some will chastise me for saying it, but I find Kevin Spacey's acting quite limited despite the world's admiration for him. I felt like I was watching a meaner version of Kevin's ""American Beauty"" role. His character in this film is ridiculously overacted, all the way down to this laughable insults the throws at this assistant. There are all-world trite and boring scenes like when Spacey is tearing into Whaley about bringing him Equal instead of Sweat and Low. Somehow, I suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny, but by this time I was ready to hit the stop button (this is approximately twenty minutes into the film). What about the faux-homage to ""Resevoir Dogs""? Whaley proclaims, ""I think I saw this in a movie once,"" as if the's going to cut off Spacey's year. But what does the use to cut him? An envelope! That's right, the's going to give him paper cuts! That has to be one of Hollywood's all-time worst scenes, and the fact that the factors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appalling. I will admit that I did't see the send of this film (my DVD mercifully locked up about a half hour before the send), but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that I missed a great twist and everything would have made sense. Well, I don't care what happened in the send, because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over-the-top dialogue. I even got the feeling that the factors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as I did.",negative

2007,"waste of onehforty-five this nasty little film is one to avoid, its like a cheap badly plotted across between saw and a few other recent films about kidnap, why the writer wrote this is obvious. he has no soul and did it to try and me some money. The twists were obvious, when those in peril could escape they did the obvious and did't etc. only good thing about it is I've discovered one new actress worth watching. peyton list, don't watch shuttle though, there are too many better nicer films to watch rather than this that will make you miserable and think less of the world. Spend your time more wisely watch good films, do some exercise, cook a nice meal. anything but waste your time on rubbish like this",negative

2623,"Hi, Everyone, Oh, Boy. This one is a lulu. It has really bad background music whenever they can squeeze it in. There are three bad guys who, I guess, are the stars of this. They beat people up and chop people up and crash trucks and bulldozers into people. Usual stuff. The woman who is sending them on their emissions is unable to move her mouth when she speaks. It's sort of like watching a bad ventriloquist who is her own dummy. She walks like she is balancing an egg on her head. The wardrobe is seventys leisure style for the men and blah for the female lead who is supposed to be a good nurse. The bad novocain mouth woman wears red. A silk frock perhaps, for maybe just a poplin windbreaker that is too big. I actually liked the ending even though it did not make a lot of sense. It lets us in on what happened earlier in the film. The police officers are OK. Some bad, some good, all stupid except two. The two bright jones could have worked again in Hollywood. The movie starts interestingly enough and ends with a surprise. The middle sucks. The guy in the diner who gives a free hamburger to the star does a good job. He is like a one thousand, nine hundred and fortys character factor. Great voice. This one is a bit too long. The lady with marbles in her mouth could have had just a couple of lines and the rest could have been said by a parrot. It would have been easier to understand a bird. Her scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained woodpecker. Tom Willett",negative

2931,"It's easy to see how this below-average screenplay got by in the early sales-pitch meetings at Regency Films (and later with Fox): across the superhero genre with a comedic take on ""Fatal Attraction"". voilà! I don't know how on earth a talented director like Ivan Reitman got involved, unless the pay was just too tempting. A dateless employee at an architectural design firm in N. Y. C. meets a girl on the subway and tasks her out; despite the fact she's distracted and unpleasant, the eventually gets her into bed--only to find out later she's the Big Apple's president superhero, G-Girl. This distaff Superman, with powers bestowed upon her by a fallen meteorite, in't a fantasy heroine, however. screenwriter Don Payne has conceived her as a needy, possessive, vindictive bitch (he telegraphs this to us from miles away, though Uma Thurman still plays the role for sassy laughs). This is the kind of worthless movie that can't let an insult slip by. Our introduction to leading man Luke Wilson, talking with Rainn Wilson on the train, is accompanied by a sour dig at gays (it prods at us to be assured these two buddies are strictly ladies' men). After being approached by G-Girl's nemesis, who wants to zap her powers, Wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman scorned. and in't that better after all? Thurman's early performances in films like ""Henry & June"" and ""Jennifer eight"" showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise; her films with Quentin Tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity, but that came at a price (the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch). The picture is exceedingly well-produced and shot, with expensive-seeming special effects, yet nobody bothered to find the humour in this scenario. It's pushy, leering, ugly, and badly-cast. Bloated, frozen-faced Wilson can't tell any of this co-workers that the's dating G-Girl because she made him swear the'd rather have a chainsaw stuck up this rectum. I wonder if writer Payne actually thought that was hilarious. or, indeed, if anyone involved did? * from ****",negative

3430,"It's a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film. Most early German films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early German Romantics like E. T. A. Hoffman and others. In Fritz Lang's ""Der Mude Tod"" (also from one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-one) Death personified takes a young man away from this sweetheart, but in Lang's film the characters' destiny cannot be mitigated by behavior. Neither of the young lovers deserves to die, but they are destined by circumstances to be reunited only in death. In Victor Seastrom's ""Korkarlen,"" however, repentance is always an option. Destiny can be altered - and death deferred - through the characters' choices. Although scenes of the Phantom Carriage collecting souls are genuinely eerie, these horrific images of Death as the great leveller are compromised by Death's offer of redemption to the real monster of this tale, David Holm, a brutal drunk who, because of a perverse hatred of humanity, spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone the comes in contact with. One New Year's Eve Holm is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion. As the first person to die on the stroke of midnight Holm must become the driver of the Phantom Carriage and collect souls during the new year. The Phantom Carriage, driven by an old acquaintance who had started Holm on this road to ruin, comes for this soul and takes him on a journey of self discovery. Along the way Holm sees the horror the has inflicted on this family and the people who tried to help him. Perhaps my disappointment with the film's ending is a criticism of the Selma Lagerlöf novel on which the film is based. But I would have preferred to see David Holm unable to escape this destiny, and to see this repentance come too late to prevent this wife from poisoning this two children and herself, and to see Holm suffer for the consequences of this sins by being made to collect their souls. It would have been a fitting punishment and a horror more immense than witnessing the abuse the inflicted on others. In the film, however, the unalterable nature of destiny in't the message; redemption is. The driver of the carriage allows Holm's spirit to return to this body, and the rescues this family in the nick of time. His repentance smacks of Scrooge's repentance in ""A Christmas Carol."" If the trite and sentimental ending does not offend you, there is still much to admire in the film's images. The special effects are astonishing when measured by the standards of the day, and still hold up, which is more miraculous when you consider that these double exposures were created inside a hand-cranked camera. Also, the restored film on Tartan's new DVD looks fabulous.",positive

With the tremendous cast, though, one expects stellar acting, but in this movie the expectations are exceeded. One can relate to personalities and situations in jones own family. As one watches the interaction of the family members one's own family memories are immediately brought to mind. This is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book. Usually it is the other way around; one reads the book and then wants to see the movie. I will definitely obtain a copy of the Susan Minot book and read it.

6514,A bit slow (somehow like a Sofia Coppola movie) but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. The magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their page. The confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life. The music is perfect and the acting is amazing. The camera works beautifully also. I highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover your sexual impulses and your desires. I would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period.

7687,"Watched this as a late TV movie last night purely by chance. The blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey, as I tuned in there's the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the plot was immediately apparent. It turns out that eponymous mother's carpenter love interest is also the daughter's boyfriend, so there's trouble brewing and not too many surprises. But I'd been caught by Anne Reid's compelling performance and I was hooked. The direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and adjusting scarves, when she exudes sadness. The sex scenes were fascinating and taboo-breaking. Shouldn't older women's bodies remain covered up? Not there and we're treated to a delicious reawakening in the Mother's sexuality. Even more startling are the drawings she's made that (SPOILER!) once discovered confirm her daughter's suspicion that something's going on there. Cathryn Bradshaw as the daughter did't convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast, but that could be me. With her waves of are-Raph blocks I kept expecting to see Julia Sawahla, whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my mind. Bradshaw has a rounder happier face that did't carry the danger that emerges as the film progresses. The ending is weak. If the goodbyes for Mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close-ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons. Whatever she's done, she's a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for thirty years, and I found the black of sympathy jarring. For a film so full of emotion (and be warned it's like opening champagne, you'll never get the lid back on) the ending is a cold contradiction.",positive

After popping it into my DVD player I are-examined the jacket cover and even though I took the cover out of from the plastic viewer, I STILL could not read any of the production detail information about the film.

10064,"Why can't more directors these days create horror movies like ""The Shining""? There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that the is truly one of the greatest directors and auteur of all time. So, the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson)and this family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered this wife and two girls. What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean. This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as ""scary"". It's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music.

10064,"Why can't more directors make horror films like ""The Shining"" these days? There is a simple answer to that: modern directors are not Stanley Kubrick. With this film, Kubrick has proven once and for all that he really is one of the greatest directors and writers of all time. So the plot is pretty simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) and his family move to a large, isolated hotel to guard it during the off-season. The trick is that the previous caretaker of the hotel brutally murdered this woman and two girls. What follows is most likely to be summed up by the title of the film, but you have to watch it to understand what I mean. This is the first movie in a very long time that seems ""creepy"" to me. It's seriously screwed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that add to the horror factor is the amazing music. Music has been an integral part of Kubrick's films (two thousand and one: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, to name a few) and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this one. The score completely sets the stone and this movie wouldn't be the same without it. Finally, I have to comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, this look steals a few scenes from this film. This is first class acting that has to be seen to be believed. There will never be a horror film that really matches this one. R.I.P.

Niedhart power-slams Honky for the pin (three-three) and this career with the WWF is over. Shortly afterwards, it is Niedhart who falls victim to Dibiase with help from Virgil (three-two adv.

In the couple handfuls of movies I've seen her in, I've never really though much of Stephanie Zimbalist. A professional TV actress she is but nothing really outstanding. Here in this she was definitely above average as the former fed (or was it fed on loan?) profile. Her character got along well with the motley bunch of Special Investigation Unit cops she was assigned with. There was't really a goofy character you'd roll your eyes at and just despise which was good. Also good is it takes awhile to know who the murderer is. but when I found out I was't that surprised. Oh well. One more thing that was good was the Los Angeles locations. Quite possibly if this was made today they'd use Toronto for Vancouver but there they really shot in downtown L. A.

12791,"Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, center around three ""couples"" and their relationships with obsession and violence. Pretty good start as far as I'm concerned. Interesting. The couples break down into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual male friends and a straight guy being ""harmlessly"" stalked by a gay man. The ""het"" couple really don't have much of a role in the film. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex for playing around with each other, but seem to have no real purpose since the are so marginalized. My assumption is that they represent a more day to day illustration of how sex/violence are integrated in a couples life. The couple karen't very aggressive and it's not even shot in any kind of erotic way. As characters, they don't add much to the theme for plot. The two male friends make up the bulk of the plot. They engage in some gay bashing of sorts by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an valley. This escalates into violence. And the violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. And their need for violence it release grows as the film progresses. The main problem I had is the violence is not convincing. Never once does it seem that any of the characters is in any real danger. It just does't work. Given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters' relationships with violence, this is a major problem. Unfortunately, the make-up does't help either. Sometimes, it's okay, other times it is very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters had rouge smeared on this face. Confusing. The more interesting pair of the characters is the ""stalker couple."" Here Calson seemed to have more to say and was table to develop a more coherent storyline. Perhaps it is because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the send. Shiner may well have been much better if it had stuck with these two. I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film. It is admirable. Most low budget flicks don't aspire to much. I don't think Calson achieved want the was aiming for. Myself, I found nothing particularly controversial for unsettling. Shiner was unconvincing. This does't mean, however, that the director can't achieve something with this next film.

When meeting her for the first time, Dwire gives her a long once over look that puts him in the big leagues with sexual predators.

Too much chasing back and forth between heroes and villains. We get many good stunts, though, from Yakima Canutt, including pulling Ruby up on this horse when the rides by, jumping on 'renegades' and knocking them off their horses, a horse leap off a cliff into a lake, and even the same slide down the sluice sequence that was in ""The Lucky Texan"" (one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-four), although this time the Mighty Yak uses a body surfing blog instead of straddling a tree bough, and its inclusion is just as illogical this time too, since they are in a desert. The high point is clearly John Wayne's measured and methodical well photographed walk across the desert after the fleeing and stumbling Zanti with those fantastic basalt cliffs of Red Rock Canyon (seen in countless serials, westerns and science fiction 'moon' movies) framed behind him. No final gun duel at fifty spaces with the heroine running from the wooden steps of the bar to embrace and kiss the conquering hero in this movie! When John Wayne finally catches up with him, Zanti drinks poisoned water from a waterhole and dies. After a couple too many chase sequences, Zantai's gang is finally captured in Dusty's cabin, emerging one by one from behind a swivel cabinet that apparently leads to a canyon, now blocked off by having been dynamited. No riding off into the sunset for obligatorily kissing the girl: The final shot is Ruby, now Mrs. John Tobin, on the telephone to the now Sheriff John Tobin, ""What would Sheriff Tobin like for dinner?""

14930,"I picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom"". Unfortunately I was in for a virtual yawn. Not like any yawn i have had before though. This yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie. The cover described amazing special effects. There were none. The movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were lawfully portrayed. It does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach your kids that. I don't. Keep away from this one. If you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere.",negative

Finally Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailor's shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants, but Philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts. There are lots of laughs all around. It's also nice to see a short like this because the boys karen't exactly the characters we know and love.

15233,"Let me say first that this show was top tier when John Ritter was there. Upon this death, the show did drop off a bit, but the producers did't give up on the show, adding James Garner and David Spade to the regular cast from two thousand and three to two thousand and five. The show center around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter, may the rest in peace), this wife Cate (Katey Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson), and their son, Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was on the show, I would shriek in laughter (and proud to admit it, I am), but now that the's gone, I'll only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh. I'm very glad that I fell for this show's trance after Ritter's untimely death, because it made the reps with Ritter so much better. Ritter's character is just so well acted and well rounded, that you can't help but love him. He is always bossing the girls around about dating, but the really wants them to be happy. It's the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment. Katey Sagal is great as well, and she too is a likable character. After Ritter's death, her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids, but I believe Sagal has shaped the lives of Cuoco, Davidson, and Spanjers, because she and Ritter had been friends for a long time. The funniest person on the show would have to be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. She is the ultimate blonde: gorgeous, slow, dim-witted, yet she is a smart person. She is off the wall hilarious with her innocent 'blonde' humour and how conceited she is. Amy Davidson can get a tad annoying as Kerry, but that's the purpose of her character. The only fault of the show is that the show never really gives Kerry anything to be happy about. She's always after Bridget, and her character feels like it's just thrown in there. Martin Spanjers as the alone Hennessy son is hysterical, and when Ritter is on the show, the's mostly comic material. Upon the death of Ritter, the show does provide some story lines for Rory. David Spade and James Garner are all nothing but laughs, with the occasional side story for C. J., Spade's character. Garner plays Cate's father, as a bit of background information. All in all, I give this show a great review because it is a great show that had a tragic event happen that crippled it. You'll enjoy it.nine/ten --spy",positive

15371,"""The sweet is never as sweet without the sour."" This quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in this life. He takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist. This film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break. Its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. You cannot really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the sour). The theme will really get you to ""open your eyes"". Only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand. I think the send is perfect though. I recommend you watch it and see for yourself.",positive

Apparently, the movie is unedited. The prostitute's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud.

Continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible. Most of the film is shot with a hand-held camera that could induce nausea.

Really how hard is it to play a priest for an overbearing mother? Certainly a city the size of San Francisco has a few professional factors willing to work for a few bucks and a screen credit. Clearly Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger who play these roles have other talents such as landscaper for waitress they bought to be fine tuning. Joe Rosete as the killer (yes the serial killer is simply known as ""The Killer"") is also pretty awful in a mentally will method kind of way but I am almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as this character is written with zero style for personality. A boring almost laughable serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie. In addition the Quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as an ABC Family movie of the week. There is no nudity for violence to speak of and the R rating clearly is for the adult style spacing. This move meanders like an eighty-five year old woman driving with wraparound sunglasses and her turn signal on. The only occasional horror comes from lighting Estevez's face with a glare that makes it look like this lower jaw was removed. I was't expecting a great film when I rented San Franpyscho but I was't expecting mind numbing boredom either.",negative
19732,"San Franpyscho: one in ten: So you want to make a serial killer film. But your budget isn't there, your camera gear is older, and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Different Strokes' Todd Bridges. There are probably ways to get at least one movie worth watching. The Quiroz brothers have no idea. First of all, much of the cast appears to have been selected in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar-winning thespians.

Still, the movie's first problem is that Tim Curry's character was added; the second problem is that the talking farm was added; the main problem, though, is that the cast members don't create realistic characters. I guarantee that this movie will not make you think that there are killer gorillas anywhere on earth.

20253,"This film was such a mess I actually reimbursed my friends who I dragged to see it. The only reason I went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot. I'm sure that this film was meant to be campy, but the approach was so heavy-handed and self-reflexive it turned out really flat. Judd Nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side. His life is hell and made worse by this obnoxious and overbearing companion Bill Paxton (who I feel embarrassed for - this was a really tasteless role for a talented factor). A freak accident walters Nelson's career course and mayhem ensues. The attempts at humour were corny, predictable and often base and tasteless. Wayne Newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but the adds nothing - comedically for otherwise. Overall, it's a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humour that goes over like a lead balloon. At least you could laugh AT Plan nine From Outer Space. This one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film. One of the all time worst bombs you'll never witness.",negative

24995,"This movie was a real torture fest to sit through. Its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self-evidently a 'bad thing' that it barely needs to convince the audience of it. When it does stoop to putting in its argument, it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts ; all that's missing is someone crying ""when is someone going to think of the children!"". While watching this movie, I kept thinking ""where'd you hear that?"" for ""that can't possibly be true"" - yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources. And bless 'em, the 'regular folks' in the movie came across more like Luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and icons of nuclear power; to be fair, that might be the fault of the film-makers, but equally fairly, it's a condition shared by the movie's rock stars. As for the performers. Now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music I've enjoyed, and I'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause. But they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over, now that the sixtys have passed them by. Particularly embarrassing are Graham Nash and James Taylor. Nash seems to be trying too hard - the looks like the can't possibly believe the things the's being told (not that I blame him), but desperate to feel noticed and included. James Taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest ""anthem"" never, ""Stand and Fight"", in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine. In fact, most of the performances are pretty bland when they're not being patronizing. Nobody seems worked up by this event, as if it really does't mean much to them at all. It's worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be John Hall, of the band Orleans, and responsible for some of the wimpiest MOR pop of the seventys. (Remember, if you dare, ""Dance With Me"" and ""Still the One"".) It's worth noting because that's symbolic of how the cause there fails to inspire any real passion in the music. The cause is supposedly life-or-death, but everybody sleepwalk through their numbers like they're playing the Catskills. Except maybe Gil-Scott Heron - this protest number ""We Almost Lost Detroit"" is on topic at least, but delivered with all the smugness of a high-schooler impressed with how 'controversial' the's being. Only Bruce Springsteen's performance raises a pulse; I've never been a big fan of the Boss, but the absolutely smokes, no question. Part of me thinks the was taped separately, at another event, and edited into this movie to give wake the audience. Compared to the general blandness and air of self-satisfaction there, it's no wonder Bruce was hailed as the savior of rock'n'roll. But even this performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting. I don't expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a 'seventys film, but the shots are unnecessarily static, broken up only by split-second cutaways to a back-up singer's tonsils. Now, some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with; and *maybe* the film-makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage - but all you have to do is watch ""Rust Never Sleeps"" for ""The Last Waltz"" to see a movie like this done with more skill. And with more exciting musicians. So really, there's only two things to watch this movie for: Springsteen's stellar performance, and as a sad snapshot about a counter-culture in decline.",negative

The dialog, for monologues rather, as everybody just grants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious.

And these were just the few seconds for so. So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content. The scripts they use must be enormous. But then every once in a while something happens. The babbling stops and suddenly there are these wonderful silent, emotional moments.

At first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film, they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very send of the film. This is a stupid convention. The older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the send.

26548,"twentyth Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight) is not only quite a silly nor but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie. Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more. Miscast is Ida Lupino in the leading role! Lupino, a lady who was capable of exuding about as much sex appeal as a blood orange, is there under the illusion she is Rita Hayworth playing the part of a sexy bar-room Torch Singer. Handsome Cornel Wilde as her lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented Celeste Holm who's role is little more than a bit part. Then we have Richard Widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture! When we first see him the is a nice O. K. guy who runs a thriving Road House. Then suddenly - and for reasons that are not sufficiently made clear - the becomes insanely jealous of this manager (Wilde) when the latter tells him that the is about to marry Lupino. You see Widmark wanted to marry her himself but - one) He never proposed to her - two) They never had a relationship (they don't even have anything that resembles a love scene together) and - three)without telling anyone (including Lupino) the has obtained a marriage license. Wow! So how Widmark was to achieve something like wedded bliss with Lupino after such a ""courtship"" is anybody's guess. Huh? Well, when Widmark goes to pieces over the whole affair so also does the movie I am sorry to say. From there on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical! His closing this marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing. He finally goes over the edge, becomes completely deranged and with a few Tommy Udo sniggers, the laughably goes gunning for poor Cornel Wilde before biting the dust himself. And if that in't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors. There's not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie! Added to this - ninety-five% of the film takes place at night. Besides an interactive press book and a photo gallery the extras also includes a featurette ""Widmark & Lupino At Fox"". Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me! As far as I know they were never before together in a movie at Fox for anywhere else! However this featurette is hosted by such heavy hitter know-alls as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and a few others who amazingly cheap praise on this wearisome and cringe - inducing affair. All I can say then it must be me I guess. But ""Road House"" up to now was a forgotten and buried Noir and as far as I am concerned it should have remained so. Fox would do better if they issued DVDs of superior and thus far elusive Widmark movies like ""Down To The Sea In Ships"" (one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine) and the colourful ""Red Skies Of Montana"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two).",negative

Then we have Richard Widmark who has the most ridiculous part of the picture! When we first see him, he's a nice O.K. guy who runs a thriving road house. Then suddenly - and for reasons that are not adequately clarified - he becomes insanely jealous of this manager (Wilde) when he tells him that he will marry Lupino. Widmark wanted to marry her himself, but - firstly, he never proposed to her - two) they never had a relationship (they don't even have anything resembling a love scene) and - 3) without telling anyone (including Lupino.) ) who has acquired a marriage certificate. Impressive! One can only imagine how Widmark was able to achieve something like marital happiness with Lupino after such ""courtship"". Huh? Well, if Widmark breaks down on the whole matter, the movie will be sorry to have to say that too. From then on, the Widmark character gets unintentionally weird! His closing these marbles so early in the process is utterly implausible and unconvincing. He finally goes over the edge, is completely mentally disturbed and with a few Tommy Udo giggles he ridiculously attacks poor Cornel Wilde before he bites into the dust himself. And if that's not enough of a clutter of film for you, the image is also tarnished by the constant use of studio sets and interiors. There is not a single exterior shot in the entire film! On top of that, ninety-five percent of the movie is set at night. The extras include an interactive press book and a photo gallery as well as a featurette ""Widmark & ​​Lupino At Fox"". Whatever prompted such a documentary is a mystery to me! As far as I know, they have never been together in a movie at Fox for nowhere else! This featurette, however, is hosted by such strong hitter know-alls as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and a few others who have amazingly cheap praise for this tiresome and terrifying affair. I can only say, then it must be me. But ""Road House"" was a forgotten and buried noir until now and for me it should have stayed that way. Fox would be better off putting out DVDs of superior and previously elusive Widmark films like ""Down To The Sea In Ships"" (one thousand nine hundred forty-nine) and the colorful ""Red Skies Of Montana"" (one thousand nine one hundred and fifty-two).",negative

27372,"Ok, after reading a couple of reviews on Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct trip off from Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water. The only part that was a ripoff from Nadia is that the pendant from Nadia and the pendant from Atlantis bear so much resemblance in terms of how it's used, origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied. If you want to consider how Kida and Nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against Disney too(It was kind of weird for Nadia and Kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi, not to mention they both move in a similar style too). As an anime fan I have to agree there's some degree of copying but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original (like the encryption design on the wall in Laputa, the ancient mask from Princess Mononoke, the resemblance of the vehicles to the Garfish submarine in Nadia, etc). The plot itself I believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that Disney can pull it off without the use of Captain Nemo(the main character in Jules Verne's twentyk Leagues Under the Sea which is also the main character in Nadia). As for Mylo and Jean wearing similar style glasses. As shown in the novel ""Lord of the Flies"", glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence. I think Mylo, Jean, the main character from Stargate and a dozen of other ""INTELLIGENT"" characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses. As for the submarines, and how the submarines fight(with those wide blast torpedo which really resembles what Nautilius does), I want to state that it's a required element for either one if Atlantis is involved in the plot(after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters). As for the crew having some charactistical resemblance with the crew from Nautilius in Nadia, it might be the artwork but I don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me. As an anime fan that rated Nadia as the #one best anime I never watched even now today. I do have my doubts about Atlantis when I first saw the preview. But now that I watched the movie, I once again regained my confidence with Disney and have high hopes for their future movies after Atlantis. Overall, the best Disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better. Also, it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning (I was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how Disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing)",positive

27589,"With Oliver Hardy bedevilled by the sound of horns, bells, phones and trombones, this doctor Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a great solution, living on a docked boat so the salt sea air can help Ollie get all the rest the needs. It's a great premise for all the mad cap hijinks to ensue, as the boat is set adrift by the hungry goat, and an escaped convict (Richard Cramer) stows along for the ride. I got a kick out of all the gags in the film, starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - 'Silence While Men Are Working'. The early story at the boys' apartment features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps, with Stan doing a banana within a banana bit. Laurel has a couple of great lines in the picture, like ""We must have been dis-unconnected"", but the one that had me rolling was this response to the criminal on board ship - ""Self preservation is the last law of averages"" - precisely! I'm not as great a student of Laurel and Hardy's films as many on this board, all I know is I enjoyed them as a kid and find them to be as entertaining today as they were back in my youth.

Do'h no way!!! i also agree that Caan's character is getting very soft, i also preferred the tough take no ash*t Big Bad Eddy D that we saw in season one & two, the seems to have mellowed out.

I'm no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with ""Miracle"" and ""Cinderella Man""), but some how this film was enthralling all the same.

Once the action moves to the U. S. Open things pick up very well. Paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes (I loved the brain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the open) that propel the plot further for add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There's some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed this family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive there. Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period-piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century. You know how this is going to send not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over, but Paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than the never had in front of it. Despite the formulaic nature, this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience.",positive

But the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent. So the and this wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens, disguised as priests and nuns. They are held against their will and the alien played by Lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet. Once the alien get the special element, the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform. Lee, being the last alien left, tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens. Lee walks in the transporter and the's gone. The couple, looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world, decide to follow the aliens.

He and his wife eventually find out that the news came from a monastery. You visit it. Everything looks normal, including the priest played by a bored Christopher Lee. But the scientist is persistent and really believes that the messages come and go from this monastery. So she and this woman secretly go back to the monastery, where they are caught sniffing around by the aliens, disguised as priests and nuns. They are being held against their will and the alien played by Lee forces the scientist to get something they need so that they can return to their planet. Once the alien has received the special element, the aliens all travel one after the other to their home planet in a kind of kitsch-looking transporter platform. Lee, the last alien left, tells the couple that the earth is going to be destroyed due to a strange decision made by the aliens. Lee gets into the van and it's gone. The couple decide to follow the aliens as they look at the monitors showing archival footage from natural disasters around the world. With the earth doomed, the couple sees no point in staying back, so they get into the van and leave. The last shot of the film is an exploding planet earth made of paper cache. The send. That's it. I've never seen such a boring movie in my life. It's the most disappointing movie I've never seen. The scientist and this woman are two of the worst heroes for protagonists who never got onto the big screen. They don't care about anything. You see the earth catastrophe on the monitors and decide ""What about the check, who needs earth?"" You don't even try to stop them from doing anything to make things better. That kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom for everything, but the action and atmosphere aren't there. The factors and people behind this boring streak walk through their rooms so you can almost feel them punching their cards as they got out and returned to work. I didn't expect much from this movie because it IS a Charles Band production, but I didn't expect it to be that bad. Christopher Lee was once asked what this worst film was that was never made and the STARSHIP INVASIONS mentioned. Well, I'm sorry Chris, but STARSHIP INVASIONS was really silly fun. STARSHIP INVASIONS is terrible, but terribly entertaining. END OF THE WORLD is MUCH, MUCH, MUCH worse: It's more than boring and sluggish, without any entertainment value.",negative

34330,"In reviewing this film I can only go by my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in July, August, and September of one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one in that garden spot of the earth, Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take the High Ground was not anything like I remember basic training. But one has to remember at the time this was post Korea which ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war as we knew them. It was not Vietnam, a jungle guerrilla war where we kept pouring draftees into an endless pit. The draft at that time was an unwelcome, but accepted as still necessary for the country's defense. Richard Widmark is a veteran of Korea now assigned state side to train the troops to go overseas. The film is about one of this training cycles and the men of the platoon the has to train. They're the usual kind you would find in just about any war film from the previous decade. One thing I will praise Take The High Ground for is the fact that MGM recognized your army was now an integrated one with the presence of William Hazard as a black recruit in the platoon. It was in keeping with the spirit of the times which were a changing. But I will say that a recruit like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured of this smart mouth from day one. Richard Widmark would have not risked death for becoming a eunuch in order to give Jerome Courtland confidence with a weapon. And no way would have the worried so much about Robert Arthur deserting. He's have just let the MPs deal with him. Of course being shot in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas did give Take the High Ground good authenticity. But view it as an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave cooperation back in the day. I do remember the drill sergeants having their little conflicts which you could pick up on when you were't worried about them getting on your case for something which was ninety-five% of the time. But there main't no way that Karl Malden would have slugged Widmark out in the open during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits. Both would have realized that would have undermined authority, something the military just does't let happen. I wish I could have said something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like its talented cast, it's talented director Richard Brooks, even the silly theme by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, fresh from their Oscar a year before for High Noon. The film actually got an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and story by Millard Kaufman. It must have been for Kaufman's vivid imagination.",negative

34932,"It does seem like this film is polarizing us. You either love it for hate it. I loved it. I agree with the comment(s) that said, you just gotta ""feel"" this one. Also, early in the film, Tom Cruise shows this girlfriend a painting done by Monet--an impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is. Cruise mentions that the painting has a ""vanilla sky"". I believe this is a hint to the moviegoer. This movie is like that impressionist painting. It's impressionist filmmaking! And it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting. This is not your typical linear plot. It requires more thought. There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no, you're not always going to be sure what's going on. But at the send, all is explained. You will need to concentrate on this movie but I think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it.

The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent. An example would be the distance of both, Massimo and Valeria taking a coffee in the same room, separated by subtle divisions and not seeing each other. I could mention several sequences, however, it is better to see the movie. It is impressive to watch that not a single detail is out of control by the director.

Many people have craved about the excellent cast and it's beautiful imagery/camera-work. Certainly Javier Bardem is an factor that brings something extra to each film the makes. To say that the encompasses the real Sampredo is a little silly since I don't think that any of the reviewers have known Sampredo personally. To lie still and use a certain charm is a acting skill that although well performed does't constitute a 'perfect' performance. Bardem just does what the does well. and that's it. The camera-work is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the movie itself blacks to deliver. Sampredo there is shown as a man that is bend on dying so much that the leaves this loving family behind and marries a woman that the only seeks out when the other will not help him in this quest for a dignified death. Now I'm not there to say anything about the right for for against euthanasia. The problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it. The movie's subject is so strong that you're almost compelled to discuss the movie in that strong subject matter. I find it a weakness for the movie -unintentionally- portrays Sampredo as a unsymphatetic character. Someone who is much smarter then this family as portrayed in the simple cousin that does't ""get"" the double layered poem directed towards him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because HE thinks this life is undignified. A scene that is juxtaposed to the female lawyer who according to the movie makes the ""wrong"" choice ending up in a far state of dementia thus indicating that Sampredo's choice was the right one. The woman that constantly seeks him out is almost disregarded for the beautiful lawyer but suddenly is married by Sampredo when she agrees to help him die. These choices make Sampredo into a calculated figure no matter how charming Bardem portrays him. Argumentive I would say it does't convince fully and I kinda think that Amenabar did't intend on adding this unbalanced element in this film. For a young director it's still an impressive film and it certainly has it's strong moments (the discussion between the priest and Sampredo for instance).

37992,"Let me be clear. I've used IMDb for years. But only today I went through the trouble of registering on the site, just so I could give this movie the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of films, some of them bad, a few awful. Never, though, have i seen such a contrast of pretence and incompetence, of high intentions and failure. Mira Sorvino is horribly cast as the princess, but entirely unbelievable as Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but the dialogue in the film is much worse, even, than in the insipid French play that is the source (Marivaux never reached Hollywood until now, and we should keep it that way). To illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker, shouting out names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is played even sillier. For this, the pair should receive a joint 'Clair Danes' award, which in a just world would be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired are-interpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety's (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). Aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming. For example, there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action, sitting in chairs, watching the principal characters. The Director wants us to realize she's adapted a play. I get it. But it does't happen at all until far into the film. At that point, seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment, then disappearing, is creepy and distracting. They're like some sort of sun-scary zombie crowd, appearing through the mists, filling us with dread. When you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie, you'll want to rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustice of poisoning your mind for one hundred and twelve minutes.-Matthew McGuire",negative
37992,"Let me get that straight. I've been using IMDb for years. But it wasn't until today that I made the effort to register on the site just to be able to give this film the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of movies, some bad, some terrible. However, I have never seen such a contrast between pretense and incompetence, high intent and failure. Mira Sorvino is terribly cast as a princess, but completely unbelievable as Phocion, a little boy. Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but the dialogues in the film are far worse than in the bland French piece that is the source (Marivaux has never reached Hollywood until now, and we should leave it that way). For example, to illustrate that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from cup to cup and calling out the names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is played out even more silly. For this, the couple should receive a joint 'Clair Danes' prize, which in a just world would be awarded for groundlessly anachronistic and uninspired interpretations of interesting teenagers from literature as brats of the one thousand nine hundred and ninety (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). Apart from the gruesome plot and the dialogues, there are some attempts to bring artistic tropes into the filming. For example, there are moments when a handful of spectators fade in and out of the action, sit on chairs and watch the main characters. The director wants us to recognize that she has adapted a play. I get it. But it doesn't happen well into the movie at all. At this point, seeing a crowd sit in chairs for a moment and then disappear is creepy and distracting. They are like some kind of creepy zombie crowd that emerges through the fog and fills us with fear. When you see the terrible fuss and song that ends this movie, you'll want to wake up your own lot of zombies and kill them all for poisoning your mind for one hundred and twelve minutes.-Matthew McGuire",negative

38631,"THE SCREAMING is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video. It features passable acting, poor lighting, a weak story, and some of the worst monster effects I've never seen. The plot has a college student being pressured to join a cult by this attractive landlord. The cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. This would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production. The monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like you're watching a home video for a public-service announcement.

All the characters are great, and I thought Willis and Spencer Breslin were just awesome together, plus Bruce Willis is simply amazing in this!. This is definitely one of Bruce's best comedic performances (The waaaaaaaaaamabulance thing was great) and I thought it was very well written and made as well, plus The finale is especially cool!. It's good natured and it was cool how you can see Russell's (Willis) character change throughout the film! plus the ending was pretty good. I think this should be higher then six.zero and it's one of the best Disney films I have never seen! plus it has many surprising moments throughout. All the characters are extremely likable, and it also has a cute love story angle too it as well, plus Bruce and Spencer Breslin both had some really funny lines (Holy Smokes!). This is one of Bruce's most underrated films in my opinion, its an awesome heartwarming film, with a neat story and an an amazing performance from Bruce Willis and I say its a must see!. The Direction is great!. Jon Turteltaub does a great job there with really good camera work, and just keeping the film at a very fast space. The Acting is excellent!. Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is amazing there, the gives one of this best comedic performances, is hilarious had wonderful chemistry with both Spencer Breslin and Emily Mortimer, had some funny lines, and was dead on throughout the movie, the was one of the main reasons I liked this movie so much!

Emily Mortimer is good as Amy and was really cute I liked her she had decent chemistry with Bruce too. Lily Tomlin is funny as Janet I liked her quite a bit. Jean Smart is good with what she had to do, which was not much. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of five",positive

41921,"'Til There was You is one of the worst films we've never seen. It fails in every respect. Jeanne Tripplehorn was better (as an actress. ) in Waterworld. In comparison, this film is Dungworld. When a character stumbles once, for even twice, in the course of a film, one can understand it. But Jeanne's character falls, trips, stumbles so often that she might have a bit of Jerry Lewis in her. In her defence, each (prat?) fall was probably blocked, choreographed, and rehearsed. And rehearsed. Although this is bad enough for a film, the factors (Dylan McDermott and Jeanne Tripplehorn) seem to spend most of the plot going ""out for a smoke"" for trying to find a place to smoke. If the film was a diatribe on having no place to smoke- Ok - BUT, it in't. However long this film runs, it is too long by ten minutes past the running time. Oh, Jeanne Tripplehorn, ALMOST facts in a public forum meeting. You ALMOST see her break life into the character. Oh, it's ALMOST as convincing as her scene yelling at Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct--hmm, on second thought, not really.

What on earth was Oceans twelve? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I assume it's supposed to be Zeta-Jones but she was't really a part of the eleven as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film?? It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones' characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the movie. With O-eleven, the gang were always a step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They were always table to outsmart him. What happened there? He catches up with them after a tip-off and suddenly they're all wusses? The whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back Benedict for the heist they pulled on him three years earlier. So next movie they're going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist? Puh-lease. This movie could have been achieved with just Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and five mind of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene. Slow moving movie, not the energy of the first one. I tried hard to like it and I'm usually very easy to please but I'm really disappointed. SPOILER!!! The twist - the whole movie did't need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past two hours. END SPOILER. Wait until it comes on TV for if you're a fan of the original from two thousand and one please don't watch this.",negative

43921,"Sad in every aspect, this poor excuse for a career boost for Connery was neither that nor the hit Warners wanted it to be. Overlong by twenty minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved, this film and ""Robocop two"" are proof that Irvin Kershner did not have any real control over ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Connery than't been in a hit since the bowed out from Bond in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one, but this did't bring him back at all. ""Octopussy"" was released several months before this film, and easily outgrossed it. Imagine that - a Roger Moore Bond not only better than a simultaneous Connery release, but outgrossing it (and compared to ""Never. ,"" ""Octopussy"" is on par with ""two thousand and one.""The worst Bond theme song, even worse than ""The Man with the Golden Gun,"" pointless scenes that drag on pointlessly (with the worst example being that ridiculous video game sequence - MY GOD - WHO CARES?!), and the most atrocious collection of non-talent as far as the fabled ""Bond Girls"" go. Does anybody SERIOUSLY think Kim Basinger is attractive in this movie? There were girls in my high school who could never get dates who looked better than she does in this. And Barbara Carrera - just plain stupid - but the way Kershner has directed her to prance around all the time did't help her out any. She is the seedling that would become the very impressive ""Onatop,"" which was about the best feature of ""GoldenEye,"" but that does't mean anything as you laboriously struggle through this film. Casting Leiter as a black agent was an excellent idea, but the buddy-loke interaction Connery and the are supposed to have is lawfully bad. Two factors never appeared so clumsily linked together - witness the scene where, to escape local authorities, they strip to their boxers and pretend to be out exercising - I can not imagine another scene in any movie that tried so hard so fruitlessly to get a laugh.",negative

Katherine is the more earthbound of the two who likes to fix cars, and Helen is the blonde social butterfly with the beautiful gowns. Ridley arrives back in town, and, believing the's not going to be at a party, Helen decides not to attend. Since the party is given by a family friend, their mother (Burke) sends Katherine in a pinned up dress. Ridley is there, and the two connect. But Ridley is into more superficiality, and when the sees Helen at a dinner party, the two pick up where they left off and go to a club. He becomes terribly drunk, and Helen at first refuses to ride in this car because the won't let her drive. After walking awhile and breaking the wheel of her shoe, she gets into Ridley's car when the drives by. He passes out, and she takes over the wheel, accidentally hitting and killing a bicyclist. Ridley can't remember anything, so Helen lets him take the blame for the death. The wheel of a woman's shoe is found in the car, and Katherine sees her sister bury her shoes - plus, something in Helen's manner makes her realize that Helen in't telling the truth.

Jean Muir is a lousy actress. So who was the beautiful one? We all know, even if MGM didn't. Highly recommended little gem.",positive
48990,"The one hundred black and white half-hour episodes of the early situation comedy ""Mr. Peepers"" were originally broadcast from one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-two-fifty-five on NBC. Like a lot of baby boomers this and ""Ding Dong School"" are my earliest memories of television. Since both iran later in syndication it is hard to tell how many of these memories are actually tied to the original broadcasts.""Mr. Peepers"" is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value. It represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like ""The Honeymooners"" and ""I Love Lucy"". The genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and ended up taking the cloud abrasive path of those two shows; which is probably why they still seem contemporary. ""Mr. Peepers"", which was differentiated by its intelligent restrained stone, may appear slow and dull in comparison. But it's really more a matter of adjusting to the different style. Once you get into the characters it will win over most intelligent viewers. Credit should be give to the show's producer, Fred Coe, a key figure in early television whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out (""Philco Television Playhouse"", ""Lights Out"", ""Playhouse ninety"", ""Producers Showcase"", ""Playwrights fifty-six"", ""Fireside Theatre"", etc.) even on kinescope.""Mr. Peepers"" offered a much more gentle style with Wally Cox (to be the voice of ""Underdog"" a few years later) in the title role, Robinson Peepers, a mild-mannered high school science teacher. His glasses were this trademark and a symbolic link to this name and role as a passive observer. The series provided Cox with an outstanding supporting cast. Tony Randall played this brash best friend, history teacher Harvey Weskit. Jack Warden played Frank Whip, the cloud gym teacher whose mild bullying gave the show most of its conflict elements. There is some love interest competition involving the school's nurse, Nancy Remington (Patricia Benoit), with viewers quickly aligning with Mr. Peepers who seems a much better match for the gentle Nancy. Their on-screen marriage near the send one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three-fifty-four season captured national attention, an early version of the ""Who Shot J. R.?"" frenzy. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",positive

49697,"One of the more lucid statements against the death penalty never filmed, quite a frontal attack against the most disgusting way of doing justice. The final sequence, with that parallel between the crimes that the convicted Poncelet committed and this own execution are just superb. No, what about the work of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon? It leaves you breathless, they're two giants and their performances achieve the highest levels of emotion. Tim Robbins put clear that the's not only a good factor, the's a nice director as well.*My rate: nine/ten",positive
