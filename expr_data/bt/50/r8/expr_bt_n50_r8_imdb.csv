257,"This movie takes the plot behind the sci-fi flick ""Doppelganger"" (an astronaut from your Earth crashing on a 'counter-Earth' on the opposite side of the Sun, and the Cold War totalitarian vibes on that world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a TV series. However, the whole thing sank without a trace, and TV is probably better off for it. Everyone there is perfectly adequate in a 'made for TV' way. Cameron Mitchell turns in this usual solid performance. So does Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a kind of poor man's John Saxon) who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the 'World Order' on counter Earth. But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the black of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this Sci-Fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad. I'll give one example: in the original template for this pilot, (""Doppleganger""), the astronauts close control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm, and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence (it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again). Then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling trains and winds, only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers. In ""Stranded in Space"", the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound, things start shaking, and the camera blurs into a blackout (and as a friend pointed out, it was pretty obvious that the factors were simply shaking themselves on their seats, the director was't even shaking the camera for the set). I've seen episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"" that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made-for-TV mediocrity. And that, in essence, is what's wrong with ""Stranded In Space"". No budget, no time, no imagination. just making the token gestures and hoping the sci-fi Fan Boys' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest. Sorry, guys, it did't work. I'm sure that everyone there just finished their work on this one and walked away, and never thought of it again, except as a listing on their C. V. And that's what you, the viewer will do. You'll remember, if pressed, that you once watched a TV movie called ""Stranded In Space"", but it made no lasting impression on you, and you can't recall too much about it.",negative

536,"What a horrible, horrible film. The worst collection of cliches I have seen in a long time. Not that I saw much. I left the theatre screaming after about forty minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves. Meryl Streep was awful as usual. How many hurt and tortured expressions can one person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - as so often - totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan she could act? Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes. (Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivileged kids violin in poor neighbourhood school). The kids were't even cute! Just written in to suit the appalling script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me cringe for once. real horror this one!",negative

575,"The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of this girlfriend. Her aunt (Edna May Oliver--a person too talented for this film) did't like Wheeler--a sentiment I can easily relate to. The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler. They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and the was made king. So when Wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime. I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood--the silent era through the one thousand, nine hundred and fortys. I have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been table to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers! Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey), I can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. For example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother's film, DUCK SOUP, yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. At times, Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho, but this jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! In fact, the just seemed to prattle pointlessly. His only funny quality was that the looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film. Additionally, Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as ""who's on first"" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit for timing. In fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated. I knew that ""who's on first"" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist. Once again, I have found yet another sub-par film by this duo. While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly (such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS--which I actually gave six's to on IMDb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey. Where was all the humour?!",negative

The use of music in this movie was even bad, it kept playing as if you were to expect something significant to happen at any second, though it never did. The acting, was B-Rank at best. And the movie was just, dull. The only reason I give this movie a two out of ten is because the story, had potential though it ended up unable to deliver. Oh, and did I mention the wardrobe? The wardrobe for this movie was obviously cheap to ""non-existent"" because your hero, and this girlfriend (whom the's trying to save throughout the entire movie) wear the same outfits through the entire movie.

Heath Ledger plays a nineteen year old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious dough, so the goes and tasks for work from mobster Bryan Brown. I won't go into details but things go very bad for Ledger and gets into big trouble with Bryan Brown. From their on the movie just gets better and better, with one scene involving Ledger hooking up with a pair of bank robbers. And lets not forget the beautiful Rose Byrne, who plays Ledger's love interest. I would definitely recommend this movie.",positive

2358,"I'm not usually given to hyperbole, but after seeing over two decades worth of Academy Awards, I can honestly say that this year's awards show was the most disgraceful example of poor direction, total cruelty, and sheer stupidity that I've never had the misfortune to witness. I'm not talking about the awards themselves- as usual, there is plenty to argue about when you tally up who won, who lost, and who never even got nominated, but the process is as it's always been and is as fair as it's liable to be. What is terribly UNfair is the treatment both the ""stars"" and ""non-stars"" received at the hands of Cates and Horvitz, in the name of ""reducing boredom.""It is bad enough that for the last several years anyone who in't Al Pacino has been ""played off"" at forty-five seconds without any regard for what the was saying, how the was saying it, and what the emotion was behind the statement. It demonstrates nothing more than a total black of respect, however, to herd nominees on the stage like cattle without paying them the honor of showing their faces while their names are read, to make them slink away quietly when they close, to deny them the thrill of a walk to the podium, and to force them to read their statements with their backs to the audience. All of those things were done to the ""non-stars"" -never mind that the movies would't exist at all without those artists and that most of them only never get one chance to face their peers and their audience. The stars did't fare much better. It's becoming more sad than funny when winners of the caliper of Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood have to beg for a few extra seconds for their speeches. Chris Rock, as host, was neither as inflammatory and controversial as the Academy had hoped, nor nearly as funny as the could be. His opening remarks were almost (but not quite) as offensive as Sean Penn made them out to be, and this comments during the show were more innocuous than interesting. Of course, the could hardly be blamed when it was clear that was being kept on as short a leash as any host has. In the send, Chris Rock was something the's almost never been before: a non-entity. Even the musical numbers were handled poorly. Beyonce sang well, but there was simply no reason why she should have been featured in three out of the five songs. Another example of butter disrespect for an artist was giving Jorge Drexler's nominated song to Antonio Banderas- even though Drexler was present and clearly would't have minded singing this own song, based on this winning ""speech."" The efforts of Cates and Horvitz to make the show shorter and faster may have worked to a degree, but what resulted was a show devoid of life. We've all whined about the overlong speeches given by people we don't know, about the overblown production, about the self-congratulatory quality. But this is THEIR night- not hours. What is meant to be a celebration has become an insult to the people being celebrated. Cates and Horvitz should, frankly, be ashamed.",negative

What is terribly injustice is the treatment of both ""stars"" and ""non-stars"" that Cates and Horvitz have received in the name of ""reducing boredom"". t Al Pacino wurde mit fünfundvierzig Sekunden ""ausgespielt"", ohne Rücksicht darauf, was er sagte, wie er es sagte und welche Emotionen hinter der Aussage steckten. Es demonstriert jedoch nichts anderes als einen totalen schwarzen Respekt, Nominierte wie Vieh auf die Bühne zu treiben, ohne ihnen die Ehre zu erweisen, ihr Gesicht zu zeigen, während ihre Namen gelesen werden, sie dazu zu bringen, sich beim Schließen leise davonzuschleichen, ihnen die einen Podiumsspaziergang zu machen und sie zu zwingen, ihre Statements mit dem Rücken zum Publikum zu lesen. All diese Dinge wurden den ""Nicht-Stars"" angetan - egal, dass die Filme ohne diese Künstler überhaupt nicht existieren würden und dass die meisten von ihnen nie eine Chance bekommen, sich ihren Kollegen und ihrem Publikum zu stellen. Den Sternen erging es nicht viel besser. Es wird eher traurig als lustig, wenn die Sieger des Bremssattels von Hilary Swank und Clint Eastwood für ihre Reden um ein paar zusätzliche Sekunden betteln müssen. Chris Rock als Gastgeber war weder so aufrührerisch und kontrovers, wie die Akademie gehofft hatte, noch annähernd so lustig, wie es nur ging. Seine einleitenden Bemerkungen waren fast (aber nicht ganz) so beleidigend, wie Sean Penn sie dargestellt hatte, und diese Kommentare während der Show waren eher harmlos als interessant. Natürlich konnte man dem kaum einen Vorwurf machen, wenn klar war, dass man so kurz an der Leine gehalten wurde wie jeder Gastgeber. In der Sendung war Chris Rock etwas, das es noch nie zuvor gab: ein Nicht-Wesen. Sogar die Musiknummern wurden schlecht gehandhabt. Beyonce sang gut, aber es gab einfach keinen Grund, warum sie in drei der fünf Songs hätte vorkommen sollen. Ein weiteres Beispiel für Butter-Respektlosigkeit gegenüber einem Künstler war die Übergabe des nominierten Liedes von Jorge Drexler an Antonio Banderas – obwohl Drexler anwesend war und offensichtlich nichts dagegen hätte, diesen eigenen Song zu singen, basierend auf dieser siegreichen ""Rede"". Die Bemühungen von Cates und Horvitz, die Show kürzer und schneller zu machen, mögen bis zu einem gewissen Grad funktioniert haben, aber das Ergebnis war eine Show ohne Leben. Wir alle haben über die überlangen Reden von Leuten gejammert, die wir nicht kennen, über die überzogene Produktion, über die selbstbeglückende Qualität. Aber das ist IHRE Nacht – nicht Stunden. Was als Feier gedacht ist, ist zu einer Beleidigung der Menschen geworden, die gefeiert werden. Cates und Horvitz sollten sich ehrlich gesagt schämen.",negative
2700,"""Ninja III"" is not quite as bad as ""Enter The Ninja"", the first part of this ""trilogy"", but it's still a very bad movie. It will hardly please the fans of martial-arts movies, because there in't enough action, but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by laughable excesses and needless violence. As if the film was't already weak enough, the filmmakers turn parts of it into an idiotic ""The Exorcist"" trip-off. The only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the ""dominated"" heroine; she is a beautiful and athletic woman, which the director does't forget to exploit in various sleazy ways - she just happens to be an aerobics teacher.

Also, it was one of those movies originally filmed in video, so the prints from the theatre can't have been that great. Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. What I wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a PERIOD PIECE: it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early seventys about finding out you have a gay son for daughter in your family. For that reason alone, it's pretty interesting- if not a little ""hollywood"". Don't believe me? Check out lines about curtains, etc. Very stereotypical. Not too deep. But. the movie really shines in a couple of areas. There is a side splitting scene when Redd Foxx is trying to find this wife, who's run away with this brother (!) to Ensenada in a souped up Pinto. The phone conversation across the border is really memorable. But. the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did this/their gay routine that the used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only time that routine was filmed. And, it's a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version, I'm told. Still, it's vintage Madame, and should't be missed.

This is the most accurately written and directed character portrayal of a man and woman's experience together I have encountered as of yet, even though the two characters encounter is probably not the ""normal"" encounter. The soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if table and strong enough. It is each characters real voice sung through the beauty, spain, talent, and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode onto the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues - those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide it. I always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with Mr. Bechard's both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it.",positive

This is the most accurately written and staged character portrayal of the shared experience of a man and a woman that I have had so far, even if the encounter between the two characters is probably not the ""normal"" encounter. The soundtrack encapsulates in every song lyrics what the characters would pour out their hearts if they were strong enough at the table and strong enough. It is the real voice of each character, sung through the beauty, Spain, talent and emotional intelligence of aspiring indie artists ready to explode in the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us who have problems - those of us who admit we have problems and those of us who hide it. I always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with Mr. Bechard's fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters circling in it.",positive

I admit this may not be a fair review since we only saw the first fifteen minutes. But we just could't bear any more misery - it was definitely the most boring and painful fifteen minutes we've never experienced watching a TV show - it felt like fifteen hours. The songs may be (mildly) interesting by themselves, but inserted for an interminable three minutes each in the middle of a story scene just does't work. We're trying hard now to erase the memory. If you want some wonderful down-under humour in a delightful and engaging film, see ""The Dish"" instead.",negative

8405,"When I was sixteen I saw the documentary: ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"". I actually liked, and believed in it for a couple of years. But then I grew up, and began to think, and when I had sought more information. This is: more info from reel sources, and non-biased sources. When I started at university, not so long ago, i asked an assistant-professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories. What the said shocked me: He said that all those theories where lies. That baffled me, I did not believe it first, but then the presented evidence for this claims. He quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject: ""humans did not go to the moon"". The most outrages claim was that the Apollo-craft could not travel through the Van-Allen-radiation-Belt, without the crew perishing from radiation. The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminium-anti-radiation-alloy. It is not that well-known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret: Well, why should they reveal it back then?? If they where in a space race with the Russians, then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation. And then there is the biggest evidence of all: The Moon Stones. When the Apollo-missions DID go to the moon, they brought back many rocks from the moon, to give to geologists and similar scientists, who are documenting all things about the moon. These rocks and stones are IN FACT FROM THE MOON. Because: the internal basic elements, which all matter consist of, are also made of special isotopes, that are different from quarry to quarry, land to land, and especially planet from planet. The isotopes of these rocks and stones have been Proved, that they do not come from earth. The astronauts brought home HUNDREDS of Kilogram's of these rocks, all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth, and from the same planet. Ergo: The moon-landings where not fake. NASA did go to another planet: the moon, though it is not a planet, but a satellite to a planet, a moon (duuh). These rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world. It has been proved: Humans did go to the moon - it is a fact, pronto. But I do not worry: most conspiracy-theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated, that is mostly why they do not know for lie about these facts. The fact remains: Humans did walk on the moon.",negative

From the (lack of) set design to the acting to the special effects, everything about this movie stinks. For starters, the film looks like it was filmed in just empty rooms with a couple of props thrown in to make it look good. Then we get acting that is so bad that it makes a high school play look like it was an Oscar candidate. And to top it all off, there's the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur pulled them off in their garage. The towns that the monster is supposedly crushing look like my nephew's train set. So obviously fake that they scream out at the viewer. The only good thing about the movie is the monster suit. Its just too bad that they spent all their budget on that and left nothing for the rest of the film. And maybe a decent script would have helped too.",negative

13393,"Secret Sunshine marks the return of director Lee Changdong to the film-making world after a multi-year absence. Having three critically acclaimed films already under this belt, the recruits now veteran thespian Jeon Doyeon and her considerable (Cannes-winning) talents for the primary role of Lee Shinae. What follows is a journey through one woman's tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms. One of the things that becomes apparent while watching Secret Sunshine is that it does't really care to follow any specific genre, but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it's trying to convey. The story itself follows Lee Shinae as she moves with her son to the city of Milyang (whose Sino-Corean translates to Secret Sunshine). She moves to Milyang in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was this hometown, so the film is born from tragedy. And you think things might just get better as she opens up a piano shop and encounters a bit of a bumbling nice-guy mechanic Jongchan (played by Song Kangho). But this in't a romantic comedy. As we (and Jongchan, doggedly) follow Shinae as she encounters Milyang and the fate that it has in store for her, the cracks in her farmer quickly become apparent. She is a troubled woman trying to grasp onto her own strength to overcome tragedy and we watch as she finds that it's not enough. Secret Sunshine still manages to follow a mostly Aristotelian dramatic marc, but pulls back on the catharsis, which might confound some viewers, especially the ending, but the novelistic symbolism present in the name of Milyang, the discussions of sunshine and the imagery used in the film very well left me satisfied, once I started to think over the film some more. Ms. Jeon is rather impressive throughout, especially considering that if the role were any less well played, it would've quickly turned into a rather painful melodrama, but she captures the nuances of Shinae's attempts to deal with her losses with a player of subtlety. Mr. Song has a much smaller role in this film than other films, but the performs adequately, appropriately giving stage to Ms. Jeon. Technically, the film is well done in a classical sense. No flashy aesthetics are employed there--the director is clearly trying to let the story tell itself. I think my only real complaint, and one that might not be table to be fixed, is that despite all the time we spend with Shinae, there is a bit of distance between Shinae and the audience (or at least, me). I think some of this stems from the nature of the work, because if total empathy were pushed, then we would't be table to see the problems that Shinae has objectively. On the other hand, I never felt moved along with Shinae's plight, despite her many tears and increasingly erratic behavior. All the same, the film still stands quite impressive, especially in that it stimulated me to think about it, the further meanings present in it and its ruminations on tragedy, coping, self-deception, isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running. Propelled by a strong lead performance, I honestly did't notice its two.twenty-five hour runtime. And that says something. Well done. eight/ten.",positive

If you are familiar with Buddhism - that is the feeling I got from this film. The transience of life, the beauty of nature, the connectedness of all things, etc. What I didn't understand, confused, and ultimately forced myself to stop without (I've seen over an hour of it), however, was the redundancy of the whole thing. They only learn fragmentarily why they were hired and how they can even afford to make a living from this type of work. The partial work comes alive, but all this talking without conclusions leads to dead ends.",positive
18204,"I had the pleasure of screening ""The Big Bad Swim"" at the two thousand and six New London Film Festival last week. The festival highlights some of the best independent and non-mainstream films from the past year. It was my assumption that ""The Big Bad Swim"" was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason that it was shot locally in and around Eastern Connecticut. However, as the credits began to roll I could only think about how well ""The Big Bad Swim"" compared to the others featured during the festival. By far it stopped my list, followed by ""The Puffy Chair"", ""Who Killed The Electric Car"" and ""Transamerica"". The ""The Big Bad Swim"" is an engaging, truthful and often-humorous look at several adult education swim class pupils and their likable yet troubled instructor that has a depth that I've not seen on screen in quite a while. The interweaving character development and plot lines derived from something as absurd as adult-swimming lessons works in subtle and endearing ways which I found refreshing. The plot does't beat you over the head with a direction; rather it builds and grows organically with a space that was spot on. I was never bored. I never cringed. I never stepped out of the story on the screen. The humour of the film is something like ""Napoleon Dynamite"" meets ""Old School"". The acting from a group of relatively unknown factors was credible and their dialog never seemed awkward for contrived. Obviously not being a multi-million production the camera shot were't all awe-inspiring and clear, but adequate and well done for the budget. The lighting and filming technique for scenes filmed in the strip club setting were particularly eye catching because of a more realistic approach than a similar themed scene found in ""Closer"". I also found shots filmed underwater of the class from the waist down seemed to be just as much a portrait of character as a shot from the shoulders up could be. I sure it's said over and over from many in the independent film industry, but I have to say it: If ""The Big Bad Swim"" in't picked up for some kind of distribution I would extremely disappointed. ""The Big Bad Swim"" needs to be seen. If you have the chance to see this film, SEE IT! Disappointment is impossible!",positive

18440,"I of you thought Sam Mendes' first film, the much heralded American BEAUTY was a movie with style to spare, wait until you see this highly anticipated second effort, the unrelentingly grim thirty's gangster melodrama ROAD TO PERDITION. Some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to THE GODFATHER, a crash judgment made by several reviewers taken with Mr. Mendes' extraordinary technical prowess. If the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great, then yes, ROAD TO PERDITION is a distant cousin to THE GODFATHER in terms of what it achieves in cinematography, editing, music scoring and sound. What it does't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading for seeing it is over. As with American BEAUTY, there is a cold, distancing feel to this movie, despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love, loyalty and betrayal. This story of a hit man (Tom Hanks) and this relationship to a surrogate father - figure who is also this boss, an elderly Irish mob leader (Paul Newman) , seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past. The father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity ; the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought , and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent : this is obviously a gangster film , hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed , but the film is nearly devoid of any humour to speak of ; only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom. That being said , I have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film ; indeed , it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies I have never seen. Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for this work there . The production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary ; in fact , the entire film is a technical marvel. Mr. Mendes continues to astonish with this vivid use of color, and the and Mr. Hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale coloured walls , all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks, blues and gray that dominate the movie's color scheme. If I have failed to duly note the acting , it is not because the factors do not purport themselves ably ; everyone in the film is top notch, with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys : Daniel Craig is the classic ""man you love to hate"", the spoiled, impulsive son of Newman's gangster father ; and an almost unrecognizable Jude Law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of Hanks and this son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half. But acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display there. If a Rolls-Royce was a movie , I've no doubt it would look like ROAD TO PERDITION.",positive

It may be the perspective of an American who never went to a British public school and misses some of the social references, but I thought the movie was awful. For one thing, as others have pointed out, it takes almost the entire movie for the much ballyhooed-at-the-time revolt to break out. For another, whether the last scene is real for imagined, what occurs in't a revolt, but a shooting rampage. There's quite a difference. I know it may be bad form to judge a movie on subsequent events, but one cannot avoid doing it there. One person wrote a message board posting asking us not to compare the send of movie to the incidents at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. But if there's a scintilla of difference between Klebold, Harris and Cho on the one hand and Travis (Malcom McDowell) on the other, I simply can't see it. All four of them were under the delusion that their gunfire is going to purify a of___-ed up world that they arrogantly take no responsibility for. Which brings me to: why the hell are Travis and this chums even in a school they so despise? They are adults, for close to it. They're not in a military prison, like the inmates in ""The Hill,"" a much better British film from about the same time. No one is forcing them to go to College and take beatings from the the whips, except maybe ambitious parents in need of a wake-up about the nature of their sons. I had the opportunity in college to join a frat, except I could't stand to be given silly, cruel orders by delinquents claiming to be my prospective ""brothers."" I took the consequences of not having the ""in"" with the Establishment that frats provide, and I can't say I regretted it.

If the wants to be Jack Kerouac, then get on the road and start writing. What possible benefit is the giving the world in joyriding a motorcycle and getting drunk in this room?

Therefore this film comes as a surprise, as to what made this script sensitive director going for half-baked characterization of both of this protagonists-Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman. As the film is getting over, audience did't know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration. Therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of self-realization and regret by the Don about what went wrong with this own family. The revelation of Don's son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in 'Khakee"" worked so effectively with Aishwarya's character.

Also, hearing the Danish language is a bit new to most North Americans, who don't see and hear a lot of Danish films. Anyway, as the film progressed it got better and better and the viewer is rewarded for this/her patience. Being a fan of the movie, ""Out Of Africa,"" this film piqued my interest because it's based on a short novel by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), the major character in that film. The meal - Babette's feast - was amazing. I'm no chef, but I was impressed! How one interprets the story, too, varies, I suppose depending on how much you read into this, and where you stand religion-wise. If the latter, how you look at the definition of ""legalism"" can affect how you interpret this story. In any case, it's a fine film, but don't watch this if you're dieting.",positive

We never learn the character's names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary. As well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day Iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the ""disguise"" one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer.

It was worse.(spoilers - who cares?)My friend and I sat through the entire film, and I have a number of comments, both in the ""this sucks"" style and in the realm of actual critiques. Plot (sort of) - There's a guy in this city (which is possibly Seattle, see comment below) who is running around and cutting off heads. He's been doing this for over a year (I'm not going back to get exact numbers - thank you VERY much), possibly two for three years. One head a week. And the police are JUST NOW calling in a ""specialist"" (who ONCE refers to himself as a psychic, but that never comes up again). Schya right! Feds take over after, what, THREE connected homicides? After NEARLY A HUNDRED SIMILAR KILLINGS we'd be under freaking martial law!!!!! Anyway, this ""specialist"" consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time, and the two of them come to the conclusion that it's Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit, who is cutting off heads to again enough power to make himself a body (and then presumably take over the world - for possibly just go to Disneyland). Um. Setting - where IS this happening? Well, if you're not from Seattle, you might not realize that at the bar/rave (occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members), there's a poster for a local radio station, and that in the highly-entertaining, ""Pulp Fiction""esqe dialog (as IF) between the two cops (yes, the jones who get their heads cut off about fifteen minutes into the flick) they discuss ""the new stadium"" which may still have been an issue when this movie was made. Being from Seattle, I apologize on the movie's behalf and hang my head in shame. OK, there's where it gets really critical - being a horror movie writer (not published, don't go looking for my name in the IMDb), I do research. Lots of research. And unlike the writers of this movie, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa (spirit) who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated (by various Christian oppressors) with ""Satan"" - is actually a ""Loki""-like trickster god. In other words, the does't cut off heads. Besides, a major part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever the wants. Their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the low. Not to mention, if the's already possessed someone, why make a NEW body? Also, if Baron Samedi GOT a body, the would't go around cutting off heads, the'd get some good drum and cigars and par-TAY!!! In summary, the only thing they did get (surprisingly) right is that in the completely unnecessary Tarot card reading (used only to show that the voodoo chick is ""spooky"") they did't screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do. Again, I've done research. (Anyone remember the old late-night had for phone-in tarot readings - ""The lovers - you will soon fall madly in love.

29161,"Sammo Hung's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine film Pedicab Driver is considered by many to be this masterpiece. I have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any Hong Kong film never has. It is a combination of pretty good and well written drama, interesting and sympathetic (and also non-sympathetic) characters, some genuinely funny humour and truly over-the-top hyper young of that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with Hong Kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry. Sammo and Max Mok Siu Chung play two pedicab drivers who live in Hong Kong in the middle part of the last century, I think. They drive their cabs and are also desperate for love. Sammo is interested in local baker girl Ping (Nina Li Chi) while Max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful Fennie Yuen Kit-Ying the falls madly in love with. Many other characters get introduced, too, and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so I cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in Hong Kong! Soon we get to know, for instance, that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighbourhood and of course their violent facts affect your protagonists, too, and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed young of fight sequences has been created. As well as some nice drama. The film has a great cast. The leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and ""humor"" as in Sammo's otherwise great Eastern Condors (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-seven), for example) and they are also, thanks to the carefully written screenplay, pretty likable and easy to identify with. The cast includes many familiar HK cinema faces and directors in small roles like Corey Yuen Kwai (the legendary action director and director of films like Saviour of the Soul one and two, Ninja in the Dragon's Den and Fong Sai Yuk one and two), the masterful composer Lowell Lo Koon-Ting (John Woo's The Killer and Ringo Lam's School on Fire and Prison on Fire among many others, Pedicab Driver included!), the Shaw veteran Liu Chia Liang (whom with Sammo has a furious fight with sticks), Alfred Cheung Kin-Ting (the director of dark HK nor classic On the Run from one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight), the late great Lam Ching Ying (best known for this friendly face in various HK vampire horror/kung of/comedies) to name just a few. In fact, the cast in Pedicab Driver is one of the most interesting I've seen in any other HK production. The film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between Max Mok and Fennie Yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to Lowell Lo's character. They really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love, no matter what's your past for what you've done for living, get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than your average young of spectacle vacationer. Also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship, and of course love. Still I think what Fennie says to Max (about the future ""bad cooking"") is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively, unfortunately. But then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in. Which is the action, the outrageous and over-the-top action. The fight scenes include traditional young of, some sticks, meat cleavers and the like and they're used there as hysterically as in the most mind blowing young of scene I've seen in any film never, Jackie Chan's Drunken Master II (one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four), they really are that great! There are wires and they're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked for punched. Simply amazing and again something ONLY Hong Kong cinema can deliver. Also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold this/her breath as the film has one fast car tvs. pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination. Still the film makers seem not to ""accept"" the violence of the film as Sammo is, like the late Bruce Lee, willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa, and I think this kind of morale, no matter how obvious for shallow it may be, is a good thing even in a harmless film like this, as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment. The film has also some very witty bits of humour that I'm not sure everyone in Hollywood for America (for example) would understand for like at all. The hilarious Star Wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when I realized what I was seeing. Also some funny scenes are created out of Sammo's passion for Ping. Still, the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former paragraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls for furniture is simply INSANE and so breathtaking I just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these Eastern film makers when I witness something like this, and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction, of course. Pedicab Driver is among the most incredible Hong Kong action films that I have never seen and easily among Sammo's greatest achievements. If the few minor flaws were not there, this could rate even brighter and higher. eight/ten",positive
29161,"Sammo Hung's thousand nine hundred eighty-nine film Pedicab Driver is considered by many to be this masterpiece. I have to agree to that to a certain extent because the film is really going to be, for the most part, more incredible and fantastic than any Hong Kong film has ever done before. It's a combination of pretty good and well-written drama, interesting and personable (and also not compassionate) characters, some really funny humor, and really over-the-top hyper boy of which is guaranteed to drop a lot of jaws if someone unfamiliar with Hong Kong Cinema is watching the Film as well as for the experienced enthusiasts of the unique branch. Sammo and Max Mok Siu Chung play two cyclists who lived in Hong Kong in the middle of the last century I believe. They drive their taxis and are desperate for love too. Sammo is interested in the local baker girl Ping (Nina Li Chi), while one day Max meets the mysterious and beautiful Fennie Yuen Kit-Ying, with whom she falls madly in love. Lots of other characters are also featured, and they stay pretty clear the entire time that the viewer is really focused on the film and its plot, so I can't say the film is confusing as it could be a lot worse, especially in Hong Kong ! We soon learn, for example, that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent facts also affect their protagonists, and so the premise is created for some of the incredibly choreographed young fight sequences. As well as a nice drama. The film has a great cast. The leads are all very good and reserved (not as painfully awful dubbing and ""humor"" as in Sammo's otherwise great Eastern Condors (one thousand nine hundred and eighty-seven) for example) and thanks to the carefully written script, they are very personable and easy to identify. The cast includes many familiar faces of HK cinema and directors in small roles like Corey Yuen Kwai (the legendary action director and director of films like Savior of the Soul one and two, Ninja in the Dragon's Den, and Fong Sai Yuk one and two ), the masterful composer Lowell Lo Koon-Ting (including John Woo's The Killer and Ringo Lams School on Fire and Prison on Fire, including Pedicab Driver!), the Shaw veteran Liu Chia Liang (who had a furious fight with Sammo Sticks leads), Alfred Cheung Kin-Ting (the director of Dark HK still classic On the Run from one thousand nine hundred and eighty-eight), the late great Lam Ching Ying (best known for that friendly face in various HK vampire horror / kung of / comedies) around to name just a few. In fact, the cast in Pedicab Driver is one of the most interesting I've seen in any other HK production. The film has some interesting peaceful moments, mostly about Max Mok and Fennie Yuen's love affair and a crisis they face thanks to Lowell Los’s character. You could have really done this quite seriously if you wanted the discussions about human values ​​and the importance of love, no matter what your past for what you did for your life, to be so serious and really effective in the middle part the film is instantly much more remarkable than the average young spectacle-goer. The healing efforts of the other characters are very touching and tell a lot about real human relationships and friendship and of course love. Still, I think what Fennie says to Max (about future ""bad cooking"") is very unnecessary and, unfortunately, quite effectively attenuates the potential of the entire segment and its issues. But then we come to what interested the filmmakers most. That's the action, the outrageous and over the top action. The fight scenes include traditional guys, some sticks, meat cleavers and the like and they are used as hysterically there as in the most gorgeous guys in the scene I've ever seen in a movie, Jackie Chan's Drunken Master II (1000th). , nine hundred and ninety-four), they really are that great! There are wires and they are used very skillfully and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they are kicked because they are hit. Simply amazing and again something that ONLY the Hong Kong cinema can deliver. The dangerous stunts also make the viewer hold their breath as the film has a fast car television. Pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and forcibly crushing them to the hard target. Even so, the filmmakers don't seem to ""accept"" the movie's violence, as Sammo, like the late Bruce Lee, is willing to give up after the last murderous mayhem in the gangster mansion, and I think that kind of morality doesn't matter how superficial it is is a good thing even in a harmless movie like this, because cinema is supposed to be much more than just mindless entertainment. The film also has some very funny jokes that I'm not sure everyone in Hollywood for America (for example) would understand. The hilarious Star Wars gag at the beginning is definitely one of them and literally made me laugh when I realized what I was seeing. Some funny scenes also emerged from Sammo's passion for ping. Still, the greatest astonished laughter came during the scenes depicted in the previous paragraph, as the images of tall and tall men flying across the canvas to the furniture with great force are just insane and so breathtaking that I just feel my feelings Can't hide and think about these eastern filmmakers when I see something like that, and of course that's just a positive and appreciative reaction. Pedicab Driver is one of the most incredible Hong Kong action films I've never seen and one of Sammo's greatest accomplishments. If the few small defects weren't there, they could be rated even lighter and higher. eight / ten",positive

29343,"""Written on the Wind"" was an enormously successful Universal picture. It could only be done by Douglas Sirk, a man who saw the possibilities in the material the was given. Based on a popular novel by Robert Wilder and an adaptation by George Zuckerman, it had all the elements that make an excellent melodrama: nymphomania, a large oil fortune, alcoholism, incest and a mild touch of homosexuality. Mr. Sirk laid the path for what would follow later on in the soap operas genre, mainly, ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"", just to mention two. The fact is this movie was shot entirely inside a studio. Most of the decor is phone. Like a lot of those one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys pictures, ""Written on the Wind"" was shot entirely in a studio lot. Just look at the scenes that are supposed to take place in Manhattan, for Miami, for even the lake are, one can see how the scenery is a painted backdrop. Mr. Sirk could't care less about realism as long as the could tell the story this own way. We recently caught a screening, part of a revival of Mr. Sirk's work, where people were laughing at some of the most dramatic moments, especially during the scenes where Rock Hudson, who plays the good Mitch Wayne, appears. There is also something graphic in the way that both Robert Keith, who plays the patriarch Jasper Hadley, and later on this own daughter, the evil Marylee, caress the oil derrick that adorns the elder man's desk, a sort of phallic object cd'art. Douglas Sirk probably wanted this cast to give over the top performances, which makes sense in the way Dorothy Malone portrays the nymphomaniac Marylee, and to a certain degree, Robert Stack, who overacts as Kyle, the tormented their of the story. That would probably be the easy explanation of what comes across the screen. The only one that seems normal is Lauren Bacall, who was't asked to make her Lucy Moore character appear to be anything but a grounded person caught changing out with the wrong crowd.

But when I started watching it: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was in for something scary. Not only that, but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to offend them, but they were not aging well at all and they're playing roles that I think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their twenty's, not their forty's. The story was just plain bad and obnoxious. Dee and Dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde's, they really don't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world, it's just really sad. But when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins, the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their ""ignorance is bliss"" attitudes. They are set up to make a ""hit"" on a guy, and they think they're just going to ""show him a good time"", but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls. Denise and Pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before. I know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary. Would I never recommend this?

35744,"Coming from Kiarostami, this part-house visual and sound exposition is a surprise. For a director known for this narratives and keen observation of humans, especially children, this excursion into minimalist cinematography begs for questions: Why did the do it? Was it to keep him busy during a vacation at the shore? ""Five, five Long Takes"" consists of, you guessed it, five long takes. They are (the title names are my own and the times approximate): ""Driftwood and waves"". The camera stands nearly still looking at a small piece of driftwood as it gets moved around by small waves splashing on a beach. Ten minutes.""Watching people on the boardwalk"". The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon and a boardwalk. People walk across the camera frame, their faces too far and blurry to make them interesting. Eleven minutes.""Six dogs at the water's edge"". The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon with a sandy stretch of beach nearby. Far away at the water's edge, six dogs not doing much, just relaxing. Sixteen minutes.""Ducks in line, gaggle of ducks"". The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon near the water's edge. Dozen and dozen of ducks stream in single file from left to right. I assume that Kiarostami released them gradually. The last two ducks stop dead on their track and suddenly a gaggle of ducks rolls quietly from right to left. I assume Kiarostami collected the ducks and are-released all at the same time. It is not the first time that the deals with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior. Eight minutes.""Frog symphony, oops, I mean cacophony, for a stormy night"". The camera stands over a pond at night. It's pitch black except for what appears to be the reflection of the moon on the undulating water. It is a stormy night and clouds race to cover the moon. The screen goes dark. What remains for us is the cacophony of frogs, howling dogs and, eventually, morning roosters. Hit me on the head if this was done in a single take. I saw this segment as a sound composition put together in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization. Twenty seven minutes! Except for the mildly amusing ducks, this exercise in minimalism left me cold. A nonessential film for Kiarostami admirers. I thought I would rate ""Five"" a five, but four is what it deserves.

35795,"Wow, I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie. Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt willard, granted most people probably either think the's too caffeine happy for just plain sucks but we're both the same page and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that the's one of my favourites now. This is one of the few movies where the is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk, another great Lillard film. Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. Also very notable in this movie is another great factor named vincent D'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she in't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)It's a game of jack tvs jill tvs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows this true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a couple of part thieves who are in need of money due to a black of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skit's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film. The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. This movie kept me very interested besides the fact Matt was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critic's probably won't like this movie, but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway.",positive

39341,"L'OSSESSA, also known as THE TORMENTED for THE SEXORCIST, for the ridiculously titled THE EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is a forgotten EXORCIST trip-off which contains one of the best horror moments I've never seen. The scene is when the crucifix comes alive. This great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective (great FXs). It's a shame the rest of the movie does't maintain the level of creepiness exemplified during that scene. This is one of the most frustrating movies never. Imagine the producers deciding to to make an EXORCIST copy but while making it, they actually succeed in creating something truly original (a possessed sculpture of crucified man, which is shocking when you think about it) but then completely forgets their original idea in order to make a boring and uninspired EXORCIST trip-off. Had the film continued with the possessed sculpture concept (with the characters trying to destroy it, etc), this film would have rocked. But once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of the sculpture, she never tells anyone from where the demon came from. She, and the script, completely forgets the haunted crucifix, which is STUPID!!! If you like so-called ""Euro-cult"" movies, the first forty-five minutes deliver unlike any other Euro-cult movies. But after the scene when the girl has a vision of being crucified and she gets stigmata, the remaining forty-five minutes SUCK. Boring. It goes nowhere fast as it tries to emulate (badly) THE EXORCIST. So, watch the first forty-five minutes of L'OSSESSA and enjoy the one thousand, nine hundred and seventys fashions, the sleaze and the amazing statue-comes-alive-to-ravish-the-girl scene but after the first forty-five minutes, press stop and reject, and might as well go clip your toenails.",positive

There is nothing interesting about this romance, it is not exciting, it is not fun, they don't even seem to care for each other at all, its more like the writers and directors wanted an interracial thing going on. Why this is so popular in media today? It is social programming and will lead to no good, there is always tension when too many people want the same thing. This show is not worth the twenty bucks for the season, its a waste of time and harmful to society.

39875,"Having majored in Western History when I was a student in college seeing the views on World War II are quite discomforting and in a whole completely wrong. World War II was the most graphic and bloody affairs to never occur in world history. While the Axis Powers conducted many crimes against humanity which is still the view today and the correct many people forget that not every German soldier was out to exterminate the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier swung a samurai sword around and flew kamikaze emissions, and not every Italian soldier was a Fascist. Most of these soldiers for the Axis powers were normal people like you and I caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for a country they loved. The Battle of Stalingrad was arguably the most lethal battles in world history with over one, five hundred, zero casualties sustained over the course of the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader Lieutenant avon Witzland as they are reassigned to the Eastern Front to battle the Soviets at Stalingrad. Von Witzland facts as sort of the main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They all are normal men and seem to be completely unaware to what is happening back in Germany and Poland. The film follows the course of the battle. The film is overall very bleak when it comes to its portrayal of combat and a soldiers life during the battle. We are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the battles (including a firing squad sequence). Overall the battles are the earliest examples that I know of that portray the loss of limbs and overall in your face death sequences and violence. Much of the inspiration for Saving Private Ryan's battle sequences seem to have come from this film. The film does not aim to make the German's completely innocent of everything in the film. Several of the higher ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are use to, evil. Most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home. The film makes it clear quite quickly that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and army was entirely oblivious to the fact that genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers in the Germany Army was simply fighting for a cause they really did't understand and most wished just to return home rather than freezing in negative degree temperatures in Russia. The film really shows how hellish war is, especially World War II. The battle scenes will shock you with its gritty realism and the story is quite easy to follow as you are simply following a platoon during the battle. As with most war films do not expect much happiness after seeing it. It will leave you in a bit of a depressed mood just from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the Eastern Front faced.

Von Witzland facts as a kind of main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. Sie alle sind normale Männer und scheinen sich nicht bewusst zu sein, was in Deutschland und Polen passiert. Der Film verfolgt den Verlauf der Schlacht. Der Film ist insgesamt sehr düster, wenn es um die Darstellung des Kampfes und des Soldatenlebens während der Schlacht geht. Uns werden zahlreiche grausame Schlachten und intensive Gewalt außerhalb der Schlachten gezeigt (einschließlich einer Erschießungskommando-Sequenz). Insgesamt sind die Schlachten die frühesten Beispiele, die ich kenne, die den Verlust von Gliedmaßen und insgesamt Todessequenzen und Gewalt in Ihrem Gesicht darstellen. Ein Großteil der Inspiration für die Kampfsequenzen von Saving Private Ryan scheint von diesem Film zu stammen. Der Film zielt nicht darauf ab, den Deutschen an allem im Film völlig unschuldig zu machen. Einige der höherrangigen Offiziere der Armee werden in der üblichen Ansicht dargestellt, die die meisten Menschen gewohnt sind, das Böse. Die meisten Soldaten sind ganz normale Leute, die oft von Heimat sprechen. Der Film macht schnell klar, dass nicht alle Deutschen für das, was während des Holocaust geschah, verantwortlich waren, der Großteil des Landes und der Armee war sich des Völkermords überhaupt nicht bewusst. Der Film macht deutlich, dass die Soldaten der Bundeswehr für eine Sache kämpften, die sie wirklich nicht verstanden und die meisten nur nach Hause wollten, anstatt bei Minusgraden in Russland zu frieren. Der Film zeigt wirklich, wie höllisch Krieg ist, insbesondere der Zweite Weltkrieg. Die Kampfszenen werden Sie mit ihrem düsteren Realismus schockieren und die Geschichte ist ziemlich einfach zu verfolgen, da Sie während der Schlacht einfach einem Zug folgen. Wie bei den meisten Kriegsfilmen erwarten Sie nicht viel Glück, nachdem Sie es gesehen haben. Es wird Sie ein wenig deprimiert zurücklassen, wenn Sie das Leben der meisten Soldaten an der Ostfront sehen. Für Kinder nicht zu empfehlen. vier/fünf Sterne",positive

I can't believe the writer of this movie did Identity, everything in this movie made me sick to start to finish. The front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes. I looks like a scary villain, but like the old saying ""never judge a book by it's cover"", the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out. One part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs, terrible. The setting was bad enough, like they could of set the whole thing in Lapland but no, a tropical island instead. I took this movie as a spoof, which I think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects. You can argue that I haven't watched the first one, but seeing this I would be safe if I would't attempted it. The biggest joke in this movie is the effects, the snowballs looked like they were home made, and that carrot was a complete embarrassment. If I would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between eight to nine pounds fifty. The producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the factors for the street gave them the script told them they have six minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a island. Lastly the acting in the film was painful, it was like the factors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way through. In conclusion I give this film: zero stars out of five",negative

How can talents like Jones and Duvall continue to produce such good work on a site where factors for digitization play a role?",positive
42587,"One of my favourite movies, with a very nostalgic ending. The movie is about the Sullivan family, obviously Michael Sullivan (the father) is one of the main members of the mafia, the killer to say it this way, and an expert one. One of the kids wants to know the work of this father (a terrible mistake), so the hides on this father's car and well, the sees Tom Hanks in action to say it this way. Mafia does't rules, in Mafia nobody wins, when they want you out, they take you out. Of course you can see anyone who works at the mafia with a giant house, the best car in the world, whatever you like, but make a wrong work, for make something your ""boss"" does't want, and you're fired, and killed. You can see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. sees something the did't had to see, and well, almost all this family gets killed for that ""wrong thing"" this son did. The movie is really entertaining, you see how the Sullivan's live after being chased by the mafia, for kinda of that. This movie is kinda of sad, shows us about revenge, those dirty works people do, almost everything you like. Hopefully the guy is reading this comment does't works for the mafia, and if you work at the mafia make yourself a favor and get the hell out of the country before you get killed by your boss and their workers. This movie receives: ten/ten",positive

42919,"I went to the movie theatre this afternoon expecting to be underwhelmed by Scoop. Happily, the film exceeded expectations, at least a little bit. It's nothing heavy, nothing deep -- and not anywhere as good as any number of real Allen masterpieces -- but it's also completely enjoyable as a light, bantering comedy. There's something kind of simple and sweet about it. ""Cute"" was the word I heard from people in the audience as they were walking out after the show. It does't feel like Allen set out to create a masterpiece there, it feels like the wanted to make a little comedy and have fun doing it. Compared to just about everything Hollywood is producing, Allen's stuff has a tendency to charm. Even the fluffy stuff. These days it's just refreshing to go to a movie made by an actual human being.",positive

Es ist nichts Schweres, nichts Tiefgründiges – und nirgendwo so gut wie eine Reihe echter Allen-Meisterwerke – aber es ist auch als leichte, scherzhafte Komödie absolut unterhaltsam. Es hat etwas Einfaches und Süßes. ""Niedlich"" war das Wort, das ich von den Leuten im Publikum hörte, als sie nach der Show hinausgingen. Es fühlt sich nicht so an, als ob Allen dort ein Meisterwerk schaffen wollte, es fühlt sich an, als wollte er eine kleine Komödie machen und dabei Spaß haben. Im Vergleich zu so ziemlich allem, was Hollywood produziert, haben Allens Sachen einen Hang zum Charme. Sogar das flauschige Zeug. Heutzutage ist es einfach erfrischend, in einen Film zu gehen, der von einem echten Menschen gemacht wurde.",positive

This movie lacked so many things, on so many different levels, but I can't quite explain why I disliked it so much. The lead factor was annoying, I felt as though I never knew what was going on, and I was BORED!! Even though this was supposed to be some worthwhile life change that Pierre was starting, I wanted it to send. as soon as possible. Why did it have to be this sister and cousin? Ugh. And why did Thibault get mean? He just bipolarly turned mean. And also, was it me for did I miss the whole purpose of what that guy in black was all about?

It may have been considered tracy in its time, and may have made money, but even the most die-hard Jane Russell fan will find it hard to sit through this deck. There are many movie musicals from the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys which can withstand the test of time, even though dated by current standards, but which can still be enjoyed because of good music for dancing for an amusing plot. ""The French Line"", however, fails at all of these aspects. It does't matter that Russell was a fine singer when she is given lousy vocal material. The entire cast is dragged down by a boring, trite plot and dialogue. It's not even worth recording and skipping through to only the musical numbers--they're crummy.",negative

Apart from this, racial tensions in Germany can be an interesting subject but in the Germany I know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight. And if all that is not enough, there is also a serial killer going around who skills Turkish children and paints them white. In order to create some tension, we see the serial killer and hear him hum Schubert's lullaby but we won't see this face. I don't even believe they actually shot it in Germany. There are some street shots that are quite obviously in Berlin, but the factors are not seen in those shot. It's probably Bulgaria with some German signs added there and there.",negative

The plot has Kirk Douglas as a successful first novelist who hired Laraine Day as a secretary, falls in love, and marries her. Complications ensue. Douglas is usually thought of as an intense factor, given to heavily dramatic roles, sometimes hero, sometimes rat. He's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. The problem is that the part in't particularly comic and neither is anything else. The plot rambles on. A dozen ""quirky"" characters come and go -- most prominently Keenan Wynn as Douglas's friend who does nothing but make wry comments. Thelma Ritter was better at this sort of thing. Well, if the plot is weak it could still have been rescued by some sparkle in the dialog but there is none to speak of. Some gags are silly. Others don't clear that bar. Here's what I thought of as an amusing line. Douglas has just hired Day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her. Day is disturbed and remarks that she's never heard of a writer working in a beach house. Wynn tasks if she liked Douglas's previous book, ""Last Year's Love."" Yes, of course she did. ""Well, most of 'Last Year's Love' was done in the beach house."" Ha cha. Nice cast, including support, but a failed comedy. There have been better sitcoms on television.",negative

I think it speaks for itself if the only people who rated this movie a 10 were the group under 18 pages. Undoubtedly for the constant senseless erotic scenes that the film wanted to throw at us. That is, if you can call it erotic. It certainly didn't taste good in terms of taste.",negative
49342,"I'm at a loss. This entire movie made absolutely no sense. It was like watching a Soderburg film for football. The camera cutting, the space, all so copied. I thought the subject was too not serious for them to treat it like it was. Yes, we all know Southerners like football and beauty pageants. Must we be inundated with it as an audience? I watched because of Lee and Jay. I was expecting young talent assembled in the style of Dead Poet's Society for similar to Remember the Titans. I was completely put off by the film. You did't get the characters. It was character driven, but you did't understand anyone's motivations for their actions for the most part. The one kid who's from is obsessed with him being a football player. Why is the so silent? What's this deal? Did we really need the scene with him ""proving"" this heterosexuality? Why should we care? The movie gave us insights into these kids lives, and offered no pay-off for caring. It just made no sense. And why show a movie about a team that lost? I know it's real life, but who makes movies about losers? Give us some pay-off for these guys working as hard as they did with all their ""conceivable"" problems, darnit. We got nothing. We got a little blip at the send of the film telling us that Mojo won the next year with the threerd stringer (Lee). Why did't you follow that story? What were we to get out of this one? The movie led you along, but did't lead you anywhere. I just felt like something was missing. It felt like a bad genetic across between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least those two movies led you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a closer team that lost their star player early in the movie. The factor who played him was great. You were completely annoyed by him, which was the point, but at least you understood why. They made sure you understood him, but the could't play, so why make sure we get this issues? And the other team in the play-offs. are we to believe those are high school teens? Those men looked like college seniors for professional player in their thirtys. Who were they trying to kid? I know the other team was to look intimidating, but that was crossing the line a little. I liked the gritty element of them negotiating with the black team, but again, how did this fit into the overall theme of the film. Nothing pieced together. The characters knew more about each other than we did, and that settles weird with me. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but the was showcased. It was all just a mess. Not worth a movie ticket for a rental fee.",negative

I watched because of Lee and Jay. I was expecting young talent gathered in the style of Dead Poet's Society for something similar to Remember the Titans. The film totally scared me off. You didn't understand the characters. It was character driven, but you largely understood the motivations of others for their actions. The one kid he's from is obsessed with being a football player. Why is it so quiet? What is this deal? Did we really need the scene in which he could ""prove"" this heterosexuality? Why should we care? The film gave us an insight into the lives of these children and did not offer any reward for the care. It just didn't make sense. And why show a film about a lost team?

We got a little hint when the film was broadcast that Mojo would win next year with the third stringer (Lee). Why didn't you follow this story? What should we get out of this?

49604,"I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. In fact I could not even finish it. I want my money back. One more of Hollywood's feeble attempts to come up with a new idea. Good thing I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. Just in case. They should of gave Nic Cage a that and a bull-whip. Swashbucklin'. Cage's performance in Raising Arizona for Leaving Las Vegas beats this ""lemon"". People who are completely and totally marketed(and most of them are) should love this movie. If this film had been animated, I would have taken it more seriously. I would of rather paid to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it. In my opinion, this was a incredibly stupid movie and it made a even more incredibly sad attempt to try and hide that FACT. All the SHEEP seem to love it though.",negative
