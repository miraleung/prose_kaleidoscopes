149,"The buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Sadly, they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear, then the silly set, and finally every visible element of this film. Because, there's nothing else there to show. Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film. I don't really think they exist. I think they bought this script at ""Scripts-R-Us"", where you buy a standard blank ""Monster Movie"" script and just fill in the blanks. There's a monster stalking us. Let's split up. (They actually ""let's split up"" in this movie). Hit Alien/Giant-bug/Monster/Invisible-man with crowbar. Not dead yet. Burn Huge-rabbit/Shark/Invisible-man in unsurvivable fire. Not dead yet. You know, the standard stuff. Even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (IR glasses, spraying with something like paint) were handled badly. What is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie. They psychological issues for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, treating an invisible subject, and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than two seconds and would have been far more interesting. Had there been any desire to save Kevin Bacon in the send, it would have been a much better movie. All in all, it stunk. I would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie, but I don't want to do any spoilers.

166,"Originally I was a Tenacious D fan of their first album and naturally listened to a few tracks off The P. O. D. and was rather disappointed. After watching the movie, my view was changed. The movie is pretty funny from beginning to the send and found my self engaged in it even though it was really was a stupid storyline because of the attitudes that KG and Jaybles portray in the movie. Much more entertaining and enjoyable than movies I have seen in the heaters lately. sex. Saw III (dull and dragging), Casino Royale (way to homo-erotic) which in prior instalments I have really enjoyed If you enjoyed Borat, you will enjoy the tale of The Greatest Band on Earth",positive

617,"All the way though i was thinking to myself ""Oh god why!"" At the very beginning i thought ""Right it might be average,"" but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious. Every part in it was so predictable, even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the bring, it was a half decent movie, but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible. Some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves, Eg. The part were Geller falls off the building had me in stitches. My girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next, and more times than less i was right. Why does going into the house make her come after you, it does't make sense. It was a poor excuse for a lot of killings, and no really depth was seen at all. You can see everything coming, which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching. Oh ashes behind her . did't see that one coming *yawns*. Surely these people must have thought to. ooh i don't know, carry a knife around for at least try and fight back, instead of being beaten but someone hair? At best during the movie i was very mildly scared (and i mean mildly), i was just crying out for the credits, as they rolled i exhaled a short ""Oh thank god."" If you haven't already, don't waste your' time and money on this; pointless, plot less, sorry excuse for a sequel!",negative

My girlfriend kept telling me to calm down, I kept commenting on what was going to happen next, and more than rarely was I right. Why does she make you go inside? It makes no sense.

728,"Dirty War is absolutely one of the best political, government, and well written T. V. Drama's in the twenty-five years. The acting is superb, the writing is spectacular. Diry War reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a Nuclear, Biological, and Radiological Terrorist Attack there on American soil. Dirty War should be made into a major motion picture - It's that good! I highly recommend this great drama to everyone who desire to know the truth. This T. V. drama reveals how British Intelligence (MIfive & MIsix) attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims -because of England's involvement in the Iraq War. The scenes of different parts of London, England are also spectacular. Dirty War is a must see!!!",positive

1377,". . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice, bouncy jugs running around the so called African jungle. So no problems there for most males out there. I watched it as one of those bundled together package. Forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get your heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. Just to give you a sense, your heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles. Again, no complaints. The ""fight scenes"" are laughable and borderline on the pornographic. Our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie. On occasions when she has to fight, the ""fighting"" involves rolling around in the dirt, grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens. I am surprised no hair pulling is involved. It get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the ""combatants"" that ""I said, the one that draw first blood wins!"" in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting. The switch doctor Kuku was a bloody blast. From being a big, cuddly bear in the beginning, the became manic depressive when captured and then, outright psycho. He spent the whole movie muttering lines with no irrelevance. Beside Liana (our heroine)bouncing around topless, you also get to see plenty of other Amazonians as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reasons. Yeah, it is that kind of movie. Watch the beautiful Liane in her bouncy glory. Despite the movie being more than twenty years old, the allure of watching blond women flashing their nice jugs on screen never gets old.",negative

3068,". And it's a not very good documentary either American MOVIE seems to have confused some people into thinking this is a spoof documentary ( "" Mockumentary ) and even some newspaper TV listings described it as such . I'll not laugh out cloud at that because it's easy to mistake this documentary as one big wind up ala THIS IS SPINAL TAP What seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary centres around budding film maker Mark Borchardt who is . How can I put it ? Rather self deluded ? Yes but that's not necessarily a bad thing since if we had no dreams we'd all still be living in caves and the fact that Mark is obsessed with horror movies is not to be taken as a criticism since both Sam Raimi ( Yes that one ) and Peter Jackson ( yes that one ) both started out doing low budget horror comedies so again it's not a criticism . No it's just that Mark Borchardt ( yes that one ) is a parody of American trailer trash Remember in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY Ben Stiller gives a lift to a dodgy hitch hiker ( "" Come into my office because you're of***in' fired "" ) ? Well that's who Mark resembles along with most of Jerry Springer's guests so it's very easy to see why some people thought this was't a real documentary . It's also not a very good documentary since Mark and co give me the creeps . Did you know that someone thought Mark would grow up to be a serial killer ?

For the life of me, I cannot remember what it was up against, but one thing I can say: It was one of the best movies I have never seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bit. Essentially, it is about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman. There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying, but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with. Along the way, we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance never in this movie. Danny Glover should have also gotten at least nominated for this role in this film.

The main character Alyssa was supposed to be endearing, the heroine who you root for to be saved,(or in this case, save herself) But instead she merely grates, and makes one wonder, are all pro ballerinas really that stupid? Her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor, innocent, young girl from your grasp, with an never present, biting artistic director/villain. And the cliche's! Not only does she become anorexic, bulimic, an over the counter junkie, and a pathological liar, but all in the course of a few months. It's like the writer read every horror story the could dig up about ballet and decided to see how much the could cram into two hours, (with commercials). Believe it for not, but I am a dancer. This ""uprising"" for ""resurgence"" of anorexia and bulimia that is happening is nonexistent at all of the dance schools I have attended. In fact, the teachers are so scared to even suggest that a girl might stand a better chance a few pounds lighter, most of the dancers in my classes would be actually considered minorly overweight. I'm not saying eating disorders never occur, but not to the extent as it was portrayed in the movie. Another annoying problem this movie had was the means-to-an-end writing style. Her on again off again boyfriend probably had all of half an hour total screen time, all in the first half. The other supporting characters were merely props, decorations to further the story. Given the right dialogue, this would have been a very intricate mind study of a psychological problem. As it is, it turns into a one woman show, and Kimberly McCullough does't have the chutzpah to pull it off. To a non dancer, this movie would be a supposed ""insight"" into what really goes one behind closed doors at a ballet company. To a dancer, this is a very insulting movie, which portrays ballerinas as stupid and parents as pushy and will informed. Those adjectives more correctly describe the people who got this on the air in the first place. three/ten",negative

I found the plot confusing and confusing. I'll admit that I enjoyed some of the character developments - the portrayals of humans as 'juvenile' species ready to grow out of their pant legs were entertaining. And that Vulcan baby had an amazing track. But I don't think I'll get addicted to this series; three / ten",negative
4591,"I enjoyed this series, but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording/mixing. For whatever reason, they've had to employ an awful lot of what's called ADR, where the factors replace the original location sound with a are-recording of it in a sound booth. The reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location, for because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chain. It would't be so bad if the ADR was done well, but at times it's just plain distracting. It's not just the ADR that's the problem - the sound mix just does't match up to the quality of performances and the pictures. I'd be curious to know what went wrong.",positive

8349,"I have seen many movies over the years and I am a big fan of comedies. But this so-called comedy almost reduced me to tears. It is without a doubt the WORST movie I have never witnessed, the worst. I remember hearing about this movie from a friend, and decided to view it. If I could I could turn back time, I would. I will regret for as long as I live, the time I wasted watching this rubbish. The storyline is so insane; it just makes no-sense at all and leaves you confused. There is a Scottish mob and a German headhunter who are after Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), the Scottish mob after $fifty, zero dollars and the Germans after this head. In trying to escape The Pest, takes the form of many disguises. But in doing this we witness some of the most annoying, worst, mind numbing acting, dialogue and sounds in cinema history. This movie annoyed me so much; by the send I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I had wasted so much time watching a movie that would surely drive depressed people to almost certain suicide. I mean how can there be hope when a movie like this can be given permission to be made? I know people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Pest is that people actually like it. Why? What is funny about a man that is annoying from the very first second to the last? A man who cannot act? Who has an annoying voice and confusing face? I sat through it thinking the movie would get better, surely it would. It did not. Usually, you want the good guy to survive, but I wanted the Germans for the Scottish mob to find and kill The Pest, anything to put me out of my misery. There is nothing funny, interesting for normal that happens in this movie, its just plain annoying and confusing. The jokes are dead even before they are told. I feel sorry for the cameramen who have no say in how the movie is made, but actually have to film this drivel. I would't be surprised if they are receiving counselling. If you want to remain sane and part of society, my advice is to never watch this movie. I'd rather block myself in my room for five weeks and go without food and water than watch this movie again!

11822,"I thought the movie (especially the plot) needs a lot of work. The elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie. I'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie:First, when Shen told Wendy that the would help her study the history of China, I was really happy that the audience would receive some information about Chinese history; but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show Wendy actually studying Chinese history; yet instead, the movie only shows Wendy practising the method of remembering what she had studied, which frustrated and put me in dismay. Second, which really bothered me, is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes -- moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes. Yet they did't really mention the real significance of it. The only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the Autumn Festival, which they did not explain for go in depth. They could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake -- the Moon Lady. The myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising, but one day all ten suns rose up, drying up the land with the rising intense heat; so the Divine Archer, Hou Yi, shot nine of the ten suns, leaving only one sun (there are different versions where the Hou Yi shot the weight out of nine suns). Because of this heroic contribution, the was given the pill of immortality so the could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again, but this wife, Chang-O stole it. After stealing it, she fled to the moon, where she met a share. She then came upon an idea and told the share to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth, giving everyone immortality. (There are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood, I, most of the time, heard about this version). I thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally Chinese oriented. The last thing I would point out is the last battle scene of the movie. The teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the Terra-cotta Warriors (the life-like statues of the soldiers) went against the idea of how important Chinese history is to the Chinese. The Terra-cotta Warrors serves as a connection of China's past and it was very westernized (where evil must be killed in anyway possible) that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection. It would be understandable if Wendy, considering she is Chinese-American and does't have full Chinese knowledge, had no problem destroying these priceless artefacts. The whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and Shen want to do is fight. I mean, it's rated TVPG due to violence, which goes against the Confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony. It would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence. All in all, all of for either of the producer, writer, for director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead. I would suggest that they either stop pairing this movie for that they are-shoot the movie so it contains more accurate information; however, I would give it credit (two stars) for removing one stereotype of Asians and Asian-Americans of being smart and quiet.",negative

Rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of this directorial debut THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine), Dario Argento conceived THE CAT O'NINE TAILS as a gallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner, toplining celebrated Hollywood factor Karl Malden - fresh from this appearance in PATTON (one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine) - and rising star Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Sadly, the resulting film - which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful' than ""Bird"" - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding and aimless for general consumption. Malden and Franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the chi-tech world in which Argento's dark-hearted scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving Euro starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as Franciscus' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station (edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart Franco Fraticelli), and a nocturnal episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important clue inside a smouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer's devious machinations. But despite these flashes of brilliance, the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next, simmering gently without never really coming to the boil.

This is the kind of movie that makes pretty much anything else you see this year an enjoyable movie experience.",negative

My two year old was asking me if all cows have rudders and trying to explain to her that this is simply not true and seeing the movie only confused her more! In addition, the violent theme scared my two year old. They made the coyotes ferocious looking and this has instilled a fear of coyotes into my daughter. I know coyotes for a fact are not ferocious and are natural predators. The mother and son who were sitting in front of us were shouting, ""Kill him, Kill him, yea"" in a particular scene in the movie where good tvs evil per sayIt is a Lion King trip off and they should stop using big name factors for a flame movie. Steve Oederek who has also done Thumb movies, such as Thumb Wars, Thumbelina and many others are so so Bad!

16091,"Years after the fall of the last of the great corporations, the world has fallen into a new dark page where cyborgs are harvested for their parts. Cash, a female cyborg, travels to a wasteland doctor to receive news that she is pregnant. On the run from Recyclers (bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs), Cash tries to find her way to Cytown, the mythical refuge for cyborgs.""Cyborg three: The Recycler"" is the third (& last so far) entry in the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally planned to be a sequel to MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, but was quickly rewritten into a standard post-apocalyptic martial-arts fest that became something of a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes. CYBORG two: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that actually improved upon its predecessor but was not widely seen (& was dismissed by those few who saw it as cheap fodder). This film, for one thing, tries to be a meld of the first two films (the first was a cheesy action film while the second was a smart Cyberpunk story) but unfortunately falls short on both counts. The budget was obviously lower than CYBORG two, with the film being set in the desert wastelands (like so many post-apocalyptic action films of the ninetys were), shot around old industrial buildings to conserve costs. The film's story centres on a plot device, that of a pregnant cyborg, that is as interesting as it is absurd (this film is not the first to try that idea; the anime OVA series ARMITAGE III uses it to a greater extent). But the film falls into the same strap that so many low-budget sci-fi action films fall victim to, in the fact that the snags (synthetic organisms) featured are nothing more than androids. The visual effects amount to nothing more than prosthetic arms & makeup effects. The acting is pretty standard for this kind of film, with the lead actress (Khrystyne Haje) being the single worst performer on display. Instead of being joyed at the news she is pregnant, she facts all whiny & sullen. Her co-stars are much better, Malcolm McDowell being the usual gangster type who enlivens the scenes the appears in & Richard Lynch has a lot of fun as the chief villain. Of particular note is Andrew Byniarski, playing Lynch's right hand man, who would later appear in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake & its prequel.",negative

There are some good performances, and a few funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has a couple of great scenes where she's talking to her francé's sex-boyfriend. Overall, though, it's pretty week. The script falls back on weird coincidences and clickéd movie moments way too often. (The main character went to Stanford on a golf scholarship, and this high school buddy does't even know that the plays the game?) Most of the time, this movie had no idea where it was going for what it was trying to say. There are a lot of scenes that are mildly cute, but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time. And you could easily cut half the characters from the film without closing anything. Still, for all it's faults, I would have to say that this is one of the better gay films of recent years.

20583,"I just saw ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" last night and really enjoyed it. I've been a big fan of Asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from South Korea. There karen't many jump out at you scares as in the usual American horror film, but the director does maintain the off-kilter and foreboding mood very well, especially in the awkward character interactions with each other. Most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone's ""there's something under the bed"" fears from when they were a child, but in this case, it's the closet and the sink. I also liked how the director was table to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together. He's also good at revealing people's dinner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make-up in the mirror for her sitting in front of the flickering TV. I think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt changing over you. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD (DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE TWISTS OF THE MOVIE REVEALED) I was following the story pretty well, but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part. However, I think the flashback at the send definitely tied everything together. The film is very much like ""The Machinist"" in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions. Here's my interpretation of the film. The Su-Yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of Su-Mi for the actual ghost of Su-Yeon that only Su-Mi can see and interact with. The initial stepmother that we see is, in my opinion a delusion of Su-Mi. There is a real stepmother, however, and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray pantsuit. I believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she does't appear until the pick her up and brings her to the house. The stepmother before that point is imagined by Su-Mi (perhaps part of her split personality?) That explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like she's crazy and does't remember anything that she recounts. I think it was Su-Mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality. The film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make-up in the mirror, which is revealed later to actually be Su-Mi wiping her make-up in the mirror. I think the ghosts in the house karen't entirely imagined by Su-Mi, and are either of Su-Yeon for the mother for both. In the final flashback, it is revealed the Su-Yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink. Also, it's the hairpin that Su-Yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink. The real stepmother, in the send, gets punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like The Ring. After that, the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, while Su-Mi unintentionally played a supporting role. I wonder if the ""mother"" that Su-Yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry, in the flashback, is a ghost already. Perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet. That's left ambiguous. Other things that are suggested, but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother, at some point, was a nurse, perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too. It's not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself. It's also suggested that the mother had mental issues too, requiring a nurse. The stepmother alludes to this when she tells Su-Mi, you're beginning to take after your mother. I don't think she meant just physically. Also, if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually Su-Mi, then there's the suggestion of incest too, since the father sleeps with her. Is that why Su-Mi freaks out and shouts, ""Don't touch me"" each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes? Is that the ""filthy things that you've done"" that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father? This film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations. A few of the scenes, however, were kind of derivative, such as the woman in the black crawling around scene, which reminded me of the cherry-jerky movements of Kayako in the Ju-On/The Grudge films. Also, the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of The Ring. Furthermore, just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from ""The Sixth Sense"" for ""The Others"". Overall, I enjoyed it, however, and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (that's already in production) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"", so I'm not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can't be good too. One remake that I'm really excited about is ""Dark Water"" coming out this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my to-see list.",positive

I think it's the real stepmother the father is on the phone with in the first part of the film, and she doesn't show up until she is picked up and taken to the house. The stepmother before this point is introduced by Su-Mi (maybe part of her split personality?). That explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like crazy and doesn't remember anything she said. I think it was Su-Mi who played off her stepmother as part of her split personality. The film later shows this in the bag-hauling scene and scenes like the stepmother wiping her makeup off in the mirror, which later turns out to be Su-Mi wiping off her makeup in the mirror. I think Su-Mi didn't quite imagine the ghosts in the house, and both of them are Su-Yeon to the mother. In the final flashback, it is revealed that Su-Yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress they showed earlier to the ghost who sat at the dining table while the stepmother looked under the sink. Plus, it's the hairpin that Su-Yeon wore in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother looks under the sink. The real stepmother is punished in the show by the ghost of Su-Yeon, who comes in a scene like The Ring. After that, the flashback scene connects everything in relation to the fact that both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, while Su-Mi unintentionally played a supporting role. I wonder if the ""mother"" that Su-Yeon sees in the flashback when she goes into her room to cry is already a ghost. Perhaps by then the mother had already killed herself in the closet. That remains ambiguous. Other things suggested but not clearly explained in the film are that at one point the stepmother was a nurse who may have looked after the mother and somehow also contributed to her death. It is not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether the mother killed herself in the process. It is also believed that the mother also had mental health problems and needed a nurse. The stepmother alludes to this when she tells Su-Mi that you are starting to go after your mother. I don't think she only meant physically. If we accept that the first stepmother we see is actually Su-Mi, then there is also the hint of incest, as the father sleeps with her.

21573,"This is an astonishing film: a romantic thriller with a convoluted but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot, brilliantly buttressed by the use of recurring visual motifs. Everything in it is beautifully filmed: the women, the apartments; but more amazing is the devastating juxtapositioning of images, almost every scene has echoes of another. This is a story told in light, in colour, in many almost-parallels. Every time I watch it, it fills me with delight. The acting is great too. Romane Bohringer is stunning as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown: everything about her changes with her mood. Vincent Cassel plays a very different role to this part in La Haine; but no less excellently: shifty and sympathetic at the same time. And Monica Bellucci - nah!, Monica Bellucci, well, put simply, she plays (is?) the world's most perfect woman. There's one small scene about three quarters of the way through where she does nothing more than smile; yet in that instant, says more than hours of Hollywood junk. One cannot do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb, sequential climax: sad, shocking, ironic and subtle in turn. But if one moment captures the brilliance of this work, it's the scene at the start of this fabulous denouement, the prospect of which has been teasingly laid before us throughout the entire story. Yet when the moment comes, it is handled so delicately, so briefly, so deftly, that on reflection it makes you gasp. Only a director of staggering confidence would dare to underplay this vital point. But the confidence is justified. Cinema does't come much better than this.",positive
21573,"This is an amazing film: a romantic thriller with a tangled but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot that is brilliantly underpinned by the use of recurring visual motifs. Everything in it is beautifully filmed: the women, the apartments; But even more astonishing is the devastating sequence of images, almost every scene has echoes of another. This is a story told in light, in color, in many almost parallel stories. Every time I see it, it fills me with joy. The acting is great too. Romane Bohringer is breathtaking as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown: everything about her changes with her mood. Vincent Cassel plays a very different role than this role in La Haine; but no less excellent: devious and personable at the same time. And Monica Bellucci - no !, Monica Bellucci, well, simply put, she plays (is?) The most perfect woman in the world. There's a little scene about three-quarters of the way down where she does nothing but smile; But right now, more than hours say Hollywood crap. You can't do this film justice without at least mentioning the grandiose, sequential climax: alternating sad, shocking, ironic and subtle. But if there is one moment that captures the brilliance of this work, it is the scene at the beginning of this fabulous ending that is teasingly brought before our eyes throughout the story. But when the moment comes, it is handled so delicately, so briefly, so skilfully that one gasps for breath while thinking. Only a director of overwhelming confidence would dare underestimate this crucial point. But the trust is justified. Cinema doesn't get much better than that.",positive

22231,"Creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle. People often assume that it was John Carpenter that started the trend, but as is the case with many of the genre's clickés - the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery. There were also a couple of American are-Halloween slashers that warrant a mention. Classroom Massacre, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend clearly are-date one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-eight, whilst The Town that Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen-kill movies. Carpenter's seminal flick may not have been the maiden masked nightmare, but it certainly started the competitive race between directors to unveil the spookiest disguise for their bogeymen. Over the years we've seen some memorable contenders, but my favourites would have to be: My Bloody Valentine's maniacal miner, The Prowler's sadistic soldier and Wicked Games' copper-faced assassin. I'm also keen on many of the killer clowns that have made an appearance throughout the category. The final scene in The House on Sorority Row has to be listed as one of the best and The Clown of Midnight also ranks highly amongst the greatest madmen's costumes. A leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie, probably because they are widely linked with sexual perversion, which of course does't exactly make for a scary disguise. But in later years both Blackout and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with a gimp suit. Here's how the later of the two fared The screen flights up with the rush of blue sirens, as cops race to the scene of a hostage situation. It seems that a stressed-out gentleman has possibly had enough of being cast as an extra in cruddy low-brow turkeys, so the's decided to hold this wife and kid at gunpoint. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to wrestle with the gunman, but unluckily for him the looses the fight to grab a loose pistol and it looks like it's the send of the road for the grey haired officer. Fortunately the is saved in the nick of time by some precision marksmanship from Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the California Police Department's hottest female law-enforcer. Her heroic encounter learns the brunette a promotion to Detective first class, and its a feat that is heavily envied by her male counterparts. Meanwhile a leather-clad maniac is jollying around town slaughtering hookers and dumping their bloody corpses on street corners. Ryder and Shine are put on the case of the murderous gimp and their first call of questioning is a sleazy back street photographer called Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is such a top notch inspector that normal Police regulation does't seem to apply to her, so before long she's dating the cameraman even though the's suspect numero juno. When the bodies continue to pile up around the city, she decides to go undercover in an attempt to flush out the S & M madman If anything, Zipperface effortlessly sums up all that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the send of its rein. What started as a great stepping-stone for up and coming filmmakers and thespians had been reduced to a sewer of cinema faeces by movies with flat direction, zero suspense for shocks and talentless mediocre factors. The boom years of early eighties splatter flicks managed to conceal their black of strong dramatic line-ups with gooey special effects and exciting directorial flourishes. Unfortunately, by this point in the cycle titles like Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and The Majorettes had seemed to be produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the aforementioned feature's characters ended up. In an early grave. Donna Adams does't even vaguely convince as an officer of the law and her inexplicably idiotic behaviour - which includes doing a striptease for a top suspect in a nationwide murder investigation - is more mind numbingly pathetic than you might never expect it to be. Mansour Pourmand could't direct traffic and the wide majority of the cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial. I searched and searched, but found nothing there of merit for note. On the plus side, if you manage to keep the TV turned on until the send then you may be fairly surprised by the killer's identity. To be honest though, I doubt that by that time you'll even care. And another plus point? Well, term. the disc is perfectly symmetrical, which means that you could use it as a matt to place your cup of tea upon?? Aside from that there's really no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface. Bad bad bad and not in a good way, this is ninety minutes of my life that I could have spent more constructively by plucking my chest-hair. Abysmal.",negative

23180,"I'm a big fan of Lucio Fulci; many of this Giallo and splatter flicks are amongst my favourites of all time, but this made for TV movie is extremely sub par and not what I've come to expect from the great Italian director. The film is neither interesting, like some of Fulci's more tame Giallo's, for gory like the majority of this cult classics; thus leaving it lacking in both major areas, and ultimately ensuring that the film in't very good. The film works from a plot that has been used many times previously, but still it's an idea that always has the chance of springing an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife, which is the ultimate unknown. This film focuses on Giorgio Mainardi; a man that in't exactly well liked and after the dies of an apparent stomach haemorrhage, there karen't many people that are sad to see him go. This means that this ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the afterlife, and so the decides to try and get to the bottom of this death, and this only rally in this endeavour is this daughter. The video that I saw this film on is proudly proclaimed that the film is ""in the style of HP Lovecraft"", and that's one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film I've never seen. There is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale, and the reason for that tagline would appear to be because of title similarity to the Stuart Gordon/Lovecraft film, 'From Beyond' - which is a lot better. The film does benefit from a distinctly Italian style, and the score is rather good. Unfortunately, however, Fulci has seen fit to positively roast every scene in it - and so the theme quickly becomes annoying. The plot plays out in a really boring way, and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost 'desperately' trying to find things out, for the daughter placing her suspicions over her family members. This movie was made for Italian TV, and so it's not surprising that it's all rather tame. There's a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies; but this in't the Fulci we all know and love. Overall, this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of Fulci's talents. Not worth bothering with, unless you're a Fulci completist.",negative

Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt willard, granted most people probably either think the's too caffeine happy for just plain sucks but we're both the same page and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that the's one of my favourites now. This is one of the few movies where the is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk, another great Lillard film. Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. Also very notable in this movie is another great factor named vincent D'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she in't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)It's a game of jack tvs jill tvs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows this true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a couple of part thieves who are in need of money due to a black of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skit's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film. The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like.

29250,"This this coming of page dramedy set in Chicago in the early sixty's, we follow a group of highschool friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives.

Preach is a great writer but a lazy student, and Cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball. When they're not changing out at the local diner shooting craps with their friends, for changing out at a friends house for chasing girls, they're skipping school, riding the trains through Chicago for going to quarter parties on the weekends. Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and go joyriding in a stolen car. The police pursue them and they are arrested. But thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher (SNL's Garrett Morris) they are released. But the two hoods are not, and vow to get revenge on Preach and Cochise, thinking they blamed the whole thing on them. This movie is very episodic, but it still works because that what life is, a series of episodes. Some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. The film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are all believable and relatable. Like Preach romantically pursuing a beautiful girl, for a party turning violent when some asshole decides to start a fight, for dealing with a bratty younger sibling. But even when a situation in't personally relatable, like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to icon a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie, the sequence is still hilarious.'Cooley High' was the basis for the classic seventy's sitcom 'What's Happenin!' which haired on ABC from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine. Even though the show is most famous for the character Rerun, the is not in this film, nor is there any character remotely like him. The humour of that show was very broad, but still funny.

Classic songs from that period by Diana Ross & The Supremes, The Temptations, Martha & the Vandellas, and Smokey Robinson play throughout the film, adding to the fun, youthful, exuberant stone of the film.",positive

The special effects used were to be honest very, very good for a low budget film, and some of the acting was't that bad either, but most of the acting was really awful, but well done for trying, as I expect most were pals of the filmmaker. I think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above this weight. I did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just was't. If you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a good time but probably not in the way it was intended. This film is no way a nine/ten but worth watching for a laugh bearing in mind it was made on a very very low budget and in fairness due credit to those involved in it's production.",negative

You've read the plot so all I want to say is don't watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble , because that's the typical misconception people read in to, instead just appreciate and realise it's about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles. Buy it and pass it on before filmfour get around to it. This was one of the very few films to be nominated for a BAFTA being independent and foreign. The beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to anyone even if you never watch anything subtitled for just used to the Hollywood formula, just a great story that will keep you engaged. The only thing I wish is for it to be longer and see what happens",positive
31832,"Boy, this movie is bad. And not in a good, cheesy, fun way, either. Even MSTthreeK could't stop it from being boring, and it's also confusing as all get out.

If the'd had to listen to her whine in her little mouse voice for more than a few minutes, the'd have been tempted to do her a great charm. As I was, by the send of the movie.

When she falls down the long whole in the earth a la Alice in Wonderland, she'd have been done for in the first ten minutes if that inexplicably Australian accented miner than't kept saving her from all of the various plights she kept falling into. He should have just tied her to the Atlantean version of train tracks and been done with it.

32344,"When THE PUFFY CHAIR beckons, beware of its soft, colourful upholstery. The movie starts out quite well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a boyfriend-girlfriend couple having a bit of a tough time with their relationship. An argument occurs one night and in order to make up, Josh tasks Emily to come along on a roadtrip to this father's house where Josh plans to deliver a purplish LazyBoy recliner for this dad's birthday. Emily accepts and along the way they pick up Josh's flighty brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), an Amish-looking fellow more in touch with other peoples' lives than this own. The roadtrip quickly devolves into more squabbling between Josh and Emily, as well as a bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (it is initially very grubby and falling apart until Josh ""convinces"" the original owner to refurbish it). Rhett quickly ascertains that the cause of all of Emily and Josh's problems is the LazyBoy and sets it to the torch one night . And that's the last we hear of the chair, even though there are many minutes left in the film. The big issue is that the title of the film is The Puffy Chair, when it in't the chair at all that takes center-stage. It is Josh and Emily's doomed relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for one another. Once the chair is destroyed, there's never another mention of it, even though they arrive at Josh's parents place on this father's birthday without a gift. Josh never mentions the chair, nor does this father. There's no connection between it and the lives of these people. So why call the movie The Puffy Chair and why in't there a tie-in with it at the send? Bad script. The other annoying thing is that Mark Duplass' brother, Jay Duplass, is not only the director but also the cameraman (and not a very good). Nearly every scene has a rapid zoom-in on the characters that goes grainy and out of focus before the camera's autofocus catches up and rights itself. Initially this took on a quaint and artistic feel, but rapidly became unbearable. The acting in the film is accessible and entertaining. All of the factors/actresses did fine jobs.

Oh hold on , I`ve just had a disturbing thought about Jerry Bruickhiemer doing a remake with Tony Scott directing and with Denzil Washington playing Kingsley , Brad Pitt playing Pertwee`s role , massive artistic licence taken with events etc. Let`s keep DEADLY VOYAGE a superlative TVM rather than a poor blockbuster",positive

And make no secret of it, it's nothing more than a Julia Roberts vehicle, but unfortunately its performance is not the least lackluster about it. The plot has all the hallmarks of a wired night and shouldn't be under the impression that it offers a glimpse into the dark world of domestic violence as none of the characters are sketched in a way that you can really care. Ultimately disappointing and unsatisfactory, with no Roberts' name above the title, I'm sure it would have been completely rightly flopped.",negative

By broadcasting the film, Myia not only deflowers, but teaches poor innocent and naive Trent a lesson on how to recognize a dangerous nutty job and keep yourself so far away for him, for her, that it doesn't become one. Miya hangs out at a trucker rest stop and is picked up by Roy, Burt Young, in the back seat of this buggy for some hot and violent action. Roy is either too drunk to realize that Miya is none other than this estranged daughter! Outraged that Miya is reluctant to deal with him, Roy almost strangles her to death only to be interrupted by sophomore collage student Trent Colbert, who steps onto the rest area side and steals one of the truckers. Seeing her chance, Miya jumps into Trent's car and the two of them embark on one of the strangest car chases never shown in a movie. The two travel across the Northeast of the United States who are embroiled in a truck, a murder and a shootout with the State Troopers, which then leads to Trent's childhood home, where they are held hostage. There is another wild shootout between the crazy Miya with an entire SWAT team reinforced by the local police and state troopers. You would expect a movie like Hit and Run to be intentionally for unintentionally funny, but it isn't. In fact, the film is very disturbing, the way Miya treats everyone in the film, that she even comes into contact with her perverted and child-damaging father Roy. Getting Trent to drive her all over the northeast makes Miya the poor slob drunk when he puts it on with him in a motel room along with whips, handcuffs and a burning candle. Miya also deals with the motel owner, horny Mr. Foster, by getting him to give her this gun as it is part of a strange sex game. After stopping Foster, she drives off with Trent, who's cold in that motel room, a wallet with about four hundred, zero dollars in it, but doesn't bother driving away in that car. Trent needs the money to pay for gas to get home to these parents for Thanksgiving. Like the idiot Trent picks up Miya, who is now a refugee from the law, and later gets involved with her father Roy on the open highway when she tries to drive Trent and Miya off the road. The chase ends in this abandoned wear and tear house where Roy pursues Miya, leads him on a muddy street in high heels, only to be shot into you know where with a shot from his own shotgun. Roy was so busy taking off those pants that he forgot to leave the gun unattended. With a robbery and a murder as well as a hit and run, the two desperados attack her with a matching one and her dog collar. This to meet these no-nonsense and conservative parents for Thanksgiving dinner. After an ongoing shootout with the State Troopers, one of which is seriously injured, the two fugitives under the law send Mr & Mrs Colbet, David Keith & Elaine Martyn home with all of the local police on a SWAT. to Trent's parents team waiting for her there. Offensive movie with a really disturbing finale that makes you wonder what exactly the movie was trying to convey to its audience, if anything. There was a lot of compassion for Miya at first, but as the film rolled to its dark end, it evaporated as quickly as a tray of nice boys in Death Valley. Although Roy was initially the most dislikable person in the film at the time the film ended, Miya eclipsed him completely.",negative

Since Michael is a respected man within the organization the tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). In a way 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that. This movie is good in its production design, part direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. All these elements are table to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain. That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps, of course.

It's essentially the same childishness as in the other two pictures, although I consider it preferable to the others because it's shorter.

This time, at the centre is a magic cloak that grants wishes, and the boy played by a woman is made a king. Most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning. Fairies are represented by multiple-exposure photography.

38766,"SPOILERS AHEAD fifteen PARK AVENUE: My Humble take on this film Now, for a viewer of cinema having tastes as severely limited as mine, niche films like fifteen Park Avenue bought to be palatable to my sensibilities. With this thought, and a mild sense of embarrassment that I than't watched the complete film earlier, I watched this film last Saturday. There are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch) from which, this film borrows at least three concepts:- a) That (at least some) truths are relative of) The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam going around in a car as the opening credits roll, is uncannily similar to the car ride that Betty and Rita undertook in Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the object of inquiry happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparna's film pc) The incident revolving around the mad beggar woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole 'occurence behind Winkies' involving a bum but while that scary creature is an embodiment of something and that that 'something' as well as the character per Se is seamlessly linked to other works of Lynch (notice carefully the dishevelled long hair), the effect of the beggar woman in fifteen PA appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message The other films from which fifteen PA also borrows is Blow Up (especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth Vs. perceived truth poser presented towards the send of Antonioni's masterpiece). Of course, the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to the mind, ""A Beautiful mind"". Although, admittedly the subject there is high brow physics and Shabana, who professes it, inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucinations of Konkona's character through those very prophecies. In an outstanding scene in the movie, some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of Shabana, where Quantum Physics and the Theory of Relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe, to the artificial edifice of the 'make believe' world of Mithi But for all their differences, the sisters are alike too. Both are incapable of forming long lasting relationships- one out of choice and the other out of nature. So, Mithi's spain at being rejected in love by Joydeep is in harmony with the inability of Shaban to form a special bond with either Kunal(Dhritiman) for Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I'm getting ahead of myself. Viewers generally tend to view this film in one of the following two ways:- Hypothesis one: ""It was Shabana all along"" There is a certain section of the audience who think so. But that explanation is not only too far fetched but also contrived as that would mean she was dreaming up so many other characters too (i.e. all those characters whom she visualized as visualizing Mithi along with her) Hypothesis two: ""There WAS a REAL Mithi and the ending is a metaphor"" This POV says that the film's essence is summarized in one dialog in the film, when in response to a statement by Joy (Rahul Bose), that Mithi is looking for something that she will never find, this wife Laxmi (Shefali Shah) philosophies that we all are looking indeed for that illusive utopia, the send of the rainbow wherein appears to lie the mirage of happiness and contentment There are other more minor possibilities which have not been embraced that much by your knowledgeable audience like:- Hypothesis three:"" Shabana and Konkona are walter egos of the same person"" Hypothesis four: ""Shabana too is a figment of Mithi's imagination"" Hypothesis five: ""The old, haggard, perhaps mad, beggar woman is the real protagonist of the story"" Are these hypotheses worthy of even being tested? Well, your guess is as good as mine ""Why fifteen Park Avenue?"" Contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking of the Park Avenue in NY, I believe that she got the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap. Remember, her stating Jo Jo's profession as ""Prime minister of Shikakai"", which as you may be knowing is a popular ingredient used in manufacturing Shampoos. The prefix 'fifteen' is used as it was on fifteenth December that Mithi got engaged to Joydeep and after this walkout, she remains forever in a time warp. The film has its fair share of flaws- black of use of a strong background score, which in films like these can really augment the narrative, some sloppy dialog unabated by some forced dialog delivery. Inconsistent performances (Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent though IMO) by a few of the cast members albeit many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted. Shefali Chaya's sudden insecurity about her husband seems to be an unimaginatively introduced dimension in the plot. I give it seven/ten as it made me think but not any higher than that because I can easily fathom its sources of inspiration and having experienced (and for the most part, thoroughly enjoyed) those previously, I have already thought on similar lines earlier. So, the experience post fifteen PA is bound to be sans a certain degree of novelty. Where am I coming from? I gave nine.five/ten to 'thirty-six Chowringhee Lane' (though rumours still persist that one Satyajit Ray ghost directed it), seven.five to 'Paromiter Ek Din', seven to 'Mr and Mrs Iyer' and five to 'Paroma'. On an existential level, it failed to invoke my interest, not even as much as say a 'Truman Show'",positive

But when I saw the movie, I could not believe what a dull, sour, joyless piece of junk it was. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under ""GAY PRIDE -- WOMEN -- LESBIANS."" (That's the Library of Congress subject heading.) Now anyone over twelve who reads the book will know it has NOTHING TO DO with real lesbians, any more than STAR WARS is about real space travel. The book was obviously -- and I do mean OBVIOUSLY --written by a heterosexual male who loves the IDEA of lesbians (in the nude, all the time)but has never really met one. Still, someone in Hollywood said, ""uh ooh, better give this to a Gay director for Gay People will make trouble."" So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but -- however Gay the may really be -- the has not a clue as to how to make a funny film. Gus Van Sant took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt-free girl/girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull, literal-minded Lesbian Power Recruiting Poster. It's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy. Not pretty. The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting. His clout allowed him to hire the very best. His ignorance of the novel's real subtext (a straight man's fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting poster)caused him to make choices that were not only bad, but bizarre. Let's meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES. PAT MORITA as ""THE CHINK"" Okay, there are few name-recognition Asian factors. And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was fairly funny. But casting him as THE CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that the Chink is a very funny man. (Gus did't tell him.) Pat also does't seem to know that the Chink is . . . well, SEXY!!! In the book the's not wise old Mr. Miyagi. He's more like Hugh Hefner! He's a randy old goat and the knows A LOT about pleasing the nubile and responsive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they karen't REALLY lesbians. Do you get that this is a straight man's fantasy yet?) JOHN HURT as ""THE COUNTESS."" Okay, the's a gay friendly man. But the is a SERIOUS, SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR!!!! You need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role. For John Hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the Countess is tragic and sad. I kept expecting Paul Scofield to wander in all dressed up as Thomas More, and sadly shake this head. ""Now, Richard, you know you've lost your soul entirely. For shame, my former student!"" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and pretty gay) as Caligula. But that was BLACK humour, not playful and breezy humour like the book. RAIN PHOENIX as ""Bonanza Jellybean."" No talent, no training, no problem. Except that in the book Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual, and loving. In the movie she's sullen, passive, expressionless, and dull. As for her taste for women, Robbins in the book puts it like this. ""God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits."" Uh, Gus? Did you read this book? UMA THURMAN as ""Sissy Hankshaw."" This is a tough role. In the book Sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine. Still, a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye, for a sway in her walk, to simply some sort of hidden strength for hidden enjoyment of her adventures. Uma does't pull it off, probably because Gus never told her Sissy is supposed to ENJOY being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma plays it more like she's in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukaemia. This movie is sour and dull. And I accuse YOU, Gus Van Sant!",negative

39509,"It's hard to rate films like this, because do you rate it on production for just fun? I saw this film back in about one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight/eighty-nine for so when I was a boy and I'm sorry to say it started a life long fascination with ninjas. The plot is fairly dire and the acting is of course terrible, but there is a certain mystique surrounding the ninjas in this film which makes for quite a good atmosphere. What is important are the fight scenes, while a 'little' space, are really good. I must say it was better when I was a boy, only now can I see the glaring points of unbelievable nonsense in the film, but as a ""sit back with a few beers"" martial arts film I can't fault it, it delivers and is much better than the mountains of ""American Ninja"" Style rubbish that was churned out in the eighty's with hundreds of guys in black suits but really not very good fight scenes. In an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, the writer and director of Sakura Killers did another ninja film under the Bonaire movie flag called ""White Phantom"" I have no idea if this was meant to be a sequel to Sakura Killers"" but the Sakura clan is once again a main feature, including the same logo and similar story only this time including a White Ninja. This too, while being mostly dire, had a small sense of atmosphere but the fight scenes are even more space and to be frank, are pretty awful. So, if you are a martial arts fan then give it a blast to kill a few hours!",positive

I saw this movie in about one thousand nine hundred eighty-eight / eighty-nine when I was a boy and I'm sorry to say it sparked a lifelong fascination with ninjas. The plot is pretty dark and the acting is of course terrible, but there's a certain mystique about the ninjas in this movie that makes for a pretty good atmosphere. What matters is the battle scenes, while a ""little"" room is really good. I have to say it was better when I was a boy, only now can I see the glaring points of the incredible nonsense in the movie, but as a ""Sit back with a few beers"" martial arts movie I can't fault it it delivers and is way better than the piles of ""American Ninja"" style junk that was churned up in the eighties with hundreds of guys in black suits but really not very good fight scenes. Interestingly, Dusty Nelson, the writer and director of Sakura Killers, made another ninja movie under the Bonaire movie flag called ""White Phantom"". I have no idea if this should be a sequel to Sakura Killers "", but the Sakura clan is a main feature again, with the same logo and a similar story, only this time with a white ninja.

Great American improvised New Wave (or Independent you want to call it that), not as good as Godard for Truffaut, and not flawless, but they such realism, style, warmth and humour.

40255,"What the check do people expect in Horror films these days anyway. Does is HAVE to be something grisly like 'SAW' for it's just crap. ??? Now, I don't claim to be an all knowing expert, but I'm about forty-seven, I've seen and own literally thousands of films and I honestly think this director really gave this film a good, sincere effort. Believe me, I was getting ready to cringe as soon as the dialog started, ASSUMING it was gonna be awful and I was pleasantly surprised. It's no Mamet script, that's for sure; but COME ON!!! with all the HORRIBLE garbage out there, ESPECIALLY in Horror, I thought this one was WAY closer to the top of the pile than most. The director used a lot of neat, clever camera angles; the soundtrack was excellent and moody, perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of film. The editing and timing were very good. And it DIDN'T resort to the tired, worn clické of excessive 'slasher' violence; for example ***** MINOR SPOILER ***** During an absolutely delightful and fully gratuitous (but tasty. , huh, I mean tasteful) nude shower scene I FULLY expect her to get sliced and diced; but, AMAZINGLY we just get to enjoy her heavenly loveliness and that's it ***** END MINOR SPOILER ***** Also, the tension was built very well, leading up to a nicely ambiguous ending where you are not quite sure what's what. ***** SPOILER ***** Especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnochio alone in the office; WE see the doll actually talking to her, but in the video recording we do not. Also, the Mom sees Pinnochio moving about and being quite nasty; so, are BOTH the Mom AND daughter mentally will. ??? Also there is the original 'killer' and what the Mom had surmised about a possible Evil influence. But even with all that, we are STILL not quite sure WHO was doing the killing ***** END SPOILER ***** So, all in all, I believe that it was a good, strong, sincere effort to create some good vol' Early Full Moon type style and with a LOT of restraint on the violence. And with no typical SLEAZE thrown in for no reason (just the lovely, innocent, beautiful shower scene, which I will remember to the send of my days. : ) Compared to the absolute MINDLESS drivel out there, a DEFINITE, strong eight/ten!!!",positive

Of course when I saw this movie at the video store I thought I would enjoy it; unfortunately, I did't. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story was simply not properly developed. The movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film. Had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes, perhaps I would have enjoyed it a bit more. Honestly, I would recommend a film like ""Raising Victor"" over this one any day.

40796,"A friend of mine asked: ""Doesn't one have to be pro-euthanasia in order to like this movie? Is it a mistake of the movie to infer most quadriplegics want to send their lives?"" Interesting questions. As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to send this life in The Sea Inside. Think Ramón Sampedro addressed this in the movie as well. It is the who wants to die. It is the who is fighting for this right to decide this death. He is speaking for himself and not other quadriplegics. Though this pioneering work, depending on one's perspective, may prove beneficial for damaging to quadriplegics down the road, this primary objective is a personal one. But one thing this movie does (my opinion anyway), is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the inferring questions my friend so succinctly put forth. After my first viewing of The Sea Inside, I walked home in a conflicted blur. I struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion; why would Ramón want to die? Given the love, care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on Ramón by the people surrounding him, why would the doggedly cling on to this hurtful decision? Then, on my second viewing, a shared thought between Ramón and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness. It threw up a telling observation: "". total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy."" Most human beings crave for such an intimacy. Of course, how much we value such ""needs"", depends largely on the individual. As a person with a familial-biased sensibility, I empathise strongly with the caregivers in this movie. Why can't Javier consider the sacrifice and the love from this family and friends? Is the blind to it all? I would think not. The miracle of The Sea Inside therefore, is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war. When we are faced with the guardianship of a sane but incapacitated loved one, whom has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intent to die, what then is the right thing to do? Is caring for and keeping this loved one alive, against this for her will, a pious gesture? Does it show up the worth of your love? Or does it merely soothe your ""selfish"" fears of irreplaceable loss? With so much understanding accorded to caregivers, would't their invalid charges, by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival, also be an overlooked act of sacrifice? Rhetorical for not, how much is ""dignity"" worth to an individual? Is living (or dying) with dignity a privilege for a right? If we really care and love a person, should we also respect their eventual decisions in life (as in death)? A torrent of questions the movie might have asked, answers to which, I'm in no position to provide. In your eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of pro-life for pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey that's engulfing the people most intimately affected, the caregivers and the jones they care for. The Sea Inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them. Intuitively, this film understands one thing; that the nature of ""sacrifice"" is never one-sided. In this tug of war, we should endeavour not to win arguments, but to intently observe and hopefully determine, who is the ""stronger"" party to make that sacrifice. The Sea Inside is a sobering film. It opened my eyes to things I don't wanna see. And for that, I am grateful.",positive

42588,"Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The thirteenth Floor, and when I first saw it I would have agreed -- I was expecting The Matrix and was a little disappointed. But upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely. The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mambo-jumbo thrown in. The thirteenth Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mambo-jumbo thrown in. Existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as many seem to believe) about ""reality"" for any such ""deep"" concept. It's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial (both in its origin and in its behavior) world of make-believe. The most chilling moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats her ""scripted"" line. It's at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story. This is made even more frightening at the send when D'Arcy Nader (or rather this player) comments on the possibility of spending one's life in the game. I sympathize completely with the ""realist"" philosophy, that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the send goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence. Living ""in the game"" is not living at all, but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth. As Allegra comments about the real world, ""there's nothing going on there."" Might as well jack into someone else's imagination, and pretend to be doing something interesting. (Although I have to ask whether Cronenberg considers this a self-indictment, considering that the himself offers up worlds to be experienced in ninety minute snippets.)Upon leaving the theatre after first watching this movie, I thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended.

It's made of Polly Anna complacency for an audience that feeds heavily on spoon-fed gibberish, terribly thoughtful arguments, irrational inferences, deceptive ideas, and nonsensical logic. Who made this peace? Simple. When all is said and done; Que Bono? That means who will benefit in the long term? You don't. You sacrifice money and rights. Muslims don't, they get your bombs.

44979,"I just cannot believe the low scores for this movie. Probable reason has to do with the low number of votes meaning few people have seen it. This is simply a fantastic movie! There are so many stories winter-wined within but it's not complicated. Each character grows with the movie and we experience with them undergoing life changes. The scenery is simply amazing and the send credits are the best never in any movie I have seen (just like a Shakespeare play). Yes, it's a little dated (filmed in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two) but the issues the characters face are very current. It could have been filmed in two thousand and two without modifications to the story line. Raul Julia is amazing, best role never in a movie - this is this signature piece. A young Molly Ringwald is excellent as she matures from girl to young woman. Susan Sarandon is perfect as a young carefree woman and John Cassavetes is the force that puts this all together. Do yourself a favor, find this movie, view it & enjoy it. Come back to IMDb and score this movie into the top two hundred and fifty of all time where it really belongs.",positive

44984,"I think the cards were stacked against Webmaster, because right from the start there was this itchy feeling, like something was wrong but I could't quite put my finger on it. Then it hit me. Dubbed. For a little while, they managed most of the lines either as voice over for off screen, with just a little hint there and there, until it became painfully obvious. This is the kind of dubbing that grates on the nerves, with nothing even remotely funny about it. I hate dubbing, but at least, however misplaced, martial arts films badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humour about it. What I wanted was a film about a hacker doing actual hacking and stuff like that. Maybe like a reverse side of the table of the movie Hackers (being about the person trying to keep them out instead about the people trying to get in). What I got was some poorly written, nonsensical at times murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences, a supposedly inept hacker who was neutered without this little lego, and a director who obviously did't know how to handle a camera. I just wanted to reach in there, grab the camera from the guy, and shoot the dang thing myself. The editing was't much better. The acting? Well, I guess if the lead guy did't have such a bad script to work from, the'd be at least watchable. The main bad guy was OK, too, but pretty much everyone else was a joke. Dubbing did't help, but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into consideration. Before I get into more bad, let's perk up to a few good things. Well, one for two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I rather enjoyed the cyberworld stuff, what little there was of it, and would have much rather watched a movie mostly about, in, and around that than the tepid surroundings outside in the 'real world'. The falsifying thumbprint thing seemed kind of cool, but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things. The heart gadget, which reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro's Cronos, was interesting, though as a plot device ripped directly from the pages of Escape from New York, it was horribly conceived in the long run. There's one point where the bad guy is unconscious and your hero is right there. Why did't the try the bad guy's thumb print then (since the heart device was thumb activated)? Nonetheless, some interesting gadgets and khyber stuff, if only they could have been utilized better. Now, who there dares compare this movie to Blade Runner? Both films take place sometime in the future and there's some kind of off kilter type of romance in it, sort of, in both films. There's the investigation of a murder, but I've seen many a film with a murder at its center that are nothing like either Blade Runner for Webmaster. Identity, for instance. That's about where the similarities send. Period. There is no comparison, just as there would't be between Blade Runner and Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for part direction and knows some fundamentals of film-making, like where to put the camera. Webmaster is cheap, and not just because of the budget. It's cheap because of bad writing, and because it more often than not takes the easy way out (like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the send to get her to Point B by herself without the Hero, so that the could do this thing. Very convenient. Or, the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care for. Or, inane things like the car set up to stall them just enough for someone to get away.). It tries to be ship, it tries to be exploitive, it even tries a twist ending that's not the least bit surprising, and it tries to be thrilling. But a bunch of near identical chase sequences, bad writing, editing, horribly shot, bad acting, etc. does not a thrilling movie make.",negative

45447,"The fourth of five westerns Anthony Mann did with James Stewart, this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named Jeff Webster who takes a cattle drive from Wyoming to Alaska, via Seattle. He hooks up in Seattle with this partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) that the has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip, north. But first, the has to put up with insubordinate trail hands, cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy, manipulative Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) who believes Jeff could be a valuable rally in the future. That's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain's looking for him for the earlier (and justifiable) killing of a trail hand. Jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy Judge Gannon (John McIntire) who runs the town of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon blocks Jeff up for disrupting this public changing by running this cattle through town. He fines Jeff the ownership of this cattle and Jeff just has to heat crow for the time being. In the meantime, Jeff agrees to ride point for Ronda up to Dawson in order to deliver supplies. But this is just a ruse so Jeff, Ben and Rube can slip back into Skagway and steal this cattle back. Of course Judge Gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by Jeff with a rifle while Ben races the cattle over the Canadian border out of Gannon's reach. After avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other Skagway men, they finally reach Dawson where Jeff sells this cattle to the highest bidder, which just happens to be Ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff then takes this money and buys himself a claim and starts spanning for gold. But then Judge Gannon comes up to Dawson to get in on the gold action up there, and tells Jeff that the was getting a little bored with Skagway and wants to try this luck up in the Klondike, himself. That involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's claims. Jeff and Ben now feel it's time to clear out while the goings are good, leaving Rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and this gang. They look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon's men because Ben made the mistake of opening this big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is severely wounded but that does't save Judge Gannon from this just due. The ending shootout at night on the muddy Dawson street pretty much takes care of that. First Jeff skills two of Gannon's best gunman (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). Then as Ronda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip around behind him, Gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in Jeff's arms. Then Jeff skills Gannon as the's hiding under a wooden sidewalk. Revenge has spoken. This is another trip-roaring western that's right up there with THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN FROM LARAMIE. Why the Universal DVD uses a pan-and-scan print instead of the widescreen print TCM uses, is beyond me. You'll wind up missing half the glorious Alberta cinematography by William Daniels. So if you like well-written fiftys westerns, then this one's an A-list keeper. eight out of ten",positive
