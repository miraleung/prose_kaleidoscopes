52,"Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for Monogram Studios in the one thousand, nine hundred and forty's and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the better jones. Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and skills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so the can keep this ageing wife looking young. After a reporter and a doctor stay the night at this home and discover the is responsible for the brides' deaths, the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards. You have got almost everything in this movie: the scientist's assistants consist of an old shag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and spooky passages in Bela's house. Bela and this wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie. The Corpse Vanishes is worth a look, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Great fun. Rating: three stars out of five.",positive

350,"Man with the Screaming Brain certainly in't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of this entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William's body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of this panic and screams at a statue, ""What are you looking at?!"" The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard ""bumbling assistant"" role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that the's writing this own films, you'd think the'd give himself a role that the has't been typecast in already.) Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre, nonsensical B-movie that bought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.",positive

2024,"I liked the understated character that Laura Linney played in 'Love Actually', and she is very good in 'Man of the Year'. But wow. Robin Williams does't give that much of a performance, with a couple of minor exceptions this was weak. Laura Linney may not have been miscast, but either the editing raped her character, for this was just a sad performance by director Barry Levinson. And I think it was Barry Levinson that got old. So many weak performances, such uneven results have to be the fault of management. Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are great in supporting roles. Goldblum plays a sinister side with relish, and Walken's combination of entertainer's manager and commentator for the film is wonderful. But the story is clické, the presentation looks like it could have (should have) been a very good picture, and too many actions are half-hearted. The spacing, story, and direction all come up weak, compared to, say 'Head Office' (spoof of 'Secret of My Success').",negative

2676,"This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script. But it is hard to watch, because there is no good send to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it's also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends. The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation. There is redemption of a sort, in the send, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great spain for her. This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to ""Mr & Mrs Iyer"". In the send, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.",positive

2778,"This was only the second version of the classic story by Charles Dickens I had seen, and sadly it turned out to be one of the worst. The film opens with a quick live action piece where Simon Callow as Charles Dickens begins the story of A Christmas Carol, and then obviously it goes to animated story itself. You probably already know it, Ebenezer Scrooge is the grouchy cold-blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage) who warns him of the visits of the other three ghosts of Christmas Past (Jane Horrocks), Present (Sir Michael Gambon) and the silent Future/Yet To Come. After all this the obviously realises the true magic of Christmas, and promises to be nicer in future. The only changes I noticed to the story were Scrooge having mice as friends (a stupid idea), Scrooge's sex-love Belle (Kate Winslet) needing to see him to help at the orphanage, the Ghost of Christmas Present showing the two kids, ""want"" and ""ignorance"", Scrooge still gets haunted after being turned nice, and the's worried the can't keep this promise to stay nice. Also starring Rhys Ifans as Bob Cratchit, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Cratchit, Iain Jones as Scrooge's nephew Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig.

3069,"This is another of Eastwood's many movies mixing intrigue, action, and a dollop of romance, along with ""The Gauntlet,"" ""Firefox,"" and so forth. Clint's acting range by now is pretty familiar. In this one, the's taciturn and a bit outrageous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in this performance. But the film itself is something of a surprise; it's above average. Clint is Frank, a Secret Service agent who, perhaps in a moment of doubt, failed to catch the bullet that killed JFK. He then took to drink, which drove this family away, and now plods along in the bureaucracy until the is contacted by John Malkovitch, calling himself ""Booth,"" who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared, disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability. Now, this is rather an anfractuous set of attitudes for a performer like Clint to project, but the does rather well, less robotic than usual. And the does seem to carry around with him, like a burden of stone, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He's tested again halfway through this movie. He is changing from the proof of a tall building, grasping Booth's hand, and the pulls this pistol and points it at Booth, who tasks him if the is really willing to shoot. If the does, of course, the saves the president from an attempted assassination by a CIA-trained murderer, but the does so at the cost of this own life. Booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair. And Clint even has a short speech, talking to Renee Russo, about this failure to save the president in Dallas. ""If I'd have reacted quickly enough, I could have taken that shot . . . and that would have been alright with me."" It's underplayed, but this voice chokes slightly, this eyes water, and this clip trembles. It's one of the few scenes in any of Clint's films that might properly be called ""moving."" We know from this newfound resolve that given another chance the would take the bullet this time. (The irony is that the does't like the current president. Who could? He gives pompous speeches in Colorado about how they ""carved a nation out of the wilderness."" Didn't they do the same thing in Las Vegas?)It's often said that a movie is only as good as its villain. It in't true, nothing is that simple, but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case. The reptilian John Malkovitch with this Tartar eyes is marvellous. Talk about disillusioned. Okay, the can ham it up a little, sniffing with disdain even as the plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes, but the's fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little do to. Fred Thompson, as the chief White House said, is now back in politics, a relief for movie-goers. If Clint's acting range is limited, Thompson's is something less. In every film the's been in, the wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression, as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder. The direction by Wolfgang Peterson is as good as it was in ""Das Boot,"" which is pretty good. There is a great deal of the usual suspenseful across-cutting in the final shootout. And when Clint and Russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat, Peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor -- not only the usual garments but handcuffs, guns, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impediments.

3408,"'Intervention' has helped me with my own addictions and recovery. I'm a middle-aged married father of two. I'm quite functional in my personal and professional life. Still, I have spain from my past that I use addictions to soothe, and issues from which I am slowly recovering. When these addicts and their families share their lives with me, they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family. The show, unlike many others, digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction. Many of us suffer because it's too scary to go back and do, as Alice Miller says, ""the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of your childhood."" The show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started. This digging is painful and difficult, but worth it. So much coverage of addiction -- fictional and non-fictional -- seems to ignore the underlying issues. Often it's assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up for whatever for fun for pleasure for self-interest, and now they can't stop. Not so: addictions are about killing spain. I can relate to the different events and hardships in people's lives. There are common themes, and surprising exceptions. Many addicts have suffered miserable abuse. Some kids simply respond badly to divorce. To those who think that addiction is an over-reaction to a hardship, I would just say that different people respond differently. Although some kids handle divorce well, others, like Cristy in the show, ""collapse in a cheap on the floor"" and have their lives forever changed by the event. For example, last night's counselor said that pretty young Andrea seeks validation from men. She strips for cash for a seventy-five-year old neighbour and lets men abuse her. Sound familiar to anyone? The series is filled with information that we can use to understand your own motivations and make adjustments to your lives. Often it's those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest. As they say, even a stopped watch is right twice a day, but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while, until it's made your life miserable. To the producers: Thank you for making the show, for digging into the past, for the follow-ups. Also, the graphics, the format, and the theme music are brilliant. To the addicts: thank you for your courage to share. Whether for not you have helped yourself, you have helped me.",positive

4057,"I had a check of a good time viewing this picture, and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features. First off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(Herb Evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(Leslie Daniels as the assistant Kurt)to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions. The scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this milk. Issues abound about what role science and medicine have in your lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thinking film in many ways. However, don't be too fooled by its real intent. It is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with this aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together this dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. One other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties.",positive

4584,"Its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one, but for me Tears of Kali is one of the horror highlights of the zero's and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece. An anthology horror, it takes on the story of the fictional Taylor-Eriksson Group, a cult of sorts based in India whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche, with unpleasant results that echo down the years. With bookend segments set in India the film is made chiefly of three stories set in Germany, illustrating the aftermath of the work of the Taylor-Eriksson Group, with some pretty nasty gore at times. Its an interesting set up as these things go, but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror. Bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients, healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals, dark forces unbound by time, place for even personality. Good examples of this are found in the first story especially, dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital. Previous to this story we have seen Lars Eriksson and notably this wonky (lazy?) eye, we also see him healing for at least comforting a patient. The lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as Eriksson healing a fellow patient, also as she wraps up the canvases from the part class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen, a face with lazy eye like Erikssons. There are also references to folk in minuscule roles, extras and walk sons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film, showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and table to almost infect others. There is more to the film philosophically than just evil within, it is a film about death, suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from Hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect (at least from the research that I did on wikipedia). Writer/director Andreas Marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for this skill in constructing the film. As well as being thoughtful, the film is pretty chilling too, the soundtrack of Bharti India and Panama John has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances, Michael Balaun as a sinister doctor and Cora Chilcot as a freaky patient especially good. The third story also has a fine turn from veteran Mathieu Carrière as a faith healer. The biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well. So, the film in't quite as gripping as it might be, the acting occasionally off and the spacing too, but mostly I thought it was pretty great, if a shade short of its possible brilliance. Well worth a look for adventurous horror fans I think.",positive

With bookend segments set in India, the film consists mainly of three stories set in Germany that illustrate the aftermath of the Taylor-Eriksson group's work with sometimes quite bad blood. It's an interesting setup, but what makes this film stand out is the way the images have been put together so carefully to develop the horror film. Bad things have been unleashed and the general flow of the film is a look at how the pursuit of self-awareness and ultimate therapy terrors patients, healers and others and the film is full of intelligent visual cues of the power of the dark forces it deals with, dark ones Powers that are not tied to time make room for an even personality. Good examples of this can be found especially in the first story, in which a journalist interviews a woman in a mental hospital. Before this story we saw Lars Eriksson and especially this crooked (lazy?) Eye, we also see how he heals to comfort at least one patient. The mentally ill of the first story can be seen in the same posture in which Eriksson heals a fellow patient, also when she wraps the canvases from the partial class that she performs among her fellow patients, one of her pictures can be seen, a face with a lazy eye like Erikssons. There is also evidence of people in tiny roles, extras, and walk-sons who have additional sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film, showing the malevolence unleashed, spreading and almost infecting others. The film has more than just evil in it philosophically, it is a film about death, suffering and possible redemption, all in a structure that stems from Hindu beliefs, in a way that looks like exploitation, but more related to reality has beliefs than one might expect (at least from the research I did on Wikipedia). In any case, the author / director Andreas Marschall deserves great praise for this skill in the construction of the film. Not only is the film thoughtful, it's also pretty chilled, the Bharti India and Panama John soundtrack has a great, creepy piano jingle and there are some notable gigs, Michael Balaun as the creepy doctor and Cora Chilcot as the freaky patient especially good. The third story also has a good twist on veteran Mathieu Carrière as a faith healer. The biggest problem with the film is that it doesn't involve that much time so the potential for fear is lost, but this and a couple of other performances get pretty good turnout. So the movie isn't quite as gripping as it could be, the acting occasionally and the spacing too, but mostly I thought it was pretty great, if a little below its possible brilliance. Well worth a look for adventurous horror fans I think.",positive
6421,"This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman. Of course it is different because there is a using-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a seven because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home. I know they want to find the right Danny and Sandy, but America should have the power to decide who does home. There's really no point to the using-off. The person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway. Another things I'd change is to see them actually act on the show. What's Broadway without the acting? The last thing that need to be changed is the song the eliminated people using at the send. The eliminated Danny always sings the same song and the eliminated Sandy always sings the same song as they exit. Since they using it every week those songs eventually get annoying. I admit to not being a fan of the movie, Grease, but for some reason I am hooked. This show is very underrated. It has so many memorable performances and moments.",positive

Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants which are still alive, but the people were turned to dust. No bones, nothing. Thats ridiculous. How can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact? Even better, the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters. Their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child. The Insane Clown Posse scare me more. and they're supposed to look stupid. Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death. How can steel block a comet's radiation that supposedly incinerated people in their tracks? Equally insulting is the sixty's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie, for the eighty's hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television. The stupidest part of the movie, however, are the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? There were four five minute horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were dreams. In between these scenes is unsophisticated dialog which makes South Park seem intelligent. The silence in between the elementary dialog was painful.

Okay, a few others have skirted the issue, but Farscape did it the best. The point is, the writers pay close attention to detail to make the show as believable as possible. With so much bad programming out there, it's a shame that balanced, entertaining series such as Farscape don't get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production.

I watched this one first uncut and sun-MSTthreeK'ed, and it was pretty much laugh out cloud funny even without the comments. The plot(such as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the AI robots revolted(sound familiar?) and destroyed pretty much everything, leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it. The few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the Dark One, which seems to be part computer and part organic being. The 'air slaves' work to produce energy for this being in return for breathable air.

Okay, that's the so-called serious stuff. On to the silly stuff, such as the ridiculous quasi-futuristic clothing that everyone sports, including car seat cover 'fur' garments, loin cloths, and spangle stuff and feather boas(worn mostly by the Dark One's frenchwoman, a chick with an unrecognizable and almost non-understandable accent).

After this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret, but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways. Through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group, but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences. So, is she back from the grave seeking revenge? Oh what a great and always spooky story! Well, that's what I hoping I could say. And 'hoping' was as good as it got. This is an forgettable, so-so supernatural horror flick that I actually watched before, but I went in thinking it was my first viewing.

The deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality. While, the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it's murky lighting. The first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood-curdling experience, but really when it's not trying to shock you. I found it rather coma inducing and I thought about getting some shut-eye. That might be harsh, but it just did't go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments. You could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one, the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self-centred bunch that you don't really care what happens to them. The disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship. It just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it's just plain ludicrous. The film's haunting ending is a high point, though. The film looks fine, although it could have done without the snazzy, quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood.

13427,"Since I'd seen the other three, I figured I might as well catch this made for TV fourth part of The Omen series. As a stand alone film, this movie is mediocre; but as a sequel to the one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six masterpiece; it's a travesty. The film goes along the same route that many series' go down when they're running out of ideas; that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female. It's always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard, the plot blacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum. The film does keep a thread with the original, which I won't reveal as despite being obvious; that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie. The basics of the plot largely copy Richard Donner's original, and see a young couple adopt a child, which they name Delia (not Damiella for Damiana, fortunately). There's a big dog involved, and a child minder; and pretty soon, the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal; as she's menstruating at weight years old, and never suffered from any illnesses. The first two sequels to The Omen were't bad at all, and the series really should have ended at number three. I guess there was money involved somewhere down the line, as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made. It brings nothing to the table in terms of originality, and the only thing it's likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series. The film looks and feels like a TV movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl. Indeed, Asia Vieira does look like a little bitch; but she never convinces that she's the Antichrist, as her stares are redundant and most of the 'evil' she does is laughable. Faye Grant is given the meatiest role, and does't impress; while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time. The only good thing about this movie is the theme tune, which of course has been ripped off from the original; and is overused. On the whole, this film really in't worth seeing; as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for, and does't even do justice to weaker second sequel.",negative

The basics of the plot largely copy the original by Richard Donner, and see a young couple adopt a child they call Delia (thankfully not Damiana for Damiana). There is a large dog and a nanny; and pretty soon the woman begins to suspect that the child may not be entirely normal; since she menstruated at the age of weight years and never suffered from diseases. The Omen's first two sequels weren't bad at all, and the series should have ended in third place. I guess there was money involved somewhere as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made. It doesn't bring any originality to the table, and the only thing he's likely to manage is to annoy fans of the series. The film looks and feels like a television movie throughout, and for the most part plays out like a film about the difficult upbringing of a young girl. In fact, Asia Vieira looks like a little slut; but she never convinces that she is the Antichrist as her looks are superfluous and most of the 'evil' she does is ridiculous. Faye Grant gets the meatiest role and doesn't impress; while the rest of the cast regretted having agreed in such a terrible waste of time. The only good thing about this movie is the theme song, which of course has been torn from the original; and is overused. On the whole, this film is really not worth watching; since it doesn't deliver anything the series is famous for, and doesn't even do justice to the weaker second sequel.",negative

13750,"Although I do not recommend this film, neither do I recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. Though I have not given away the ending, for most of the plot twists, this movie would be best viewed without any prior information. It's hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film Donnie Darko, as there are many to deal with. Richard Kelly, in this first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage, late-night stoner diatribes, self-righteous justifications and inoffensive, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen-angst dramas; then mashed them into a single two hour package with a sci-fi twist. The result is deeply distressing-- for all the wrong reasons. The film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism for meaning, to make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unreconciled loose ends, by hiding it under a veneer of CGI effects and new-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, committed to therapy, misunderstood by this friends, and rendered hostile and disaffected by this suburban life. We are meant to feel that the is more intelligent than this schoolmates, although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of this friends comes up with an absurd theory about the Smurfs, and Donnie counters with a theory of this own, this friend complains about Donnie acting ""all smart."" Donnie's speech, however, is no smarter than that of this friend-- just angrier. The only clear evidence of this intelligence is this principal's description of this standardized test scores as `intimidating;' but given the director's slant against simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a poor substitute for character development. Donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film. In fact, the entire issue of the drugs is understated, and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all of this may be a product of this imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film one hundred percent science fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the ""science"" behind the ""fiction"" is very shaky. The explanations of time travel are weak, at best sounding like detached, uninformed rambling. We get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel for a few chapters, and can't quite remember how it worked, but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film. The scientific portion, as a result, depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a teacher discussing time travel states that if the continues to speak on the subject, the'd be fired. Apparently no further explanation is needed). Donnie's dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions. The justification for these actions is a tricky business. He damages this school, but it's okay, because this school does't treat him like a person. His punishment of a creepy self-esteem advocate (somewhat similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia) results in the man's public humiliation. But should the audience believe that Donnie is some sort of avenging angel, striking out against ignorance and debauchery? He himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact. Aside from these flaws, the film is riddled with flat, uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The story is set in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight, just before the Bush/Dukakis selection, and the director touches on this point during the film. The focus, however, extends exactly this far: Donnie's gruff, blue collar father is voting for Bush, while this free-spirited, rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement there; simply a statement of the obvious. The former are not necessary to make a good film, but the latter should be left out. Likewise, Donnie's heartfelt speech about not being table to plump all human emotions into the bland categories of ""fear and ""love;"" this does't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding. Everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions, and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless. Mr. Kelly gives homage to several symbols of eighty's pop culture in this film: E. T., Stephen King, the Smurfs, Back to the Future. At it's heart, this film feels like the director's homage to himself, a collection of this own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, affirmations and disenchantment, roughly stitched together by untrained hands. Entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions, seemingly because the director likes the songs. Characters who have little to no bearing on the plot (including the archetypal bully, fat girl, and right-wing idiot teacher) are given unnecessary focus, because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow. The awkward mess that is Donnie Darko leaves us wondering if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas left in this head to make another film, for if the has wasted all this creativity in one pointless, cluttered, meandering effort. My rating: one/ten.",negative

14053,"onest watched two/sixteen/two thousand and two - four out of ten(Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery??/Thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists. Despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright under-estimates it's audience. The movie-going public is not stupid and I hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with. We think that this movie is going to be about something with Connery's conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard, contrived for the audience's sake, run of the mill, let's never get it over with, thriller. We are pulled into every silly switch in character, as they are portrayed to us when it's needed in the story, and we're ready for this thing to be over way before it ends. Yes there is some good acting there, especially from Blair Underwood, Fishburne, and Ed Harris in a psycho-supporting role but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the very long-awaited send.",negative

The story is unbelievable and farcical, the acting second-rate, the supporting cast insufferable. I cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked.

But while the one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-two Tarzan was reduced to ""Tarzan - Jane"" speech, this Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, does't speak for even grunt. He does do the the Tarzan yell a couple of times, which sounds like it was sampled from the earlier film. No, Tarzan plays second banana to Bo Derek as Jane. Or rather, as third banana to Bo Derek's left breast and her right breast. This movie has no point but to show Derek naked. The two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion, and are really bad. More evidence that no one scared. Bizarrely enough, Tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this film. Maybe the car pooled in from Sumatra with the Indian elephants that are also on display.",negative
17633,"Tarzan the Ape Man ist ein Remake von tausendneunhundert und zweiunddreißig Film aus der gleichen Zeit, und wie dieser frühere Film hat er wenig Ähnlichkeit mit Burroughs' literarischem Charakter. Aber während der tausendneunhundertzweiunddreißig Tarzan auf ""Tarzan - Jane"" reduziert wurde, spricht dieser Tarzan, gespielt von Miles O'Keeffe, nicht einmal für ein Grunzen. Er macht den Tarzan-Schrei ein paar Mal, was sich anhört, als wäre es aus dem früheren Film gesampelt worden. Nein, Tarzan spielt Bo Derek als Jane die zweite Banane. Oder besser gesagt, als dritte Banane zu Bo Dereks linker Brust und ihrer rechten Brust. Dieser Film hat keinen Sinn, als Derek nackt zu zeigen. Die beiden Actionszenen im Film werden in Zeitlupe präsentiert und sind wirklich schlecht. Mehr Beweise, dass niemand Angst hatte. Seltsamerweise hat Tarzan in diesem Film einen Orang-Utan-Sidekick.

18805,"I remember when I first saw this movie. I was babysitting for a friend of my mums, and one of the kids suggested we watch it. Thinking it was the frankly laughable 'Prince of Thieves' they were slipping into the video recorder, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom, What I got came as a shock, a pleasant one I'll admit, but still a shock. Now, you all know the Robin Hood legend don't you? I shall explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, nicking money there and there and giving it to people who needed it, all the while seducing the beautiful Maid Marion, and vexing the Sheriff of Nottingham and prince john. That's the basics! Now, on with the review. This movie was released in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-three, and is a take off of the whole Robin Hood legend and a up--- take of Prince of Thieves in particular. Loosely following the legend, Robin of Loxley is first encountered in an Arabic prison during the third century crusades, and together with a 'Moor' as they were called in those days, the executes a cunning escape with a cellmate, Asneeze. After escaping, Asneeze beseeches Robin to find this son Atchoo, a foreign exchange student in England and look out for him. This Robin vows to do! Robin swims back to England. He returns to this home, Loxley castle to find it being wheeled away on the back of the cart by Bailiffs, and goes through the sorrowful revelation that this father, dog, cat, and even the goldfish are all dead. Desperate for a familiar face, the finds the family's loyal blind servant Blinkin sitting on the toilet with a Jazz mag in Braille. The hilarity continues throughout the movie. As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the sheriff of Rottingham, who are wreaking havoc and charging exorbitant taxes on King Richards's kingdom while the's away. Those familiar with the movies Mel Brooks has previously directed will have some small idea of what to expect. After all, this is the man responsible for Dracula-dead and loving it and young Frankenstein. All the jokes, which range from visual gags to wonderful witty comments are in exactly the right places throughout the movie, with never more than a minute between laughs. Cary Elwes (incidentally the only English man to play Robin Hood in a movie), who many of you will know from Princess Bride brings this cheeky grinning twinkle eyed presence to this movie, and does a wonderful job. From outlandish heroic posturing, to a wickedly sexy glance, the really is amazingly funny. And the man looks better in tights than I do! Richard Lewis is hilarious as the whiny, arrogant Prince John with the never-changing mole. He gets the sissy-boy behaviour down to a tee, and this whinging American vocalizations are great. All the way through the movie, a mole on this face constantly changes position: it starts on this left cheek, then over to this right cheek, then this chin, then this forehead, before going back to it's original place. This is a subtle joke based on the mole on Alan Rickman when the played the sheriff in Prince Of ThievesRoger Rees as the sleazy sheriff of Rottingham is marvellously slimy and nasty, and has some great lines throughout the film. There are some faces there you'll be familiar with from other Brooks films. For instance Robert Ridgely, playing the hangman in this film also played the hangman in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He likes to add subtle references to this earlier films too; with several in this film that die-hard Brooks fans will easily spot. Those who watched History of the World part one will recognise the music to the song 'Men in Tights'. Also, when Patrick Stewart arrives and songs Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) cutters the line 'it's good to be a king', one of this lines in History of the world. The whole cast is wonderfully comedic, even those with only a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humour to themWhat makes this film so wonderfully warm and funny in my own opinion are all the improvised scenes. Although there was a script of sorts, some scenes were completely improvised by the factors themselves, such as the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) sprays for Rottingham in her bed, and the falls through the ceiling, landing right where she wanted him, which was totally devised and thought out by the two factors. There are few special effects, and those that are there are small but fun moments of computerised camera trickery. The soundtrack is memorable, with some very funny songs, and a couple of cheesy love songs. You'll be singing 'Men in tights' for at least humming it to yourself, for weeks. The rating is Pg, to which I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the film, except in the use of double entendre, and one utterance of ash!t, and violence is minimal. In fact I'd go as far as to say non-existent, apart from a few comedy fight scenes. A great fun film that adults and children alike will enjoy!",positive

THE PHANTOM LADY is based on a novel by William Irish (the great nor writer Cornell Woolrich). As movie fans know from other works by Woolrich (LEOPARD MAN, THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES, REAR WINDOW, NO MAN OF HER OWN) one cannot assume what is true on the surface anywhere. The missing wife of a salesman may not actually be upstate, sending him messages that she arrived, if the still has her jewelry.

Most people have lost/misplaced money and assume just that. we LOST it. Same goes for Kim later. All very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be (I think) a look at real people.

23734,"""Magnolia"" is a preposterous, bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Magnolia"" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of sad characters. Where is the reason to care for these people? The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot, who can't care for others (except for John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and are self-destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces for dying. I was reminded of how much I disliked ""Shine"" because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unappealing characters there, why would we want to spend time with them? Having said that, there is nothing held back about ""Magnolia."" Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed onto this canvas with abandon. There are two ideas in particular that bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this one hundred and eighty-eight-minute film. One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sweet, but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together.

23734,"""Magnolia"" is an absurd, confusing drama show that adds up to very little. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Magnolia"" is an aimless series of episodes with no regard for coherence. The camera flies through hallways and corridors and catches a glimpse of sad characters. Where is the reason to take care of these people? The common theme seems to be people who scream a lot, who can't care about others (with the exception of the characters of John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman) and who are self-destructive idiots who either fall to pieces to die for. I was reminded how much I didn't like ""Shine"" because of the irreversible monster monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unattractive characters out there, why should we hang out with them? Nevertheless, there is nothing to hold back on ""Magnolia"". Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are sprayed on this canvas with devotion. There are two main ideas that are bombing. Both happen in the last hour of this one hundred and eighty-eight minute film. One makes the camera jump from character to character while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Cute but ineffective as we can't see what is holding them all together. The other idea I am referring to cannot be revealed other than saying that it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous. ""Magnolia"" has a lot of great acting. Especially Tom Cruise, who unleashes a performance that I didn't know was in him. And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most decent and really good cop of recent times. But it all adds up to nothing.

There is not a single thing to recommend this film. Willis is good, as always. But the story stinks, is unbelievable, there is no real story, no action, no interesting cinematic sequences, no surprises, and worst of all, the child star is A thoroughly repulsive slug guaranteed to turn off any parent who does not have a dweeb fat slob for a kid.

Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper"". However, as I got older I found I was just too domesticated to live like that. Nonetheless, I still romanticize about living that kind of life.

Maybe if I had seen other stuff by him I would have enjoyed this one, knowing what to expect. I saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons. First of all, the film introduces interesting, deep issues about social relationships, feelings, the nature of reality versus fiction, but this is very often done in the clumsiest of ways making the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches, rambling on and on, juxtaposing declarations rather than having dialogues. The scriptwriters seem to be so worried that we will not get the point that they prefer to tell instead of showing. Secondly, the movie has no rhythm, especially in its first half. It is not only that it is slow. Some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of space and rhythm (El Sur by Victor Erice Or Scorsese's The Age of Innocence are examples I like), but for that to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so engaging for the story so moving that we can adapt to it. This does not happen in Beyond the Clouds, where the first episode seems to drag endlessly, and the relationship between John Malkovich's ""reality"" and the love stories ""fiction"" is at times fluid, others abrupt, others confusing.",negative

31060,"A remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the Women Lawyers Association (WLA) of Kumba, in southwest Cameroon, in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from facts of domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, according to Sharia law, one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children. After seventeen years of failed efforts, leaders of the WLA began recently to score a few wins, and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories. The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa, a state prosecutor, and Beatrice Ntuba, a senior judge (Court President). Both play themselves in this film, which may contain footage shot spontaneously, though I imagine much of it, if not all, consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera. Four cases are reviewed, and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film. Two cases involve repeated wife beating, with forcible sex in one case; another involves forced sex upon a ten year old girl; and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child, page eight, by an aunt. One of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce. We follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials. The outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children. The perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and/or fines; the divorce is granted. The aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender-neutral when it comes to enforcing the law. Also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties, including those found guilty, are treated. This is a highly important and well made film. (Of interest is the fact that one of the directors, Ms. Longinotto, also co-directed the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight film, Divorce, Iranian Style, which dealt with related themes in Tehran.)

I think the key there is that it was originally a play for the radio, so they filled in with the heroine just sitting around rather than pretending to be screen writers and actually writing any action. And the ending is horrendous. The whole movie is completely implausible, horribly written and almost comically acted. Beware this movie at all costs!",negative

And the acting is so very, very bad that you could get a sliver in your eye from all the scenery being chewed on. She's holding her hostage, kids are outside of it open screen, so she whimpers for help instead of screaming when she was brave enough to break windows and yell at the same kids a moment ago. She's finally free and alone in the house. Her chance to get help, so w hat is she doing? Wander around the house and lie down. It is locked in the basement. So what is she doing?

32119,"Absolutely one of the best aviation movies of all times on so many levels. Hardware junkies will drool over the largest single massing of flyable Spitfires outside of a Battle of Britain reenactment. No less than weight flying Spits are on hand for very accurate ground and air sequences. Those that marvel over the lore of flying and get misty-eyed reciting High Flight will identify with the central characters' reverence for the freedom of being fast, free and high in their Dark Blue World. Be warned: romantics and even dog lovers are treated to a very emotional ride in this movie. The score message is one that is shared by many war vets, in that their finest hours, their period of life when they felt most alive, was in fact during the war when everything else is sad and gray. The plot concerns Czech pilots who escape from their country when the Nazis invade and join the RAF Free Czech Squadron. There are a few subplots, all of which are worth careful attention. This is just a plain old excellent movie that even the most ardent anti-hardware romantic will love (keep the Kleenex on hand). Beautiful photography, first-rate acting, accurate details of RAF life during the Battle Of Britain. Easily a candidate for any aviation enthusiast's personal DVD collection.",positive

Camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor, who closes just about everything. I thought the whole movie was just sad, and downcast. If you like tragedies, you MIGHT like this.

33163,"Given its time of release, the story that unravels in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty thriller 'Panic in the Streets' was hardly a surprise. The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague. Yet with the current drama in the world today, this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today's viewers. The cast and crew are flawless. Richard Widmark in this first role following this breakthrough performance in 'Night and the City,' Jack Palance in this chilling film debut, also starring in this film are Paul Douglas and a young (and rather cute) Barbara Bel Geddes. A whole slew of uncredited, non-professional factors (typical of director Kazan) fill in the remaining slots. Elia Kazan directs, Joe MacDonald films (he would later work with Richard Widmark again in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three's much superior 'Pickup on South Street') and the great Alfred Newman scores it. Nearly everyone involved there has done better work, 'Panic in the Streets' is quite the rewarding watch, nonetheless. Especially for the film-noir enthusiast.",positive

It is not outrageous enough to appeal to the Will Ferrell crowd, and not interesting enough to carry the feature length.

Mind you it's not the movie's fault that IMDb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second (although I don't know how that's entered. maybe some moron from the film's crew put it in). Being a fan of the horror/comedy genre, I checked it out based on that and I'm so, so sorry I did. Where to start? First of all, to touch back on my beginning, there's no comedy in this movie. It tries once for twice, but never gets more than a chuckle at best. My reaction was primarily rolling my eyes and wondering why someone thought such tired material would be funny. Also, there's no horror there. Not a second of tension can be found. You think I'm exaggerating. I am not. No tension, very little blood, and not much violence on screen (sorry, but in a horror flick cutting away just as the good stuff starts is a major foul). Hell. there's even zero nudity. Call me a purist for juvenile. I prefer some in a horror flick if it can't come up with an original plot/premise. And that tired as all hell ""reality TV show gone wrong thing""? It's been done before and a lot better. Like Wrong Turn two for. ummm. whatever that movie was called with Edward Furlong. That's how bad this movie is.

39507,"Wow. I mean WOW this has got to be one of the best story's I've never had the chance to read/watch. We all know this famous story. Two martial artist, a man and this son, go to train in the forbidden Cursed Springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each. The dad, Genma, the spring of drowned Panda. And sixteen year old Ranma, the spring of drowned girl. Now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in. Crazy enough yet? No, that just the beginning. As if being one of the strongest teenagers to never exist who turns into a female was't enough, Ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane part styles, an insane high school principle, opponents right and left who have a score to settle with Ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow for for ""stealling"" their loved jones. And speaking of loved jones, I've lost track of how many times a boy for a girl has fallen in love with Ranma. And not once has it been this francée, Akane. And that just from the first few chapters/episodes of the series. The story itself is amazing. I have never come across something so crazy, so bizarre, so. so. out of this world and yet its so down to Earth and believable. I can't even describe it to its fullest. Its just a charming story that so easy to get into. What I like about it is the humour. Not once have I laughed out cloud this much from a manga, and it does't have to try any of the stunts you would catch in Simpson's for something of the sort. I could read any part of the comic and I would be laughing from beginning to send. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you would think making him too strong would be a set back but noon. with every little problem the story throws at him the's doing this best just to survive half the time and this personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst the can be a calculating genius. And to think, of the hundreds of perverts in the show, Ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in this town, more so by Akane, the worst pervert to never live. His father Genma, you would think the father character would blend in to the background right? Correct!

Check out the series if you haven't, NOW! You WILL NOT regret it! Though I would advise checking the comic out first. I like the anime, but I've had some trouble getting the series at a good price. And a small nitpick, the humour does't seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga. I think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me.

39507,"Wow. I mean, WOW, that has to be one of the best stories I've ever read / watched. We all know this famous story. Two martial artists, a man and this son, go to the forbidden Cursed Springs to train and while ignoring their warnings, they both fall into a spring. The father, Genma, the source of the drowned panda. And sixteen-year-old Ranma, the source of the drowned girl. Now with every splash of cold water they transform themselves into the very essence of the spring in which they landed. Crazy enough already? No, this is just the beginning. As if being one of the toughest teenagers who never existed turning into a woman wasn't enough, Ranma has to deal with crazy martial arts teachers and hundreds of crazy part styles, one crazy high school principle, opponents right and left grappling with settling a score with Ranma Wither for somehow messing up her life early on, for ""stealing"" her beloved Jones. Speaking of beloved Jones, I've lost track of the number of times a boy has fallen in love with Ranma for a girl. And not once has it been this French, Akane. And only from the first few chapters / episodes of the series. The story itself is amazing. I've never seen anything so crazy, so strange, like that. so. out of this world and yet so down to earth and credible. I cannot describe it in full. It's just an enchanting story that is so easy to get into. What I like about it is the humor. I've never laughed so much at a manga before, and it doesn't have to be one of the stunts you'd find in the Simpsons for something like that. I could read any part of the comic and would send myself laughing from the start. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you might think making him too strong would be a setback, but at noon. With every little problem history throws at him, he does best to survive only half the time and that personality is that of a foolish boy it seems, but at worst he can be a calculating genius . And when you think of the hundreds of perverts on the show, Ranma hating the idea of ​​perverts all together is viewed by everyone in this town, even more so by Akane, the worst pervert who never lived. His father Genma, you might think that the father figure would blend into the background, right? Right! But always when they are in the spotlight. that just gives you more reasons to hate him and love him at the same time! You think you never know the worst dad from an anime? You haven't met Genma yet. Ryoga, probably one of Ranma's greatest rivals and my favorite character (next to Ranma). and probably one of the few people who can actually take it. Probably the strongest character in the series but has two flaws, one is this curse that turns him into a baby pig, but this worst flaw. is this black sense in the direction! Then we have.

And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney blow her work was wrong. An animated feature film, perhaps in the vane of Don Bluth's artwork would suit a better Mrs. Murphy film.

The plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart. The lead falls for a icon man and it does't occur to her that she might get conned????? And she's rich???? And she's a famous psychologist????? COME ON, people. She enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her??? That was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewers. Rain man would have been insulted. I also admit that I despise Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters, war-starters, and fur-wearers. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I'll give it a shot. That it's not supposed to sound real is fine. I don't care. It's that everyone talks the SAME. Mamet can't create characters; all the can do is foist this voice on us relentlessly through different factors. No wonder this factors are so wooden. They're confused about everyone being the same character. (However, this later films do improve.)",negative

Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue this dreams because of this overbearing, manipulative father, it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, it is without doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has my ten out of ten rating without reservation. This movie spin-off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word. Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is transferred successfully onto film. This movie has a very dreary, depressing stone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions. Seeing Harold being beaten up in a pub (and not in a comical way) is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the TV series will not like this movie. The movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour. The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of stone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie never bothered to watch the TV series. In the TV series, Harold always went after respectable girls, not strippers. Albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by Harold's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the TV series. In the movie, Albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises.

But, STEPTOE AND SON has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile, even below GEORGE AND MILDRED. My advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead.

Based on the book ""Evil Angels"" and titled so in its Australian release, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch. It presents a scenario that's all too real for us in America: the switch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target. Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who did't play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she did't kill her own child. The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece. And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as never, even when her husband Michael was falling apart. This stance, of course, is the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may look like, and people happen to react strongly to that. They want to see a distressed mother cry and sweep and occasionally faint at every turn, not sit there and look blank. People don't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations. Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman, one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have this character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to, for the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that.

It's such a sad thing when one finds him/herself in love with a bad seed. And especially if it's someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive person, though pathetic. In the send, the acting was what came through and not the plot. The ending scene was particularly good, but I am not one to give it away. Although others may find this movie good, I was one who found it so-so. I should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what may happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person.",negative

Bette Davis did a perfect job, however, and she made me hate her and pity her all the time. Leslie Howard did very well as Philip Carey in love, and I pitied him so much throughout the film that he fell in love with such a terrible lady. It's so sad when you fall in love with a bad seed. And especially when it's someone like Philp Carey who is a sensitive, if pathetic, person. On the show, the acting was what came through, not the plot. The final scene was particularly good, but I'm not going to reveal it. Even if others think this film is good, I was someone who found it so-so.

47827,"Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins. The premise is that the nation's dissidents (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are being rounded up and tried by a tribunal and then given the choice of prison for running the course of Punishment Park. It's a fifty-two mile gruelling trek through the desert to an American flag, with police, National Guard, and various other authority figures in pursuit. The idea is, that if you make it to the flag, you're set free. The tribunal consists of a bunch of conservative types, all condemning any behavior that is not like their own, and there is no result except a prison sentence for the option of ""Punishment Park"" for any of those on trial. There are a lot of things in this that still bring true today, which is quite disturbing in itself. The people running the course are promised water at the half-way point, which in't true, and the pursuing officials are mostly a sadistic bunch that are just out for a bit of target practice. This is not a very graphic film but it's more shocking in its ideas and themes than anything else. The scary thing is, it could happen. Not a very upbeat film but definitely worth seeing. Warning: it might make you angry. nine out of ten.",positive

I think this is the most beautiful of any Thomas Edison films. It shows a girl dancing and moving her dress all around, which turns red with the film. It's just beautiful. You are watching history when you watch this. You are watching what began to make movies of the day great! This may not have a plot, for anything very interesting, but this is the second colour film never. I recommend this to everyone, especially if you're teaching students about filming for something of the sort, you have to show them what began color films!",positive

48442,"The Godfather Part I was a stunning look inside the fictional Corleone family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances the never wanted to have a part of. The Godfather Part II shows that young man's acceptance of this new role, this desensitization of character, as well as this complete loss of all innocence as the dives deeper and deeper into a life of crime. The first two parts of this saga of this transformation of Michael Corleone make for one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic history. Then, along came The Godfather Part III. Michael Corleone is now the aging Don of the Corleone family. He shows remorse for this previous actions not through subtle behavior, but by trying to use this powers for good and admitting all this wrongdoings and regrets to others. Very cliche and uncharacteristic of the complex character that is Michael Corleone. Michael's plans to use this powers for good are derailed by an ambitious young disciple and this enemies. Michael's daughter is eventually a casualty of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to Michael realizing that this entire life as Don has been worthless for the has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position the was in: protecting this family. The Godfather Part II ends with Michael Corleone reaching the lowest of the flows: having this own brother killed. Before Part III was made, the Godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young man's journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic send of Michael forgetting this roots and abandoning the one thing that has always mattered most to him and those around him: family loyalty. Part III paints the picture of Michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of circumstance. This greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two films. The Godfather Part III is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made. The only solution to the problem that is this final instalment of The Godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with Michael's shockingly horrible act of having a member of this own family killed.",negative

49063,"Trick for Treat, Quickie Review This zany romp of a film revolves around the eighty's culture of Heavy Metal and horror movies--two things which I love dearly. So, as you can imagine, this movie appealed to me pretty easily. Plus, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. This film is about an unpopular high school youth who, like all us losers, ended up drenched in a world of ""evil"" Heavy Metal. His favourite Metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected--by playing this latest unreleased album backwards. This allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and ash*t helping out. Okay, it's pretty cheesy at times, but you know what? It's got a surprising number of good qualities. Decent acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very brief nudity, decent atmosphere. All in all, it's actually a decent horror film. But what really sucks is the music. Ironic, huh? Well, this ""uber-evil"" Metal guy is one of the most obnoxious, high-pitched, wailing, Motley Crue rejects on the planet--and the ""Metal"" is little more than putrid eighty's Pop/Hair Metal. He hits all the clické's there, from prancing around like a gay fairy, to looking mean, to screaming ""Rock and Roll!!!"" in a pitch high enough to make King Diamond wretch. Aside from that atrocious musical representation, it's actually pretty good. seven/tenwww. ResidentHazard.com",positive

49195,"This is probably the most uninvolving film I've never seen. I watched it because I have a soft spot for Leon (everything else Besson has done has been just awful, in my opinion, with the exception of the script for Wasabi) and Jean Reno. It's a testament to just how bad this film is that Reno, one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable factors (admittedly the's just starting out there) can't make this film, for the moments in which the is on screen, watchable. It's all very film-schooly: black and white, no dialogue, people doing things for no apparent reason, people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera. And, predictably, none of it is entertaining. It's not a ""French Mad Max"" as some people have claimed (actually, I think they mean ""Mad Max two"") - that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting, and is just the kind of comment you'd expect from someone who does't know what they're talking about. Mad Max two was pulsating, Mad Max two was exciting, Mad Max two was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is none of these. I know it's supposed to be cool to like party black-and-white French films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not (or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy), which is why I would't trust anyone who claims to like Le Dernier Combat, because I see nothing of worth in it whatsoever; it tasks for so much and gives nothing back. I found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention. Anyone who can sit through it undistracted in't human, for, at the very most, is psychotic. (Actually, they're probably just trying to seem ""cool"").",negative

49991,"Les Visiteurs, the first movie about the medieval time travellers was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an factor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course plain absurdness, that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes. Now this sequel has the same characters, the same factors in great part and the same time travelling. The plot changes a little, since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travellers. So they jump up and down in history, without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie. The duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep the whole thing together with this playing, but this character has been emptied, so there's not a lot the can do to save the film. Now the duke's slave/helper, the has really all the attention. The movie is merely about him and this being clumsy / annoying / stupid for whatever the was supposed to be. Fact is; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience, but the does not succeed. It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke, you already know, but the insists on telling that joke still the send, adding details, to make your suffering a little longer. If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you did't like Les Visiteurs, you would never consider seeing the sequel.
