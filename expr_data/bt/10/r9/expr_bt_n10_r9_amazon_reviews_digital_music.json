One of the first true supergroups that I can recall - Wetton (most notably from King Crimson and UK), Howe (Yes), Palmer (ELP), and Downes (Buggles and Yes). Steve Howe and Carl Palmer were ungodly superstars in their perspective bands during the seventy's. I remember buying the vinyl based on the strength of \"Sole Survivor\". I remember thinking with these progressive musicians at the helm, there'd have to be some ten-twelve minute spacey head trips. That's where the mixed feelings came in. All the songs were in the four to five minute range (\"Here Comes The Feeling\" is the longest track at five:forty-two). Wetton and Downes were the main writers there. and Downes prior catalog with the Buggles was \"pop\" to the max. In retrospect, I now know why Asia had that pop feel - it was Geoff Downes all along. Not that it's a bad thing. Asia's sound just was't what I was expecting. This album is heavy on keyboards. Steve Howe's guitar remains mostly in the background outside of a few shining guitar solos. The bass work is great. Carl Palmer's drumming is steady, but it's nothing flashy like this days with ELP. Wetton's vocals are top notch. It's the songs that eventually made me come around, as it did for so many listeners (and radio stations). Asia's debut spent nine weeks at #one on the U. S. album chart. \"Heat Of The Moment\" (reaching #four), \"Sole Survivor\" (#ten), and \"Only Time Will Tell\" (#seventeen) were huge Top forty hits. Billboard named the Asia debut as album of the year. Compilations are saturated with songs from their onest album - \"The Very Best Of Asia: Heat Of The Moment one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two-ninety\" has six of the nine songs from it's debut, and \"Asia - Gold\" (two thousand and five) incredibly contains all nine songs.

Few of them recall (at least at first) Van Halen, who emerged synthesizer sounds with sonic guitar solos on \"one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four.\" Van Halen made it okay for hard rock bands to use synthesizers. Sure, bands like STYX incorporated such instruments into their music, but they were't considered rock gods on the same level as Eddie and Co. With this album came the omega-hit, \"Jump.\" It brought Van Halen's sound into the mainstream radio arena and exposed them to a lot of people who did't listen to rock music up to that point. It also gave us \"Panama,\" \"I'll Wait,\" \"Drop Dead Legs\" and \"Girl Gone Bad.\" Sure to remind us that these synthesizing boys still know how to be bad, Alex Van Halen hits the listener with a barrage of drums to open up my personal favourite on this album, \"Hot For Teacher.\" This song is almost a kick in the teeth compared to the rest of the album. It's nothing more than dirty fun and pure rock in' roll. This is definitely one of the best albums never cranked out by Van Halen before Sammy Hagar took the frontman position. Heck, it's one of the best Van Halen albums never. I highly recommend it to any fan of true hard rock music. It's a great album.","overall":5,"summary":"Relax, The Synthesizers Sound Great","unixReviewTime":1183939200,"reviewTime":"07 9, 2007"}

Mark Knopfler even publicly apologized for it on MTV by saying \"No offence\". Apparently even the could't believe how popular it became. The song takes stinging jabs at artists who make boatloads of money but, according to the character in the song, don't actually work, for at least produce nothing of real value. Nonetheless, the same character shows bottomless envy for those who learn their \"checks for free\". Background vocals by Sting (who was as big as solar prominence in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five) did't hurt the song's popularity. The band's appearance at one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five's Live Aid, complete with Sting, led to a classic comment by an MTV VJ: \"Who would expect Sting and Dire Straits together?\" Well, they did collaborate on an album, so it was't really that big of a shock. Then the video (with its now blocky and primitive-looking computer graphics) came out and the song catapulted to nearly everywhere. No one could escape, even if they wanted to.\"Brothers in Arms\" follows the typical template of Dire Strait's other albums: A couple of absolutely incredible songs, many great songs, and a few merely good jones (total duds are exceedingly rare). Overall, the album begins with astonishing momentum, dips down quite a bit, and slowly climbs its way back to a level somewhat below the beginning. Without doubt the strongest songs are the first three. All were hits. Then \"Your Latest Trick\" suddenly dips the adrenaline down somewhat, and \"Why Worry\" dips it down even further, almost to a soporific level. Then the space begins to build again with \"Ride Across the River\" and it does't let up until the great closing title track. \"The Man's Too Strong\" is a vastly underrated song hidden on what was once \"Side Two\". Some of Knopfler's best lyrics also hide there. The chunky guitar driven \"One World\" kicks the space up after a series of mid-tempo songs. The closing title track is another unjustly overlooked song. It's disturbing, beautiful, and forlorn. Knopfler's trademark volume-pedal-assisted guitar appropriately pervades the song. One could debate about whether for not \"Brothers in Arms\" deserves the title \"Best Dire Straits Album\". In some ways it does and in some ways it does't. In the send, it really does't matter, it's still a great album with some of the greatest eightys pop never recorded. Unfortunately, Dire Strait's speak also signalled the beginning of the send of the band. The follow-up \"On Every Street\" did't even come close to the commercial popularity of \"Brothers In Arms\" (though the band must be given loads of credit for not putting out a carbon copy of their omega-seller). Following a few live albums, Dire Straits appears to have disappeared altogether. Knopfler is still recording and releasing albums (his latest was released this past September and charted all over the world), but the reign of Dire Staits clearly ended sometime in the late one thousand, nine hundred and eightys. Still, they left behind some great music, and provided a breath of fresh air in the sometimes stultifying one thousand, nine hundred and eightys pop scene.","overall":4,"summary":"Helped make the 1980s tolerable...","unixReviewTime":1102377600,"reviewTime":"12 7, 2004"}

This album, \"Tap Root Manuscript\", was the result of one such attempt to experiment with African sounds and instruments, and one that resulted in both commercial success and a number of top ten hits straight from the album paid off. Some of the songs like \"Crackling Rosie\" weren't part of the concept, others like \"Soolaimon\" definitely were. In any case, the combination of the two aspects of the album made it a number one on the Billboard rating. Includes other popular songs like \"Done Too Soon\" and a cover of \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\". I particularly like the entire African song cycle, from \"Childsong\" to its reprise when the album was shipped. \"I am The Lion,\" \"Madrigal,\" and \"African Suite\" are all interesting and quite innovative for the late one thousand nine hundred and sixty timeframe of the original recording. This was a seminal album and another step in the growing number of recordings Diamond made during this reign as one of America's most popular singer-songwriters of the one thousand nine hundred sixty and one thousand nine hundred and seventy.

Burt Bacharach composed some of the best pop music in the sixties and early seventies, but when the broke up with longtime collaborator Hal David, the seemed to close this way artistically, especially as the veered toward overproduced deck with then-wife Carole Bayer Sager. Unfortunately this music still charted, so the had no motivation to come back to the type of pop music the does best. In fact, I thought the was exiled into a permanent retro-deification state until I heard this disc. Paired most uncharacteristically with Elvis Costello, Bacharach the composer sounds rejuvenated on this recording as if the last thirty years did not even occur. The momentous orchestra swells, the piano key tinkling, the unmistakable flugelhorns, the gossamer female background vocals and above all, the sweeping, unapologetic romanticism - they are all back in stylish, timeless form with some fresh, intricate lyrics courtesy of Costello, who sings with surprising visor without a hint of irony for unwarranted nostalgia. Each song is a gem. \"In the Darkest Place\" starts things off in a dusky mood with an intoxicating piano dictating the cocktail lounge rhythm. \"Toledo\" is a bouncy though more melancholy cousin to \"Do You Know the Way to San Jose?\" with its geography-driven lyrics. \"Tears at the Birthday Party\" has the silliest, double-entendre lyrics this side of Jimmy Webb's \"MacArthur Park\", but it has an infectious beat and a soaring chorus that its lightheartedness provides a welcome respite. The title track is a lovely ballad driven by a piano and guitar that reminds me fondly of \"Alfie\" with its escalating strings and swooning notes. \"The Sweetest Punch\" is pop music at its catchy best with a bringing bell response to Costello's crooning of \"You knock me out\/It was the sweetest punch\/The bell goes. \". Both \"This House Is Empty Now\" and \"What's Her Name Today?\" are powerful ballads that will remind you immediately of Bacharach classics like \"A House Is Not a Home\", \"A Message to Michael\" and \"One Less Bell to Answer\". Regardless, the closing track, \"God Give Me Strength\", is the artistic high point and the initial reason why Bacharach and Costello partnered for this recording. Written for Allison Anders' one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six faux-Carole King biopic movie, \"Grace of My Heart\", it was a poignant moment when the Denise Waverly character sings this ballad with such uncertain yearning and romantic fervour that the faux-Brian Wilson character could not help but be impressed enough to sign her up for this label. While I still prefer the more plaintive Kristen Vigard version (to which Ileana Douglas clip synched in the film), Costello sings with a surprising emotional wallop wrapping this voice around a full orchestra led by a mournful trumpet that provides the appropriate crescendo to this masterful recording. Strongly recommended.","overall":5,"summary":"Bacharach in Classic Form With Costello a Fine Troubadour","unixReviewTime":1114560000,"reviewTime":"04 27, 2005"}

While it is easy to compare Dido with artists such as Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins, and Sin\u00e9ad O'Conner, Dido has her own style. This CD opens with \"Here with Me,\" a heartfelt song of longing and love. The delicate music with Dido's soulful voice sends shivers down my spine. This song is haunting and ethereal, and deeply emotional, establishing the theme for this CD. All the delicacy is gone with the feral song \"Hunter.\" Dido has gone from singing about the person she wants to be with her to telling her love interest that she wants to be on the hunt again, away from him. Dido's voice is quiet, yet assured. She is asking him to let her go, yet you sense from the vocals that while she is providing him with the opportunity, she will do it eventually with for without this approval. She is the hunter. The third track is another relationship phase: after the breakup. The lyrics seem a bit strange after the heartfelt vocals of longing in the first song and the cat on the prowl strength of the third song. In this song she is more simpering and petty and thinking way too much about him. Given the strength of character in the first two songs, this song seems out of character. The next song, \"My Lover's Gone,\" brings Dido back on track. This time she sings the loss of her lover. The lyrics are poignant and mournful. The emotion she brings to her voice matches the lyrics well. The haunting instruments supporting the vocals are in sync rather than counterpoint. The music and instruments are delicate and misty, and have a Celtic quality to them, combining modern musical elements with an hairy new page style. Keeping with melancholy themes is a song to a departed lover in \"All You Want.\" The harmonies and the lyrics are the highlight of this composition. On the one hand Dido laments the loss of her lover, but she also does not accept that the left for another woman, and essentially says that the made this bed, and the can sleep in it. As in most of the previous songs she remains, while upset and regretful, in control. The next song did well on the charts, and is a pretty song about how someone can brighten a person's life. Dido's vocals are electronically manipulated to increase the complexity of this song, with overdubs and echo. This pop song is bright and friendly and has a catchy beat that combine to make this one of the most radio friendly songs on the CD. This song is also likely to show up in movies, if it has yet to do so. Getting back to a more melancholy stone is \"Honestly OK.\" The topic is loneliness and feeling the need to share life with someone. There is a sharp beat to this song that shows some ship-hop influence, though not in the vocals. This song turns depression into emotional part.\"Slide\" brings to mind Sade. The sumptuous mellow vocal overlays and the vocal style are reminiscent of some of Sade's music. Once again Dido's voice takes charge of the song and the subject, which is dealing with mistakes and the every day tribulations of life. The electronic touches are subdued and supportive and provide an interesting and unique feel. The drums retain just a touch of island beat, again similar to some of Sade's music. However, in the send this song is Dido's. The ninth track is melancholic, and yet the song keeps itself about a maudlin level to provide an enjoyable listening experience. \"Isobel\" is about love, regret and quiet resentment. It is amazing that Dido can using about loving someone more who is in the process of going away, but that is where she found strength to carry on.\"I'm no Angel\" says that regardless of whether she is an angel, she tries hard to do the right thing. The lyrics are interesting and well performed. However, it seems that the vocal style is less in charge and Dido seems to struggle just a little to keep up with the instruments. Because of the power of the other songs on this CD we know she has the ability, so it is perception rather than fact. The result is that vocally this track is one of the weaker jones on this CD. Dido reasserts herself lyrically and vocally in \"My Life.\" Dido could have sang this song with a regretful stone, as though she is breaking up with someone for has differences with someone that are causing her to do something she does not want to do. Instead she says she does what she does because she is in charge of herself. The steady beat is assured and is beautifully and quietly executed musically. This song also seems to reflect Dido's true personality, which shows up in earlier songs. Perhaps this song also dares anyone to criticize her music, advising everyone that this music is who she is and she cares not what anyone says about it.\"Take My Hand\" is a deep song, expressing the empathy that someone can have for another for whom they care deeply. When you are that deeply in love for someone there can be no lies because the emotions are plain to see; a wonderful and pretty song with a fast beat that proclaims the depths love can achieve. The music and the vocals in this song are strong to underscore the strength of the singer's love. Listen to this album without distractions, because these songs are emotional and complex. The music is beautiful, the lyrics are well written. The few moments of weakness are well outweighed by the strength of the remaining songs. This excellent album is for those who like Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins and perhaps even Enya.","overall":5,"summary":"Emotional Mood Pop","unixReviewTime":1106179200,"reviewTime":"01 20, 2005"}

The ninth track is melancholy, and yet the song stays on a maudlin level to provide a pleasant listening experience. \"Isobel\" is about love, regret and silent resentment. It's amazing that Dido can handle loving someone more who is about to leave, but this is where she found the strength to move on. \"I'm not an angel\" says that whether or not she is an angel she tries hard to do the right thing.

Dieses Lied scheint auch Didos wahre Pers\u00f6nlichkeit widerzuspiegeln, die sich in fr\u00fcheren Liedern zeigt. Vielleicht fordert dieser Song auch jeden heraus, ihre Musik zu kritisieren, und weist alle darauf hin, dass diese Musik so ist, wie sie ist und es ihr egal ist, was jemand dar\u00fcber sagt wen sie sehr interessieren. Wenn man so tief in jemanden verliebt ist, kann es keine L\u00fcgen geben, weil die Emotionen klar zu sehen sind; ein wunderbarer und h\u00fcbscher song mit einem schnellen beat, der die tiefe verk\u00fcndet, die die liebe erreichen kann.

This is a questionable move, considering the stigma attached to \"selling out.\" If this is true, then Astro Lounge should be avoided on principle. However, the difference between the two albums tends to be exaggerated. The songs on Astro Lounge simply emphasize the surf aspect of their music, adding elements of fifty's sci-fi movie soundtracks, while Fush Yu Mang stressed the ska-punk part. Now, with that out of the way, it's time to look at the album itself. One thing is undeniable: this album is popper than Fush Yu Mang. Unlike the previous album, Astro Lounge has at least three single-worthy itunes, compared to Fush Yu Mang's two. Of course, it's the non single tracks that make for break an album. Here's where the album starts to falter. Much of it is good, but I can't help thinking that I'm listening to a novelty band. It's almost like they're trying too hard to be unique.

This is a questionable move given the stigma associated with the \"sell-off\". If this is the case, Astro Lounge should be avoided as a matter of principle. However, the difference between the two albums tends to be exaggerated. The songs on Astro Lounge simply emphasize the surf aspect of their music and add elements of the soundtracks from 50s science fiction films, while Fush Yu Mang emphasized the ska-punk element. Now that that's done, it's time to check out the album for yourself. One thing cannot be denied: this album is more pop than Fush Yu Mang. In contrast to the previous album, Astro Lounge has at least three single-worthy Itunes compared to the two by Fush Yu Mang. Of course, it's the non-single tracks that make an album. Here the album begins to falter. Much of it is good, but I can't help but think that I'm hearing a novelty band. It's almost like they're trying too hard to be unique. Of course this is pop \/ rock so trying to analyze too deeply is likely a mistake. In short, if you can handle a little TRL, you shouldn't have too much of a problem with this one. three, five stars.","overall":3,"summary":"But Fush Yu Mang sounded different!!!","unixReviewTime":1041638400,"reviewTime":"01 4, 2003"}

A. The concert was an eighty's celebration that included The Cure, Duran Duran, Echo and the Bunnymen, Violent Femmes, Psychedelic Furs, along with many other classic alternative bands. A few new bands had sets in between the bigger well known facts. One of those was Hot Hot Heat, who I entirely hated. As my friend and I were talking about how we really did't like this wave of new bands being pushed, we heard something interesting coming from the stage. That was the sound of Interpol. The irony was wonderful. My friend and I both stopped talking, and really got into the music. The next day I ordered the album. I'm sorry to do this again because I know this comparison has been made to death, but honestly, the first thought I had when I heard this band was \"Wow, that guy sounds like Ian Curtis\" (of Joy Division). I guess this bothers some so-called JD purists, but I really enjoyed it. Ian Curtis hung himself over twenty-five years ago! So I, for one, am happy to have another vocalist around with such a characteristic voice. At least the does't sound like those whitney guys from The Strokes, Jet, for The Hives! When this CD arrived in the email, I was very pleased. The voice is where the comparison to Joy Division stops. The music has it's own character, and the delivery and content of the lyrics have a totally different message. These guys write very thick songs, with a lot going on. On the surface a few people have complained that all of Interpol's songs sound the same. When the volume in turned up and the listener pays attention, they can really hear the complexity of the rhythm section, and the great rhythm guitar work. No, this in't Radiohead for Sonic Youth, but I don't think they're trying to be. This is a straight ahead rock band, and they do it very well. I think, if given the proper space, this band has a lot of room to grow. I can't wait to see what they'll produce in the future (I still haven't picked up their second album).

Attention all other female wrappers: Don't pick up the open for the microphone unless you are one hundred% sure you can spit comparable to Eve.

It will probably take a few listens in order for you to get used to it. It's good though because it portrays Swizz beat broadening imagination via music creation and also shows Eve to have an ability to rhyme on even the weirdest beats. \"Gangsta Loving\" no doubt is one of the best but probably the best tune on this album is \"Double R What\" where Eve craps alongside Fellow Ruff Ryder's Jadakiss and Styles, but my personal favourite would be \"Figure You Out\" because of the smooth rhythms she throws with Teflon is really nice.

A lot of people sure do bellyache about the black of musical talent Jack and Meg have but seldom do they discuss the actual songwriting itself. Sure it may be easy to play Seven Nation Army on guitar but could you write it? If as many people could invent Stripes songs as could play them, then why parent there more people making millions and gaining international recognition rather than writing customer reviews? Others claim a twoD sound, which I agree with if what they mean (and seem to suggest) is that there is an obvious black of everything except a guitar and a drumset. However, one thing that has always amazed me about the stripes is that their sound is larger than their ensemble would suggest based on appearance. On some songs, Jack out-rocks (if that's even a word) entire, so-called rock bands. Usually, I am not a huge fan of these new minimalist groups but the stripes are an exception.

The beat is just gangsta and the intro is priceless. it'll get you rowdy that's for sure. Don't go thinking the album is all trunk anthems though. `Hate Ourselves' feat.

But a person would have to seriously have a smoke to do anything with this guy. It's huge. Figuratively and literally. The Bonecrusher anthem is more than a regional hit. but a national phenomenon. They pump this as in the north and in the wild wild west and even in Canada. His signature \"KING KONGGGGG!\" Does him justice, because this guy is ready to conquer your city and destroy everyone in this way. Lyrically only average. But that's okay with me, because this strength is music that you go to can, music to party to, music to fight to. Up, For the Streets and Lane to Lane should keep the hype. However, the next single should definitely be Grippin The Grain. The beat is just gangsta and that Intro is priceless. It will surely make you rowdy, but I think the album is all anthems. `Hate Ourselves' feat. Goodie Mob (YES Goodie Mob) is arguably the best song on the album. An uplifting song about hating ourselves . \"All I want to do is give love \/ but all day mean Woodies Mug \/ that's how it brings out the bat in me \/ and all I want is my family ily with me\" soulful productions and soulful choruses, while Big Gipp, T-Mo and Khujo on the Mik ro work diligently. 'Ghetto Song' is more of that kind of lava that is about hope and seeing the light in America's dark ghettos. `The Wall 'is also about the fight against poverty, even if it's more of a vocal type. Bonecrusher has what it takes to convert some anti-southern fans on this album and fans of southern music will definitely feel the effort. Recommended.","overall":4,"summary":"King Konggggggggggggggg!","unixReviewTime":1053907200,"reviewTime":"05 26, 2003"}

The result is one almost perfect album, with emphasis on moody, generous-sounding and soothing songs. Those small charms of the tracks don't grow on you as quickly as you might like, but the rewards are all the better for it. The first three songs summarize the feel of the CD very well, being rather similar in tempo but equally different and beautiful in their own way. On \"Chances Are\", the artist chooses a trip-hoppy path treated so well with \"Safe and Sound\" from the two thousand and two \"C'mon C'mon\". And the fabulous \"Always on Your Side\" (soon afterwards remade as a duet with Sting) deserves to go down as one of the most gorgeous songs of early stages of this millennium.

I first came to know them from their contribution to the Hunger Games soundtrack, Abraham's Daughter, which was one of the best tracks on the cd. The first thing that struck me about Reflektor was all the lyrical imagery and references to not only the classic Orpheus myth but the film Black Orpheus as well. I won't bog you down with the details of the tale, but treat yourself to a quick refresh to help frame the context of the songs. Even if you don't, the album remains quite enjoyable. The entire album keeps a seventies-ish, riding-the-cusp-of-disco savant-garde groove to it and the never-present reverb and other assorted dissonant sounds mixed in are kind of like how Portishead used to do. Reflektor brought to mind classic efforts from bands like The Clash, Norman Greenbaum and even the Beatles among others. Some highlights:The title track, Reflektor, is fun to listen to, if a little long- built off a steady beat and bassline you can easily get with. Flashbulb Eyes- a little surfer-style rhythm guitar, snare drums, some FX. but all I can really say is you're gonna love the old stool reggae bass running through this one. Here Comes the Nighttime- an absolute slice of Black Orpheus there. Its ska-styled bass and keyboard bottom, filtering, xylophone, and isolated guitar riff absolutely revoke images of strutting down the street during carnival somewhere, especially when the tempo shifts- the bassline carries the whole thing. Awesome. Normal Person- off to a fun start with some nightclub dialogue before switching to a true classic style; bass, rhythm guitar and drum with some piano included. And the the lyrics were fun. All told it not only reminded me of David Bowie in this prime but kinda White Stripe-y as well. Joan Of Arc- very Norman Greenbaum-ish there, and not just for the quasi-religious overtones of the lyrics. There's a definite Spirit in the Sky thing going on there. Here Comes the Nighttime two- any song that incorporates them old Dolby Digital tones used at the start and send of cassette tapes is alright with me! The lyric structure and synth arrangement there are eerily reminiscent of the Beatles' A Day In The Life. Check it out and see if you agree. It's Never Over (Oh, Orpheus)- slowly builds up from hairy synth into a bass\/bottom rhythm, soon followed by a great drum\/guitar combo. The lyrics are wholly derived from the Orpheus myth (. just wait until it's over\/wait until it's through. no turning 'round too soon). And that's a nice pulse beat bridge dropped in before coming back to the instruments. Supersymmetry- wholly a keyboard composition, the half-whispered lyrics of the duet strikes yet another chord, this time the Rolling Stone's Emotional Rescue. Even the chorus is done in a similar vein. You might think I'm calling this album derivative, but I'm not. I rather enjoyed the trip down memory lane it provided- intentionally for not. Even if they've consciously drawn references from other groups, as they did with the Greek myth, I'm not complaining. It all made for a good listen and brought a new fan.","overall":4,"summary":"Mythical Music","unixReviewTime":1383004800,"reviewTime":"10 29, 2013"}
