2091,"Movie about two Australian girls--Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight)--and what happens when they become girlfriends of two surfer guys. I caught this at an part cinema there in America in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one. Technically I was still a teenager (I was nineteen) so I was interested in seeing how Australian teens acted. Script wise there's nothing new there. It shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating, sex, suicide etc etc. I always knew what was going to happen before it did but I was never bored. What I found interesting was, despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair, these teenagers karen't much different than American teens. They had many of the same difficulties and hang-ups. Also this was based on a book from a real surfer girl and her true life adventures and (I heard) it was a faithful adaptation of it. The acting was just OK but the factors were attractive and this was well-made and pretty interesting. So this is no unsung masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it's like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids. I give it a seven.",positive

2200,"I finally caught up to ""Starlight"" last night on television and all I can say is. . . wow! It's hard to know where to begin -- the incredibly hokey special effects (check out the laser beams shooting out of Willie's eyes!), the atrocious acting, the ponderous dialogue, the mismatched use of stock footage, for the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production. This truly is a one-of-a-kind experience, and we should all be thankful for that. I nominate Jonathon Kay as the true their to Ed Wood!",negative
2200,"I finally caught up with ""Starlight"" on TV last night and can only say. . . Impressive! It's hard to know where to start - the incredibly weird special effects (look at the laser beams shooting out of Willie's eyes!), The gruesome acting, the clumsy dialogue, the inappropriate use of stock footage, for seeming more serious Presumption that runs through the entire production. This is truly a unique experience and we should all be grateful for it. I'm nominating Jonathon Kay as the real Ed Wood!",negative

I used to rent it so often from this one video store that used to carry it, and when we moved I could't find it any where so I kep going back tot the far away store just so I could watch the movie again! Finally i found it for sale and I bought it and watched it over and over again. great movie! Since then though it was my very first DVD that I got after I got my DVD player. OK well I got them at the same time, the quality on the DVD is way better I could't believe it! You Gotta see this one!",positive

4027,"How does David Lynch do it? Unlike the legions of thick-black-framed-glasses-wearing types and pretentious movie critics who praise this name, I just don't see how this guy keeps getting paid to make such stripe. How can Lynch sloppily cobble together leftover footage from a failed TV pilot into a nonsensical, poorly-acted mess & have critics grave about it & actually include it on Year's Best lists? I'm baffled. If you're looking for a good film nor, rent ""Bound"" instead. If you're looking for a good ""puzzle"" movie try ""Memento."" But beware of this over-hyped stinker unless your idea of a fun night is throwing away two one/two hours of your life & $three.fifty of your hard-earned cash.",negative

5437,"I am fully aware there is no statistical data that readily supports the correlation between video games and real life violence. The movie is false and phone because it is in complete contradiction of itself, which is what I tried to emphasize in my original review. The movie fails, not necessarily because I really do think these kids were influenced by video games, but because the movie sets it up as ""random"" and does't follow through. Let me clarify. In Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer, you can see her claims about the police and being controlled by radio waves are ridiculous, yet she is so troubled, she really believes them to be true. The viewer can make the distinction however. In Zero Day, the two kids keep saying how they are not influenced by anything environmental, which is obviously false since everything they do contradicts this. Neo-nazism, talking about going on CNN with Wolf Blitzer (which is laughable not only because they know this name, but its a shameless attempt by the filmmaker to get coverage of this bad movie). etc. This movie does't depict 'reality', it shows nothing but phoniness to prove a point. Unfortunately you fell for the bait and did't see this, and you did't pick up on it from my review either. The entire movie is just taking Michael Moore's hypothesis and applying it to something ""real life"" in hopes of validating and it fails, not necessarily because the hypothesis is wrong, but because the movie is wrong and does't support it. Of course I don't think kids that play video games are more likely to kill people, but if I'm not mistaken, did't video tape exist of the Columbine kids (or some teen killers) shooting guns in the forest claiming how much they looked for acted like the weaponry in Doom? Hmmmmmmm, the distinction is kids are most likely aware of the media, influenced, but obviously balanced for intelligent enough that its not even an issue. Zero Day is a bad movie not because I really believe a correlation exists, but because the film maker does't know what hes trying to say, and the movie does more to disprove this point then support it. It's almost as if the new ratings given to video games made someone upset so they came up with 'Zero Day' in retaliation. If you want to see the 'mindless' teen killer theory pulled off right, go watch Bully.",negative

7362,"Unfortunately, this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original. Nicholas Cage, fairly wooden as far as factors go, imbues the screen with a range of skill from, non-plussed to over the top. The supporting cast is no better. The plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse. Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold. It turns out it's just a bill of poor goods. Disbelief cannot be suspended, nor can a befit of a doubt be given. The only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual, as the medium requires, and whomever scouted the location should be commended. There was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos, literally, at the send. Disappointed! Wait for the original to come on television, pour a whisky and enjoy.",negative

10015,"This is a perfect series for family viewing. We gather around the TV to watch this on BBC America. It is an up-to-date version of Robin Hood and it appeals to children and adults alike. Our teenager and tween-ager both enjoy sitting with from and dad and watching Robin's next exploits. We can't wait for the next episode to air each week and are glad for the free ""On Demand"" viewing. The wardrobe has a spot of current fashion. There is a moral to each story. It is entertaining. The violence is not over-the-top for needless. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a John William's feel to it. It is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair. There is so much garbage on television from brain rotting ""reality"" TV to senseless violence. You should take this for what it is and that is an updated ""Robin Hood"" not to be compared with the movie exploits of Errol Flynn. This is a gem to be enjoyed by all. Parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that Robin has lost this taste for war and bloodshed. He is a Robin Hood that would rather attempt to reason this way out of a disagreement than fight. Maid Marian is also an appealing role model for young girls. Rather than stand by and do nothing, she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the ""Night Watchman."" The Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously over the top wicked, just as the Sheriff should be and looks like a across between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne is played by an extremely handsome factor, one that makes most women wish the did't have portray the role of a bad ""Guy"". The only question we have is ""Where is Friar Tuck?""",positive

14403,"This film is not morbid, nor is it depressing. It -is- sad, because AIDS in the early 'ninetys -was- sad. But its real message is one of love and perseverance. Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. Their devotion to each other is evident right away, and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see strength and commitment that are truly heartwarming. When ""Silverlake Life"" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS heat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life friends deteriorate. It touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me.",positive

But some how 'Wicked Little Things' just was't scary. I am a horror fan and I loved the location, the plot in principal and I liked the three leading ladies. I did't want to see them come to charm, I wanted the 'bad guy' to get this just desserts, the rest of the cast are always simply cannon fodder so I was indifferent either way with them and it played out every clické in the book - even down to the torch battery running out in the pitch dark just as you start to there whispering voices closing in on you.

23179,"As with all Haneke films, make your own decision--don't be swayed by what you read and if you are interested in someone using the medium of film for their own unique ends, see it yourself. Isabelle Huppert is stunning in this film--combined with Haneke, these two never pull their punches. Haneke reels us in with the lure of golden boy, Benoit Magimel, but this is an anti-romance as much as Funny Games was an anti-thriller. You'll have to force yourself to watch much of it and the catharsis is much more in the range of sustained anxiety than any kind of emotional release but it's incredibly nervy and thought provoking; Haneke continues to hold up a mirror to how desensitized Western civilization is for has become. People may turn their noses up at this but it's only taking what Solondz did in Happiness a few steps further. While grounded in reality, much of what Erika (Huppert) does can be viewed as emotional metaphor. I'm not recommending it but I would't dissuade you either. it definitely divides people but given it's largely about repression--that's no surprise.",positive

Isabelle Huppert ist in diesem Film umwerfend – in Kombination mit Haneke ziehen diese beiden nie durch. Haneke reißt uns mit der Verlockung des Goldjungen Benoit Magimel ein, aber dies ist genauso eine Anti-Romanze, wie Funny Games ein Anti-Thriller war. Sie werden sich zwingen müssen, viel davon zu sehen, und die Katharsis liegt viel mehr im Bereich anhaltender Angst als jede Art von emotionaler Befreiung, aber sie ist unglaublich nervös und regt zum Nachdenken an; Haneke hält weiterhin einen Spiegel vor, wie desensibilisiert die westliche Zivilisation geworden ist. Die Leute mögen darüber die Nase rümpfen, aber es geht nur ein paar Schritte weiter, was Solondz in Happiness getan hat. Obwohl in der Realität geerdet, kann vieles von dem, was Erika (Huppert) tut, als emotionale Metapher angesehen werden. Ich empfehle es nicht, aber ich würde dir auch nicht abraten. es spaltet die Leute definitiv, aber da es hauptsächlich um Repression geht, ist das keine Überraschung.",positive
24704,"This sad romance is untellable because the director decides to break its narration and to offer the points of view of each characters. So, there are a lot of flashbacks, of are-shooting of the same scene. But, it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments in order to see the result! And it would worth it, because it's for me, just one the best French movie never made! It has everything: Cast: first steps of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such a presence and such voices, even for a hard-of-hearing! It's symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this movie! Directing: this camera is bright, alive, plays with the sets for can be mysterious with long close-up ""à la David Lynch"". Cinematography: the light is beautiful, between gold and trust, like their love! A never-seen before Paris: It's a Paris out-of-time of more accurately, a composite of a lot of districts! Huge search there! It's look like Gotham City, modern and old at the same time! Music: Not the big orchestra but in perfect tune with the frames. And the song of Charles Aznavour made me discover this great singer! Ah, the story! As I said, it's a love story but rather tragic: Saying that love can be for nothing, that it does't make all people happy for in't guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message in't often told! Love is passion, which is derivative from the Latin ""pain"". You can suffer a lot when you are in love! Because of the Why . ?, of the endless waiting, the black of courage, the indecision. And when you can lease yourself, fate, destiny, god (?), devil (?) can stab you in the back , just because you arrive too soon for too late, and above all, because love means two in a world of billions! A lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written! So, what's love? Personally, I lived some moments like this: in a car with the dear one. Her mobile rings and you know it's her ""special friend"" whom she kisses goodbye (and not you, even if we are always together). So, you want to go out of this car to leave them together, to not hear the sweet but cruel words but you can't, because an amazing hard brain just started!

27350,"Everyone knows about this ''Zero Day'' event. What I think this movie did that Elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were. They showed their life for about a year. Throughout the movie we get to like them, to laugh with them even though we totally know what they're gonna do. And THAT gives me the chills. Cause I felt guilty to be cheered by their comments, and I just thought Cal was a sweet guy. Even though I KNEW what was gonna happen you know? Even at the send of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of three for four I thought this was funny but still I was horrified to see their heads blown off. Of course I was. I got to like them. They were wicked, maybe, but I felt like they were really normal guys, that they did't really realize it. But I knew they were. That's, IMO, the main force of this movie. It makes us realize that your friends, for relatives, for anyone, can be planning something crazy, and that we won't even notice it. This movie, as good as it was, made me feel bad. And that's why I can't go to sleep right now. There's still this little feeling in my stomach. Butterflies.",positive

Because I felt guilty about being cheered on by their comments and I just thought Cal was a cute guy. Even though I KNOW what was going to happen, do you know? Even when they posted the film when they were about to commit suicide and were just about to decide whether to do it when they counted three for four, I thought it was funny, but I was still horrified when they saw their heads blown off. Of course I was. I have to like her. They might be angry, but I got the feeling that they were just normal guys that they didn't really notice. But I knew it was them. That's, IMO, the main force behind this movie. It makes us realize that your friends, for relatives, for everyone, are planning something crazy and we don't even notice. This film, as good as it was, made me feel guilty. And that's why I can't go to sleep right now. I still have that little feeling in my stomach. Butterflies.",positive

If you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this film--the payday of Motown--or if you want to reach back and see what your parents made so much noise about, I suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch. At the risk of sounding cliche, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll reminisce and remember. You'll go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight. You'll recall with fondness your best friends from school. It's a feel good movie with an edge of angst and spain and realism--misconceptions, closing friends, deciding what to do with your life. I think everyone regardless of race, page, socioeconomic standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it. So take a couple hours out of a lazy day and check out this film; there are much worse ways you could spend your time.",positive

If I could go back in time and erase my memory for suffer from momentary amnesia I would so I could enjoy this movie as much as I did that very first time. It's still enjoyable second and third times around but I found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills were't unexpected. If you want a see a film that you truly won't be table to predict the ending of then I highly recommend this film. Its chilling, shocking, full of suspense and there's also loads of humour to help you through it too. If you watch this film and don't love it I truly question your sanity!",positive

44032,"I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favourite soap opera. Because of this, she goes on a journey to Los Angeles to reunite with her supposed soap opera character lover Dr. Rubell. To add fuel to the fire, she is also being chased by some ruthless `one life not to live' whitman who think she has stolen their drugs. You could say that is how Nurse Betty spends `the days of her life' throughout the movie. This very `ungeneral' situation eventually leads her to the `hospital' set of her beloved soap opera. However, the only problem is that Betty thinks this is all real. It is like her mind is in `another world.' Ok! Enough! I will wipe off my mouth with soap and not mention any more soap names. I have already registered my vote for Renee as a best actress oscar nominee. Also, Greg Kinnear's performance as Dr. Rubell was as good as it gets in this acting biography. To sum it up, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call in for `Nurse Betty.' ***** Excellent",positive

Just the rich sisters kind of thing I think even though Alysons more the actress, in this movie Amanda michalka was okay sometimes but Alysons acting stunk. i think that after high-school musical they needed to come up with something better and this definitely was't it. The story line was't that great and I think they should have gotten two other people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big Alyson Michalka fan and this movie did't make me like her any better. i think they should definitely sick to singing and only watch this movie if you have nothing better to do (which sadly I did't)",negative
