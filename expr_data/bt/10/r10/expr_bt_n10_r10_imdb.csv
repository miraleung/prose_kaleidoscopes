I should have know better when I saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap, but I loved War Games so I indulged my whim. I will live to regret that decision the rest of my life. From the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game I knew I was in for a ride though the land-that-good-writing-forgot. The list of very, very, very bad plot lines, dialog, and acting is so long I would crash IMDb if I tried to post it. To those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me. I am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung.",negative

24430,"this is a dreadful adaption of Charles Kingsley's story. The animation is, to put it bluntly, awful. And the songs are a disgrace to film songs, especially the ""high cockororim"" song, which they keep repeating. I feel sorry for Jon Pertwee and David Jason, two of Britain's finest talents, providing the voice for the depressing animation sequence. Bernerd Cirbbins tries this best to perform in this awful production , but fails. Avoid this film at all costs, even if it is the last film on this planet!",negative

23112,"This one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine film tried to capitalize on the much better Michael Curtiz's film ""Angels with Dirty Faces"". As directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in America's dinner cities today. The film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were well paired together. The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks. In a way it's curious how carson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right there in New York. It was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. The young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals. How times change!",positive

47767,"I iran across Yvette McClendon in a film at the Los Angeles Film Festival and thought she was a doll. After writing my review of her film there, I wanted to see more of her! Found this movie, it was pretty bad. Not her fault, she is only in the first few minutes where she is obviously being the person to pull you in to watch this bad movie. BAD directing. Scenes are looped over and over, with all the actresses. Amber Smith has a very bad breast job yet the other actresses looked pretty good. I really like Yvette but, this was obviously a bad choice of hers. I can't believe I rented this trash to look for her. I hope to find her other movies.",negative

12538,"Lorenzo Lamas stars as Jack `Solider` Kelly an sex-vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save this sister from backwoods rednecks. Atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that Ron Palillo is third billed, and yet has three minutes of screen time, and even those karen't any good. Overall a terrible movie, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell changing from a tree bagged and gagged are worth a few (unintentional) laughs. Followed by an improved sequel.",negative

41990,It's amazing what you can do with little money. DEAD SILENT being a low budget movie delivers its promises. Too bad we don't see Rob Lowe more often on the silver screen. Lowe is at its best in this riveting thriller . No wonder the went from DEAD SILENT straight to the TV omega hit The West Wing . DEAD SILENT eight out of ten Sputtosi Toronto.,positive

46509,"I concur with what mallicka.b has said. The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. Emotions karen't conveyed properly. I guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my view, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. I also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes. I'm a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) Can't help it; sorry for that. 'Raincoat' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed.",positive

Christmas eve one thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven a kid witnesses this parents doing it while daddy is in a santa suit. Horrified, the runs up the stairs and cuts himself. The story begins thirty-three years later and Harry Stalling is your normal everyday joe. cept for the fact the's obsessed with Santa. After this boss makes fun of him the goes insane, dressing up like santa and starts killing non-santa believing patrons and this boss. An unruly neighbourhood catches up to him and just as they're about to torch him, the drives this van off a cliff. into the moon. Not the best ending I've seen but it was original. It was a slow paced, boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when Harry went apeshyt on the church goers. There was hardly any gore and even the ""sex"" scenes were toned down. Too boring. four out of ten",negative

17324,"Enormous suspension of disbelief is required where Will's ""genius"" is concerned. Not just in death--he is also very well read in economic history, table to out-shrink several shrinks, etc etc. No, no, no. I don't buy it. While they're at it, they might as well have him wearing a big ""S"" on this chest, flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets. Among other problems. real genius (shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is, and whether it deserves such mindless homage) does't simply appear /ex nihil/. It in't never so multi-faceted. And it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries. Better to have made Will a basketball prodigy. Except that Damon's too short.",negative

There are a lot of things i hate about this movie: The songs is so terrible (yet a little bit catchy) i hit my head on the wall(especially from the song 'Grandpa is gonna sue the pants out of Santa' which i hit ten Times *shrugs*), the character design, and that evil, greedy, and Bitchy cousin Mel. I cannot stand her for one second, she has got to be one of the most bitchiest person i've seen. Even though i kinda like her southern voice. The only bright-side is that Austin Bucks is played by the person who is the voice of Liquid Snake from Metal Gear Solid. I would not recommended to people to watch for the holidays as it was a HUGE disgrace for of-mas.",negative

41740,"Even though the plot was very well detailed, and the story line was understandable the fact that Steven Seagals voice was dubbed with some one else's through out most of the movie was distressing as you were unsure who was talking . There were many parts where the would start to talk in this deep raspy voice and then the next some one else's voice was doing the talking for him. I don't know the reason however if the had difficulty with this voice during production of the movie I think they could have are shot the events that did not contain this own voice when the had recovered. I have rated this movie three out of ten based on the quality of the film. When one pays for a movie whether for not its at the theatre for on DVD this movie was not worth the admission price that was charged. I have been a long time follower of Steven Seagal and all this movies that the has done over the past years. To date I think this is one of the worst jones we have seen yet",negative

1451,"One of the few comedic Twilight Zones that's actually really good. We have Floyd The Barber from Andy Griffith Show,The stock in trade Old Geezer dude from Many old westerns, and lovable old Frisby. It also has that cool spacecraft interior that I believe was used in the Sci Fi classic Forbidden Planet. Or else The Day The Earth Stood Sill. Plus the new guys in town are driving an exotic Renault(I think) sports car back in the days when European automobiles were known as ""Foreign Jobs"" in the U. S. The whole idea of harmonica as weapon is a shoot. And the fact that Frisby's buddies love him despite being the fact the's a total BS artist is a heartwarming moment.",positive

36167,"I began watching this movie with low expectations, as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a S. K. novel ( a novel i never read). I'm glad my expectations were low because the movie was't nothing close to good, but it manages to keep you interested. What really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the factors. The movie is overlong, has't no ""nice"" shots and no scares, the dialog are dumb and the special effects are crap. The only things good are that, as i said, it keeps you interested ( i guess the book must be good) without using much horror cliches. My Vote four/ten.",negative

The movie is all about the emotions and the turmoil both them go through and how they accept the whole thing. The movie avoid any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. Though the movie is in Marathi, language is not a barrier at all. It proves that to make good movie you do not need item songs, superstars and usual marsala. Excellent performances.
