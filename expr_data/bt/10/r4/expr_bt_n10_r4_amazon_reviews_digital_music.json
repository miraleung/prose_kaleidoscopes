Six months prior, she had released A Star Is Born, which was her greatest box office film success to date. The accompanying soundtrack was Number one for six weeks, (the longest running Number one album of her career) which included her co-penned opus \"Evergreen,\" which also learned her an Academy Award for Best Song after spending three weeks at the pole position on the Billboard Hot one hundred. By one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven, Streisand was still delivering an album a year, but the fact that she delivered Superman just six months following A Star Is Born was extremely unusual, especially since the soundtrack was still riding high on the charts. The pop success of Streisand was now in full gear, and the songs on Superman were further proof that Barbra, a singer who barely scratched the pop singles chart a decade earlier, was now encroaching into new territory, and radio was finally embracing her. The press dubbed the six-month releases of A Star Is Born and Superman as \"Streisand's one-two punch!\"There were't many female singers (if any) that could release an album that carried a title such as \"Superman\" - and yet it seemed appropriate. Streisand was known for her chutzpah, and her pose on the album cover wearing a skimpy pair of white short-shorts with a tight white it-shirt emblazoned with the Superman logo seemed absolutely fitting. The title and the photo suggested that the queen of entertainment also had balls. And as successful as her career had been prior to 'seventy-seven, she seemed to have reached an even higher speak. It was fascinating to her fans and infuriating to her detractors. Now that I've exhausted the packaging and multiple interior Steve Schapiro photos of the empowered Streisand, let's get to the music. Streisand had finally delivered an entire pop album that was consistent and one that absolutely suited her. The songs ranged from pop ballads such as the hit single, \"My Heart Belongs To Me\" which reached Number four on the Billboard Hot one hundred, to gorgeous sonatas including \"Love Comes From the Most Unexpected Places,\" which was co-written by the prolific Kim Carnes, to rock and roll. From the opening title track, Streisand's vocals soared so effortlessly above the clouds, that when she sang the lyric \"I'm Superman\" with such conviction, you believed she WAS Superman! The entire album is so much fun; it's like cotton candy at a summer carnival. The only exception would be \"Don't Believe What You Read.\" Even though the track was co-written by Streisand and the lyrics were terrific, elucidating the details of her life in the tabloids, the steely rock guitar chords absolutely lacked a hook while repeating a monotonous rhythm. On the other hand, one other song that was co-written by the songbird was the gorgeous ballad \"Answer Me,\" which was originally written for A Star Is Born. Although, it did't make the final cut to the film and soundtrack, it luckily ended up on this album. Upbeat rhythms such as \"I Found You Love\" and \"Cabin Fever\" captured Streisand's playful side, and since she succeeded so well in this genre on \"A Star Is Born\" (despite what many critics said) it was a given that she continued to show off her versatility as a first rate vocalist that could capture just about every style of music. Speaking of versatility, she even sang a brilliant cover of the Roger (\"King of the Road\") Miller country-tinged ditty, \"Baby Me Baby.\" Two very bright highlights were the albums final two tracks, Billy Joel's luminous \"New York State of Mind\" and Rupert Holmes' divine code to independence \"Lullaby For Myself.\" Billy Joel was said to be \"over the moon\" with Streisand's dazzling rendition of \"New York State of Mind\" that the later commented, \"My mother now knew I had made it because Barbra Streisand had recorded one of my songs.\" Barbra Streisand had made it alright. She had conquered just about every medium of entertainment; it was just a matter of time that she dominated the world of pop music.

Scene","helpful":[9,16],"reviewText":"When an album sells somewhere around thirty million copies and it is the biggest selling album in the history of the music business, it does garner my attention. Therefore, separating out Michael Jackson's personal life from this music - I decided to review this one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two release \"Thriller\". Looking at this album strictly from a creative musical standpoint, I do think this album is overrated. For this album, Jackson and producer Quincy Jones assemble a powerful team of musicians. These musicians - while very talented probably were't the reason why this collection became the monster-selling album that it became. Simply put, this album sold because it came along at the right time - and was marketed very well to fit in with the times. The musicians that contribute to this album are big names. There probably karen't many names bigger than Paul McCartney. McCartney is well known for this entertaining duet with Jackson on \"The Girl is Mine\". However, there are many other big names that contributed collection as well: James Ingram (background vocals on \"Wanna Be Starting Somethin'\", songwriter of \"P. Y. T. (Pretty Young Thing)\"), Toto's David Paich (an arranger on \"The Girl is Mine\", Synthesizers on \"Human Nature\" and \"The Lady in My Life\"), Mega-producer David Foster (Synthesizer arrangements on \"The Girl is Mine\"), Vincent Price (provides the famous sinister 'rap' on \"Thriller\"), Eddie Van Halen (a guitar solo on \"Beat It\"), Toto's Steve Porcaro (Songwriter of \"Human Nature\", Synthesizer on \"Beat It\", \"Human Nature\", and \"The Lady in My Life\"), Toto's Steve Lutkather (Guitars and Bass on \"Beat It\", Guitars on \"Human Nature\"), Toto's Jeff Porcaro (Drums on \"Beat It\", \"Human Nature\", and \"The Lady in My Life\"), and LaToya and Janet Jackson (background vocals on \"P. Y. T (Pretty Young Thing)\" Finally, acclaimed keyboard player and studio musician Greg Phillinganes (who worked on Lionel Richie's \"Cant' Slow Down\" and Donald Fagen's \"The Nightfly\" - two outstanding albums in this era) contributes to several of the tracks on the collection. As for the Toto band members, I do feel their contributions are overlooked. They had only one year ago released their own critically acclaimed album - \"Toto IV\" and now they were working on \"Thriller\" and Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" - two of the largest selling albums of this time period. I don't feel it was Michael Jackson's vocals for any of the outstanding talent that helped this collection become the blockbuster seller that it became. This album was released in December, one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two. This was a time the music industry was undergoing change. This was the beginning of the page of music video. I give Michael Jackson and this management team credit. They take what I consider a mostly average set of songs, but they marketed it with some very clever music videos. Say what you want about Michael Jackson's music - but the did make the most of this medium. The videos basically became a marketing machine for this album - and it resulted in seven Top ten hits of the nine songs on \"Thriller\" in the United States. (The title track \"Thriller\" is probably the best example of this). There are several reasons why this album is \"average\" at best:- The Percussions are awful. Despite having one of the best drummers and musicians in the business in Toto's Jeff Porcaro, this album basically takes a bunch of music and puts a disco dance beat behind them. There is very little in the way of any solid drumming on this album.- There is little in the way of any cohesion on this album. Yes it did have a mixture of styles (the Rock-edge on \"Beat It\" to the R&B; Style of \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\" to the campy \"The Girl is Mine\"). A lot of times this happens when there are \"too many cooks in the kitchen\" - while there was a vast array of talent, I do feel that eventually this impacted the final product (even Quincy Jones could't fix that).- There is nothing groundbreaking in terms of the music on this album. Yes, the music videos were groundbreaking - but not the music.- One thing I discovered is that Michael's songwriting did't really shine. I thought it was the songs written by \"outsiders\" that were better. The Steve Porcaro \"Human Nature\" penned song is probably the strongest effort on the collection. Rod Temperton is very underrated on this album. Many people don't realize that the wrote the \"Thriller\" track (while it in't my favourite, it is probably the only innovative track of the collection). Temperton also wrote the two underrated R&B; itunes - \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\". As for the positives:- The strong points are the contributions of the Toto band members. As mentioned, \"Human Nature\" is probably the strongest track. While I've never been a fan of \"Beat It\", there is some good instrumentation in there. I actually feel if \"Beat It\" was just done as an instrumental without the disco beat - it would sound good.- Eddie Van Halen does give a terrific solo on \"Beat It\".- If you are a Synth-Pop fan, this album (with the exception of \"Beat It\") is going to provide plenty of it. The liner notes include all of the lyrics and do a good job at providing musician and songwriting credits. Overall, when I look at this collection - I just don't think it is the greatest album of all time. I would even say that for the year it was \"Album of the Year\" that The Police's \"Synchronicity\" and Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" were miles ahead of \"Thriller\". The bottom line is that if there were no music videos, this would have been just another eightys Synth-Pop album. If you are curious on what all the hype is - then you may want to get this collection - otherwise I don't recommend it.","overall":2,"summary":"Came along at the right time - but not a lot of substance","unixReviewTime":1110153600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2005"}

Scene","helpful":[9,16],"reviewText":"When an album has sold about thirty million copies and it's the best-selling album in music business history, it gets my attention. To separate Michael Jackson's personal life from this music, I decided to review this one thousand nine hundred and eighty-two release \"Thriller\". Looking at this album from a strictly creative musical point of view, I think this album is being overrated. For this album, Jackson and producer Quincy Jones put together a strong musician team. These musicians - while very talented - probably weren't the reason this collection became the monster-selling album that it became. Simply put, this album sold because it came at the right time - and was marketed very well to match the time. The musicians who contribute to this album are big names. There probably aren't many names bigger than Paul McCartney. McCartney is best known for this entertaining duet with Jackson on \"The Girl is Mine\". However, there are many other big names who have contributed to the collection: James Ingram (backing vocals on \"Wanna Be Starting Somethin ',\" songwriter on \"PYT (Pretty Young Thing)\"), Totos David Paich (an arranger on \"The Girl.\" is Mine \", synthesizer on\" Human Nature \"and\" The Lady in My Life \"), mega-producer David Foster (synthesizer arrangements on\" The Girl is Mine \"), Vincent Price (delivers the famous dark\" Rap \"on\" Thriller \"\"), Eddie Van Halen (a guitar solo on \"Beat It\"), Totos Steve Porcaro (songwriter of \"Human Nature\", synthesizer for \"Beat It\", \"Human Nature\" and \"The Lady in My Life\"), Totos Steve Lutkather (guitars and bass on \"Beat It\", guitars on \"Human Nature\"), Totos Jeff Porcaro (drums on \"Beat It\", \"Human Nature\" and \"The Lady in My Life\") and LaToya and Janet Jackson (Backing vocals on \"PY T (Pretty Young Thing)\" Finally, the acclaimed keyboardist and studio musician Greg Phillinganes (who worked on Lionel Richie's \"Cant 'Slow Down\" and Donald F agens \"The Nightfly\" - two outstanding albums of the era) contributes to several of the tracks in the collection. As for the band members of Toto, I feel like their contributions are being overlooked. They had only released their own critically acclaimed album a year ago - \"Toto IV\", and now they were working on \"Thriller\" and Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" - two of the best-selling albums of the time. I don't think it was Michael Jackson's singing for one of the standout talents that helped this collection become the blockbuster salesman that it became. This album was released in December one thousand nine hundred eighty-two. This was a time when the music industry was changing. This was the beginning of the music video page. I give credit to Michael Jackson and this management team. They take what I consider to be a mostly average collection of songs, but they marketed it with some very clever music videos. Say what you want about Michael Jackson's music - but you made the best of the medium. The videos basically became a marketing machine for this album - and it resulted in seven top ten hits of the nine songs on \"Thriller\" in the US. (The title track \"Thriller\" is probably the best example of this). There are several reasons this album is \"average\" at best: - The percussions are terrible. Although he has one of the best drummers and musicians in the business in Totos Jeff Porcaro, this album basically takes a lot of music and puts a disco dance beat behind it. There is very little solid drumming on this album. - There is little cohesion on this album. Yes, there was a mix of styles (the rock edge on \"Beat It\" to R&B; style from \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\" to the campy \"The Girl is Mine\"). This often happens when there are \"too many chefs in the kitchen\" - although there was a wide range of talent, I feel that it ultimately affected the end product (not even Quincy Jones could fix that) - It's in Nothing groundbreaking in terms of the music on this album. Yes, the music videos were groundbreaking - but not the music - One thing I discovered was that Michael's songwriting wasn't really that brilliant. I thought it was the songs that were written by \"outsiders\" that were better. The song \"Human Nature\", written by Steve Porcaro, is probably the strongest contribution to the collection. Rod Temperton is very underrated on this album. A lot of people don't know they wrote the \"Thriller\" track (while it's not my favorite, it's probably the only innovative track in the collection). Temperton also wrote the two underrated R&B; itunes - \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\". As for the positives: - The strengths are the contributions of the Toto band members. As mentioned earlier, \"Human Nature\" is probably the strongest track. Although I was never a fan of \"Beat It\" there is some good instrumentation. I have a feeling if \"Beat It\" were only made as an instrumental piece without a disco beat - it would sound good - Eddie Van Halen gives a terrific solo on \"Beat It\" .- If you are a synth-pop fan, the album (with the exception of \"Beat It\") will have plenty of it. The liner notes contain all of the lyrics and do a good job of providing musician and songwriting credits. All in all when I look at this collection I just don't think it's the best album ever. In fact, I'd say it was \"Album of the Year\" that year with The Police's \"Synchronicity\" and Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" being miles ahead of \"Thriller\". Bottom line, this would have been just another '80s synth-pop album if there hadn't been any music videos. If you're curious what all the hype is - then you might want to get this collection - otherwise I don't recommend it.","overall":2,"summary":"Came along at the right time - but not a lot of substance","unixReviewTime":1110153600,"reviewTime":"03 7, 2005"}

The music on this album was still horn driven with drum solo's but it was the purest of this pop albums, with more positive sound even if it had some great ballads the had left the dark territory of bitterness and self pity. The album starts with the effective pop song \"Sussudio\", the myth said that the was listening lot to Prince's one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine album while touring and wanted to release something on the line. This uptempo pop song was one of this biggest hits. \"Only You and I know\" is a very catchy song with synths and horns, feels a bit dated today but it's a good pop song just the same. \"Long Long way to go\" is a slow ballad like song that features a guest appearance from Sting. Yes you heard right!. \"I don't wanna know\" is a uptempo song, although it discusses the issue about a breakup where the woman wants him back while the's done with it. \"Cos I don't wanna know No, I don't wanna know, She can cry all she wants, She's not gonna bring me back, no no\". \"One More Night\" was also one of the singles from this album, it's also a ballad about this divorce, when the tasks for just \"One More Night\".\"Don't Lose My Number\" is a catch uptempo song with percussion and synths. I was single released maxwell and a decent hook, but not as deep as many of the other contemporary songs. \"Who Said I Would\" reminds a bit of Sussudio, it deaures horns and is also a funky uptempo. The hook is the weakness though but musically it's great with a good horn solo. \"Doesn't Anyone Stay Together Anymore\" is a midtempo song about breakups. \"Inside Out\" is a semi-ballad with a powerful chorus. Features a great guitar solo. \"Take Me Home\" is perhaps the best song there, it got this hypnotic percussion sound in the background, the song itself is a semi-ballad that could have been released much later (it sound like a ninety' song). It's almost six minutes long. The album ends with \"We Said Hello Goodbye\" Beatles inspired title?, however it's a classic ballad without too many cathy instruments used. Overall, this was this most commercial album and this biggest success maxwell. It goes in the same spirit as the previous but it launched more hit-singles and it's lot more positive to listen to lyrically.

The album begins with the effective pop song \"Sussudio\", the myth has it that he listened a lot to Prince's one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine album while on tour and wanted to release something on the line. This uptempo pop song was one of those biggest hits. \"Only You and I know\" is a very catchy song with synths and brass, feels a bit out of date today, but is still a good pop song. \"Long Long Way to go\" is a slow, ballad-like song with a guest appearance by Sting. Yes, you heard right!. \"I don't wanna know\" is an up-tempo song, despite the fact that it deals with the topic of a breakup where the woman wants him back while she's done with it. \"Because I don't want to know, no, I don't want to know, she can cry as much as she wants, she won't bring me back, no no\". \"One More Night\" was also one of the singles from this album, it's also a ballad about that divorce when the tasks only apply to \"One More Night\" synthesizers. I was a single release from Maxwell and a decent hook, but not as deep as many of the other contemporary songs. \"Who Said I Would\" is a bit reminiscent of Sussudio, it pops its horns and is also a funky uptempo. The hook may be the weakness, but musically it's great with a good horn solo. \"Does't Nobody Stay Together Anymore\" is a mid-tempo song about breakups. \"Inside Out\" is a semi-ballad with a powerful chorus. Features a great guitar solo. \"Take Me Home\" is maybe the best song out there, it has that hypnotic percussion sound in the background, the song itself is a semi-ballad that could have been released much later (it sounds like a 90 'song). It's almost six minutes long. The album ends with the Beatles-inspired track \"We Said Hello Goodbye\", but it's a classic ballad without too many Cathy instruments. Overall, this was the most commercial album and this greatest success for maxwell. It goes in the same spirit as the previous one, but it brought out more hit singles and it's a lot more positive to listen to lyrically. Essential work, a very good album.","overall":5,"summary":"This \"Jacket\" is Needed","unixReviewTime":1130025600,"reviewTime":"10 23, 2005"}

This band of English scruffy backed up sex-pat Chrissie Hynde and made one of rock's all time great debut albums. At a time when female singers either had to be disco wailers for blues chicks (the sole exception being Heart), Chrissie completely smashed all the old stereotypes and marked a new era in female singers. She, along with vocalists like Pat Benatar and Patti Smith, made it cool for independent women to make music that was sexy because it was't sexual. Remember Pat Benatar's classic quote of \"you break my heart and I'll kick your a**\"? Chrissie was that to the in'th degree.\"The Pretenders\" mixed hard rock and pop sense so flawlessly that the band never again came close to matching it. From the sweet longing of \"Brass In Pocket\" to the cool dismissiveness of \"Up The Neck\" (\"it was all very. run of the mill\"), Chrissie delivered tough and tender in equal doses with full credibility. Having James Honeyman Scott throwing inventive riffs behind almost every song certainly helped, as did the undeniable power of Martin Chambers and Pete Farndon -- listen to this bass work on \"The Wait\" -- as a rhythm team. (And dammit, why did James and Pete have to OD themselves? When will we never learn?)One of the juicy things about this double disc release is the bonus CD. You get a pair of songs that were't on CD before (save forPirate Radio), \"Porcelain\" and \"Cuban Slide.\" The demos are interesting in just how little they changed before they came on the original album. I chuckled at the \"Roxanne\" quote before the demo of \"Kid\" and was surprised that \"Brass In Pocket\" started out as a down-tempo number. The live tracks show The Pretenders to be incendiary in concert. The packaging itself is a blast, including lyrics! (I guess I was singing the wrong words all these years. )All the chemistry was in perfect coordination there. Even the one moment when Nick Lowe steps in for producer, a cover of The Kinks' \"Stop Your Sobbing,\" can't break the synergy of this album. It remains a timeless debut, standing tall alongside of first efforts of the period from Tom Petty, Elvis Costello, Joe Jackson and The Cars.","overall":5,"summary":"Gonna make you, make you, make you notice","unixReviewTime":1186790400,"reviewTime":"08 11, 2007"}

Erinnern Sie sich an das klassische Zitat von Pat Benatar \"Du brichst mein Herz und ich werde dir einen Arsch ficken\"? Chrissie war das im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes. \"The Pretenders\" mischten Hardrock- und Pop-Gef\u00fchl so tadellos, dass die Band nie wieder ann\u00e4hernd daran herankam.

Ich kicherte \u00fcber das \"Roxanne\"-Zitat vor der Demo von \"Kid\" und war \u00fcberrascht, dass \"Brass In Pocket\" als Downtempo-Nummer begann. Die Live-Tracks zeigen, dass The Pretenders im Konzert aufr\u00fchrerisch sind. Die Verpackung selbst ist ein Knaller, inklusive Text! (Ich glaube, ich habe all die Jahre die falschen Worte gesungen.) Die Chemie stimmte dort perfekt. Selbst der eine Moment, in dem Nick Lowe als Produzent einspringt, ein Cover von The Kinks' \"Stop Your Sobbing\", kann die Synergie dieses Albums nicht brechen.

The Brown Album(from what I have heard) blacks the energy and creative that makes Primus so great. This record shows defence energy in comparison, but blacks the technical precision that Seas of Cheese, Soda, and Punchbowl have. So what do you have there? I cracked up Primus with its biggest commercial appeal yet(ironically titled Anti-Pop). Now before you hit that negative feed back, consider some of these little titbits:one) Go back to Cheese and listen to the song Eleven. You know why its called Eleven?

Their influence shows up and makes this album more accessible than any previous record. And yet, I can still say that this is one great recording. The Bass riffs are still jaw dropping. Ler's guitar playing just keeps getting better. And Brain may still not have made himself of Herb caliper yet, but the's damn good there, adding a nice textured player of drums to the already dense wall of noise. The funk tones there seem stronger than before(certainly a good thing). The only thing is that it really seems like Les is running the well dry for lyrics, that sometimes overshadow the music. This is decent first cutting for beginning Primus fans. Its easy enough to listen to and has some high caliper musicianship. But incompareson to their early stuff, this is not their best. Still, its better than most . out in the music industry today. And though I said it might be their most commercially exceptable album yet, it still won't turn any Primus haters into fans.","overall":4,"summary":"Primus's least impressive work(that I have heard)...","unixReviewTime":1005955200,"reviewTime":"11 17, 2001"}

However, it does have thirty tracks on it, it's a single disc edition, and the music is extraordinary. Berry is one of the creators of rock and roll, and listening to this stuff forty years later, it's still rocks, and rocks really hard. The music there sounds more vital, fresh, and edgy (yes, edgy) than most rock and roll facts do today. Berry wrote all thirty tracks in this collection, and they're all fantastic. This album has the classics (Johnny B. Goode, Maybellene, Rock and Roll Music), and it has some songs that I've heard covered by The Rolling Stones and REO Speedwagon (Carol and Little Queenie). It also contains the great, underrated You Never Can Tell (featured in Pulp Fiction, but I can listen to the song without thinking about that film now. Thank goodness, as I like the song a lot better than the film). I love the song Promised Land, an obscure one. Listen to the guitar solo and tell me you don't hear Lou Reed in it, specifically the soloing on the Velvet Underground's first album.

However, it has thirty tracks, it's a single disc edition, and the music is exceptional. Berry is one of the creators of rock and roll, and if you listen to this stuff forty years later, it still rocks and rocks really hard. The music there sounds more vital, fresher and edgier (yes, edgier) than most rock'n'roll facts today. Berry wrote all thirty tracks in this collection and they are all fantastic. This album contains the classics (Johnny B. Goode, Maybellene, Rock and Roll Music) and it contains some songs that I covered from the Rolling Stones and REO Speedwagon (Carol and Little Queenie). It also includes the great, underrated You Never Can Tell (which is in Pulp Fiction, but I can now hear the song without thinking about the movie. Thank goodness I like the song a lot better than the movie). I love the song Promised Land, an obscure one. Listen to the guitar solo and tell me you don't hear Lou Reed on it, especially the solo on the first Velvet Underground album. Some have criticized the recording of My Ding-a-Ling, a novelty song that was Berry's last # one hit. I like the song and Berry liked it too, although it's very different from this other material.

She returns on `Back to black', her sophomore disc, which is off to a blazing start in the UK; Top ten for the album, and lead off single, the horn sprinkled midtempo Motown-ish `Rehab', a song about a battle to get her into rehab, fictitious for autobiographical, we don't know. The horn sprinkled `You know I'm no good' has a jazzy\/tango sound set to skitter ship shop beats. Very catchy and one of my favourites. `Me and Mr Jones' is a downtempo retro soul\/jazz\/blues song that sounds like it was recorded in the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys. There's a slight reggae feel to `Just friends'. The title track `Back to black' is a beautiful midtempo Motown-ish song with excellent harmonies, and haunting\/creepy sound effects. `Love is a closing game' is a lovely ballad, and continuing the Motown influence, the beautiful `Tears dry on their own' has traces of `Aint no mountain high enough'. Awesome song and another of my favourites.`Wake up alone' is a tender ballad with soothing harmonies, the brief `Unholy war' is a mellow blues\/jazzy song, `He can hold her' is more upbeat with a ship shop beat and horns flitting in and out.

By this I mean that bands that are identified with the genre generally think about the way in which they can perform complex musical material in a live situation. Battles' \"supergroup\" pedigree includes death rock monsters such as Don Caballero and Helmet, and as a critical fan of so-called \"math rock,\" they have piqued my curiosity since their first EP. However, I never bought any of their albums. Then I saw the video for \"Atlas,\" and this curiosity became a fascination. I have long been a fan of King Crimson circa one thousand, nine hundred and eighty, and it seemed like Battles engages contemporary technology and virtuosity in the same way that Fripp and co. did on \"Discipline.\" I immediately bought \"Mirrored,\" and in the final weeks of two thousand and seven, it shot up my personal \"album of the year\" charts. What is really fascinating and ultimately satisfying about \"Mirrored\" is unravelling its tapestry of execution. I love to contemplate \"who\" is playing \"what.\" This form of listening is particularly stimulating when you have a band full of multinstrumentalists that sample, loop, tap, and generally thrash their way through their work. As usual, the most publicly accessible song on the album is not necessarily the most representative. I think that \"Atlas\" is great. The video reflects the energy and experimentalism of the band very well. However, there are songs on the album that show \"Atlas\" to be the \"single\" that it is. \"Tonto\" is a beautiful piece of work, as is \"Race: In\" and \"Tij.\" \"Race: Out\" is a fun \"whack-a-mole\" game of \"who is playing what\" and \"Bad Trails\" shows Battles' potential for more atmospheric work. The only work that I could offer any critique for is \"Rainbows.\" It is wonderfully epic, and covers a great amount of musical ground, but seems a little repetitive. The same seven-minute song could potentially be done in five. The slowdown: Battles creates highly active music that is satisfying on intellectual and accessible levels. To the passive listener, \"Mirrored\" may bring to mind the work of savant-garde DJ's, like DJ Shadow for BT. For the more invested listener, Battles' potential for mind-boggling virtuosity, a la King Crimson for Don Caballero, is similarly compelling.
