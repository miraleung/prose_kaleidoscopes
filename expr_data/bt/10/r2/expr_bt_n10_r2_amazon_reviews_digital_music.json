And \"Southerplayaisticmuzik\" back in mid 'ninety-four help place Atlanta on the map. Two years later, they come out with their sophomore album \"ATLiens\" in Sept one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six. This time, they flipped their whole concept around compared to their first one. While their debut was mostly about pippin and smoking weed, this one was more \"out there\". The production by Organized Noize was more laid back and smoother sounding. Their first single \"Elevators (Me & U)\" was heavily rotated back in summer of 'ninety-six, and everybody was trying to memorize that hook \"Me & U\/Your mommy and your cousin too. \" (lol). Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton and Andre \"three thousand\" Benjamin's rhymes took a side step (not saying they did't improve, but just went a different direction with their rhymes). On the song \"Two Dope Boyz In A Caddilac\" would be a good example of what I'm saying, as well as their second single \"ATLiens\". The most \"out there\" concept on this album would be the two songs \"Millenium\" and \"Extraterrestrial\" that will garuntee to have you head nod. The latter song may sound weird to many listeners because the song does't have any drums, so it sounds like they're freestyling accapella. Guest wise is pretty dope too. Goodie Mob's Khujo and T-Mo appear on \"Mainstream\" as well as Cee-Lo, Big Gipp, and Cool Breeze on \"Decatur Psalm\". Witchdoctor would handle the hook on the song \"Ova Da Woodz\". As much as I LOVE this album, I have to gripe about one thing (and I may come back and edit this to a ten rating, because this should have been on the greatest hits album). \"Jazzy Belle\" was the third single back in early 'ninety-seven, and if you remember it was remixed with Babyface singing the hook to the song.

As with all of those albums in the thousand nine hundred and eighty, \"Parade\" is an amazing display of Prince's sampling talent. In contrast to \"Purple Rain\", which was often about rock, \"Parade\" is consistently a funk album. \"New Position\" and the irresistible \"Girls and Boys\" are just as infectious as in one thousand nine hundred and eighty-six, and the almost classic single \"Kiss\" is minimalism at its best, reduced to just a synthesizer, drum computer and a pinch of guitar.

Well, not literally, but I really enjoy this album because it almost seems like the prototypical Simon album. Well no, each of this solo albums have been so unique. But anyway, \"Rhymin' Simon\" has just about everything you could ask for, this time around with a really great gospel-ish slant. So, let's see what we have there:-Kodachrome: the commercial hit of the album, and it's a great song; fun, upbeat, and truly unique. It's a classic; there's no other song like it. and I love the lyrics--this man could write a song about AnYthinG.-Tenderness: Here's some of the gospel element (thanks to the Dixie Hummingbirds--they rule), a slower, more pensive song dealing with a reality of human relationships--now you've got to love the way the writes songs not about \"LOVE\" but you know, tenderness\/brutal honesty\/truth. -. Mardi Gras: Here's a little Cajun flair, a song that I almost wish would move more, but it's fun and an interesting departure for Simon.-Something So Right: Pretty. honest reflection on personality\/relationships. but too flush and produced for my last.-One Man's Ceiling. : I love this song. My favourite on side one (ok, I admit I'm sticking to the LP) Simon sounds isOUlful on this, man. gospel-y, fun, but not ToO fun :) The title sums up the song, which is a quirky little insight but works amazingly well for the topic of a song!-American Tune: I think this is a very beautiful song, a really simple melody, weary, almost timeless I think. The words are simple but powerful (though some say pretentious). But this is not pretentious--it's indescribably 'what it is.' Oh well, the bridge is my favourite part, it's earnest but never cloying. HOWEVER, I wish they could LAY OFF THE STRING SECTION! Find a live version, simpler=better for this song, in my opinion.-Was a Sunny Day: This song sounds quite perky, but it's eerie. An odd little story of a \"navy man\" and a \"high school queen,\" but it fits. I like this song. I admit I like the way the says \"speedooo.\" You've gotta love the way this dude says this vowels :)-. How to Fall: a good solid LESSON, but come on, it's a nice song. great dark beginning, then melts away, then back. -St. Judy's Comet: I adore this song. I'm a sap, but I do. NOT that it's a sappy song, I'm just a sap that a song about this kid can get me like this one does. anyway, it's a great tune, sounding almost reminiscent of the later \"fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover\". except more wholesome because this is an endearingly self-critical bedtime song for the kid. (\"'Cause if I can't using my boy to sleep, well it makes your famous daddy look so dumb. \") Low key but it moves. very nice.-Loves me Like a Rock: I always think of this as the companion song to \"Kodachrome\"--they're almost like one song in my mind. This song is awesome: more gospel influence, Simon's really getting into it, and the words have that funny-serious feeling that unifies all the songs on this album. SO, it's fun, quirky, and serious. This album's got all types of songs, but they've all got a laid-back feel, classy lyrics and a gospel swing that unifies it into one great Paul Simon album!","overall":4,"summary":"Fun, Quirky, Serious...Rhymin' Simon","unixReviewTime":1049500800,"reviewTime":"04 5, 2003"}

As I now have more time on my hands I have decided to plough my way through as much of my record and Cd collections as I can before I go (or my hearing disappears). I use the word plough, not because the task that I have set myself is unpleasant, but merely because it is daunting. I have thousands of records and Cds and hardly know where to start.

She also wrote all the music for the musical and is one of its producers. This marks the third time Dolly's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty masterpiece has been released on CD. It originally came out on CD in the mid to late 'ninetys, but RCA did a bad job in its release-only eight tracks were included. Then in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine Buddha Records, in conjunction with RCA, released the album again with beautiful repackaging and all ten tracks were included with renewed audio. Now comes this wonderful CD edition with bonus tracks.\"nine to five and Odd Jobs\" has gone on to be one of Dolly Parton's most successful albums in her career. It went all the way to #one on the country charts, where it stayed for a whopping ten weeks (her longest stay there), garnered Dolly two Grammy wins, one for Best Country Song and one for Best Country Vocal Performance, both for the song \"nine to five\", and the album went Gold selling five hundred, zero copies. If RCA would do some research on the sales of this album in two thousand and nine, the accumulated sales would bring it to over a million copies. Since Dolly is no longer with RCA the label refuses to do an accounting of her old albums, which is not only an insult to us Dolly fans, but to Miss Parton herself, who is one of the greatest entertainers and singers in the world. The album title song went to number one on the country charts and became Dolly's first #one pop song and her second million selling single, after \"Here You Come Again\". \"nine to five\" also is one of those rare songs in which a female country act had the song go to the top of both the country and pop charts. The last song to do this prior to \"nine to five\" was \"Harper Valley PTA\" back in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-eight. \"nine to five\" also went on to beat Tammy Wynette's classic \"Stand By Your Man\", in terms of sales for a single.\"nine to five and Odd Jobs\" also produced another #one country hit, Kenny Roger's and The First Edition's \"But You Know I love You\". The CD has many other covers, among the best is \"Detroit City\", which Dolly makes her own. \"The House of the Rising Sun\" is also performed there and Dolly sounds impeccable on the vocal. Mike Post, a big Hollywood record producer who Dolly met on the \"Merv Griffin Show\" in the late 'seventys, produced the bulk of the CD's songs, but it was Dollys long-time friend and band leader Gregg Perry who produced the \"nine to five\" single. Mike Post would also go on to produce Dolly's \"Rhinestone\" album in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four. An old Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton song also surfaces there, \"Poor Folks Town\", which Dolly wrote, and was included on the duos \"Together Always\" album in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two. The crowning jewel in this particular CD collection are three bonus tracks, including a karaoke version of \"nine to five\", a dance mix version of the same song, and the previous unreleased track \"Everyday People\", which was a pop hit in the late 'sixtys. \"Everday People\" is also one of Dolly's best vocal performances never.

Hints of classic soul, perhaps even true do wop might be observable, but in no way should the potential listener believe they know what this band sounds like before they put their own years through the experience. When first listening to \"Young Liars\", comparisons to Peter Gabriel seemed natural, but really only stand up in a surface comparison to the vocal textures. The lyrics possess a darkness and intensity rarely seen. There is a sense of protest in their song crafting, a palpable laura of rebellion. Not becoming anything so simple as a political statement for stance on issues, they seem to radiate an intrinsic feeling of non-acceptance to the cold players of society. In \"Staring at the Sun\", which makes its way from their brilliant debut \"Young Liars\", the singers hang on with concentrated determination (\"Oh my own voice can not save me now \/ It's just one more breath and then down I'll go\") in front of their unique wall of sound. Occasionally, Kyp breaks out some guitar chord melodies that accent that wall, but don't expect any self gratifying guitar solo's to appear. This band works in unison to create a sound unlike any other, a sound that is refined and expanded on \"Desparate Youth\".

They had three main strengths - Annie Lennox's terrific voice and unique, soulful personality , an advanced sense of melody , and their ability to develop as musicians and become more sophisticated as their career progressed. I always really liked them back in the eighty's, and had the good fortune to see them in concert on one\/twelve\/one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine there in Hobart on their We Too Are One tour. Here they are again with a second, updated hits package, and not surprisingly it's very a good CD. This compilation spans one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three until the present day, and like most hits compilations it includes two new tracks to make the CD more enticing to casual and long-term fans alike. They're not going to set the charts ablaze, but both new songs are pretty good. Always with such a successful group that has more than one CD -worth of hit itunes, you wonder whether a twoCD set would be better, but I'm satisfied with this as I'm sort of intending to purchase the group's back catalogue albums on CD anyway. In particular the remastered sound is excellent. My old CD of the Eurythmics one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five album Be Yourself Tonight has much inferior sound on the cloud, rocking #one hit Would I Lie To You (which I love) when compared to the improved sound quality there. Favourite tracks ; Right By Your Side ( holiday \/carnival vibe, lovely) , Would I Lie To You (brilliant rock vocal performance, face guitar playing) , When Tomorrow Comes ( routine melody but lovely lyrics) , I Saved The World Today ( gorgeous melody, great singing) , Here Comes The Rain Again ( cool melancholy vocal , atmospheric instrumentals) , There Must Be An Angel ( Playing With My Heart) ( sweet vocals, terrific harmonica guest performance from Stevie Wonder), Miracle Of Love ( one of the best eighty's radio ballad hits with lovely lyrics) . I hope newer listeners unfamiliar with this music might wish to try out this package of hit songs, all of which are really good. I would imagine however that most fans of this band would already own most of these tracks, so the only selling point then is the improved sound quality.

Over-amped, distorted guitars, melodic songs with soaring choruses and plaintive vocals are all in evidence. On \"Carnavas,\" their debut, they're at least closer to the Pumpkin's early albums, eschewing the grandiosity that made Corgan's later work such a chore. Actually, they seem to have more in common with another young L. A. band, Autolux. Both are clearly indebted to the noisy soundscapes of My Bloody Valentine and the more melodic moments of Sonic Youth. Listen to \"Carnavas\" back-to-back with SY's recent \"Rather Ripped\" and you'd think the two bands could be cousins. Mind you, SY's songs are stronger and their guitars more gloriously of***ed up, but Silversun Pickups have plenty to offer as well. Like Autolux, the Pickups manage to fold their more experimental tendencies into their songs, and when they stretch things out, like on album closer \"Common Reactor,\" they drone instead of jam. Sometimes they're even genuinely hypnotic, but even as Brian Aubert's guitars soar into the stratosphere, they keep their feet on the ground (actually, they kinda have to; otherwise, they could't reach their effects pedals). Another nice touch are the keyboards of Joe Lester, which curiously makes the sound warmer (as opposed to the chilliness of say, Radiohead). Lyrically, the band traffic in the vague, elliptical imagery that have been a staple of indie rock for more than twenty years. At the very least they're modest, not self important. The propulsive \"Future Foe Scenarios\" begins \"The things we laid do not amount to much\/made of abandoned wood and stones and such.\" All things considered, while Silversun Pickups are anything but original, they survive comparisons to their inspirations fairly well.

On another note (unlike Babyface's Playlist) I don't understand how any Toni, Tony, Tone listener did't see this coming. Raphael has been retro since \"Hey Little Walter\" and pretty much kept an older genre sound on almost all TTT's cd's. This cd is not a homage, it is a work of part because the handles the music masterfully as though the was in the sixty's. For those who'd rather pick up Sam Cooke when you want to hear him, cool, but I'm sure just like artists such as Prince, Madonna, and other older artists try and go back into that era for more for less vice versa meaning they try to enter this era and look stupid doing it; this is a focused cd and absolutely well crafted musically with full melodies, choruses, and poignant lyricism. I say this to say it is authentic in its recreation of that vibe. I'm pretty sure you can pop this cd in with Sam Cooke, Smokey, Diana, on a playlist and people would think this was made also in the sixty's.

Individual releases from both artists are worth months of anticipation: both forefathers of West Coast ship shop, they have impeccable catalogs and huge legacies; DJ Quik, in my opinion, as the West Coast's greatest producer and Kurupt as the quick slipped, smooth lyrical half of Long Beach's Tha Dogg Pound. Both helped pioneer the of-funk phenomenon from the early one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys and have proven time and again to be masters of gangsta wrap. Quik's discography is among ship shop's best, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a single beat of this that's anything less than great. This also arrives at a perfect time; Quik has been inactive for four years and Kurupt has suffered some recent backlash from fans who claim this hunger is lost.\"Blaqkout\" is an immediately appealing LP that just sounds great and is perfect summertime music. It has the light, breezy vibe that Quik perfected onSafe & SoundandRhythm-al-ism, yet stays innovative and forward-reaching with further creativity. Quik is a musical genius and an artist foremost, so even on a collaboration piece this beats take center stage. The instrumentals are rich and funky and do this immense talent justice, bearing this famous Midas touch. Kurupt and Quik share mic duties equally along with a few guests. There's not much heavy lyricism; they tend to flex their MC muscles with light sixteen-bar verses between good hooks. It's clear they've come to play from the gorgeous opening title track, with its soaring synths and heavy claps, and the funky \"Cream N Ya Panties.\" The bouncy \"Ohh!\" and \"The Appeal\" are strong, and Kurupt trips the cleverly minimalist \"ninex Outta ten.\" Quik impresses on the space-age winner \"Jupiter's Critic and the Mind of Mars,\" and the gem of the tracklist is the brilliant party track \"Hey Playa! (Moroccan Blues),\" where Quik flips a ridiculous sample into a superb production. As far as flaws, I'd only pick the reggae track \"Exodus\" and \"Watcha Wan Do\" as subpar, so the latter did't need an alternate mix on the last track. It's a little brief at barely forty minutes.\"Blaqkout\" is quintessential West Coast ship shop and perfect summer music from two legends. Longtime fans will love it and new fans will similarly find it suitable for warm-weather listening. I highly recommend \"Blaqkout.\"","overall":4,"summary":"\"How can you go wrong?\"","unixReviewTime":1244505600,"reviewTime":"06 9, 2009"}

I'm embarrassed to say that I did't even realize that she was still recording steadily in the eightys & ninetys. But hearing this stellar new album I want to go back and hear what I missed. This new recording is a revelation. Betty sounds GREAT and the songs on this album are terrific: a few classics and a bunch of other keepers. Not a dud in the bunch. And considering that there is over seventy minutes of music on this CD (wow!) that is saying at lot. Very impressive. Kudos to the guys in the Roots for doing a fine job of support. They blend in seamlessly and don't overpower the singer. Betty Wright does't sound like she's lost any of her soul and sass over the years. I agree with some of the other reviewers: this was one of the very best albums of two thousand and eleven.
