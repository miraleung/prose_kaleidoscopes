650,"People watch movies for a variety of different reasons. This movie did't have the big budget, there's no special effects, no car chases and there's no explosions. Actually reality does't have much of these either. At least not in my life. This is a very real movie about very real people, none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos. I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology, since I'm neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain. So watch this movie for the characters. It is brim-full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk. Within the first three minutes Kiefer Sutherland enacts Detective Michael Hayden's life superbly and the keeps developing the character throughout the movie. Excellent acting, very believable. Henry Czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between this 'Harvey' and Kiefer's 'Mickey' enhances the oppositeness of their characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady, 'Mrs Ramsay', I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends!!! There's a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited there so watch the movie and enjoy them.",positive

2470,"Fiction film (it lists as based on a story though it does have a ""documented by"" credit) about a group of scientists going into the wilds of Canada to try and find a Bigfoot.(They want to capture one and then attach a tracking device). Its lots of scientific mambo jumbo mixed in what is really a dull film of a bunch of people wandering around in the wilderness. There are some attempts at creating tension and scares, but to be perfectly honest there is nothing there worth seeing outside of some great looking shots of the wilds. This is a perfect definition of an exploitation film, it promises you so much, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it delivers very little. Recommended for insomniacs only",negative

3718,"Comparing this movie to anything by Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best thing I can say about it is it tries desperately to be like an Almodovar movie and fails miserably. The script is dreadful, the characters are one-dimensional, and the performances are the quality of high-school drama (except Marcia Gay Harden's, which is pretty good, given the material she has to work with). Furthermore, the cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the whimsical beauty of Gaudi's architecture for the infectious charm of Barcelona. If you enjoy the grit, pathos and dark, quirky comedy of Almodovar's movies, you'll find none of them there. Spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid.",negative

7503,i would give this movie an eight.five for a nine. I thought it was just straight up hilarious i don't know how you could not think this movie was funny but the only thing that disappointed me was that there was little bit too much gross stuff because personally i think when they fly off of bikes and stuff like that is much funnier but I'm sure there are people that think the other things are very funny so that is not my desicion but anyways great movie go see it and after that you should definitely go buy it also if you do not like this movie that is fine because I'm sure there are many people who think that this movie shows how downgrading your society is for whatever this is just my personal opinion and you have yours. also the jackass box set is definitely something worth downloading for buying for whatever you do to get your videos,positive

10536,"Dark Harvest three: Scarecrow: one out of ten: In Einstein's theory of relativity time is of the perspective of the one that views time. (Or so I've heard) In other words this movie feels a lot longer that an hour and change. Even on fast-forward (And you will be reaching for that fast forward button) it clocks in somewhere around eternity. If you are familiar with Lionsgate's own version of Project Greenlight (This is where they buy a home movie but a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror section of your local Wal-Mart) you will not be surprised by the complete and butter black of entertainment value contained within. The line reading (I refuse to call it acting) is uniformly awful. This is a collection of deadbeat dads and strippers pretending to be in a movie between scans of Schlitz. The camera work is drunken father shooting vacation film quality and while the special effects are okay the scariest effect is the breast augmentation scars in the nude scene. The story is awful, the sets are from a haunted Halloween put on by ADHD middle school students and once again the line reading (remember this is not acting anymore than sinking to the bottom of a pool is swimming) is distracting beyond mere words.

18874,"One of my favourite movies. Great cast, lead by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious drama situations with brilliant comedic punches. An exact mixture of character and story. Real people with real problems, and everyone has a different relationship with each family member. Sensitively moves from slightly-sad to hilariously-funny. Read the quotes. This is the best adaptation of a Neil Simon play. If you wanna see more of Eugene check Biloxi Blues (starring Matthew Broderick who played in both stage versions) is OK, a bit on a darker side. Get away from the made-for-TV Broadway Bound.",positive

20058,"In my mind the best of the Ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time. The theme of workers of. management (with lots of talk of unions and rights) perhaps dates the film a bit now as it's no longer a subject discussed all that much but that does't stop ""White Suit"" from being a show stopping classic. The plot, about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil, does't sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true Ealing comedy. The fabric repels dirt and can never wear out! The titular white suit that Alec Guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences, such as Guinness being table to use this indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall! The script itself is full of dry wit - ""Is the all right?"" ""Yes."" ""Pity."" - and characterisation is first rate. I'm always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well. Comedies of later eras would adopt a ""point the camera at the factors and let it roll"" mentality but the Ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations. This film is no exception. Of course, it's the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights. Alec Guinness gives a fantastically understated performance, with eyes that convey wonder, joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it. Stratton is a man oblivious to everything except this work. Such an insular character could quickly have become boring for irritating but Guinness effortlessly makes him likable, so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as Stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything the's never worked for. Joan Greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual, as are befuddled Cecil Parker and slimy Michael Gough; everybody gets laughs without even trying to. It's comical British understatement at its finest.""The Man in the White Suit"" is eighty-one minutes of sheer brilliance, with a great plot, great cast, sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism. Absolutely top notch.",positive
20058,"Meiner Meinung nach die besten Ealing-Komödien und einer meiner Lieblingsfilme aller Zeiten. Das Thema Arbeiter der. Management (mit viel Gerede über Gewerkschaften und Rechte) datiert den Film vielleicht ein bisschen jetzt, da es nicht mehr so ​​viel diskutiert wird, aber das hält ""White Suit"" nicht davon ab, ein Klassiker zu sein, der aufhört. Die Handlung über einen Mann, der versucht, einen revolutionären neuen Stoff zu kreieren, der die Textilindustrie in Aufruhr versetzt, klingt aufgeschrieben nicht aufregend, aber der Film behält den wesentlichen Funken Fantasie, gemischt mit der Realität, die ihn als wahr auszeichnet Ealing-Komödie. Der Stoff weist Schmutz ab und kann sich nie abnutzen! Der weiße Titelanzug, den Alec Guinness während der zweiten Hälfte trägt, wird zum Mittelpunkt mehrerer ikonischer Bilder und Sequenzen, wie zum Beispiel Guinness als Tisch, um mit diesem unzerstörbaren Faden eine steile Wand zu erklimmen! Das Drehbuch selbst ist voll von trockenem Witz - ""Ist das in Ordnung?"" ""Yes sir."" ""Das Mitleid."" - und Charakterisierung ist erstklassig. Ich bin auch immer wieder erstaunt über die wunderbare Regie in diesen Filmen. Komödien späterer Epochen nahmen eine ""Kamera auf die Faktoren richten und rollen lassen""-Mentalität an, aber die Ealing-Filme versuchten immer interessante Lichtverhältnisse und Winkel und Innovationen. Dieser Film ist keine Ausnahme. Natürlich ist es die Besetzung, die das Material in schwindelerregende Höhen hebt. Alec Guinness bietet eine fantastisch zurückhaltende Performance mit Augen, die Staunen, Freude und vernichtende Niederlagen vermitteln, wann immer die Geschichte es erfordert. Stratton ist ein Mann, der alles außer dieser Arbeit nicht wahrnimmt. Eine so abgeschiedene Figur hätte schnell langweilig werden können, um zu irritieren, aber Guinness macht ihn mühelos sympathisch, so dass die Schlussphase des Films eine echte Dringlichkeit erzeugt, als Stratton versucht, in einer Welt, die alles begraben will, sich durchzusetzen das hat noch nie funktioniert. Joan Greenwood spielt eine weitere ihrer starken Frauenrollen und ist wie immer ein absoluter Genuss, ebenso wie der verwirrte Cecil Parker und der schleimige Michael Gough; jeder lacht, ohne es zu versuchen. Es ist komödiantisches britisches Understatement vom Feinsten. ""Der Mann im weißen Anzug"" ist einundachtzig Minuten purer Brillanz, mit einer großartigen Handlung, einer großartigen Besetzung, sprühendem Witz und einem gesunden Schuss Zynismus. Absolut Spitzenklasse.",positive

36079,"This film is about a man's life going wrong. His business is failing, and the cannot impregnate this wife despite multiple attempts. The plot is complete chaos. It simply does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the film makes sense. The story is so poorly told that I simply could not understand it. It is a shame, because the sets and costumes are done well, and are visually stimulating enough. The shots are well composed throughout the film. However, these redeeming features still cannot make up for the bad plot and poor story telling. I am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film. It is such a waste of their talents.

38317,"Shwaas may have a good story, but the director is utterly devoid of talent. He does not know when to stop. When the story calls for people to act confused, there are ten minute scenes of people miming the act of confusion. When the story calls for a little background history, there are ten minute scenes of Konkan's greenery. When the story calls for a kid throwing tantrums. you get the idea. Not to mention the extreme closeups so that you can count people's nose hair. There are movies that should be seen on a big screen, this movie should be seen on a thirteen"" TV. Also Amruta Subhash who plays Asavari is the worst actress I've seen in quite a long time. A normal human being would need to practise overacting for years to achieve what she does so effortlessly. I give it four/ten solely because the subject matter is different, and the story is not bad. The fact that a movie like Shwaas gets to be India's entry to the Oscars tells volumes not about the state of Indian cinema but the state of Indian judging committees. A movie is not good just because its subject matter is party.",negative
38317,"Shwaas mag eine gute Geschichte haben, aber dem Regisseur fehlt es an Talent. He doesn't know when to stop. Wenn die Geschichte die Leute dazu auffordert, sich verwirrt zu verhalten, gibt es zehnminütige Szenen, in denen Leute die Verwirrung nachahmen. Wenn die Geschichte ein wenig Hintergrundgeschichte erfordert, gibt es zehnminütige Szenen von Konkans Grün. Wenn die Geschichte nach einem Kind verlangt, das Wutanfälle bekommt. You have the idea. Ganz zu schweigen von den extremen Nahaufnahmen, damit man die Nasenhaare der Leute zählen kann. Es gibt Filme, die man auf einer großen Leinwand sehen sollte, dieser Film sollte auf einem 13"" Fernseher gesehen werden. Auch Amruta Subhash, die Asavari spielt, ist die schlechteste Schauspielerin, die ich seit langem gesehen habe. Ein normaler Mensch müsste das tun Üben Sie jahrelang, zu übertreiben, um das zu erreichen, was sie so mühelos tut. Ich gebe vier/zehn, nur weil das Thema anders ist und die Geschichte nicht schlecht ist. Die Tatsache, dass ein Film wie Shwaas Indiens Einstieg in die Oscars wird, sagt Bände nicht über den Zustand des indischen Kinos, sondern über den Zustand der indischen Jurys. Ein Film ist nicht gut, nur weil sein Thema Party ist.",negative
39068,"This movie was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the screenplay (Ulee's Gold). Nice and straightforward writing, that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, looking at Ruby's day to day life. What we see is a slice in the life of the young woman Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. She explores jobs, friendships, boy friends, sex, a typical young adult search. The movie won Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast I picked the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of movie, because it does not carry the Hollywood baggage. Although the stories are completely different this reminded me of Nobody's Fool, staring Paul Newman. The later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man. I like that. The story is very nicely told, and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story. The only thing I am not sure about is the title. I am sure that there are not that many bugs, and flies in paradise as there are in Florida. As I am allergic to mosquito, Florida is no paradise to me, I pitch all over thinking about Florida. I turn into a complete red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking at the beach of Panama City, Florida.

As a brummie, some of the filming locations (especially a scene at the send outside the Ring O' Bells pub in Moseley!) were quite easy and fun to spot. but the odour look of the cinematography is really a downer on things. Some really poor acting, for instance lead factor Raido with an indecipherable accent that's all over the place, and a whammy script with some misfiring dialogue are bigger problems for the film though. More established factors like Peake and even telly favourite Neil Morressey are sidelined to very small supporting parts, while the disastrous Raido and Ronnie Fox's flame villain take centre stage.

But at least Steven got a few things right compared to this Crapperella. Hello, the ships weren't big insects, they had names. They were tripods and the aliens worked in threes. The ships and the aliens were all wrong, you don't see the aliens until they are sent. The effects and cast work well. But these factors are much better than this ""movie"" deserves. Most, if not the whole of the movie, is the Howell character, wondering through the devastation, meeting one person, joining him, and losing them for one reason for the other. At no point are more than two people in front of the camera, even though most of the film is. It's like shooting three at once then the movie is going to over budget for something. So bold is the only and nasty adaptation of the story of WAR OF THE WORLDS that can be seen, the GEORGE PAL version from the one thousand nine hundred and fifty years. THE BLACK HOLE.",negative
47771,"THE CHOKE (aka AXE in the UK) is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight-to-DVD movie. I say ""supposedly"" because the title of the movie does not have the ""V"" in brackets to indicate that it was a made for DVD movie (even though it does have the appearance of one). The plot is simple  a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by one. I think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece, but this does not excuse the faults there. Even straight-to-DVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating) have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so-called ""so bad, they're good"" movies. However, THE CHOKE falls far short of being either a serious slasher (such as HALLOWEEN) for being a ""so bad it's good"" movie (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE). The movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill. The blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget. But, from there towards, it's downhill all the way. There are so many faults in THE CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about them. But, a few obvious jones stand out and I'll go into them. The aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around fifty people present but after the music stops, there seems to be only around eight people left (and yet they're all meant to be locked in!). The characters in this movie are not likable at all. Most of the band members are aggressive foul-mouthed morons for just downright weird. No one really cares about what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they've been dispatched. The highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church (seriously!). He spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But sadly, even this presence can't save the movie. There are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation. Around sixty-five minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking. Characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation. As in other straight-to-DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all. There are plenty of over-the-top outbursts (mainly from the male characters) and one nearly results in a full-blown fight. In fact, the format could be said to go as follows: characters walk around--murder takes place--characters walk around--murder takes place. You get the idea. The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the of-word being used. Perhaps this was meant to be funny, but it just comes off as sad. And more to the point, we have all seen this done a thousand times before (usually to much greater effect). The movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all. The dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger. A maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons. They make little attempt to get out of the factory for find a weapon with which to protect themselves. And much of the time, they don't even pretend to be scared. In the same vein as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed (with the exception of the final murder when the killer's identity is revealed). A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. There is no one seen stalking the characters at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, this served to make the film funny (unintentionally of course), but there it is not funny at all. And, as another reviewer has pointed out, the soundtrack includes music that is very bad, even for those who like punk rock. The extras look uncomfortable dancing to it. The score (at the send, there is no music at the beginning!) consists of a band of Sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie. Don't misunderstand the points made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as the classics (such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE thirteenTH). But, it seems that THE CHOKE tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either. And even as straight-to-DVD movies go, this is a poor effort. On a positive note, the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes. But, when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes close their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion. Fans of the traditional one thousand, nine hundred and eightys B-movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of the classics such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE thirteenTH should do everything in their power to avoid it!",negative
