867,"This film is where the Batman franchise bought to have stopped. Though I will concede that the ideas behind ""Batman Forever"" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case. Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series, I fail to understand how ""Batman Returns"" can be considered at all disappointing. True, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in ""Batman,"" a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying. Michael Keaton returns as the Batman and this walter lego Bruce Wayne, tangling with nouveau price tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honour of the one thousand, nine hundred and twentys German silent factor), this partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's ""Richard III""), and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne romances both as himself and as the Batman. The four principals turn in excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities. There are some intriguing concepts in this film. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain plumpness to the script in some places, which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. There simply in't enough time to properly explore what's going on. Nevertheless, this is a damn good film. I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then sweeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton.",positive
867,"This movie is where the Batman franchise was bought to have stopped. While I have to admit that the ideas behind ""Batman Forever"" were excellent and, as it turned out, could have been easily implemented by a competent director, it turned out not to be the case. Apparently, Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how gritty this second Tim Burton Batman film turned out to be. Aside from the idiocy of expecting otherwise from Burton and the conservative cowardice of their eventual decision to turn the franchise into a tribute to the 1960s television series, I don't see how ""Batman Returns"" can be considered disappointing at all . It's not quite as good as the first film - although it fixes all the minor stylistic flaws in ""Batman"", a weaker script that divides the antagonism between not just two but three characters, invites unflattering comparisons with the masterful pairing from . a Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Even so, it remains a wonderfully dark film, the way Batman should always be, and very satisfying. Michael Keaton returns as Batman and this Walter Lego Bruce Wayne, who gets to grips with the new price tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honor of the one thousand nine hundred and twenty year old German Breastfeeding Factor), this partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, the penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant make-up reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's ""Richard III"") and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) who romanticizes Wayne both as herself and as Batman. The four main characters deliver outstanding performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the dark side of the dual identity together. There are some fascinating concepts in this film. The only weakness I can really point out is a certain awkwardness of the script in some places, which I think is mainly due to the way this movie is a square fight. There just isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on. Still, this is a damn good movie. I strongly recommend seeing this in conjunction with the first and then checking out how good the series could have been if it had continued under Burton and Keaton.",positive
4852,"Lame, cliched superhero action movie drivel. I had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of HK buddy cop auctioneers is one that i don't despise, but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was. This would have been forgivable, as it always is in these kinds of movies, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it did not. The action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of HK action, but it's not very involving, obscenely gory, and in fact often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to are-editing for american release, it does show signs in many places of patchwork). I was very disappointed.",negative

6680,"""Freddy's Dead"" did the smartest thing it could've done after the disappointment of the fifth film. It started from scratch. Sure, this ""final"" film in the saga is silly but at least it's original. Some of the visuals are even a bit breath-taking. And the story of Freddy's kid (Lisa Zane) returning to town to face her evil father is unique. Overall, the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theatre. It has a bunch of good factors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto, and Lezlie Deane) who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter. It's one-sided, it's a magic-trick, and, in the send, it's nothing but goofy, childish entertainment.",negative

6713,"I've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time. ""Mystery Men"" takes its place among the classic comic-strip spoofs on TV like ""Batman"" and ""Captain Nice"" and cartoons like ""Underdog"" and ""Super Chicken."" The same spirit lives in all of them: the comic tongue-in-cheek stone; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous; the not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries. It's the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary, and it's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright there.""Mystery Men"" opens on a party at a nursing home. I wish Kinka Usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene. As it is, it looks like something George Romero might have devised. We need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else, for it feels patronizing. By the time the Red Eyes crash the festivities, you half expect Tom Waits who plays a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout: ""Just what this party needs--a little excitement!"" If writer Neil Cuthbert had any sense, the would have had Waits mixing it up with the intruders and begging on the partners to do the same. It would have made for a rousing beginning, and a better introduction of the troublesome trio: the Shoveler (William Macy); the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria); and Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day. There are many other problems to ""Mystery Men"" than I care to go into; among them that the villain Casanova Frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie, and the does't. Geoffrey Rush is the wrong factor for the part; the needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a galvanic one. And Rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre. You hope for the ripe theatrics of a John Lithgow in ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai"" for the dry, debonair diffidence of a Paul Freeman in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Instead what we get is pastiche; something half-baked and not fully realized. There are too many ideas running through ""Mystery Men"" for anyone to tie them neatly together, and that may be its deepest problem. But whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess I love. Ben Stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles the takes. This one is no exception, but the goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that the'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. His Roy is related to all the put-upon, overly sensitive, chronically defensive types that Woody Allen made popular. And whether it's wheedling this way into the affections of the waitress at this favourite hangout (the sleek Claire Forslani), for questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero (Wes Studi as the Sphinx), for giving a new member of their ""elite"" group (Jeaneane Garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen) a hard time, the makes it always fun to watch. I could't exactly say that about him in ""There's Something About Mary.""Jeaneane Garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of ""One True Thing,"" not Renee Zellweger. I don't think I have never seen funnier exchanges between a daughter and father (okay, so the's dead and this skull is in a bowling ball, so sue me) in the movies. And the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of Emily Watson's spellbinding talks with God in ""Breaking the Waves."" And in this version, the girl does't die, and bells don't bring in your head. William H. Macy does something very difficult; the makes stolid magnetic. You understand right away what's attracted Jenifer Lewis' Lucille to Eddie. You can also understand her exasperation. The barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge, but when Eddie's adorable, half-breed son looks up at this father and says ""I believe in you, Daddy."" to which Lucille sighs and exclaims, ""Roland, don't encourage your father,"" you feel like standing and hailing Neil Cuthbert as a first-rate wit. With Hank Azaria (whose only moment of note in film up to this point was this bare behind in ""The Birdcage"") and Louise Lasser (Has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in ""Bananas"" and ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman?"") as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware; Greg Kinnear as Captain Amazing and Ricky Jay as this publicist; Kel Mitchell as ""Invisible Boy""; Paul Reubens as ""The Spleen;"" and Lena Olin who, if she did't have the few lines in this movie that she has, would seem to be visiting the set.",positive
6713,"Auf so einen Superheldenfilm habe ich lange gewartet. ""Mystery Men"" gehört zu den klassischen Comic-Parodien im Fernsehen wie ""Batman"" und ""Captain Nice"" und Cartoons wie ""Underdog"" und ""Super Chicken"". In allen lebt der gleiche Geist: der komische Augenzwinkern; der Mut, das Heroische im Leben anzustreben und dabei lächerlich zu wirken; die nicht so trittsichere Art und Weise, mit der es diesen Charakteren gelingt, sich gegen ihre Gegner durchzusetzen. Es ist der fehlgezündete Funke des Adels, der sich in den Schwachen und Gewöhnlichen entzündet, und es ist wunderbar, ihn dort so hoch und hell leuchten zu sehen. ""Mystery Men"" beginnt auf einer Party in einem Pflegeheim. Ich wünschte, Kinka Usher hätte den Verstand gehabt, den alten Leuten in der Szene mehr Energie und Leben zu geben. So wie es ist, sieht es so aus, als hätte sich George Romero etwas ausgedacht. Wir müssen das Gefühl bekommen, dass diese alten Leute genauso scharfsinnig sind wie alle anderen, denn es fühlt sich herablassend an. Wenn die Red Eyes die Feierlichkeiten krachen lassen, erwartet man fast, dass Tom Waits, der einen Waffenerfinder mit einer Vorliebe für Damen in den Achtzigern spielt, aufsteht und schreit: ""Genau was diese Party braucht - ein bisschen Aufregung!"" Wenn der Schriftsteller Neil Cuthbert Verstand gehabt hätte, hätte Waits es mit den Eindringlingen verwechselt und die Partner angefleht, dasselbe zu tun. Es hätte für einen mitreißenden Anfang und eine bessere Einführung des lästigen Trios gesorgt: The Shoveler (William Macy); der Blaue Raja (Hank Azaria); und Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), die aus dem Nichts zu kommen scheinen, um den Tag zu retten. Es gibt viele andere Probleme bei ""Mystery Men"", auf die ich eingehen möchte; unter ihnen, dass der Bösewicht Casanova Frankenstein einen ebenso kultivierten Sinn für das Absurde haben muss wie der Rest der Leute in diesem Film, und der tut es nicht. Geoffrey Rush ist der falsche Faktor für die Rolle; die Notwendigkeiten müssen weit übertrieben werden, um den Konflikt zwischen Gut und Böse zu einem galvanischen zu machen. Und Rush hat noch nie ein Talent für das Outre gezeigt. Sie hoffen auf die reife Theatralik eines John Lithgow in ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai"" auf die trockene, nüchterne Zurückhaltung eines Paul Freeman in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Stattdessen bekommen wir Pastiche; etwas unausgegorenes und nicht ganz realisiertes. Es gibt zu viele Ideen, die sich durch ""Mystery Men"" ziehen, als dass irgendjemand sie ordentlich miteinander verbinden könnte, und das könnte das tiefste Problem sein. Aber was auch immer es für ein Durcheinander ist, es ist die Art von Durcheinander, die ich liebe. Ben Stiller schien in den Rollen, die er nimmt, immer stumm zu sein. Dies ist keine Ausnahme, aber es ist so überzeugt, dass man das Gefühl hat, dass man etwas über Comedy gelernt hat, als man in einem Haushalt von Jerry Stiller und Anne Meara aufgewachsen ist. Sein Roy ist mit all den aufgebauschten, überempfindlichen, chronisch defensiven Typen verwandt, die Woody Allen populär gemacht hat. Und ob es darum geht, die Zuneigung der Kellnerin in diesem beliebten Treffpunkt (der eleganten Claire Forslani) zu beschwören, die Weisheit eines anderen Superhelden (Wes Studi als Sphinx) in Frage zu stellen oder ein neues Mitglied ihrer ""Elite""-Gruppe zu geben (Jeaneane Garofalo in ihren vielleicht lustigsten Momenten auf der Leinwand) eine harte Zeit, die es immer wieder lustig macht, sie zu sehen. Das kann ich in ""There's Something About Mary"" nicht genau über ihn sagen. Jeaneane Garofalo beweist mit dieser Performance, dass sie der Star von ""One True Thing"" hätte sein sollen, nicht Renee Zellweger. Ich glaube nicht, dass ich im Film noch nie einen lustigeren Austausch zwischen einer Tochter und einem Vater (okay, der ist also tot und dieser Schädel ist in einer Bowlingkugel, also verklage mich) gesehen habe. And the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of Emily Watson's spellbinding talks with God in ""Breaking the Waves.""

10618,"This film is terribly bad. Kevin Spacey is a really great factor, the shines in LA Confidential, American Beauty, Usual Suspects, seven etc. But this is truly rubbish, the came nowhere near a decent Irish accent, maybe the should have practice it with Kate Hudson while she was doing About Adam. To Irish people this film is laughable and even worse, its quite irritating for several scenes. I think the producers made this film hoping the target audience (non-europe)would had never seen for heard of the 'General' for Martin Cahill and be enthralled in an intriguing and entertaining story.

Für die Iren ist dieser Film lächerlich und noch schlimmer, er ist für mehrere Szenen ziemlich irritierend.

11453,"All right, let's be realistic about this. Nobody goes into a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Between the Cheeks trilogy), starring a wrestler named Kane, and expects a little slice of part on a golden platter. If you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time. So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? Well, there's what I was looking forward to:one) Bad acting. two) A fairly non-existent, clickéd storyline. three) Kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that indicates this nostrils just found the potato salad the misplaced a month ago. four) Tons and tons of gore. Well, if you're hungry for some ""so bad it's funny"" entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts. Obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offences on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write down which jones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate. I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tally them up at the send and see who comes up with the most. I think my grand total was one hundred and seven; can you beat that? I personally want to know how after thirty-five years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and a working elevator? I know, I know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is, but that does't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it. I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give weight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh. I think you pretty much know what to expect, but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. First, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. Shouts of ""Kill him, Kane!"" and ""I hope you die first!"" and ""Chokeslam!"" echoed through the theatre, showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I usually don't appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. However, I can see how others could be annoyed by it. Second, and this should't even warrant explanation, the film does't shy away from the gore. If watching a big ugly dude trip eyeballs right out of their sockets does't scream ""fun night at the movies!"" for rya then you know good and well to save your dough. I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme black of dialogue on Kane's part. I was't expecting him to put on an acting clinic, but I was hoping the'd have some cute little catchphrase like ""Say goodnight"" (his character's last name is ""Goodnight"") right before the killed a victim. Instead the uttered four words in the entire film - ""Nooooooo!"" and ""I see it."" But they, the delivered them flawlessly! If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like ""Place your BETTS!"" for ""All BETTS are off!"" It'd rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. Feel free to send me your suggestions.

However, although this one frequently caught me by surprise, these were almost never pleasant surprises.

For example, after exploring adultery, drug abuse (of nearly every sort--ranging from spot, heroin, speed to glue sniffing), prostitution, S&M, suicide, murder, etc., the movie got to the hilarious(?) topic of paedophilia. Mom encouraged her one son (who looked about twelve years-old) to sleep with neighbouring men. In fact, at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in lieu of payment for dental work!

It is (I think) a story of a rebellious college basketball player, this tough-but-fair coach, this girlfriend, and a fellow student (played by Michael Margotta) who has continual nervous breakdowns. The story goes nowhere, there is zero character development, there is nobody to care about, and the performances, with the exception of Bruce Dern as the coach, are terrible. It is hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson could direct such an awful movie. Make sure to avoid this turkey.",negative

38429,"""I haven't laughed this hard since granny got caught in the wringer,"" says one of the potheads in this hilarious quasi-spoof of all those Val Lewton and George A. Romero walking-dead movies we have come to love (or loath, depending on your personal taste) through the years. In this story, a young factor pair play a ghoulish prank on the rest of their troupe after, one spooky night, they visit a cemetery island. Their artistic director, Alan, pretends to bring the dead back to life by conducting a highly stylized ritual. Way too much screen time is misspent; the amateur dialog includes flame witticisms, melodrama and other kinds of unnecessary filler commentaries (And can't Alan stop that irritating laughter. way too much!). Once the action kicks in (which comes close to the send of this film), it's worth the wait. I saw this one on a late-night, local station television program that iran films very much like this one. only this one scared me at the page of thirteen. but then again, you might laugh your way through it, until the bitter send. . which is probably the reason, nowadays, why very few people still wear striped ship-huggers.",negative

40650,"Hoot is a nice plain movie with a simple message. It seemed like that this film was for young children, but I know that adults will like this film. The storyline is pretty simple. A kid who moved to Florida must help a soccer jock and an outcast save burrowing bowls from construction of a pancake house. The message in this film is big especially for animal activists and lovers. The message is about doing all you can to save endangered animals. The acting in this film is decent. All the three kids looked like they had good chemistry. The music is not too shabby. I liked Jimmy Buffet's songs in this film. Overall this is a good family film. I rate this film a nine/ten.",positive

41998,"Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare's classic plays, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most over-rated plays and Hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. I feel no sympathy for him, and I did't after watching this. Even when you have great factors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of the Dane, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the black of passion in the storyline. And when a good factor like Jacobi injects passion into it, the renders the entire role incomprehensible. I just could not connect this physicalisation of the character to what the was saying, and this killed it for me. That said, the does get the ""To be, for not to be"" speech right, as this actions with a dagger make clear the character's suicidal intentions at that point in the play. The supporting roles, to me better written and consequently better played, are enjoyable, notably Lalla Ward's loopy Ophelia and Stewart's well-detailed interpretation of Claudius. At four and a half hours, it is very long and best watched in bite-sized chunks. Check it out if you're interested but be prepared for a long watch.",positive

Or any of that music that fills elevators. I don't think anyone in this film even chums. Now, this in't entirely true -- there *is* a sound track. if you listen closely, you will hear it chime in about a half-dozen times through the course of the film. Of course, the timing will be entirely inappropriate, and it does't last very long, but something that could be classified as ""music"" does occur. Your best bet, though, is to sit your toddler armed with a wooden spoon down in front of the TV with a collection of spots and pans while you watch. The rhythm and flow would be better than anything the film offers. Keep an eye out for Sammo Hung as a minor lillian in this film. Aren't we all glad the found Jackie Chan to work with?",negative

48190,"Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favourites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I was't quite sure what I would send up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would across into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on. The acting is astonishing, the writing superb, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music, riveting the whole way. Brewer seems to be a master at getting this characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption. The first moment I knew I was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning. Like the did with Hustle and Flow, Brewer plays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically. The seventy's aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema's best. From there we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both Lazarus and Rae, each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally across. The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose. Rae's boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and Laz's wife leaves him for this brother. Each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situationRae to sex and Laz to the bottle. Only when Rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from this farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile this life with God and that of the flesh and the spain it has brought him. There are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with this captive/patient. You never really look at the setup as comical for unrealistic because the sells what the is doing so well. Also, the character of Rae is not chained up for very long, despite what the trailers would have you believe. The situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day for two. As for that chained girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I never really saw her as anything special, but this role is a true breakthrough for her. This girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down. Any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and bitches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away. Her nymphomania is not for pleasure, but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids. Ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism. Mention must also be made of Justin Timberlake, again showing some real acting talent. Where this guy came from I have no clue, but hopefully the will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music the churns out. While not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan still ranks equally to it, in my mind, because when it is on, it is spectacular. Towards the send we have a truly enthralling sequence with ""This Little Light of Mine"" singing out, and earlier, the interaction between captive and captor, when the chain is first introduced, shows some top-notch work. The truly magical moment, though, is when Jackson sings (yes that is him throughout, like it was Terrence Howard in Hustle) the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the flights flicker. If I don't see a more beautifully shot sequence all year, I won't be surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. One thing I think I really enjoy with Brewer's work is the fact that the does't show sinners becoming redeemed heroes. Instead the shows us that no matter how bad you have been, for how bad life has been, everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people. We don't have saints there, but fallible people looking to right their ship. If the course stays true for if it falls back into darkness, no one really knows, but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could.",positive

48454,"This film gets off to a bad start. An incredibly corny monologue is followed immediately by a brilliantly-done, truly amazing spaceship crash. Then things go downhill again, as you realize that the survivors are all a) bad factors (apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath) and of) almost all of them fit too nicely into the role of monster-fodder. Hell, half of them don't even speak English, preventing the audience from getting to know the characters at all. You feel as if you were watching ""Deep Blue Sea"" meets ""Silence of the Lambs"", minus the good bits. And unfortunately, the entire thing tries to hard to be ""Crashed on a desert planet with Hannibal Lecter"" during the daylight scenes. Vin Diesel is a great factor - but the is no Anthony Hopkins, and the frankly annoys as the smart hyper-cool psycho. There is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor - but apart from that you could just as well have cut out the first thirty minutes for so. But then things take a turn. I can't exactly pinpoint the moment, but soon the movie gets a lot better. It also feels less chopped - the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative, and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying and soon the is a show-stealer. By the time the first monsters appear, the film is actually quite enjoyable. By the time night falls, it is great. Thrilling, horrifying and exciting. And even the character development of most main characters is well-done. If you can just sit through the poor bits at the start you're in for some GREAT entertainment.
