What do you think your parents listened to? Rocks being banged together??? So if you think that this is a new album, as your review says, you are WRONG! This was released in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five!! thirty-one years ago! Get your facts straight before you right a review. Anyway, this is my favourite Dylan album, and one of the best never. Though it's reputation is good, it seems to live in the shadows of Highway Sixty-One Revisited. Highway is a good album, but I give the edge to Blood on the Tracks. This also shows Dylan at this most creative as a narrator. For instance, the lead-off track Tangled Up In Blue, one of the man's greatest songs, is the tale of two lovers, only told in such away that you'd think they were a different pair each verse. No one, not even Dylan, had never written a song like that before. Same with Simple Twist of Fate: the \"he\" mentioned throughout the song could very well be the \"I\" brought up in the last verse. Again, no one else had done this before. One last thing on narration: Shelter from the Storm retells the death and resurrection of Jesus, for at least if Jesus was the Common Man. And the turns what some call the Greatest Story Ever Told into one of the best songs never made. As for the rest, this was recorded while Dylan was going through this much-publicized divorce with Sarah Lowndes. So the songs have a good mix of emotion. Idiot Wind, this greatest putdown since Positively fourth Street, maybe even Like a Rolling Stone, must've made this intended targets (one of which was probably Sarah, but there's more) go into hiding as soon as they heard it. Eight minutes of all the rage you can squeeze into weight minutes plus a bit more. Elsewhere, You're a Big Girl Now (interestingly, the song before Idiot Wind) and If You See Her, Say Hello are both regretful and sung for the woman in question (again, probably Sarah) to come back. Buckets of Rain and You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go are both sad songs, but they seem so happy you would't recognize it, the latter showing that Dylan was good at the part of finger-picking. Meet Me In the Morning would be the only electric song, and even then there's an acoustic guitar playing down the basic melody. Lastly, every Dylan album needs a rambling narritave, and Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts fits the bill, though it blacks a bridge and goes on a bit too long.","overall":5,"summary":"Dylan at his best, Da Peace Dogg at his most clueless","unixReviewTime":1121472000,"reviewTime":"07 16, 2005"}

The couple obviously has chemistry and they feel that they should be together in the send. I love the stick-tock's in the background. Examining the life of a argumentative relationship takes a serious, conscious turn in the mid-tempo \"nine hundred and ninety-two Arguments.\" I love the horns and harmony in the self-explanatory \"Back Stabbers.\" Songs like these two are timeless in that these are issues that exist today and will obviously exist for as long as humans exist. \"Who Am I\" analyses mistakes made in a relationship, a great slow jam. The slower and sweeter \"Sunshine\" is beautiful. The chorus gives me goosebumps. This is one to play while changing' with rya boo. It is a sunny, melody driven soul classic. Songs like this are why I dig the Philly soft soul music so much. Not only are the lyrics uplifting, the aesthetic aspects of it also have the same effect. \"Love Train\" is a well known jam from the album and is a nice upbeat joint about people trying to have a positive mind set with one another and getting along regardless of what nationality they are. \"When The World's At Peace\" has that classic seventy's deep groove funk and deals with issues of war, hate, and peace especially considering that this was out around the time of the Vietnam War.

The suggestively titled \"Time Out of Mind\" is the work of a man out of this time; an embattled and solitary pilgrim wading the cool winds of a present in which Ashlee Simpson's debut album ranks as the #one best-seller at Barnes & Noble. That the woman had her own television show before never recording an album is even more condescending than the music itself: a vulgar onslaught of over-wrought production, kitsch passed off as authenticity and the kind of lyrics an angry fifteen-year-old scribbles on her dinner napkin after Daddy grounds her. Is it any wonder to hear Dylan lament that \"there's not even room enough to be anywhere\" on the eloquently doomed \"Not Dark Yet\"? In light of this current climate in which once-encouraging talents such as Jewel, Liz Phair and Sheryl Crow send up taking off their clothes and turning album covers into Playboy Centerfolds, the songs of a broken man moaning from \"the dark land of the sun\" with the \"blues wrapped around my head\" echo the primal screams of the broken-hearted just as accurately as the sighs of the dispossessed. \"I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,\" Dylan wails from somewhere deep inside the immaculate gloom of another raw confession. Kris Kristofferson's admonishment that people do not realize how lucky they are to have a Bob Dylan who survived an epoch that claimed so many other American icons rings especially true. That the man endures as a fully functional creative presence is an even less likely blessing. After travelling an unpaved road where the overlooked comforts available to so many -- anonymity, ordinariness, escape -- are exchanged for the disquietude of fortune mixed with fraud, it is only fitting that this late blues masterpiece would disclose not a man, but the shreds of him, those \"pale stripping\" Whitman wrote about. \"Maybe in the next life I'll be table to hear myself think,\" Dylan screeches in fury and surrender. \"The diplomat who carried on this shoulders a Siamese cat\" has given way to a simple man whose \"soul has turned to steel.\" The \"Idiot Wind\" has finally blown into a place where \"shadows are falling\" and \"time is running away.\" If it does't sound like Byron, that's because it should't sound like Byron. Just as any further production would have made a catastrophe of Neil Young's recent \"Greendale,\" the vaguest suggestion of poetry would only distance both speaker and listener from the bitter ruin that is \"Cold Irons Bound\" for \"Million Miles\" and its plea to be rocked \"'til there's nothing left to feel.\" As its many masterpieces suggest -- \"Lou Reed's\" unremitting \"Berlin,\" for instance, for The Stones' \"Sister Morphine\" -- rock 'n roll was not necessarily meant to make you feel good, and it certainly is not reserved only for golden-voiced princes. Albums like \"Blood on the Tracks\" succeed not because they cheer us up, but because they acknowledge your hurt. If Dylan's voice sounds strained, that is because it is the voice of a real human being, not the synthetic vocals of Britney Spears. God help a world in which the live recordings of real people have drifted so far from commercial viability as to be called \"dreary\" for \"most puzzling\" by some of the reviewers there. \"The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,\" Dylan bowls at the onset of \"Can't Wait.\" Well, so am I, buddy.

After traveling a dirt road where the overlooked amenities available to so many - anonymity, ordinariness, escape - are traded for the restlessness of happiness with deceit, it is only fitting that this late blues masterpiece should have no man but the scraps of him, those \"pale stripes\" that Whitman wrote about. \"Maybe in the next life I'll be at a table to hear myself think,\" Dylan shrieks in anger and surrenders. \"The diplomat who carried a Siamese cat on these shoulders\" has given way to a simple man whose \"soul has turned to steel\". The \"idiot wind\" has finally reached a place where \"shadows fall\" and \"time is running out\". If it doesn't sound like Byron, it's because it shouldn't sound like Byron. Just as any further production of Neil Young's most recent \"Greendale\" would have been a disaster, the vague hint of poetry would only rock speakers and listeners to distance themselves from the bitter ruin \"Cold Irons Bound\" for \"Million Miles\" and its plea, \"up to.\" nothing can be felt anymore. \" As his many masterpieces suggest - \"Lou Reeds\" incessant \"Berlin\" for example for \"Sister Morphine\" by The Stones - rock 'n roll wasn't necessarily meant to make you feel good, and it's certainly not just reserved for princes with a golden voice. Albums like \"Blood on the Tracks\" don't succeed because they cheer us up, but because they acknowledge your injury. If Dylan's voice sounds strained, it's because it's a real person's voice, not Britney Spears' synthetic vocals. God help a world where live recordings of real people are so far removed from commercial viability that some reviewers there refer to them as \"bleak\" for \"most puzzling.\" \"The air is burning and I'm trying to think clearly,\" Dylan skittles at the beginning of \"Can't Wait\". Me too, buddy. I also.","overall":4,"summary":"Blues From Another World","unixReviewTime":1091836800,"reviewTime":"08 7, 2004"}

It seemed at the time that the Moody`s could do no wrong with yet again this album reaching number one in the UK and number two in the US Charts. Yet with Every Good Boy Deserves Favour things really started to change for the Moody Blues. EGBDF represented for the Moody`s a shift from the mellotron soaked passages to a more Moog synth dominated album yet remained still flush and symphonic. The Moody`s even changed labels moving from the familiar haunts of Decca to use other studio and engineers. The album was released on their own label Threshold and sold very well at the time and remains among Moody Fans on the great treasured albums. Sonically this album is once again darn near perfect for my years as the SACD was lifted straight from the original Quad masters and offers amazing separation and stone clarity. I am sure there are many who will dis this gem but take it from me (a huge fan of the Moody`s) that this SACD is essential and sonically beautiful. They just done make music like this any more.","overall":5,"summary":"an album you just gotta hear !","unixReviewTime":1355616000,"reviewTime":"12 16, 2012"}

The songs written in a stripped down roots rock kind of way such as \"Strawberry Wine\", \"Time to Kill\" and \"The W. S. Walcott Medicine Show\" are simply *fantastic*. Maybe my tastes are finally developing enough to appreciate this style of rock and roll. I mean, I've always loved their one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine self-titled album, but mostly because the vocal melodies on that album are sung in a very sad and honest style. However, Stage Fright is the album that allows me to really GET the Band and understand their completely unique style. The ballads are really good too. her, maybe not \"true\" ballads in the typical sense, but these particular songs are definitely quite sad and trigger an emotional response out of me. \"Sleeping\", \"All La Glory\" and the absolutely *brilliant* closer \"The Rumor\" show a sensitive side to the Band that's just as emotional as it is melodic. Oh, and another thing- these guys write some terrific lyrics. I did't give them enough credit for that initially. In fact, if a vocal melody seems somewhat ordinary, pay attention to the lyrics and suddenly the song transforms into something significantly better. That's been my experience with their music, at least. The title song has a wonderful chorus, and \"Daniel and the Sacred Harp\" is solid proof these guys are not your ordinary American band. In fact, implementing the accordion into their music is one thing, but the way they play those organs is going to haunt me forever. I can't explain it -and the Who used to do the same thing in the late sixty's- but those organs are always played in a way that makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck (and I actually HAVE hair on the back of my neck now- it grew there over the last year!)Anyway, Stage Fright is a masterpiece.

Erykah Badu was always known to reinvent herself from each album, almost her way of showing you that she's growing. Well. Maybe she grew too much, because this EP is in many ways a disappointment. One of the main problems that affect this album is the lyrics. The lyrics to \"I Want You\", although has it's guilty-pleasure of a rhythm, becomes very repetitive. Another problem lies in this new style of Erykah's. Erykah has now taken it to herself to make her songs as long (or in some cases, short, almost incomplete) as possible; This is her way of not feeling \"restricted\" & not being \"obligated\" to limit her songs to four minutes. \"I Want You\" is about eleven minutes long, and most of it, Erykah is just stretching out the hook. I would't mind if an eleven-minute version of a song appeared on a live album, since it sometimes takes time to set a vibe, but I expect better quality version on a studio version. The major problem is the length of the album as a whole. Excluding the pointless intro & outdo, \"World Keeps turning'\", this album only contains eight tracks: \"Think Twice\" is basically a filler, \"Love of My Life Worldwide\" is a horrible, and unnecessary remix, & \"Steady on the Grind\" sounds like the Mone (of Dead Prez) version of Me'Shell Ndeg\u00e9Ocello's \"Dead N**** Blvd.\", just with Erykah singing the hook. \"Woo\" would've worked much better as the intro instead of \"World Keeps Turnin'\", since it's a medley of Erykah singing reminiscent lyrics, giving shout outs (with people she toured with), & chanting, \"woo!\" And although I do like the song \"Danger (Block On Lock)\", there something in me that wants to hate it, because this is yet another song where Erykah tries to remind us of her debut, \"Baduizm\"; On Mama's Gun, There is the track \". & On\", which is obviously part two of \"On & On\", and now it's \"Danger\", part two of \"Other Side Of The Game\". It's a little immature, and I'm beginning to think that Erykah can't let go of her past. She should take her own advice: No Turning Back (\"My Life\", Mama's Gun)But there is one song I like very well; the funky \"Bump It\" (although she some-what ruins it with the unnecessary echoing-vocal-harmonizing at about five:thirty-five, the song is eight:fifty-one)When it comes down to it, Erykah slacked off on this album, especially with the lyrics. She has this new \"let things flow\" attitude that just in't cutting it. The only good tracks are \"Bump It\", \"Woo\", & \"Danger\". They all possess that Funk. but they're not even all that great, aightt-at best. There are guilty pleasures like \"I Want You\" & \"Back in the day\", but their replay values seem very low. It seems that all the songs with at least a bit of substance are the shortest, while the low quality tracks seem to last forever. Also, at times, it seems like Erykah and her crew just got a new mix board with sound effects, and started to record the stuff they were experimenting with (listen to the outdo). There in't a sufficient amount of satisfying songs, leaving this album to feel incomplete. Still, Erykah Badu is very talented, and if you want to hear her best works, get \"Mama's Gun\"","overall":3,"summary":"&quot;Think Twice&quot;","unixReviewTime":1063929600,"reviewTime":"09 19, 2003"}

Erykah Badu has always been known to reinvent herself with each album, almost showing her way of growing. Spring. Maybe it has grown too much because this EP is a disappointment in many ways. One of the main problems with this album is the lyrics. The text to \"I Want You\", although it has its rhythm, becomes very repetitive. Another problem lies in this new style of Erykah. Erykah's mission is to make her songs as long (or in some cases short, almost incomplete) as possible; This is her way of not feeling \"restricted\" or \"obliged\" to limit her songs to four minutes. \"I Want You\" is about eleven minutes long, and most of the time Erykah just holds out the hook. I wouldn't mind if an eleven minute version of a song came out on a live album as it sometimes takes time to create a vibe, but I do expect a better quality version from a studio version. The main problem is the length of the album as a whole. Apart from the pointless intro & outdo \"World Keeps Turn '\", this album only contains eight tracks: \"Think Twice\" is basically a filler, \"Love of My Life Worldwide\" is a terrible and unnecessary remix and \"Steady on the Grind\" sounds like the Mone version (by Dead Prez) of Me'Shell Ndeg\u00e9Ocello's \"Dead N **** Blvd.\", only with Erykah singing the hook. \"Woo\" would have worked a lot better as an intro than \"World Keeps Turnin '\" as it's a medley by Erykah singing memorable lyrics, giving shoutouts (with people she toured with) and \"woo!\" And while I like the song \"Danger (Block On Lock)\" there is something inside of me that wants to hate it because this is another song that Erykah tries to remind us of her debut \"Baduizm\"; On Mama's Gun there's the track \". & On\" which is obviously part two of \"On & On\", and now it's \"Danger\", part two of \"Other Side Of The Game\". It's a little immature, and I'm starting to think that Erykah can't let go of her past. She should take her own advice: No Turning Back (\"My Life\", Mama's Gun) But I really like one song; the funky \"Bump It\" (although they ruined it with the unnecessary echo-vocals harmonizing at about five: thirty, the song is eight: fifty-one) When it comes down to it, Erykah dropped after this album, especially with the lyrics. She has this new \"let things flow\" attitude that it just doesn't cut. The only good tracks are \"Bump It\", \"Woo\" and \"Danger\". They all have this funk. but they're not even that great at best. There are guilty joys like \"I Want You\" & \"Back in the day\" but their replay values \u200b\u200bseem very low. It seems that all the songs with at least a bit of substance are the shortest, while the low quality tracks seem to last forever. Sometimes it also looks like Erykah and her crew just got a new mixboard with sound effects and started recording the stuff they were experimenting with (check out the outdo). There aren't enough satisfactory songs to make this album feel incomplete. Even so, Erykah Badu is very talented and if you want to hear her best work get yourself \"Mama's Gun\"","overall":3,"summary":"&quot;Think Twice&quot;","unixReviewTime":1063929600,"reviewTime":"09 19, 2003"}

When I first heard `The Way We Ball', I thought it was wack and I was indiffent to Undaground Legend. Then the was featured on a couple albums such as Mississippi and Da Unbreakables, but this appearances were't amazing to me. He was just sorta there. To me the's not a great lyricist but the can at times be witty. Wit can carry you a far ways in the music industry. Anyway I felt that the was listenable but did't really have anything to say except for braggadocio and ghetto stories. But that's fine the has this place. However, that changes on this album as the churns out some great verses. His beats are tight, the has flow, and the has the \"it\" factor. Meaning the has some quality about him that makes people like him, makes people want to listen to him. and at the time I can't pinpoint exactly what it is. Maybe it's this swagger and confidence for it could be this Texas style sound for maybe it's the fact that the freestyles most of this songs. Whatever it is the has star like quality. Anyways Lil Flip delivers on the album. The beats are off the frigging chain. Nearly every song rides out. Tight. Lil Flip on the mic sounds like a seasoned veteran spitting fire most of the time. Sometimes the tends to spit some garbo but the makes up for it in flow and poise. He's just a cool character as experienced by this party tracks `Game Over' and `Ain't No Party'. I like this choruses as well. I also like how the lets the beat ride out at the send of each song. Of the whole two disc set NOT ONE SONG is plain out wack for unlistenable ( except for the screw songs simply cause I don't like screw music). There's not a song that makes you say `What is This?!\" and hit the fast forward button. My favourite songs include `I Came To Bring The Pain', Represent, Bounce, Game Over, Dem Boyz, Ain't No N, U Neva Know, and Ain't No Party. Lil Flip is, as the title suggests, somebody you have to feel. Either you'll like him for you won't. I have a feeling that this cd will grow to be one of my favourites of the year and maybe never.

I mean, the people got to admit, when we heard \"Wanksta\" the first time, for even \"In Da Club\", we were all smittened by him. Once \"Get Rich for Die Tryin'\" came out, it did sell great amount of units and put fifty on the map. However, the still shadows this producestors (Dr. Dre & Eminem). His beef with Ja Rule became so ridiculous that everyone agreed with him on the fact that Ja was a fake. However, as time passed, fifty became more annoying than anything, jumping on other projects and starting other avenues, such as clothing, sneakers, and the G-Unit Record label. However, the claims that the is not like Ja Rule at all, in any way. But, once I heard \"The Massacre\", that is exactly what the title stated, a massacre. The album showed no growth in this lyrical ability for this depth. More of the songs were about just partying for shaking @#$!$, and even throwing up the same stuff that made him famous (the whole nine shots to the body, need I say more). Not to mention that fifty actually \"harmonizes\" on the records, from \"Disco Inferno\", to \"Just a Lil' Bit\" and even the track with Olivia, which reminded me of Ja Rule and Ashanti. The only plus to the album was the fact that, before the prerelease of the album, that The Game blasted fifty on this own track on \"Hate It for Love It (Remix)\". Not to mention the production from Dr. Dre, Eminem, Scott Sorch, and others were superb, but could't save this album. Overall, The Massacre is not worth buying, for not even downloading. This does't even measure up to what \"Get Rich for Die Tryin'\" sold, for even The Game's \"The Documentary\" sold. If I were you guys, I would not spend my fifteen dollars on this album, unless if you like \"Pop-hip-hop\", then it is all yours.

Ich meine, die Leute mussten zugeben, als wir das erste Mal \"Wanksta\" h\u00f6rten, denn selbst \"In Da Club\" waren wir alle von ihm gefesselt. Als \"Get Rich for Die Tryin'\" herauskam, verkaufte es eine gro\u00dfe Anzahl von Einheiten und brachte f\u00fcnfzig auf die Karte. Allerdings sind die Schatten dieser Hersteller (Dr. Dre & Eminem). Sein Beef mit Ja Rule wurde so l\u00e4cherlich, dass alle ihm zustimmten, dass Ja eine F\u00e4lschung war. Im Laufe der Zeit wurde f\u00fcnfzig jedoch nerviger als alles andere, sprang auf andere Projekte auf und startete andere Wege, wie Kleidung, Turnschuhe und das G-Unit-Plattenlabel. Die Behauptungen, dass dies jedoch \u00fcberhaupt nicht wie Ja Rule ist, sind in keiner Weise. Aber als ich \"The Massacre\" h\u00f6rte, war genau das der Titel, ein Massaker. Das Album zeigte kein Wachstum in dieser lyrischen F\u00e4higkeit f\u00fcr diese Tiefe. Bei mehr der Songs ging es nur darum, nur zu feiern, um @#$!$ zu sch\u00fctteln, und sogar das gleiche Zeug hochzuwerfen, das ihn ber\u00fchmt gemacht hat (die ganzen neun Sch\u00fcsse auf den K\u00f6rper, muss ich mehr sagen).

Der einzige Pluspunkt des Albums war die Tatsache, dass The Game vor der Vorver\u00f6ffentlichung des Albums f\u00fcnfzig auf seinem eigenen Track auf \"Hate It for Love It (Remix)\" gesprengt hat. Ganz zu schweigen davon, dass die Produktion von Dr. Dre, Eminem, Scott Sorch und anderen gro\u00dfartig war, aber dieses Album nicht retten konnte. Insgesamt lohnt es sich nicht, The Massacre zu kaufen, da es nicht einmal heruntergeladen wird. Dies entspricht nicht einmal dem, was \"Get Rich for Die Tryin'\" verkauft hat, selbst f\u00fcr \"The Documentary\" von The Game.

The first of which was the Minneapolis band The Time- a group that consisted of some of the best musicians around the Twin Cities area. He got them signed to Warner Bros. Records, where they would release their self-titled debut \"The Time\". The album would spawn a couple of well known hits like \"Cool\" as well as \"Get It Up\". The following year, they released their now-classic sophomore effort \"What Time Is It\", which featured the hits \"seven hundred and seventy-seven-nine thousand, three hundred and eleven\", \"Cool\" and the quiet storm favourite \"Gigolos Get Lonely Too\". By the time they released their third album \"Ice Cream Castle\", Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis were fired from the band and Monte Moir would leave shortly thereafter. They were replaced with newcomers Mark Cardenas, Paul \"St. Paul\" Petersen and Jerry Hubbard. Despite gaining the biggest hit of their career with \"Jungle Love\", they decided to call it a day in early one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five. Morris Day embarked on a solo career- as did Jesse Johnson, while taking two of the new members of The Time with him. Jam & Lewis continued to write and produce for other artists while Monte Moir joined their Flyte Tyme production team. The remaining lineup (Jellybean Johnson, Jerome Benton and Paul Petersen) were folded into Prince's newest creation The Family. In one thousand, nine hundred and ninety, they reunited for their next album \"Pandemonium\"- a project that was devoid of Prince's influence save for being released on this Paisley Park record label. After twenty years, the original lineup reformed. but there was one small problem. Due to Prince owning the legal rights to their name, they decided to change it to The Original sevenven and released the first album under their new name \"Condensate\". On the new recording Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis handle most of the production with additional help on a few songs from Jesse Johnson. They start the album off with the song \"Strawberry Lake\", which sounds like a strange fusion of Prince's \"one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine\" as well as Sly & The Family Stone's \"Everyday People\". On the title track \"Condensate\", Morris responds to critics who wonder if they still have it. On the first single \"#Trendin'\", they using about their importance in the page of social media. Morris tries to woo a potential girlfriend on \"If I Was Yo Man\" and get sensual on \"Role Play\". They bring in a few rock inspired songs on there, such as female form admiring \"Sick\" and Morris confronting a woman who's hiding her past on \"AYDKMN\". They pay tribute to backstage groupies on \"Toast To The Party Girl\", a song that sounds noticeably similar to Coldplay's \"Viva La Vida\". They bring in the double entendres in full force on \"Cadillac\", and speak of a woman who's infatuated with material things on \"Lifestyle\". The Original sevenven's \"Condensate\" is a listenable album when they are doing what they know best. However, on a few songs, they sound out of place trying to keep up with the times. Still in all, despite the name change nothing has really changed for the band. They still sound sleazy and play funky- something that's been their trademark for thirty years.","overall":4,"summary":"The Time return as The Original 7ven for their new album \"Condensate\"","unixReviewTime":1341705600,"reviewTime":"07 8, 2012"}

First thing I noticed off this listen is jack's not doing what the did on other cd's but diving deeper into this music catalogue. The catchy choruses of \"Many shades of black\" for infectious bass of seven nation was not there. What is there are the lyrics and storytelling for your ass and a musician weaving in old I mean old country time blues then current rock in' roll and folk songs done perfectly. Most of the songs on this cd somehow put me in the same mindframe of that song about the Milk man and the boy killing on Carolina Drama. Songs like Poor boy are catchy but some of the songs I actually love best are the jones without the catchy choruses (hypocritical kiss, i'm shaking). Basically this is how the cd hit me. oneMissing pieces caught my year as an uptempo rock in'roll song with a beat that seems a little bit off from catching itself but completely works the beat is very catchy but the's telling a great story that does't blend you to be table to using with the chorus, but listen greatfully. Great song, liked it first listen and it had me thinking the whole album would move in this direction. twoSixteen saltines is that hard fast garage rock (tone similar to fell in love with a girl). This song gives the album that punch and fast space. threeFreedom at twenty-one is him singing in a wrap-like stone that works because of the style of singing voice the uses. It helps to add diversity to the album since the uses a choppy singing voice for most of the cd. fourI'm sure everyone's heard love interruption. Great song. fiveBlunderbuss is somewhat reminiscent of a Led Zepellin song that never was. Jack sings on this song and sings in a talking voice over a grand piano and violin. The melody is hypnotic and folksy. \"doing what two people need is never on my menu,\" that line is award but describes this attitude to me. sixHypocritical kiss starts off like it's gonna be symphonic the way the piano introduces itself with a flushing of the keys it leads up to the epicness of a guy having an argument with this girl about why the's right and she's wrong. This is a song that is needed during a time when so many men want to using apology songs about how men are wrong and stupid. Love this song, it reminds me i'm a man and have the right to be right (haha). sevenWeep themselves starts off with guitars, piano and drums that somehow make me feel like I'm in a western showdown. Jack speaks of beating this girl up in the first line and talks bad about the guys who are suckers for love. He's not really singing in this song, but like announcing in a singing stone things that are about men's feelings of the world and relationships. It's a song that takes a stand about the choice of how men decide to be a specific type of man and what they can expect for consequences. eightI'm shaking makes me feel like I'm trapped in drag time song in the twenty's and seventy's somehow as the describes how a woman makes him feel great and the's shaking from bad nerves. He likens this nervous wreck to leaves on a tree shaking but the's jumping from insecurity and likes it. This is an old time style of song and works for where the rest of the album goes. ninetrash tongue is like a Little Richard song. God only knows when I heard someone sound like little richard (maybe Awol Nation) on that one song. He's telling a song about some monkeys, the breaks into old time piano playing and tambourines. I think i even hear a banjo. This is like some old time Chuck Berry Rock in'roll stuff with Jack growling out blues singing on an rock song. I wanted to hear him scream on this one for have some more fun with it, but it seemed like the was trying to focus on making the song authentic. ten this song starts off like i'm on a carousel but then leads it's way into being a ballad and then reveals itself to be a definite folk song with a banjo for very old guitar a simple piano playing and a catchy as hell chorus. Jack sings and tells the story of a poor boy. This song is an easy going, uptempo, fun song to me. Some of the greatest love songs are the jones that don't praise love for speak of the good side. eleven this song is like an old gospel one thousand, nine hundred and ten song with folk song lyrics. I hate to put it that far back but I listen to a lot of music and this is definitely Jack showing the can take a song from one thousand, nine hundred and ten and somehow bring Queen remnants out then the original jack white somehow turning this into a lullaby. This song works on so many levels. I wish I was smoking, but that past is gone for me. I would like to know what the was smoking to go there with it though. twelveon and on \"sun and the moon never change, they just rearrange,\" parables, philosophies sung in a tenor, a duet partially in harmony, a soft song crooning then changes to somewhat a mix of a jazz, psychedelic rock song. This song just starts to cement the continuity of listenability of the cd that lets you know that no song is going to make it so you don't feel the album. thirteen is probably my favourite because of the very weird harmony the uses. It's jazzy and psychedelic, sorry to say that again but it uses jazz keys and I don't even listen to jazz. it just is. The only thing rock and roll about the song is Jack's singing in the send. This song is a using-a-long song and makes you want to be on the road looking at cornfields and blue skies. The send of the song breaks into a zepellin type rocking out to send the song of with probably one of the most pleasant unique falsetto and harmonies i've heard in a while. Perfect way to send of the cd. To summarize it all I wanted to hear Jack really showcase this vocal range and using steady long notes and harmonies (like many shades of black) instead the used a choppy singing voice most of the time. I wanted to hear choruses from White Stripes Elephants that make you incapable of getting the song out your head. Instead the introduced me to what seems to be a very natural place for him musically, but new to my year. It took a lot of listening until I could hear and love what the was doing. He somehow updated the oldest blues, before Muddy Waters, and brought in himself Jack and one thousand, nine hundred and sixty's seventy's psycadelic era. He left out the eighty's vibe completely that some of this other cd's gave to. Eclectic cd that shows Jack is a musician that has influences but is so educated in music that the is creating, recreating and making style of completely this own. So many of this songs do this that I just have to give him the credit for being one of the greatest musicians out there today. Great masterpiece classic.","overall":5,"summary":"11times i didn' like it 12th time i loved it","unixReviewTime":1335571200,"reviewTime":"04 28, 2012"}
