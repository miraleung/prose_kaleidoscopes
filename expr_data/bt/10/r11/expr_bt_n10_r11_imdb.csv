22940,"Where to begin? This film is very entertaining if you are new to the wonderful game of rugby, however, if you live outside the US and do follow the game, it is laughable. Various rugby traditions such as the ""Haka"" which is preformed by the New Zealand ""All Blacks"" and only by the All Blacks. The leader of the Haka is usually the member of the team with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been misused and represented by the writer. The film itself is quite well directed however it is the poor script and over-all execution that lets it down, heavily. Taking into account is is based on a real story, it does posses a great deal of clickés in the storyline. I would strongly suggest that any American interested in rugby watch this film then watch what rugby actually is on Youtube because the rugby portrayed in this film has been distorted and skewed so far from what it really is.",negative

12149,"Good historical drama which is very educational and also very entertaining to people who like history. Very good acting and script. Not as sensual and sexy as it is sometimes marketed, be prepared to peek into the pioneer spirit and human ability to adjust. Very touching as well for the spiritually mature. Not for people who do not like to think.",positive

But, years later, at a party YEARS later, at a seventys' type PAR-TAY, where certain substances had been smoked, inhaled, and with plenty of tequila,""HEAD"" was on late at night. We watched it, and finally realized what ""HEAD"" was all about. It spoofed their own show, as shown in one song that called themselves,""a manufactured image"". As Davy Jones wrote in this autobio,""They Made a Monkey out of me"", he openly admits that everyone in the film, had been up all night smoking weed. They made fun of themselves, society, everything! Great film! Tho, as a fifty-two tyr old granny,I no longer ""induldge"", I STILL watch this film when I want a good LOL!!!",positive

27744,"Apparently the writer and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher movie is a fan of Friday thirteenth and other summer camp slashers. This movie has everything - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called ""Camp Blood"", the old man who warns them not to go there; and of course the crazy killer with the machete who keeps on slashing and hacking at the teenagers without any reason at all. The whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on thirty-five hmm film with acceptable Special Effects. But instead the Special Effects are poorly done. The killer walks around as if the's out on a Sunday afternoon stroll, and the only good things about this movie are the acting of the talented main actress and the sex scene at the beginning. Other than that - dull and forgettable. Jasper P. Morgan",negative

17694,This movie is one of the best never produced by disney. The plot is very original and entertaining. The animated sequence is also very well done with the live factors. (For the time).

47780,"With Harry Callahan getting up in years, the inevitable `old man with a chip on this shoulder' story had to come into play eventually. Callahan, looking fragile sometimes and out of place, this demeanour still was unwavering. Thankfully, this film took some time off to develop a different type of story, one that might reinvent the Dirty Harry and the whole genre. While the film fell short in doing so, it was still an excellent addition to the series, even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and New Wave music.",positive

27773,"I caught the North American premiere of this at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was beyond disappointed. From the mood in the audience, I was't the only one. The film takes a long time to get to the conflict, and then refuses to resolve it, opting instead to tell us the story is ""To Be Continued"". Is it a spoiler to reveal that a movie has no ending? I consider it more of a warning. This is, at best, only half a movie- and not the good half.",negative

11306,"Fairly good romantic comedy in which I don't think I've never seen Meg looking any cuter. All the players did a good job at keeping this a lively romp.

26367,"This movie was so bad, outdated and stupid that I had rough times to watch it to the send. I had seen this Rodney guy in Natural Born Killers and I thought the was funny as hell in it, but this movie was crap. The ""jokes"" were't funny, factors were't funny, anything about it was't even remotely funny. Don't waste your time for this! Only positive things about this were the beautiful wives :) and Molly Shannon who I'm sure tried her best, but the script was just too awful. That's why I rated it ""two"" instead of ""one"", but it's definitely one of the worst films I've never seen.",negative

33265,"It has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film. Initially, I was struck by the stylized sets, but found the rest slow going and dull. I thought that such a sensational subject needed the Ken Russell treatment to take it way over the top. I now find the enforced restraint (placed on the production by Mishima's widow) to be an asset. Some of the more lurid aspects of Mishima's life are reiterated and dramatized by corresponding themes from this novels. I think it helps to be familiar with the novels - that's what finally made the difference for me. Still feel the film overall could be a little tighter and warmer, but it's genuinely unique, and deserves serious attention. Love the fact that the Japanese characters speak Japanese - not English. The Philip Glass score is mesmerizing.",positive

(The following may look like a spoiler, but it really just describes a large class of movies) There is the passionate, wise main character, this goofy but well-meaning sidekick with this will-placed attempts at humorous comments, the initially-hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable ""unlikely"" love story, the loved jones taken hostage, and of course the careless evil adversary with this brutal minions. Everybody has seen tons of these movies already, and ""National Treasure"" is like any one of them, with only a slightly modified wrapping. Every turn of the story was easily predicted (and I can assure you I am not the sharpest tool in the shed). I am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theatre from a Hollywood movie, and if you have never felt that way too, heed my warning; stay miles away from this movie.",negative

I could't help but care about the characters. Ms. Merkerson will blow you away, as will the young man playing the young lead. I also thought that the set design was top-rate. The viewer is really placed inside each era as it's presented. The music is a blast, too. Nice selections to represent mood, time and place. The blind blues man is stereotypic but the delivers some great songs. This is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings. Take the time to watch it!",positive
