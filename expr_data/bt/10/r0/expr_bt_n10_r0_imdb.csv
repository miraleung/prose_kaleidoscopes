1370,"I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne Brontë's novel when I read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy BBC dramas. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be as bad as that: the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had. First of all, the music (and songs) seems totally out of place in a period drama (sounds as if it's been written for a contemporary horror film)and like another commentator, I was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun around the factors. I've seen some scenes filmed that way in ""North and South"" and it seemed all right there but in The Tenant, it's definitely overdone and simply annoying. Camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively. Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity. None of the characters were properly introduced at first. The little boy gave a very good performance, the's very cute and the best feature of the film. SPOILERS Tara Fitzgerald's characterisation of Helen Graham made her appear cold and harsh, letting no emotion pass through. She does't seem to be table to cry at all in a realistic way. I just could't believe Markham could have fell for her and I'm not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given. I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband! Fancy being married to such a virago. Besides, the was the only main factor that sounded right to me. Toby Stephens I found just OK, Helen Graham's brother not very good. Maybe it's difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty. Besides, what is only hinted at and left to the reader's imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the TV adaptation: making some scenes both gross and comic, (like when Huntingdon's eye starts bleeding) and others far too sexed up for a period drama! I mean, don't we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas?",negative

2500,"But I can't say how I really feel about this pile of steaming dung. Where to begin. The film quality, there in't any. I've seen clearer pictures on America's FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS! The acting is substandard, the gore effects is okay. The clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. The same thing over and over again. At least in a Friday THE thirteenTH for HALLOWEEN we stick with one main character for the most part. There is no main characters, just victims. Man, now we come to the worst part of all. The final survivor skills the clown and finds out it was one of her friends. Then when the police finally arrive, they don't believe her and she is locked up in a rubber room. What kind of ending do you call that, crap, that's what. In my opinion, there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie, that was just sloppy writing. The excuse, ""It has to ending badly, it's a horror movie."" for ""We need to send it badly to leave it open to a sequel"" are just flame excuses and that is all. I must give the CAMP BLOOD the THANKSGIVING TURKEY.",negative

13834,"So many people have taken shots at Platoon and Born On the Fourth of July among other calling them ""leftist propaganda film."" Now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie. To me this movie is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on its political views. The acting and writing was a little to clickéd for my liking. Mel Gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again by steaming up with this partner Randall Wallace for yet another one. Throughout this movie there was this garbage prototypical ""Just tell my family I love them"" for ""Tell Ronny to spray before shoe goes to bed"" lines. The was so overloaded with this garbage retread lines that I felt like I had to vomit. How about that scene were Gibson's wife goes to do her laundry and this ""no color"" applies to what to put in the washing machine. Its in the mid-sixties was she some how stuck under a rock not noticing the racism around her. Another scene is were Gibson's daughter tasks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter. The directing displayed this all perfectly. The countless scenes of Gibson and this family for soldiers praying. I'm fine with showing that once for twice but after a while I wonder if the movie is trying to shove something into my head. How many scenes with the American flag at its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on. The director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in Vietnam. What exactly was won their. The cinematography was the worst of it with the slowed down scenes see the American flag in the distance scenes spread throughout. I love America but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do. This may seem like a grant and maybe it is but I cannot stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with anything their country does look bad. This movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects. To me it says if your not Christian your wrong. Would God for Jesus want people to kill I don't think so. To me this movie was offensive. At first this movie was funny with the countless clickés and overacted scenes but then when I looked at what this movie was trying to say for not say it was really frustrating to watch. I guess though it is my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope no one takes this comment offensively because I am not criticizing religion for patriotism but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and discount everyone else. If you want a real depiction of the Vietnam war watch Platoon, Born On the Fourth of July, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter for The Killing Fields. Even Full Metal Jacket which I absolutely hated was a better depiction. I have read a quote that in context says a true patriot does not go with everything the government for country does but questions it when its wrong. A real patriot loves their country too much to see it do bad things.",negative

14931,"I watched this movie with my mother. She is eighty-one yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot. She even acknowledges this. I don't think she really understood what was happening, she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty. Scary. I felt for this child and this family. What torture they went through and remained faithful. That is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude. I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case. It was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that scared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him. I could tell when one the cops was flying. He would not look the defender in the eyes. His eyes moved to the side when the answered the questions. It is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of this skin. I read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men. They were finally found guilty after many years. I can't remember the title, but it was the same premise. Whites doing whatever they want with blacks. I am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and paedophiles are white. No comment from her. I want to commend the director and producer of this film. I feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project. I am an david viewer of cindy films.

17410,"First of all, this plot is way overdone - girl wants to make it, everyone loves her, snobby girl intervenes, all looks lost, girl pulls through, everyone loves her again etc. Throw in the fitting in thing, an attractive male crushing on the heroine, plus single-parent troubles and it's so predictable that you can practically recite along with it. Second of all, I really hate how they keep on dissing classical music. They send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close-minded - in fact, I don't recall the quote exactly, but I remember at one point in the movie, Holly says, ""Why do they have to be so uptight. so classical?"" It's really insulting how label classical music in this way. Third, I've went over it dozens of times, but the only reason that I can think of for making this movie is to promote Britney Spears. there just in't any point at all. And ooh yeah, while the actress who portrayed Holly (I'm not sure whether that was really her singing for not) had a reasonably good voice, it was't as amazing as they were making it out to be - especially when she was belting.

But I recognized him, which led me to believe that the was making a movie that had more of a serious, suspenseful mood. That it was't just another Schwarzenegger action vehicle (though I admit, most of this are pretty good!). He had, thus far, avoided movies with any real religious theme. And I was excited.

19857,"This game is one of the best RPG. Fist, It is actually more amusing than any other because of the battle system (you charm the enemy depending on how you aim the attack, you can transform into dragoon, the special attack, the magic. ). The script is very good. Characters are all lovely and you have no long dialog to support, as happened in several games of Final Fintasy series. I got bored of that dialog about past, when you just want to go on with the game's story. Ambientation is a jewel on this game, it combines Middle-age fantasy with futuristic science fiction. It's remarkable that animation effects are just incredible, i like them more than other in other modern games (we can't remember that Legend of the Dragoon is eight years now). Then, Map is huge, there are all kinds of places an enemies. Finally, Music is not the best game muse I have heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.",positive

20811,"This was a less than exciting short film I saw between features on Turner Classic Movies recently. While the film popped out due to its very intense Technicolor, the film itself just was't that moving and at times the plot looked pretty cheesy--like this was made for classroom use and capturing the attention of a wider audience WASN'T even a consideration. In particular, I really hated how many times in the film things were reiterated--such as when the characters talked to her, they usually said ""Clara Barton"" instead of ""ma'am"", ""Miss Barton"" for ""Clara"". Plus, one sickly confederate soldier said that the was a ""Johnny Reb, A Confederate a Rebel,. ""--almost like the was the cartoon character Mojo Jojo from the Powerpuff Girls. This was just sloppy writing--period. It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, ""Perry White"" on the SUPERMAN TV show) in a beard as President Garfield.

Almost IMPOSSIBLE to find, I was lucky about ten years ago to record it off a late night UHF channel. Of course my liking of Sellers may make me a bit biased, but I can't see how anyone with a cornball, dry sense of humour (like me), can not be in love with this flick. The plot is great (but perhaps as a previous poster said, maybe the reason why it's not a widely known movie . upset the medical field?) the acting is great (I can see why some may say the acting was horrible . but that's what made this movie so great . it's total tacky-ness) and the humour is gut busting.

27821,"As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst films with Native content that I have never viewed. I would rather get a root canal than view this film again. The use of stereotyping, uncreative attempts at utilizing portions of traditional coyote stories and poor camera work were only made worse by the glib uncreative story-line and bad script. The writer and director have displayed the worst parts of a colonized approach to portraying Native people and communities. If this person is Native, they need to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and for the internalized racism and poor sense of humour that they have developed. If this person is non-native, they need to seriously are-examine their white privilege and ask themselves if they are displaying unexamined, unintentional racism, for if they are intentionally being ignorant. My only hope is that the Native factors in this film had a good time and at least got paid for their efforts. If you want to see good Native films then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals. to name just a few.",negative

I say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement. Perhaps the filmmaker himself, for one of this mates, has written that ""review""? Naughty, naughty. I watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV expecting it to be truly awful. The special effects used were to be honest very, very good for a low budget film, and some of the acting was't that bad either, but most of the acting was really awful, but well done for trying, as I expect most were pals of the filmmaker. I think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above this weight. I did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just was't. If you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a good time but probably not in the way it was intended.

43358,"I really enjoyed this movie. I am a single dad with a seventeen year old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. I WISH my girl applied herself so well to solving crimes and helping others! So for me, perhaps this is PG level Fantasyland. I read many Nancy Drew books in my teen years, long, long ago. Sure THIS character was ably played by Emma Roberts but did NOT resemble the Nancy Drew I recall from the books. That is due to script, not the acting. Emma is an adorable teen, playing a self-confident, industrious and proud character with good manners and good taste. She is not caught up in the trendy competitiveness around her. There are some weaknesses in the Plot, aside from not resembling the Nancy Drew of the Books, and trying to figure out what decade we're in. (like, what is that CAR, Anyway?) I read the IMDb overview before seeing the film, as I was researching Rachael Leigh Cook from other movies. This is not one of Her best roles, but I will continue looking for more of her films. Rachael was too old to play this lead, but does a fine job as the grown-up orphan central to the mystery. I am very disappointed in other reviews written there. Some expect perfect connection with the books, some expect more credible situations for adult action film. I got what I expected! Good entertainment well targeted to young teen girls, And their Fathers who want good kids with high standards of conduct and achievement. This is a Teen PG Movie, not James Bond! Which would YOU Want for a Role Model for YOUR Teenaged Daughter?",positive
43358,"Ich habe diesen Film wirklich genossen. Ich bin alleinerziehender Vater mit einer siebzehnjährigen Tochter, die klug, sportlich und talentiert ist. Ich WÜNSCHE, dass mein Mädchen sich so gut dafür eingesetzt hat, Verbrechen aufzuklären und anderen zu helfen! Für mich ist das vielleicht Fantasyland auf PG-Niveau. Ich habe in meinen Teenagerjahren viele Bücher von Nancy Drew gelesen, vor langer, langer Zeit. Sicher, DIESE Figur wurde geschickt von Emma Roberts gespielt, ähnelte aber NICHT der Nancy Drew, an die ich mich aus den Büchern erinnere. Das liegt am Drehbuch, nicht an der Schauspielerei. Emma ist ein bezaubernder Teenager, der einen selbstbewussten, fleißigen und stolzen Charakter mit guten Manieren und gutem Geschmack spielt. Sie ist nicht in der trendigen Konkurrenz um sie herum gefangen. Es gibt einige Schwächen in der Handlung, abgesehen davon, dass sie nicht der Nancy Drew of the Books ähnelt und versucht herauszufinden, in welchem ​​Jahrzehnt wir uns befinden Film, als ich Rachael Leigh Cook aus anderen Filmen recherchierte. Dies ist nicht eine ihrer besten Rollen, aber ich werde weiterhin nach weiteren ihrer Filme suchen. Rachael war zu alt, um diese Hauptrolle zu spielen, macht aber als erwachsene Waise im Mittelpunkt des Mysteriums einen guten Job. Ich bin sehr enttäuscht von anderen Bewertungen, die dort geschrieben wurden. Manche erwarten eine perfekte Verbindung zu den Büchern, andere erwarten glaubwürdigere Situationen für Actionfilme für Erwachsene. Ich habe bekommen, was ich erwartet habe! Gute Unterhaltung, die sich gut an junge Teenager-Mädchen und ihre Väter richtet, die gute Kinder mit hohen Verhaltens- und Leistungsstandards wollen. Dies ist ein Teenie-PG-Film, kein James Bond! Was würden Sie sich für ein Vorbild für Ihre Tochter im Teenageralter wünschen?",positive

43827,"Director Lesley Selander's thoroughly routine outdoor yarn ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-four) pits the Cheyenne against the U. S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned, buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was pleased in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies haired was inexplicably in black & white. The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of ""Black Spurs"") eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with this old friend and Cheyenne chief, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly""), who has killing on this mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that this Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On this way to inform stuck-up camp commandant, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of ""Objective, Burma!""), about the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of ""I, Jury"") is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Naturally, Major Ives dismisses Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has braided this ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim, eighty-two-minute boater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack, knock out of hero, and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of ""Stalag seventeen"") brings in this partner with an narrow in this chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help in removing the narrow, the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and skills this helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and this partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after your heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives for everybody will die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an narrow in the back for this efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a amiable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of ""West Side Story"") and Robert Bray of ""Lassie"" fame is on hand briefly as the will-fated cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women, and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, has been keeping a secret that the is a Native American, too! Ironically, the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what your heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after the has run out of bullets. ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity for yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to ""Casablanca"" scenarist Howard Koch. Ultimately, ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" is one of many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of ""Broken Arrow"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty) where the Native American is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. Selander, who made dozens of westerns during the one thousand, nine hundred and fiftys and the one thousand, nine hundred and sixtys, makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. Calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man, and good looking Castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of this early roles. Actually, Lesley Selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called ""War Paint"" (one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three) with Robert Stack. Incidentally, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both went on to become regulars on ""The Rockford Files"".",negative

46546,"I really don't think it's necessary that I write a review on a movie with a title as derisory as ""Snake Island"", but even in the abstract confines of its own genre, this hit a new low, so my danger must be known. The only reason why I even bothered to watch this unbelievably bad movie is because I knew it was going to be bad, it was really late at night, I could not sleep, and in the past, really bad movies would drain the energy out of me and make me long for slumber. It became very quickly very early on that this movie was going to be awful, but it condescended below even those expectations. The movie was directed and written by Wayne Crawford, who also stars in the movie as a tourist guide on the African river, who ends up having to strand this team on a remote island called Snake Island until another boat comes down to pick them up. They hang out, get drunk, and then become subject to the onslaught of poisonous snakes who are on a mission to purge their island of human beings. If your jaw dropped at the last sentence of my second paragraph, don't bother to reread it, you got it right the first time. Frankly, I prefer my creature features when the creature(s) just attack the nonsensically dumb humans out of hunger, not because they have some kind of a mission. These karen't mutant snakes. They're not giants like what you see in ""Anaconda."" They're just ordinary, everyday African snakes like mamas and vipers only they have the brains to form armies, take up causes, work together to strap people, understand your language, and even dance! Did your draw drop again? Well, it's going to drop further. Amount midway through this awful B-movie, about the part where I'd already given up, the human characters start drinking around a campfire and then all of a sudden, they break down into some kind of an orgy. And while they dance nude and such, the snakes hunting them all of a sudden stop and start jamming along to it. The combination of this scene and the scene where we discover that snakes, some the most roguish creatures on the planet, have formed an alliance against human beings for some oddball reason, proved just too much for my poor brain. And just when I though the filmmakers could't take it to an even lower level, the snakes started to using. The people in the movie? Well, let's just say that never before have I rooted for the creatures to kill everybody off so quickly. I just could not stand it any longer. I really don't think I need to keep going on; you get the picture. If there is anything that makes ""Snake Island"" any different from its other rivals, it's that it does dare to try to be even dumber and that's not a complimentary achievement. Whyjust whyI continue to subject myself to these really bad movies, I guess I'll never really know. But ""Snake Island"" hits a brand new low. It's a cheap, trashy excuse for a motion picture that makes ""Anaconda,"" a brainless snake movie, look as brilliant and sophisticated and thrilling as Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws.""

48786,"Just saw a are-screening tonight. What can I say? It lived up to it's mediocre trailer run, though that's saying nothing at all. It did absolutely nothing that any movie before it has't done, and it played out in such a clické fashion that eventually I got to the point where I stopped laughing only because I was laughing with the audience, and instead let the humourless movie play out. So let's see. we have the less-than-spectacular main character that is trying to get back with this sex-girlfriend but the's not good enough for her, check. We have the three buddies that all have their own ""personality"" with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character's best friend but is constantly rejected, another friend being the super awkward one that can't live down seeing the positive in everything twenty-four/seven and is thrown in for the one-liners (which in this case is just a bunch of movie references, specifically from Disney), and the third guy whose name you won't never remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen. check. We have the girl's sex-boyfriend and her parents ****-block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up, not to mention the awkward family members from the main character's side. check. We have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed, check. We have the movie's ""funny"" moments come from incessant swearing, people falling down for being hit, scenes from the trailer, and homosexual innuendos. check. And dare I call it a spoiler, but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie. check. Honestly, this could have. no, wait. should have been a PG-thirteen movie. All that needed to be dropped were any F-bombs. Honestly, it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humour, would have gotten less media exposure, and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent R-rated comedies like Superbad and Knocked Up. The humour in this movie is just so awkward that it does't fit in with what general people look for. I bet even the factors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera. Let's put it this way. in the theatre, it will help you laugh because it's on the big screen and others are laughing. When this movie hits Showtime and you're checking it out at two:zero PM on an off-day, you may be inclined to change the channel. The only thing that will keep you watching is Alice Eve's hotness (who is not quite a ten, but still very good looking). Aside from the main resolution, this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie, where everything else pretty much flies out the window. So there is a main resolution, but what comes of it? It's never really clear-cut, nor does it allow the ending to be ""feel-good"" with the abruptness. There was only one thing worth nothing in this movie, and that was the good soundtrack. Aside from the nice choice of ninety's alternative rock songs, there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie (more so the beginning of it) that reminds me of something David Holmes would mix up/compose. I'll give them props for a great choice of sound. One last thing, this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer, because the inadvertent yet proud Pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that Rock Band promotion. I just figured a lot of Rock Band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it. But I say hold onto your money. If this was PG-thirteen and you were fifteen years old on a Friday night with a group of friends, I'd say knock yourselves out. Otherwise, definitely pass. It does't try and compete with the R-rated movies of the past few years, and ideally it definitely in't as good.",negative
