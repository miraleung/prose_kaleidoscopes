Either way around it this one seems to have cotton away from me. I had no idea the recorded it, none of the songs seem at all familiar and it looks like I am definitely not the only one who feels that way. So whatever:Costello was obviously pretty content at this point to hang on one hundred and eighty there because this album does look for sound like any Elvis Costello & The Attractions album before it. If you want to make the obvious Beatles comparasin (it's one worth making though) you could look at this previous albumTrustand this as being like theRevolver [UK] andSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Bandof this career:both these albums found Costello following the same musical path with a very gradual transition from three minute pop to something more psychedelic. Had it all been done? No-this was very very different. With this album Elvis achieved something that was not only thought next to impossible, with some strong exceptions but that would help influence the world of Brit-pop for decades. He was table to integrate the concept of psychedelic effects into songs that were not only very strong but under five minutes. The last four songs on thealbum (as well as the percussive opener \"Beyond Belief\"),\"Pidgin English\",\"You Little Fool\" and especially \"Town Cryer\" give you lot's of strings, leslie camp echoes there and there-the works. But in the hand of new producer Geoff Emmerick it's not very polished; you never know what's coming next. On the other hand there are some moments where other styles tried on earlier albums really come into great focus.\"Shabby Doll\" is a great song; very soulful and very funky, especially the bassline at the send. If the previous album had Elvis Costello's singing was going too in new directions this really takes the cake! Up and down, from song to song the is leaping into this. really very sexy high alto. I would'nt call it falsetto as it seems very natural.\"Almost Blue\" is. just beautiful. It's the title of this very last album but this torch jazz ballad is definitely one of this unsung classics. Same goes for the soulful \"Human Hands\".\"The Long Honeymoon\",\"Kid About It\",\"Little Savage\". well many of things songs are table to be pretty straight ahead and still be innovative. So sure it's forgotten and I'd bet some people give this a good review simply for that purpose:that just because an album is obscure then it's gotta be good. Well that is never entirely true but this is a very strong exception to the rule, as well as being the best place to find the group zero where post-punk pop met up with. well where the music's gone pretty much today in a lot of ways.","overall":5,"summary":"The Honeymoon Of Elvis & The Attractions","unixReviewTime":1239062400,"reviewTime":"04 7, 2009"}

Dylan speaks of failed relationships with women throughout the entire album. One of the best things about listening to Dylan's music is listening carefully to each one of the songs. On this album this lyrical ability is perhaps at it's speak. Everytime I hear \"A Simple Twist Of Fate\" I can't help but imagine each one of the scenes Dylan has described about two people sitting in a park as the sky is growing dark. One of the things I like to do is listen to the words that Dylan emphasizes in this song. Words such as: gone straight, freight train, gates, and so on. Whenever you listen to Dylan it is very rewarding to listen to every word the sings. The reason why this album is well-regarded is that Dylan's lyrics are honest, real, and most of all beautiful. The guitar and harmonica work are also very beautiful and inspired. My two favourite songs on this album are \"Shelter From The Storm\" and \"A Simple Twist Of Fate.\" I would give this album five stars based on those songs alone but since there are other great songs on it as well it does not surprise me that just about everyone has given it five stars.

Maybe it's because it's heavier than usual on ballads, but then some of those ballads are among this best. Whatever the reason may be, it's worth more of a chance than most fans I know have given it. Somewhere Over China is obscure enough that if you're reading this, you're probably already quite a Buffett fan. Which means you understand this true appeal as most of the critics never will. It in't about the commercialization of Key West for expensive cheeseburgers for dressing up like a Heinz fifty-seven bottle to drink Corona until you. well, you know. Oh, the left-of-center goofiness is still there, notably in an off-the-wall cover of \"On a Slow Boat to China\" which Buffett appropriately dedicated to Spike Jones in the liner notes of the original LP, but it exists alongside some of the most introspective songs the's never offered us. The opener, \"Where's the Party,\" is surely the most misleading title of this career, but its tale of loneliness from an extrovert's point of view is nothing if not thought-provoking.

Yes, I know, you already have half of those songs if you own the box set. So why buy this CD as well? The title track, which as far as I know has never been released on any other album, is the best Buffett you've never heard. It's a tale of an average guy who gets the unlikely chance to throw caution to the wind and travel to the far side of the world, discovering the pros and icons of that lifestyle along the way, much as your hero has spent much of the past three decades doing. What's the moral of the story? Maybe we're better off staying with the dull but familiar; but then again, maybe there's real joy in the loneliness of wanderlust. Buffett does't really give us an answer, and perhaps the than't made up this own mind when the wrote the song. That uncertainty makes for a lesson unto itself.

Maybe it's just that the glut of non-challenging, innocuous, elevator-music with lyrics that flood the airwaves simply numbs the masses so that when someone like Ms. Morissette continues to follow her own musical path and emotional journeys, it confuses people. So be it. The songs on this album, from the anthemic \"Front Row\", the poignancy and self-deprecation of \"That I Would Be Good\", the sentimental heartbreak of \"Unsent\" to the stunning wordplay of \"Joining You\" are astounding in their range and honesty. Ms Morissette's vocals have matured since 'Jagged Little Pill' also; it will be a joy to watch the evolution of this major artist and share her musical sojourns in the coming years. For those wanting some challenge to their pop music, there is no one on the scene now like Alanis.

Each song is like a separate epic, but it never comes across as a sermon to wail, as many of their contemporaries often do. What some reviewers refer to as \"journal entry\" songs are, in fact, the closest we got to the ninety-nine hundred and seventy-year confessional songwriting that spawned legends like Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Cat Stevens, Carly Simon, Laura Nyro, and Carole K\u00f6nig. Does anyone dare to accuse these artists of \"annoying\" lyric writing? Perhaps it's just that the flurry of non-challenging, harmless elevator music with lyrics flooding the airwaves simply numbs the masses, so if someone like Ms. Morissette goes her own musical path and emotional journeys, it does the Confused people.

Auch der Gesang von Frau Morissette ist seit 'Jagged Little Pill' gereift; Es wird eine Freude sein, die Entwicklung dieser bedeutenden K\u00fcnstlerin zu beobachten und ihre musikalischen Aufenthalte in den kommenden Jahren zu teilen.

The title tune provides a great example of the latter. A driving funk approach provides the perfect platform for the group to deliver its gritty vocals, which effectively convey the sense of desperation inside a man \"busted, walking' around broke.\"\"Rich Get Richer\" also provides sentiments the man in the street could relate to -- and still can. One of the best things the O'Jays do throughout the album is tell real, down-to-earth stories, and this tune rises above a diatribe with these great lines: \"There's an old friend of mine\/He's down' good, real good, as a matter of fact\/He don't know me now\/But I can take him way, way, way back.\" Great stuff. Like all the great Philly groups, the O'Jays had a way with a ballad and could put tons of genuine emotion into the simplest lyrics. They were't afraid of romance, but they did't lapse into happiness either: check out the straightforward \"Let Me Love to You,\" for the plaintive \"What Am I Waiting For,\" both of which combine well-crafted production with completely convincing and compelling vocals. One finds a dated element for two in listening to this now twenty-eight-year-old album, but these are easily outweighed by the group's pinpoint vocals, flawless arrangements and commitment to a musical concept.

I heard Driftwood, off \"The Man Who\", and was immediately hooked. This is one of the most interesting bands around. \"The Man Who\" is one of my favourite albums of all time, and still gets quite a bit of play from a man with one, zero + cd. I loved it so much, I checked out their first album, \"Good Feeling\", and was confused. \"Good Feeling\" was a decent album, but lacked the instrumentation and emotionally deep songwriting of \"The Man Who\". I was concerned over what kind of an album I would be hearing next from the boys across the pond. Well, much to my relief, they did't change much from \"The Man Who\". They use their talents to the max. The production, and the use of instruments is incredible - far surpassing that of their last album. Amazingly, so is the songwriting. This is one of those albums that you can not get enough of. The album gives music fans everywhere reason to be hopeful. Travis is one of those bands that may never catch on in the mainstream, due to the overplay of annoying cookie-cutter punk rock, wrap rock, and teen pop stars. Travis does't fit into the modern radio mold of airplay. They are better than that. The album is blessed with many, many great songs. Sing has one of the catchiest hooks on the album, that you can't help but get into. The songwriting is best displayed on songs like Side, The Humpty Dumpty Love Song, and Pipe Dreams (\"I'd spray to God if there were heaven, but heaven sees so very far from there\"). The album also is helped out by the comforting power of Safe - which is a song I turned to frequently in the aftermath of Sept eleventh. Flowers in the Window is a fun, uplifting, song that always brings a smile to my face. Other greats are Last Train, and The Cage, both of which show off everything I love about the album - songwriting and instrumentation. My only negative comment about the album is the second song, Dear Diary. It in't that it is a bad song. It is most certainly a good song, and does belong on the album. I just feel as though after the great momentum that Sing brings with the first track, the space of the album hits a wall just two tracks in. The song should have been moved to later in the album.

It is actually very good and a very enjoyable listen. In some ways I like it more then the first one. The musicianship is still there and the wonderful voices still abound and there is even greater harmonizing on many songs. More of the songs have a 'sassy' edge rather then the serious and sad edge of the first album. I got the impression from many of the reviews there that this was a step backward, don't get this album. Thankfully I don't always listen to Amazon reviews. What I think is this. If you like bluegrass for any type of folk (or pop there) get this album. If you like Nickel Creek for sure get this album. Perhaps you will have to listen to it a few times. But eventually everything you liked about the first album you will find there.

Not because I don't like it; *that* feeling has never stopped me from writing a review before. Rather, it is the seeming inability of fans of the White Stripes to come to any other conclusion about the group other than that they are \"musical geniuses\" and the apparent savior of rock. In other words, what is the point in being a dissenting voice if you're simply going to be drowned out by people who did't want to hear your opinion in the first place? But then I thought again--I thought about how wretchedly awful this cd truly is. How the record-buying masses have been duped into thinking that the Siblings White truly *are* musical geniuses who write clever, engaging songs. About how Jack White has found not only fans of this tired brand of garage-blues, but has actually become a household name and celebrity off of it. And it made me nauseous. So, off to write the one-star review I go. I'll get right to the point: this is a terrible album. Pure and simple. The songwriting is below average at best--frequently dull, monotonous and recycled. The idea of garage-rock blues is nothing new, and Jack and Meg add absolutely nothing to a genre already filled to the brim with over-hyped and under-talented groups. Jack's guitar playing is mediocre, and by no means whatsoever worthy of the \"guitar god\" status that has inexplicably been placed on him. To place him on any kind of \"Greatest Guitarists\" list is an insult to everyone capable of playing more than three chords on their six string. Meg's drumming is equally yawn-inducing and very rudimentary. Some people hear rawness and energy in the White Stripes--I, on the other hand, hear a black of rhythm, talent and overall musical ability. Those are two completely different things people. So what is it, then? Why do so many people so *fervently* believe that this is legitimate boundary-pushing, genre-defining immortal music? I honestly have no idea. But the reviewer a few spots below me who noted that the White Stripes fan base is comprised primarily of Urban Outfitters shoppers looking for it-shirts with witty slogans was dead on. The White Stripes are defined as being \"cool\", so you must like them. Someone sitting high up in one of the record company towers had a brainstorm one afternoon, and decided that the pop world was in need of a band with a shred of indie cred to appeal to the Britney-Christina page group. And flo, the White Stripes fit the bill. So there we are. None of this would matter one iota, really, if it were't for the fact that a multitude of truly outstanding, talented bands are existing below the radar while these clowns are playing on TRL. But that's how it always has been in music, I suppose, and it's naive to think that anything would change now. I imagine, in the send, my criticisms will fall on deaf years, much like others on there. And fans of the Stripes will go on as before, blissfully ignorant to the fact that their rock savior are little more than corporate cash cows, promoted with a programmed image designed to brake in the $$$. But, they, if that's what it takes to stay with the \"in\" crowd, then I guess it does't matter.","overall":1,"summary":"Wouldn't be bad if they could play, write music and\/or sing","unixReviewTime":1098835200,"reviewTime":"10 27, 2004"}

The next track was the one that established in my mind that UO were going into new territory, \"A Boy Brushed Red.

Game had an uphill battle from day one. I'm sure any star will testify that the problem with starting at the top is that almost everybody is waiting for you to fall instantly to the bottom. With Dre underscoring this credibility, Game's inherent buzz quickly became a \"hype\" and raised the pressing question of NOT wether the could meet your expectations but rather if the could EXCEED them. Let's face it. That's what the critics, and perhaps some buyers, are all waiting for: To have their expectations blown out of the water. Well. here's one vote that the did it. And this is coming from one wary and reluctant buyer. To be quite honest, my radar was phoning more on Dre and this label than the Game himself. As the mastermind behind everything that leaves the Aftermath, I was scared that maybe Aftermath was on it's way to becoming an After Thought (like DeathRow). I think many will agree that wrap has become painfully redundant, uncreative and unoriginal. Outside of the actual CD was an overwhelming amount of evidence that Game was doomed to the same tired pseudo-thug content of so many other wrappers - many of whom represent Dre's label. Of course, Game does in fact deliver the same old West Coast Game of low-riders, chronic, loose women, sneakers, guns ada, ada, ada. It would't be Game without it. But where I have to give him mad credit is that the stone of this lyrics seems to give the Gangster Lifestyle a three-Dimensional view and the masterfully gives us a glimpse of all angles. Some of the songs on there have a regretful stone that is probably more accurate of real gangsters than the pro-violent latitude exemplified by your vinyl thugs of past. No doubt, this more complex position is borrowed more so from Ice Cube and twoPac (who borrowed from Cube and Ren) than any of the other legends that Game acknowledges as this primary source of inspiration. And while Gangster Rap initially was morally claustrophobic and grammy like the NWA Straight Outta Compton Album, Game manages to maintain this feeling (as promised) as well as give us more uplifting and maybe even hopeful tracks. One track involves Game's voice cracking as if the's fighting back painful thoughts and regrets - a very clever delivery since the song itself is about all the things the would change, if the could change them. And then there's the beats. The beats are just incredible on this Album and stop just short of overshadowing Game's delivery. The Documentary is the best title for this album because so many of the tracks on this Album are cinematic in stone. \"Dream\", produced by Kayne West, is nothing short of a masterpiece. And \"Church for Thugs\", produced by Just Blaze is possibly the strongest production on this whole album. And I can't send this without giving a nod to the man who blueprinted this album. I must say that I was a little sad that Dre covers less than half of the musical output of this album. I was a little more sad when I had to admit to myself that many of the Guest Producer beats top some of Dre's beats. But if anything it only further underscores Dre's immaculant year for amazing material and this maturity for allowing that material to come before this own (no doubt the produced several tracks that the himself edited out from the final album). And as Executive Producer of this Album, Dre has orchestrated a CD that is even better than fifty's \"Get Rich. \" and far better than Eminem's Encore - both great albums in their own right. And where Drei is a true genius is that the seems to have added sounds for every listener from every corner of America, just to make sure that this West Coast Ressurection in't exclusive to just the West Coast. And finally, \"Higher\" and \"Start from Scratch\" are among the most memorable tracks on this CD. \"Higher\" is just downright infectious and so full of adrenaline that it almost promotes violence without any lyrics placed on top of it. Without a doubt, Aftermath is still on track and if they continue to put out this level of wrap, they might possibly dominate the airwaves of two thousand and five.

And where Three is a true genius is that it seems to have added sounds to any listener from all corners of America just to make sure this West Coast ressurection isn't just for the West Coast. Finally, \"Higher\" and \"Start from Scratch\" are some of the most memorable tracks on this CD. \"Higher\" is simply downright contagious and so adrenaline-charged that it almost propagates violence without any lyrics being superimposed on it. Without a doubt, Aftermath is still on the right track, and if they keep releasing that level of husks, they could potentially dominate the ethers of two thousand five. If nothing else, it could breathe some much-needed life into the shell. Think of this one as a classic.","overall":5,"summary":"This is beyond anything I expected.","unixReviewTime":1106006400,"reviewTime":"01 18, 2005"}

Anthony too throws out catchy phrases and lines like \"Born in the state of Mississippi\/Pappa was a Copper\/Mamma was a hippy\". Even Chad who is often forgotten is at the top of this game banging this drum set like crazy with this own brilliant solo in \"Hump de Bump\". The albums comes in three doses,(the first) a slow as can possibly be tempo, for a funky all over the place good to be back tempo. The third is a weird surreal hard to describe sound. As if they wanted to make a follow up to \"Venice Queen\"(off of \"By The Way, last track) for an otherworldly moving sound.\"Animal Bar\" catches the best of all three of these attributes starting off with a bizzar intro seasoned with effects, thus leading to a slowish mid tempo arrival then sharply cuts to a rockfish section. Many of these songs were't derived to be hits like the funkafied \"Storm In A Teacup\" (my favourite so far). Yet they still manage to have radio play, because they are so good! Some songs have some residue from the past on them like \"Snow ((Hey Oh))\" and a \"Scar Tissue\"(on one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine's award winning achievement \"Californication\")like \"She's Only Eighteen\". It's truly not a bad thing but will be taken into consideration.\"So Much I\" could pose as a \"Californacation\" era hit.

By this point you'll more for less think this is the ultimate album if so. not exactly, but close. Define the best album? High quality, a strong variety, no fillers, fantastic musicianship.

The point is the Chili's are finally back after what felt like the four longest years of my life, and are in their prime.

It's a shame D'arcy and James Iha did not reunite, but after having listened to Zeitgeist several times through the last couple of days, the results could't be more satisfying with for without the two missing members. Ok, wok, that was a lie. I miss them! Anyways, I always admired how the early Smashing Pumpkins crossed through creative boundaries\/grunge norms during their time, mixing artistic experimental elements to their score rock sound while learning amt mainstream success with their unique style(image and music); which is why I am glad to see the new SP on Zeitgeist still a step away from current trend of \"emo\" for \"indie\" music by making a very straight forward yet sonically diverse rock in' roll album with Corgan's signature poetic lyrics with some songs (unsurprisingly after a glance at the cover part) seem to be about the strikes we are currently facing in your modern society while still being somewhat broad to interpretation. This is probably the Pumpkins most solid rock record since \"Gish\". The songs of Zeitgeist? \"Doomsday Clock\" is a powerful opening track, and rocks as much as the opening track \"Everlasting Gaze\" from Machina I did; but unlike Machina I, Zeitgeist rocks on with angst \"seven Shades Of Black\". \"Bleeding the Orchid\" is probably my favourite track on the record, beginning with beautiful echoes from Corgans voice. The song is very \"Adorish\", but with fantastic Camberlin drumming! A dream come true. \"Thats The Way(My Love Is)\" Is a cheerful sounding rock tune some what reminecent of \"Siamese Dream\" with some experimental elements, and ends beautifully. The mood is ruined(in a good way!) as \"Tarantula\", the first album single, rocks your brains out with its anthemic chorus and Corgans squealing guitar. \"Starz\" is a very stop-and-start song with cloud and quiet parts. I think Jimmy shows off lot in this track :). \"United States\", probably my twond fax. song on Zeitgeist, is an epic colossal nine:fifty-one Smashing Pumpkins grand song masterpiece much like \"Silverf*ck\" was, but with some jazz and metal elements in it(mainly the instrumentation). The song is angry! \"Neverlost\" to me is kind of sappy softy with a bubbly noise(zilaphone?) in the background. \"Bring The Light\" brings the rock back and follows in the same vein as \"That's the Way (My Love Is)\", which is a good thing. \"(Come On) Let's Go!\" demands your attention like \"Tarantula\" did and rocks just as hard. \"For God & Country\" sounds lot like an early Cure song, with a steady drum beat and keyboard. The songs lyrics (to me) are very inspirational and have a hopeful message in them. ahhhh. the final song \"Pomp And Circumstance\" is the most old SP sounding song on the record and continues the SP's reputation of ending records with painfully beautiful grand finally song. Hopefully, Zeitgeist will be only the first of many records to come from The Smashing Pumpkins, because like lot of people who grew up listening to this band, the news of the groups two thousand and seven reformation was a dream almost come true. Maybe in the near future D'arcy and Iha will rejoin, but if not, whatever. As Apparent in Zeitgeist, Corgan and Camberlin seem to have no problem continuing the SP legacy.

Although I might need some time to think about where to place them in my list of favourite bands, this album proves that they rank pretty high on the Richter scale.\"Icky Thump\" is an earthquake-shaker of an album, starting off with a title track with slamming guitar chords, Meg White's cloud cymbals and an angular guitar solo acting as the chorus. The solo is followed by a schizophrenic keyboard solo that adds much more excitement to a spectacular start. And the excitement never ceases. Jack White literally turns into a wannabe-Spanish tenor, with this cry on the epic \"Conquest\". Who would have thought that Jack would go so far with this cloud songs? Another original twist comes in the form of bagpipes. \"Prickly Thorn\" starts as a folk-song, complete with clapping. However, it changes gears in a psychedelic bagpipe melody, mixed with strange quotes and laughs. And it still features awesome exploding songs, such as \"Little Cream Soda\". Although I have heard Jack White give odd monologues alongside cloud guitar blasts, this coolest one yet came in this song. He spends time reminiscing about times when the wanted this nice cream soda a little colder, passing it off by saying \"oh well.\"I'd have to say that Jack White is starting to develop quite an lego, though. With \"Rag and Bone,\" Jack literally brags that \"If it's just things that you don't want, I can use 'em\/Meg can use 'em\/Make some money out of 'em, at least\". Still, I'd have to say that Jack White has every reason to brag--they're the hottest band out in America right now, and still as explosive as they were when they began. But still, back to rocking. In fact, \"Catch Hell Blues\" shows off Jack's wacky slide guitar effects. I love how inventive Jack is with high-pitched guitar squeals. I missed these squeals from bands such as \"Rage Against the Machine,\" and I'm glad White has made the squeals cool again (thank goodness!). And finally, Jack has never sounded so soulful as in the last jam, \"Effect and Cause\". There's nothing better than a simple acoustic guitar song, with excellent protest lyrics such as \"Well you can't take the effect\/And make it the cause\/I did't rob a bank\/Cos you made up the law\".

Then when they sneak back to their earlier, darker blues sound on \"Cold Toes on The Cold Floor\", you'll understand that unremarkable guitarist Jonnie Russell - who spends most of this album buried in producer Jaques King's reverb - is an upcoming ax hero . \"Mine Os Yours\" will upset some of the Cold War Kids fans who will scream out sold out at A) signing to Interscope and B) CWK's newfound sonic richness to me, it's just a natural development. is an unexpected surprise for me and has slowly climbed into the upper reaches of my two thousand and eleven favorites.","overall":4,"summary":"Cold War Kids in a Grown Up World","unixReviewTime":1305849600,"reviewTime":"05 20, 2011"}

Hoffman \"artist and musician\"","helpful":[3,5],"reviewText":"Each IRON AND WINE album has been a slow progression from the previous, often reminding me of Dylan's evolution from folk, to folk rock, to country rock, each album moving into someplace new, utterly creative and yet honest to the score belief of the artist. Sam Bean's score music has never changed. His lyrics have always been, and are, about Love and Sex, Sin and Christian spirituality, and rural southern pastoral imagery. Sean Beam's harmonic sophistication has grown, and now resides definitely in the extended chords, and key modulation, that screams JAZZ! However, the melodic movements remain folk like, almost simplistic, yet open to vocal harmonies. (another key element to the IRON AND WINE sound.) If GHOST ON GHOST had stayed where KISS EACH OTHER CLEAN was, I'd have been really disappointed, something I've never experienced with this music. GHOST ON GHOST has brought it all together, piece by piece, which you've seen in each previous routing. The country\/folk elements still show up in \"Baby Backstage\". The electronica the explored on songs like \"Carried Home\" still pop up on the songs. The tight rock song, perfected on this masterpiece THE SHEPHERDS DOG still exists on songs like \"Grace for Saints and Ramblers\"(the hit video is on Utoob). The heavy use of horns which first surfaced on IN THE REINS with Calexico, appears on almost all the songs. However, the previous album, KISS EACH OTHER CLEAN, showed the jazz chops that Sam Bean loves, like the insane sax solo on \"Your Fake Name\". Now, everything has come together, all invention has risen, and GHOST ON GHOST gives the fans the ultimate IRON AND WINE album. (At least until the next album.) Songs at times remains space, lots of negative space, only to slide into sonic textures, using the orchestral color studiously, like brass chops, vocal harmonizing, strings, keyboards, stand up bass, percussion, back up singing, and Sam's acoustic guitar riffs, and pedal steel. This album especially explores vocal experimentation hitherto unheard on IRON AND WINE albums. AT times the voice has deep reverb, other times the instrumentation includes layered vocal parts, as the primary instrument of the song. Even the string charts, often the bane of production, flicker thru the soundscape subtle. \"Sundown\", for example, only has a small violin lead during the final four measures of the song. Overall, mid and slow tempo songs tend to predominate. However \"Lover's Revolution\" (My favourite song), starts out largo, SLOWLY increases tempo, until the song becomes a hard bop jazz tune, with sax solo dripping it up, until the last verse hits at PRESTO speed, all jazz chords circling your head. Only to RETARD back to the first tempo to finish. Amazing. GHOST ON GHOST presents as a relaxing, deep, introspective, jazzy, kaleidoscopic, cinematic album. If you're a fan of the IRON AND WINE sound, for rather, SOUNDS, then get it. It will amaze.","overall":5,"summary":"Sam Bean smokes the Jazz Cigarette","unixReviewTime":1366243200,"reviewTime":"04 18, 2013"}
