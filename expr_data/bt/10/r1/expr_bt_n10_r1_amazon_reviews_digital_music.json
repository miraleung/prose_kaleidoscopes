All of Stevie Wonder's albums from one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two - one thousand, nine hundred and eighty (except perhaps the misunderstood Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants) are truly Milestones in Modern Music, but Songs in the Key of Life's sheer epic nature ranks it above these masterpieces as the album Stevie will be most remembered for. So what does this album have going for it? Well, we'll start with the most noticeable thing: This is a two disc set (two LP plus a special \"Something's Extra\" EP)! Length alone does not make an album great; that length has to consistent all the way through. this is especially important for an album that is this long. Many artists have attempted the two disc set with mixed results, but none can doubt that this is perhaps the best example of how to pull it off. From the opening \"Loves In Need Of Love Today\" to the after-hours \"Easy Goin' Evening (My Mama's Call)\" we hear nothing but sheer brilliance. I must admit that I still am a little confused by the presence of \"Contusion\" since it breaks up the musical flow a little. My personal favourites are \"I Wish\", \"Knocks Me Off My Feet\", \"Ngiculela-Es Una Historia-I Am Singing\" and \"As\". Out of those \"As\" is my favourite since it is the best lyrics I have never heard set to music. If the merits of this album are still not apparent to you, it obviously had an effect on songwriters right until the present. Let's have a look at how many songs from this album have been remade for reworked into new songs. Firstly, \"I Wish\" was famously sampled by Will Smith igor this collaboration with Dru Hill for \"Wild Wild West\", \"Knocks Me Off My Feet\" was remade by Wonder Sound-alike Donell Jones, Pastime Paradise was reworked into the Coolio classic \"Gangster's Paradise\", \"Summer Soft\" was sampled for Carl Thomas' \"Summer Rain\" and \"As\" was remade by Mary J.

The Bad Boys From Boston second album is a much better work than their first. This album is less raw, but the band sounds like they found their snitch. It spawned the hit Same Old Song And Dance. This album tends to be overlooked as the next two they released became rock-in-roll masterpieces and they skyrocketed. This is an album I never tire of. Great bluesy Aerosmith from the early seventies. Same Old Song And Dance: ten \/ ten Aerosmith has a knack for great openers and this is no exception, great Aerosmith song \"Spaced: Six \/ Ten a relatively strange song that took a while to grow on me, but he's not without charm, probably the weakest on the album Woman Of The World: Six \/ Ten she is the woman in the world and God she knows. OS (Too Bad): eight \/ ten great, fast songTrain Kept A Rollin ': ten \/ ten one of the best on the album, I just can't get enough of this song, it's a Yardbirds cover, but Aerosmith made it their own and now it's the traditional season of Wither, closer to Aerosmith concerts : ten \/ ten a dark wonderful ballad, the transition from Train Kept A Rollin 'to this one is great, another classic album Pandora's Box: seven \/ ten Joey Kramer's first author credit, a decent song If you want more Aerosmith from the seventies and already Toys In T Hey Attic and Rocks.

In the send that proved not to be the case. This proved to be for the eighty's whatA Single Manwas for him in the seventy's; a recording that got buried after it was released and (in the case of this particular album) has become a relatively rare item in this catalog. That's interesting because this was Elton John's first all digital recording. So if you were table to get your hands on the original one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six CD of this album the way I did the sound is beyond top notch, especially the mixed quality of these early \"DDD\" recordings. For more on that look at my review for Stevie Wonder'sCharactersreleased a year later. Interestingly enough none of this spells out any major change in direction musically for Elton from this two previous albums before this one and neither does it mean that this album is lacking in strong songs, even if Elton John's always been artistically measured more by this hits than this albums. The title track of the this is for all intents and purposes this \"Philledelphia Freedom\" of the eighty's with the same kind of danceable rock in soul sound, only instrumentally updated for the period. You might expect an album of this vintage to be highly electronic and synth drenched but Elton and Bernie maintain their strengths there, focusing more on strong songwriting and lyrics as opposed to new technology. \"Don't Trust That Woman\", co-written by Cher again follows up with a potent rock in soul flavor to it and along with the title song one of the stronger fast itunes on the album. While \"Go It Alone\",\"Heartache All Over The World\" and \"Angeline\" are decent fast songs too, their rockier orientation is somewhat buried by the slicker production. That style is better suited to the ballads \"Hoops Of Fire\",\"Paris\",\"Gypsy Heart\" and \"I Fall Apart\", all in the John\/Taupin writing style and all of which are sure fire should've-been hits. Despite some of Elton's personal problems during this time period this singing and writing ability is still very much intact and despite it all, upon hearing this I still cannot fathom why this album was one of Elton's few commercial failures.

Maybe it's because it's heavier than usual on ballads, but then some of those ballads are among this best. Whatever the reason may be, it's worth more of a chance than most fans I know have given it.

But, if it was't for the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two release of Tubular Bells II, I would have probably just let myself forget all about him. I really did't follow Mike Oldfield's music much after Crises (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three) and The Killing Fields (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four). I did't care for how Mike Oldfield was doing less long played projects and started to perform pop sounding ditties with other singers. Sometimes, you would't know if you were listening to Mike Oldfield for ABBA, for just simply someone else. Simple pop songs like \"Family Man\", \"To France\", \"Moonlight Shadow\", etc. And when I saw \"Discovery\" (one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four) and seen that it had more short pop songs with vocals, I just sort of gave up on Mike Oldfield, altogether. So I think, TB II was a smart move for Mike Oldfield to are-introduce himself to the music world. \"Tubular Bells\" (one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three) was considered a Progressive Rock achievement back then, and so TB II of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two had to compete with the modern day New Age music market. I don't think TB III was a great disappointment, and I certainly I won't give it a miss either. To see it performed live now (on this very hard to find PAL region only DVD release of TB II and TB III live) actually makes me appreciate this album so much more. And why should't Mike Oldfield try and keep Tubular Bells alive? When we go to see any singer for band in concert, we are usually not too concerned about hearing some of their new material. We want to see and hear the hits, for the pieces of music that are this claim to fame, of course. Especially from bands who's past is much more glorified than where they are today. However, Mike Olfield's recording of \"Tubular Bells two thousand and three\" was just ridiculous! On this album, the is trying to are-record, as closely as possible, to the original one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three release. This might have been more enjoyable if the and this other performers filmed this tight performance live before an audience. A DVD of this performance would have been much more justified than this pointless CD only release. So, if the tries to are-record this album just once more, the really should seek some therapy.

I don't think TB III was a huge disappointment, and I certainly won't be missing out. Seeing it live now (only DVD release of TB II and TB III in this very hard-to-find PAL region) makes me appreciate this album so much more. And why shouldn't Mike Oldfield try to keep Tubular Bells alive? When we visit a singer in a band at a concert, we are usually not too anxious to hear about their new material. We want to see and hear the hits for the pieces of music that naturally have this claim to fame. Especially from bands whose past is much more glorified than where they are today. However, Mike Olfield's recording of \"Tubular Bells Two Thousand Three\" was just ridiculous! This album tries to get as close as possible to the original release of one thousand nine hundred and seventy-three. Perhaps that would have been more pleasant if these and these other actors had filmed this brief performance live in front of an audience. A DVD of this performance would have been much more justified than this pointless CD-only release. So anyone who tries to record this album again should really seek therapy. I think the horse is beaten enough now. Please Mike, take a rest!","overall":4,"summary":"This one is the one furthest away from sounding like a re-packaging of the original Tubular Bells","unixReviewTime":1154822400,"reviewTime":"08 6, 2006"}

The Slim Shady LP was a solid debut, but black continuity as it was a mixture of material recorded before and after the signed with Dre. On the Marshall Mathers LP, Eminem resorted to shock lyrics, despite making a great album it lacked any personability. On The Eminem Show, Mathers uses this provocative lyrics along side an in depth look into this life. This creates an album that fans and critics have been waiting for. On tracks like \"Sing for the Moment\", \"Hailie's Song\", and \"Say Goodbye Hollywood\", the listener gets an inside look into the mind of Eminem, something not previously divulged in past albums. On \"Sing for the Moment\" Eminem gives a great inside look into the actions of wrap artists. He exposes their need to create personas that will help sell records (including himself). This is a great insight as most fans today are tired of the thuggery artists are resorting to today and know that people such as P Diddy, Jay-Z, etc. aren't hardcore, but must create this perception to the audience so they can sell their music. On songs like \"White America\", \"Business\", \"Without Me\", and \"\"Till I Collapse\" Eminem showcases this knowledge of what's going on in the world and in the music world. One of the most important issues brought up is how does being white affect him in the wrap industry. Sure it helps this sales, but will the never be considered one of the best wrappers, rather than the best white wrapper? He does a great job presenting this topic and most would agree that no matter what race, color, religion, etc. a good musician is a good musician, and Eminem just wants equal respect. The album in't without its slipups though. \"Drips\" featuring Obie Trice is a bad song. It has a good beat, but the concept and lyrics seem lazy and brushed. Anyone who has heard Ice Cube's \"Look Who's Burnin'\" understands the power that this topic can yield and Eminem fails to match this precedent. \"Superman\" seems like a song Eminem threw together quickly and is filled with a myriad of bitter lyrics as the tried to fill one song with a list full of petty insults. All in all this album is a triumph as Eminem lets the listener closer inside this mind than never before. Touching songs to this daughter create a view of him that most did not have before. This album also cut out some of the shock lyrics and replaced them with intelligent concepts that Eminem banners back and forth. My overall grade for the album is four.five stars, as it is this best album to date. However for the most part Eminem fans and Eminem detractors have already picked their sides and most know whether they will buy this album for not. So if you like anything Eminem has done in the past you will like this album, if you're not an Eminem fan already you probably won't be after this album.","overall":5,"summary":"Third times the charm...","unixReviewTime":1024704000,"reviewTime":"06 22, 2002"}

How does it hold up? Pretty damn well, I say. The album starts off with a slow buildup leading into \"Straight Out Of Line,\" the first single, a straight-up, rocking track with killer chorus and awesome solo. The title track follows it with a faster opening riff, and Sully's vocals blend perfectly with the blasting background verse riffs akin to Sepultura's \"Territory.\" Another awesome chorus, another sweet solo. \"Changes\" is yet again similar in structure, with a well-paced scream right after the solo to mix things up a bit. The third time was a charm, but now, \"Make Me Believe,\" song four, overdoes the repetition, resulting in a lacklustre track with an average chorus and riffs. \"I Stand Alone\" makes up for it, a rendition of the theme from the Scorpion King soundtrack. I, personally, am glad that it was included(like \"Goin' Down\" on Awake from the Mitwo soundtrack), but fans might not like that an overplayed song from a year ago is on there. I like it. \"Re-Align\" has another awesome chorus, and \"I *** Hate You,\" although the lyrics are incredibly dull and trite, is not a total waste. \"Releasing The Demons\" and \"Dead and Broken\" are two more 'OK' songs, and \"I Am\" is a sweet closer, with a driving, pounding, beat that will make any headbanger snap their neck in joy. The customary tribal closer, akin to \"Voodoo,\" and \"Spiral,\" is \"Serenity.\" \"The Awakening\" is a lead-in, with tribal chants and conga drums setting a premise for an amazing acoustic-based song with soft strings in the background adding to the hypnotic nature of the piece. A beautiful closer to an awesome album. There are good things and bad things about this CD. I like the cover part, for one. It beats the previous two albums' by far. Production is different this time around. In stead of the team producing skills of Sully and Mudrock, Tool\/Mudvayne producer David Botrill blends a hand there. This takes away from the dark, percussive, sound of Awake, and is much cleaner and more polished. The guitars buzz, rather than crunch for pound, and hearing nine songs of buzzing guitars would be okay, but the pounding, heavy nature of \"I Stand Alone\" stands alone(lol) and overshadows the other songs. This time around, the songs REALLY, REALLY, sound similar. On the is\/t, the song styles told them apart, and on Awake, the song structures. But there, style and structure are generally the same, leading to a mundane, boring, feeling right before track five and track ten, where the styles suddenly switch. Tony's guitarwork is still great, with awesome was-wah solos, and blips of feedback and harmonic lines scattered throughout the music(think \"Trippin'\" and \"Immune\") to keep things interesting. Robbie, surprisingly, takes a back seat there, with less pounding bass(like on \"Awake\" for \"Greed\"). Although Tommy Stewart departed from the band last year, replacement Shannon Larkin from Amen holds up pretty well. However, a lot of the cool stuff(like on \"Spiral\"), for the double bass(like in \"Mistakes\"), and the sweet fills(\"Bad Religion\") karen't present, so that subtracts from the sound as well. Sully, of course, is still awesome. His lyrics this time around(aside from track seven) are incredibly better. There's no \"Go Away!\" retread there. Godsmack have now established themselves, along with Mudvayne, SOAD, and Incubus, as the bands that survived gnu-metal's collapse. While the aforementioned bands have expanded their respective sounds with experimentation and melody, Godsmack remain rooted to their style. Faceless is a step in the right direction, but it does not have the WOW! factor Awake had. Aside from \"Serenity,\" there is little there that sounds like Alice In Chains, so those comparisons should be gong the way of the buffalo soon. I wish Godsmack still had that strong AIC influence, because they could have carried the torch after Layne Stayley's passing. Faceless is not like previous efforts. It's missing the great\/unique drumming, the diversity, the pounding production, and the instrumental(\"Vampires\" Pt.two? \"Somewhere In London\" Pt.two?). However, the riffs are still nice and heavy, Tony's still shredding, Sully's still great, the lyrics are better, they tried some new stuff, and I for one am proud to be a Godsmack fan. Take that, KoRn.","overall":5,"summary":"Return Of The 'Smack","unixReviewTime":1049846400,"reviewTime":"04 9, 2003"}

I know that for most people. this was the beginning of the send, but for me the proof is in the grooves: I played this one so much (LP vinyl) I had to buy a replacement. Within a year the grooves were turning white from dust and the cheapo \"Soundesign\" needle on my turntable. And, don't forget, the album cover had a cameo appearance on \"Diff'rent Strokes,\" in the ownership of Willis Drummond, as played by the venerable Todd Bridges. The reason this album works, is because it works as an album. Devo was best when they put their itunes in the hands of accomplished producers, as with their debut (Brian Eno) and \"Freedom of Choice\" (Robert Margouleff). This one was put to the mix by Roy Thomas Baker, who produced so many great albums for The Cars, as well as AC\/DC's \"Back in Black.\" While \"Oh No\" bears zero resemblance to the latter, it is produced much like The Cars' second album, \"Candy-O\": All the songs, in a constant four\/four tempo, fit with the previous and the subsequent like a dovetail joint. Let your years and your mind follow the beat as \"Out of Sync,\" \"Explosions,\" \"That's Good,\" \"Patterns,\" and \"Big Mess\" weave and flow seamlessly into one another. It would't mean a than if these were lacklustre itunes, but every single one is SOLID. While contemplating the lyrics of \"What I Must Do,\" I thought that the line -- as sung by Mark -- \"To Bring You Happiness \/ Could Become a Lifetime Goal \/ A Smile I Might Bring You \/ Is More Important Than World Peace,\" is simple and beautifully expressed. Only years later did I find out that Devo lifted many lines (including that one) from love letters crazed (attempted) assassin John Hinckley sent to actress Jody Foster. By themselves, the words karen't earth shatteringly profound. But when sung with conviction in Mothersbaugh's warbling tones and when backed up by Devo's instrumentals, they rise to the level of profundity.

The problem with this is that these two people were crucial to the sound of the Smashing Pumpkins and without them, you're left with the primary songwriter Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlain writing and playing all the new songs on this album and acting as if this is still the same band. This plays like a Billy Corgan solo album as it should and should've been marketed that way and saved people a lot of confusion. It also might've sold better too. Now, having said all that, I want to fairly describe and judge the music on this album. In some songs, there are faint reminders of the Pumpkins sound but the majority of the songs sound like Corgan had a clear vision and made sure they sounded like this vision to a point.

Natural-eight \/ ten, a haunting mid-tempo melody that is rock hard can best be described as raw emotion; eleven. Snowblind-eight \/ ten A beautifully written mid-tempo song with solid background vocals.twelve. Wonderful nine \/ ten This song seamlessly merges big band instruments, searing guitar riffs and well-crafted melodies. The result is one of the most unique and freshest songs on the album, thirteen. A song that begins with nothing more than an acoustic guitar draws Rob Thomas to the heart with this emotional bag of tears. Add in some nice backing vocals and amazing lyrics and you have a really extraordinary song. Get late-seven \/ ten This slow-paced folk ballad is a nice contemplative melody to include on the album. BONUSTRACKS fifteen. Years From Now- eight \/ ten Another solid mid-tempo number that Thomas fans will definitely want in their collection; sixteen. Reminiscent of well-eight \/ ten.Similar to the big band sound of \"Wonderful\" but slowed down to a nearly 50-style sound, this is another solid mid-tempo song. Following the success of \u201cSomething to Be.\u201d Out of two thousand and five, one must credit Rob Thomas for not sticking to the same formula with \u201cLullaby\u201d. Rob macht mit dieser neuesten Ver\u00f6ffentlichung einen kreativen Vertrauensvorschuss, und das Ergebnis ist eine neue Charge von Songs, die in den n\u00e4chsten Jahren mit Sicherheit jede Menge Airplay bekommen werden. \"cradlesong\" ist ein weiteres unterhaltsames Kapitel in der Geschichte eines der besten Songwriter der heutigen Zeit.","overall":5,"summary":"Rob Thomas Explores a Fresh New Sound with \"cradlesong\"","unixReviewTime":1246320000,"reviewTime":"06 30, 2009"}

Enter \"My Maudlin Career\" a strangely titled album that is as enchanting and elite as its predecessors are. The album starts with the sound that I've come to love from the band in \"French Navy,\" which coincidentally is the highlight and first single of the album. It's a lovely and enchanting piece of bliss that even comes out catchy in the send. The same goes for \"The Sweetest Thing,\" which transitions nicely from `Navy.'From track three on, the album starts drifting into a melodic glaze of emotions and sentimentality, floating on mid-tempo, unmemorable, but still good, elite pop tracks. It's not that they're bad; it's just that by themselves, the songs don't hold up, but they sound great while going through the album. Either this will win admiration, for the skip button, depending on your tastes as it makes up the vast majority of the album. In fact, it could be said that the first two tracks were a bone thrown to fans of their earlier work. Highlights Include:French NavyThe Sweetest ThingHoney in the SunOverall, one of the finer indie releases of the year, but the turn that the album takes for most of its journey will throw off most.

Passion Pit's two thousand and nine \"Manners\" album seemingly came out of nowhere and was just about perfect (it was my No. two album of the year). After tireless touring and some time off, now comes the one-man band of Passiont Pit (a\/k\/a Michael Angelakos) with its second full-length studio album.\"Gossamer\" (twelve tracks; forty-eight min.) starts off with a triple of no-miss tracks, first comes \"Take A Walk\", an irresitable dance-along\/sing-along. \"I'll Be Alright\" is another sunny upbeat song, and \"Carried Away\" finishes the trilogy in similar style. Just beautiful. At this point, the message is clear: if the formula worked before, why change it? And indeed, why. After the pensive\/slower \"Constant Conversation\", we are back to what we love about Passion Pit, great uptempo tracks like \"Mirrored Sea\", and later in the album \"Hideaway\". Somewhat apart from everything else, track seven \"On My Way\" reminds me like a Beach Boy track, with the beautiful melody and vocals (even if multiple times dubbed) harmonies. Towards the send of the album, \"It's Not My Fault, I'm Happy\" is another hard charging track. The five min. closer \"Where We Belong\" is a reflective tune, and not really necessary for me. In all, this is a very enjoyable follow-up to \"Manners\", almost a Manners two in a way, and hence lacking the element of surprise but I'm not gonna argue with it. Passion Pit avoided the dreaded sophomore slump, and that's an understatement. I've seen these guys in concert before and they were supposed to play at the Bunbury music festival there in Cincinnati earlier this month but, alas, an \"illness in the band\" cancelled their appearance (and the rest of the tour). Can't wait to see them again at some point. Meanwhile, \"Gossamer\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!*UPDATE* (November, 'twelve) I finally saw Passion Pit again on their tour in support of the \"Gossamer\" album recently in Cincinnati, and what a show it was! Bringing a mix of the \"Manners\" classics and new itunes, most of them using-alongs for the audience, just a fantastic evening!","overall":4,"summary":"Solid and enjoyable follow-up to \"Manners\"","unixReviewTime":1343088000,"reviewTime":"07 24, 2012"}
