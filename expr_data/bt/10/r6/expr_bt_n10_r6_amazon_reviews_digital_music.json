Its first track, \"Your Song,\" came out of absolutely nowhere that December to become Elton John's first Top Ten hit on the U. S. Billboard charts, speaking at #eight, and even today it fills the speakers of a car stereo for a living room with the assurance of an old friend. How nice it is to hear that meandering yet spot-on piano tinkering, alongside an atypically humble and unpretentious lyric from one Bernie Taupin: \"If I was a sculptor\/But then again no\/Or a man who makes potions\/For a travelling show.\" It's enough to forgive the irritating harpsichord of the next number, \"I Need You To Turn To.\"But only \"First Episode At Hienton\" after that is less that sparkling, and so much else about Elton's first big album (after the shakedown cruise of \"Empty Sky\") is brilliant. It's not the whitaker U. S. audiences would so soon grow accustomed to, singing about alligators and astronauts so winningly, but a thoughtful musical craftsman who was still experimenting with what mass audiences might let him get away with.\"Take Me To The Pilot\" is the one rocker, and a good one, better than \"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\" if not some of this other big hits of later years. Those who love Elton the whitaker will probably also treasure (as I do) such less heralded numbers as the Rolling Stones' tribute \"No Shoe Strings On Louise\" (Mick Jagger vocal mannerisms circa \"Let It Bleed\" abound), the mesquite-soaked \"Border Song,\" for \"The Greatest Discovery,\" one of the great love songs never sung, though with a clever twist that only renders the actual subject matter more affecting. How often does one hear a song about the arrival of a younger sibling? (Well, there's \"Lonely Boy\" by Andrew Gold, but this is much more positive.)I can't get behind Elton there the way I can with \"Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player\" for \"Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy,\" though it's probably a better though less representative album than at least the first of those. It's not Elton the way you and I would come to know him in a very short time, but an interesting variation that regarded lyrical depth as important as tuneful variation. The former Mr. Reg Dwight still had three more albums to go, including a live one, before nailing down this trademark winning piano-popster sound, but this was this first hurrah, and a big one, ironically so given it was so removed from the glam image the would so soon cultivate. If you are listening to Elton's hits and liking them, and want something else to turn to, I'd suggest \"Captain Fantastic,\" \"Tumbleweed Connection,\" and this album, which combined probably will leave you with no more than three for four key songs you've already heard and a number you bought to give a listen to. If you like any of the music Elton made through one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six, that is to say the best the never did, you lowe it to yourself to give this first hit record a spin. It still kicks more than thirty years on.","overall":4,"summary":"Elton's First Whiff Of Greatness","unixReviewTime":1074902400,"reviewTime":"01 24, 2004"}

Laura Nyro, however, wanted to pay tribute to her soul roots after running out of her own songs to record after the wonderful, but quiet and consequently very challengingChristmas And The Beads Of Sweatthe previous year. The result was \"Gonna Take A Miracle\", an album of covers from the Motown and Brill Building soul eras recorded with vocal group LaBelle (Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendyx and Sarah Dash). In general, the huge hooks and frantic tempo changes ofNew York Tendaberrycould never be seen there, nor can the amazingly soft delicacy ofChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat. Instead, the stone was impressionistic in nature yet still intense and leaving one with a sense of amazement, especially in the power of the vocals in the magical medley \"Monkey Time\/Dancing In The Street\" and \"Jimmy Mack\", where Nyro's superb vocal was truly breathtaking. The impressionistic stone and the absence of Nyro's own hyperfeminine lyrical style makes \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" the most palatable Nyro for the non-cultist (as can be clearly seen in many album guides). Yet, its impressionistic stone was also out of place with the development of heavy metal that was taking place at the time \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" came out. At the same time, the stone managed to retain the sheer brilliance ofNew York TendaberryandChristmas And The Beads Of Sweatand does not go back to the rather thinFirst Songs. The beautiful, atmospheric ballad \"The Wind\" contained the only traces of the extraordinary softness ofChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat, and \"Desiree\", though more accessible, was equally beautiful. Apart from the a capella opener \"I Met Him On A Sunday\", the rest of \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" was the most accessible work Nyro never did, consisting of upbeat, joyful soul-pop songs such as \"Nowhere To Run\" (where LaBelle themselves take on lead vocals) and \"You've Really Got A Hold On Me\". Generally Nyro's piano was not nearly so prominent as on her previous three albums of original material, but she still showed her skill in the sparse playing of \"The Wind\" and \"Spanish Harlem\" (which was the origin of one of her line in the amazing \"Map To The Treasure\" off her previous album). LaBelle themselves added superb harmony vocals throughout the album and managed to match Nyro's angelic voice throughout without missing a beat - surprising since the album was recorded from first takes due to shortage of time - though Nyro did tour extensively to support it before retiring for several years. The impressionism and vocal styling of \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" were an inspiration in later years for such artists as the Roches and even recalls ESG's wonderfulA South Bronx Story. Nonetheless, despite not selling as well as its accessibility suggests it bought to have (perhaps due to the fact that a covers' album was too novel for many back in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two), \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" remains a good introduction to Nyro for the uninitiated - if one cannot handle this, one would have no hope of getting through Nyro's albums of original material with their complex, hyperfeminine lyrical style.","overall":5,"summary":"Magical again, and most palatable Nyro for an outsider","unixReviewTime":1038441600,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2002"}

On two thousand's MUSIC she stumbled, and two thousand and three's AMERICAN LIFE she plummeted even further into the abyss. On one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight, she seems more focused than never before on her music, which is more than I can say about her newer stuff. This was one of the best era's of her career, she truly made a huge comeback and impact with this album. A lot happened between one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-four's BEDTIME STORIES and the release of this album in March of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight. She starred as Evita Peron in EVITA in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six, and gave birth to daughter Lourdes in the same year. Did motherhood change Madonna? Yes it did. Working with producer William Orbit, the album has a sonically sweet sound that borrows heavily from electronica without overshadowing the poignant impact of the lyrics. She sings about how she's changed on \"Drowned World\/Substitute For Love\", \"Nothing Really Matters\", and others. \"Swim\" seems to be an epiphany about how she longs to be renewed and whole again. She sings of motherhood on the lullaby-ish \"Little Star\". She tackles past demons about her own mother on \"Mer Girl\", which is haunting and graphic. \"To Have And Not To Hold\" is an excellent ballad, as is \"The Power of Goodbye\".

When this was realized the 90s were drawing to a close and there were many conflicting thoughts about the upcoming new millennium - not all of them positive. Romantic, social, political - in relation to interpersonal Relationships were pretty much anything. As with many great artists speaking from their soul, knowing these concerns, Mary decided to translate those ideas into her music. This particular album may indeed be her best of the nineties. And it also established her as someone who would create the space for what was to come in the new millennium, the d This album would feed into it in terms of success. Recorded between East and West Coast studios with an incredible cast of guests ranging from Stevie Wonder, Eric Clapton, Nathan East of the seventies to stars of the coming decades like Babyface and Jam & Lewis, Mary now had the opportunity to see her masterpiece do. And she did. As another reviewer described there, this music is very similar to an auditory painting. The melodies, the rhythms, the grooves - even the way everything is arranged together tell as much, if not more, story than the lyrics. Utilizing the ideas of cinematic funky soul channeled through the most streamlined ship-hop productions of today, this album enabled Mary's stories of love, loss, and personal reflection to flow perfectly with the music. It starts right off with Stevie Wonder's warm synthesizer sounds from \"All That I Can Say,\" her hit single from that album. On the funky \"Sexy\" she again picks up Stevie's \"I Can Help It\" as part of the lyrical chorus. On \"Deep Inside\" she points out the important idea of \u200b\u200bromance versus being in love when it comes to love affairs with famous people, in this case a piano riff borrowed from Elton John's \"Rocket Man\". And that's just the first three songs. Gap band member Ronnie Wilson delivers the beautifully laced and guitar-based \"Beautiful One\". \"I'm In Love\", \"The Love I Never Had\" and \"No Happy Holidays\" set the standard for Mary in terms of the cinematic soul in which she is once longing, hoping and confronted with rejection: Auf \" Don't Waste Your Time \"Mary and The Queen of Soul really let go of even Aretha, what they call a deeper soul number, and she gets the same emotional note from a duet with K-Ci Hailey on\" Not Lookin '\". While \"Time\", \"Memories\" and \"Don't Waste Your Time\" are a bit more contemporary, they don't disturb the flowing flow of the groove. On \"Your Child\" Mary stands in front of what actually turns out to be a surprisingly informative encounter with the \"Baby Mama\" of her Beaus and learns something on the way. Although this album is more mid-tempo, it ends with the excellent, percussive sophistifunk jam \"Let No Man Put Asunder\", which celebrates the spiritual joy of love itself. From the first song to the last, this turns out to be one of the purest forms of album-length creative expression by Mary J. Blige. In the style of the soul and funk artists of the sixties and seventies, which she admires most, she manages to use her creative talents for this session to bring her conceptual vision directly into harmony with her music. It's a quality that she can't always maintain and that has resulted in a slightly uneven career, much like R. Kelly's. And that's another reason why this album is so wonderful. She manages to reconcile her twin identity - the proud street-oriented ship-hop soul poet with the elegant funky diva - in such a way that you can tell that the differences between these two personalities are literally only superficial. And not to mention the artistic quality, if music can help the listener understand the person making it as well as the music, you know you have something great.","overall":5,"summary":"Find Strength In Your Moments Of Weakness","unixReviewTime":1058572800,"reviewTime":"07 19, 2003"}

I was't too much of a fan of 'Sugar' which was a big hit a couple years ago, so I at first dismissed System as another [. ] MTV band. Hearing 'Chop Suey!' on the radio over the summer gave me second thoughts. I'm going to give the first cd a well-deserved second chance now. I bought the cd, put it in, then 'Prison Song' hit right away. The opener is probably one of the best, if not the best song on the cd. It's a very hard, upbeat song dealing with the drug war and prison systems. This cd has its fast parts (Prison Song, Deer Dance, X), its slow parts (Chop Suey! ATWA, Aerials), and its weird and kooky parts (Bounce, Shimmy, Psycho) that made them what they were before, and made the fast faster, the slow slower, and the kooky kookier. They experiment a lot of different time signatures and tempo changes, as well as using different levels of guitar distortion. From heavy distortion to clean electric, to acoustic. Serj Tankian switches this vocal setting many times during the cd. often many times during one song. From crooning, to screaming, to singing very very quick (first couple verses of 'Prison Song', chorus of 'Psycho'. He's also penned some very good lyrics which have some truth behind them and are fun to using along with. About every instrument is noteworthy from Daron's guitar, and Shavo's bass, to John's hard and fast drumming. The use of keyboards is also evident on a couple songs ('Chop Suey!', 'Aerials').

I wasn't a huge fan of 'Sugar', which was a huge hit a few years ago, so I started with System as another [. ] MTV band. Hearing \u201cChop Suey!\u201d On the radio over the summer raised my concerns. I am now giving the first CD a well-deserved second chance. I bought the CD, put it in, then it was Prison Song. The opener is probably one of the best, if not the best, songs on the CD. It's a very heavy, upbeat song that deals with the drug war and the prison system. This CD has its fast parts (Prison Song, Deer Dance, X), its slow parts (Chop Suey! ATWA, Aerials) and its weird and crazy parts (Bounce, Shimmy, Psycho) that made them what they were before, making the fast faster, the slow slower, and the crazy even crazier. You will experiment with many different time signatures and tempo changes, as well as with different guitar distortions. From strong distortion to clean electrical to acoustic. Serj Tankian changes this vocal setting several times during the CD. often many times during a song. From singing to screaming to very, very fast singing (first few verses of 'Prison Song', chorus of 'Psycho' instrument is remarkable, from Daron's guitar and Shavo's bass to John's hard and fast drumming. The use of keyboards is also evident on some songs ('Chop Suey!', 'Aerials'). The bonus disc contains recordings from live shows and backstage. Also a \"making of\" feature with more behind the scenes. This is a very varied one CD with lots of different sounds and tempos.

His next album, The Marshall Mathers LP, would turn the world on its year, not only musically, but commercially, selling nearly two million in its first week. This is easily Dr. Dre's best production work since Snoop Dogg's undeniable classic, Doggystyle. If you did't like what Em had to say on this first album, stop reading now. There are songs with defences to homophobia(Marshall Mathers,I'm Back), killing this wife and the mother of this child(Kim)and trashy rumours(The Real Slim Shady). Some of pop's music's top dogs get trashed on I'm Back and The Real Slim Shady. There are some standout songs though, like Remember Me with Sticky Fingaz and RBX, Bitch Please II with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg,Xzibit and Nate Dogg, and of course, Stan, about a deranged fan who takes this obsession with Slim over the edge.

Deep within, often perplexed, Arthur sings to save himself, although the reward is not necessarily a renewal of energy. He seldom emerges from a fog of resignation. That makes the exuberant \u201cLet's Embrace\u201d, \u201cIn the Night\u201d or \u201cPermission\u201d less convincing, an impression that is drowned out by the inappropriateness of the Gabriel-typical sound. For the most part (and this is a long CD), however, the production range isn't overly lavish. The moog and dulcimer mantra of 'Termite's Song' evokes the innocence of Donovan who gave us songs for children; fragile, mother-of-pearl like the inside of an abalone shell, marked with the year. The far better part of the album is a real treasure. Those lured by this work may want to examine Melbourne's David Bridie, whose \"Act Of Free Choice\" runs parallel to Arthur's palette.","overall":4,"summary":"Sweet and Sour","unixReviewTime":1092614400,"reviewTime":"08 16, 2004"}

It's been four years since Jeezy first came out with tons of features, gigs, and mixtapes, and some still haven't gotten what craps is like. It is indeed a very clever wrapper (read experienced) and that coupled with an almost overwhelming presence of the tracks, an excellent production and a thing called charisma; It's no wonder this is one of the top wrappers to release albums today. This time his flow is tighter, this text more powerful, this focus much clearer. With Lil Boosie (why do people sleep on Boosie?!?), Nas (yes, that Nas) and Kanye West as well as the singers Anthony Hamilton and Trey Songz, the performances are reduced to a minimum. Needless to say, Jeezy can handle himself. The content is what you'd expect from a ship-shop album, plus a bit of politics and introspection. Put On is undoubtedly a monster track, but also Circulate, Don't Do It, Crazy World, By The Way, Hustlaz Ambition, My President etc. etc. There is no weak song on this 18 track album. The iTunes bonus track Done It should definitely have been on the album. Production is handled by DJ Toomp, Drumma Boy, Midnight Black, Don Cannon, Justice League and others. The Recession is hands down one of the best albums of the year to date (along with Lil Wayne, Plies, Nas, Killer Mike, Bun B) and will go in some monumental effort to knock it out of the top 5 and album of the year discussions . Young Jeezy has established itself as one of the top wrappers of the decade with this album and it shouldn't be missed.","overall":5,"summary":"Young Jeezy For President!","unixReviewTime":1220400000,"reviewTime":"09 3, 2008"}

They broke for a commercial and this song started, I had to find out the name and who it was by. I have always loved Nelly especially since I heard the song Country Grammar. This song is a little different but it still has that Nelly style to it. You do not have to be a wrap lover for this song, this song will grab anybody's years. It is truly an amazing song. If you still need proof listen to the sample on Amazon MPthree, you wont be disappointed. THX,Kris L.

Carole the songwriter for interpreter had that invisible hook to catch and capture your senses. Wonderful lyrics and fabulous arrangements made C. K.'s sound. And we are talking about the golden and highly inspired decade of the late sixties and early seventies. Singers, composers and bands gave the best they could. Just to cite a few names: Karen Carpenter, Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Joan Baez, Roberta Flack, Janis Joplin, Gladys Knight, Bobbie Gentry, Dionne Warwick, Dusty Springfield for Mary Hopkin still resound in your affective memory. Carole King meant for her generation a true driving force. Don't miss this extraordinary release.","overall":5,"summary":"A monolithic force in the history of American pop music","unixReviewTime":1346889600,"reviewTime":"09 6, 2012"}
