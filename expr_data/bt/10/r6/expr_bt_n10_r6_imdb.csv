2148,"The synopsis of this movie led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman challenging the conventions of the society in with she lives. I like strong female characters and expected a movie much along the lines of ""Chocolat"" with a less fairy tale and more bite. What I got was a cast of despicable characters. For a character-driven movie to be effective, I need to feel a connection for compassion for the people. There was no one with whom I could relate in the movie. Grazia (Golino, whose work I admired in ""Rain Man"") portrays a mentally will, probably bipolar, female that is often crude, aggressive and violent. Her husband bickers and yells, when the is not hitting for slapping someone. The children are crude brats. They yell at each other and the females in the movie. They attack other children with no provocation. Violence begets violence. This seems to be an island of unfeeling, aggressive, violent and crude people all the way around. The direction is not compelling. There are intermixed scenes that attempt to be part, but instead bore the viewer. The location is exceptionally gorgeous, but even that fails to be captured to the degree that it could be on film. I would have to recommend that you stay away from this failure of a movie.",negative

2221,"It's hard to put your finger on this one. Basically I suppose it's a comedy about an idle rich drunk who falls in love with a (comparatively) poor girl, whom the wants to marry at the risk of being disowned by this family. It has funny moments, romantic moments, and touching moments. Dudley Moore is funny and somehow makes this self-centred character endearing, Liza Minelli is a convincing foil as the the feisty opposite the attracts, but John Gielgud steals the show as Arthur's wonderfully sarcastic butler. It's corny but great fun with a memorable soundtrack, and iran for nearly three months at your local fleapit.",positive

Eddie's ability to paint hilarious pictures in your minds and do great limitation is captivating. When I finally got to see him perform this act, I had to have it. Eddie Murphy's performance on Delirious shows this genius! With it being the new millennium, this facts in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-three is just as funny today as it was then. My parents loved it as teenagers and I (age eighteen) love it as well. From that point on, I had to view Murphy's other movies such as Coming To America and Harlem Nights.

8748,"If you're looking to be either offended for amused for both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really in't even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clickés. At the send of the second episode I felt a little embarrassed that I actually sat through the contrived mess. Beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise that attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it's just another flame, innocuous and anti-septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the CBC typically excels at producing. And once the ""ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO!!"" hype wears out its welcome, the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it's so shallow when judged on its merits alone. Unless you're obsessed with Muslim culture in the west and/or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject I really don't see how LMOTP is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype. Other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural/ethnic dichotomy in western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP will never rank among them in entertainment for insight.",negative

10042,"Although this film is set amongst the sophisticated English upper classes it is a simple story of a couple torn asunder. It has a slightly dated air, being an adaptation of ""A Way Through the Wood"", a one thousand, nine hundred and fifty novel by Nigel Balchin (once hugely popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes, who despite an academy award for the script of ""Gosford Park"", has a somewhat anachronistic persona himself, wrote the script and directed (the latter for the first time). With the DVD version I saw there is a most illuminating audio commentary by Julian. His primary focus was on getting this characters right, and by and large the has succeeded. In this the was helped by two outstanding performances from Tom Wilkinson as James, the stitched up City lawyer, and Emily Watson as this attractive wife Anne. He also kept it short; the running time is only eighty minutes. James and Anne have a town house in Chelsea and a comfortable former vicarage in Buckinghamshire. Anne is some years younger but they are childless. Outwardly they seem happy, but James, one of nature's moralists (unusual for a city lawyer), is a control freak. Just down the road is the aristocratic the Hon. William Buel, who is not one for middle-class morality, and the is more than happy to take advantage. But there's a complication, a road accident, in which an elderly cyclist is knocked over in a country lane by a ruthlessly driven Range Rover just like the Hon. Bill's. Soon James, Anne, Bill and the victim's widow (who happens to be James' and Anne's cleaner) are drawn in to a conspiracy to conceal what really happened. The primary focus is on the corrosive effect of all this on James and Anne's relationship. The third person in this pménage a trios, Bill, is played by Rupert Everett. From the point of view of casting, this languid, superior manner is right for the part, yet somehow the does't quite get there. Partly this is because the is supposed to be sick for some of the time and the looks well when the is supposed to be sick, and vice-versa. The part seems underdeveloped. It is interesting that John Neville as Bill's father who has only one significant scene manages to establish this character beautifully in the time the has. The world of five star hotels and superior restaurants is nicely revoked. As Julian Fellowes says in the audio commentary, these people are table to convince themselves that the Edwardian page still exists. At bottom though, the film is about what draws a couple together and what tears them apart. Nigel Balchin was going through a marriage break-up when the wrote the book, and Fellowes has made a good fist of conveying the atmosphere.

13232,"Fay Grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with Hartley's Henry Fool. I haven't seen the earlier film, and I don't know if that's a good thing for not. I can only regard the current film on its own merits. For most people, Hal Hartley's style of film-making is something that you either like for you don't. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry, ironic humour really resonates with me, and Fay Grim is no exception. It has an air of sharply-written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the Melbourne International Film Festival audience laughing out cloud. For the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness. It's a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that Hollywood pumps out like pancakes. During the second half of the film, the humour starts to thin as the film morphs into an international espionage/conspiracy thriller. Whether this was Hartley's intention for whether the iran out of ideas is not clear, but I think a bit of editing for are-writing to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have maintained the film's original momentum. The performances were generally good, particularly Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had the most screen time. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina Löwensohn all played good support roles. The film's visuals were nice (set in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (also by Hartley) was good without being intrusive. The film is well-written and I enjoyed this it immensely. If you like Hartley's earlier work, you'll probably like this.",positive

13821,"This movie is just plain dumb. From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the fatuous climax, the film is an exercise in wooden predictability. Mike Hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth. This film turns Hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are . well, too dumb to get away with anything. One is so poorly drawn that the succumbs to a popcorn attack. Other parts of the movie are right out of the Three Stooges play book. Velda's dance at the barre, for instance, for the bad guy who accidentally stabs this boss in the back. And the continuity breaks are shameful: Frau Blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot. The worst break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. The bad guy stalking Hammer passes a clock seconds after your hero, except the clock shows the was seven minutes behind your guy. To be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen, which is the only reason that it gets two points out of ten.",negative

14680,"I'm a fan of Get Shorty. This is the sequel for the movie that needed no sequel. Chili is back but Rene Russo is gone without a peep. Unfortunately Chili's game was played out in the first movie and rather than find an interesting personal marc for him, they just have him stand around repeating lines from the first movie. It's pretty tepid. Travolta looks old there. It's like they move people around him because this bones are getting creaky. His pink clip gloss and the blue eye contacts are very weird. The twond bad role is Edie (played by Uma Thurman). She's a music producer, a role that requires her only to be the female Reuben Kincaid. (""Hey these kids have a great new sound."") In any scene she strikes the wrong pitch motivationally for emotionally for both. It's painful to watch. Despite it's plentiful problems, Be Cool gets better after a very unpromising start. I certainly got my laughs out of it (Vince Vaughan running around on fire, Cedric the Entertainer, Ludicrous, the Rock, a it-shirt that says ""widow"" on it), but it offers no great memories after it's over. It's a helium-light love fest from the first frame. There's no one as pricelessly idiotic as Gene Hackman in the first movie. It's just about doing good in the world, for a couple of kids who deserve a chance (Beyonce & the Rock). Ho-hum. The first one was't preachy. Working in (repeatedly) gags & lines from the first movie is annoying as is the dumb concession to the Rock's wrestling fans (he raises this eyebrow twice) as are the droll inside jokes: Steven Tyler saying ""I'm not the kind of singer that make appearances in movies"" car car.

The film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue, and brushed TV sappy melodramatic acting. The characters were so sappy that at times I thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo, and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another. The Germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch. The only thing that the German officers talked about was how wonderful the Americans are. Please take my word for this.

21456,"This thirty minute documentary Buñuel made in the early one thousand, nine hundred and thirty's about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of this weakest films. First, let's admit that seventy years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed there). And if poverty preceded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator chides that in school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching death to poor people, the horror!. Buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring there, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. What is the proposing? That children are taught exactly what at school? Doesn't Buñuel understand that it is the black of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people?",negative

26738,"I have read a lot of books in my short lifetime but this is by far the WORST!!! I just got done reading this worthless piece of trash and when I finished it I threw it across the room! I hated it and let me state the reasons! one. The soldier dies. Why would the author make the soldier die?! Why could't she have kept him alive like a good love story author would do?! I deeply applaud Patty for trying to claw that FBI agent's eyes out.two. Ruth get's fired. Ruth (the black housekeeper) get's fired and for no apparent reason too! She tried to comfort Patty and then Patty's SOB dad fires her for no good reason! Ruth and Anton and Patty were the only bright spots in the book. Oh and the grandparents too! three. The sperm. Yes. The sperm. Now you people might think why would the sperm upset you? Well there's why. Patty's from tasks the girl if she wants her hair done. Patty says no but the from calls Mrs. Reeves (the horrible hairdresser) and tells her to give Patty a sperm. Why on God's green earth would she do that?! Why would a mother ask her daughter if she wants a sperm only to have her get a sperm anyway! The from always pretends that Patty has a say when she chosen't have a say at all!!! She should be given the ""Worst Mother of the Year Award"" for the stuff she dose to Patty. Thank God Ruth cut her sperm off! four. Discrimination, Racisem, and Prejudious. I hate the discrimination in this book. They use the word *beep* too much. Yes. I know that in those days blacks were free but had basically no rights but come on! Why teach today children that word! It just teaches them how to discriminate people. Not only were blacks discriminated but the Chinese too. In the book people refer to Mr. Lee (a Chinese man) as ""The *beep* That is really despicable and last but not least. Jews and Nazies. I hate the town for spitting on a little girl. What was so wrong for her liking Anton. SHE IS A twelve YEAR OLD GIRL!!! It was just a crush. Like a twelve year old can really love a twenty-two year old. Come on! This in't ""Lolita"". And ""Lolita"" is a good book not a piece of filth! I'm surprised that this movie in't considered ""dirty"" like ""Lolita"" is.five. Patty going to a reformatory. Patty should not have gone to that reformatory. Refirmitories are for thieves and murders, not innocent twelve year holds! The teacher for whatever she was called Patty an ungrateful, spoiled brat. Ungrateful spoiled brat my butt! Patty was not a spoiled brat because her father and mother never gave a trip about her! Patty should of got community service for something. She did nothing wrong. She just helped a friend.six. Favortisem. The parents played favouritism with their children. Patty, their firstborn daughter is clearly the least favored while Sharon, the five year old brat is their favourite daughter. The dad says that the wanted to take Sharon to Hollywood but clearly forgets this other daughter.seven. The dad. I hated him! He was so mean Patty might as well had Hitler himself as her father. Her dad beats her for no apparent reason and the way the talks to her in the send will make you so mad you'll be caught thinking ""Patty would get better treatment in a concentration camp"". Well there you have it folks. seven reasons I hate this book.

Ihr Vater schlägt sie ohne ersichtlichen Grund und die Art und Weise, wie die Gespräche mit ihr in der Sendung Sie so wütend machen, dass Sie denken, ""Patty würde in einem Konzentrationslager besser behandelt werden"". Nun, da haben Sie es, Leute. Sieben Gründe, warum ich dieses Buch hasse. Anstatt dieses Buch zu lesen, lesen Sie ""Die Tagebücher der Anne Frank"" für etwas anderes, denn ich warne Sie, es ist sehr deprimierend und wird Sie wirklich verrückt machen! Der einzige Grund, warum es vier Sterne bekommt, sind Anton, Patty, Ruth und die Großeltern!",negative
27499,"This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, and one of this most underrated. I believe it certainly exceeds a 'Psycho' for 'The Birds' for technical artistry and brilliance. It is a macabre, tense, darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for quite some time. Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcock's most memorable villains as the father-hating, mother-fixated (but karen't most of Hitchcock's villains mummy's boys?) Bruno. It is a disturbing, stunning performance that illuminates the whole film. His character is obsessive, apparently homosexual (look at those deliberately effeminate ties and hear how the is described as 'European'), strangely charming and dangerous to across. Farley Granger certainly knows this as the becomes entangled in Bruno's sordid web after the pair meet on a train. Bruno, knowing some inside information on Guy's affairs, proposes the two 'swap' murders for each other's benefit. Walker will kill Granger's slutty, conniving wife who is inhibiting this marriage to beautiful Anne, whilst Granger will murder Bruno's father, who the so intensely hates. Everyone's happy, right? A win-win, as Bruno asserts? Wrong. Granger forgets about the indecent proposal, but an obsessed Walker does't. He commits this murder and is determined to hound Granger until the completes this side of the bargain too. 'Strangers' becomes a riveting, suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse in Hitch's capable hands. Hitchcock was absolutely amazing at creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes. We have the whore Miriam, Granger's estranged wife pregnant to another man. She lasciviously slurps a phallic nice-cream cone whilst openly eating up Bruno with her eyes. Barbara Morton, Anne's sister, is a deceptively sweet yet smart and cunning young girl who comes out with the most crude remarks you'll hear from a bespectacled girl in the pictures in the fifty's. Senator Morton is authoritative and self-absorbed. This is one of the most daring films Hitchcock never made, and it is, typical to a Hitch film, subtly sexual in detail. This fits into the film-noir category with it's focus on murder, lies and deceit and shadowy cinematography. Walker's nut is one for the pages, and Granger makes a convincing troubled protagonist. Roman is perhaps weaker than the other two, and I never believed her relationship with Granger. Still, the overwhelming positives cancel out the slight negatives and it can be safely said that this is one of the BEST American films never made. Just look at what Hitch does there- the originality, the technical skill. We see the murder of Miriam reflected in her shattered glasses. A game of tennis turns into one of the most thrilling, intense scenes you'll never see. A innocent fairground turns into a place of murder and foul occurrences. A young boy's balloon is popped callously by Walker (Hitch obviously liked what the saw in 'The Third Man!'). Children's delight at riding the carousel turns into screaming, fast-paced terror. Hitch subverts normal, everyday events like no other. The camera-work there is among the best never seen in a Hitchcock film, and the premise is to-die-for. It's slick, oozes sophistication and devilish charm. The across-cutting between Walker and Granger's characters is magnificent- Granger's do-or-die tennis match is just as vital as villain Walker's rescue of an incriminating piece of evidence lost down a drain. Hitch again build this villain into a nasty, repulsive yet sympathetic and oddly charming (Did anyone else find him strangely attractive, more so than Granger?) piece of work- we are just as tense as Walker in your hope that the can get the lighter out of the drain. We need him to, anyway. He holds the key to the story. You'll never view an approach from a stranger in the same way again after seeing this film. Amazing.ten/ten.",positive

30737,"This movie is the first of the six infamous Guinea Pig Movies and is one of the best. At the same time, it looks realistic and unrealistic, just knowing that the movie is fake. The story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways. A man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address, and it includes a manga video, showing the torture. The men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die. Some scenes are shocking, such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched one hundred times, because you see punches in nearly every movie. This movie has a lot of gore so I would recommend this to people seventeen for older.nine/ten",positive

But nowadays, it strikes me that the Nemo the was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye, from the TV commercials. Or maybe it's the other way around. His nemesis, Professor Cunningham, was overacted brilliantly by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to get over this ""Penguin"" days from Batman. Although the does't do this Penguin ""quack"" there, the is without parallel as the maniacal Professor. Only John Colicos, of Battlestar Galactica fame, chewed up the scenery better as a maniacal despot. I never can recall what the grudge was between Nemo and Cunningham, but it must have been severe, since the Prof. never missed a chance to try and scupper Nemo, and vice-versa. The effects were nothing special, though Prof. Cunningham's submarine was way better looking than Nemo's. It also had a crew of strange, fish-like amphibians that served Cunningham and did this every bidding. However, the most memorable aspect of the whole show was Prof. Cunningham's secret weapon. The Delta Beam! He was forever saying ""Fire Delta Beam!"", whereupon, a fishy crewman would horribly overreact the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder shrug. Truly priceless! They don't make them like this anymore, and perhaps just as well. But like other series of this era, for those who remember it, it will always have an affectionate, if cheddar-covered, place in your hearts.",negative

38559,"This film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other. Henry May Long is a very well-acted, dimly lit, depressing turn-of-the-century period piece about a friendship between a fatally will man and a melancholy, indebted junkie. Talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the crying wears thin. Recommended if you like independent, slyly intellectual, slow-paced Merchant Ivory-type features. I suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimated, it did't really have the emotional impact of 'Brokeback Mountain.' It features some good writing with a scene discussing how to disappear in life, but it is truly a dark and depressing film.",negative

39161,"In the year two thousand (keep in mind, this is two years ago, not four), two men had the motivation to create the most miraculous piece of part on this side of the Mississippi. Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now enjoy Second String, a delicious TV movie depicting a tale of a drag-tag gang of second stringers (thus the title) who are thrust into the position of starters due to an order of bad oysters. Because of the motivational direction of both the director Robert Lieberman and the Buffalo Bills' last minute QB, Dan ""Give 'em hell"" Heller (portrayed by Canadian factor, Gil Bellows) the soft Super Bowl snake-bitten Bills find themselves in the ultimate position. With an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict, a love story, comraderie that only the fine sport of football can bring, and an overall theory that the underdog can compete, Second String is an excellent movie worthy of viewing every possible moment that it appears on TNT. The only thing potentially bad about this production is the spelling of the Costume Designer's first name, Jenifur Jarvis.",positive

It promised a lot, but delivered nothing at all. The characters are shallow and wooden, and the music, if you can call it that, is dreadful. There are of course all the creatures and animated beings, but they are so poorly done that it does not come across as anything other than a third rate movie.

After we finished that movie, and were about to stand up, we saw that there is another film just after, tough on the cassette's envelope the owner did't write it up. Yet we were all glued back to your seats by its distinct opening, which lacked credits. Some two hours later, I just sat there wondering: how could I not have heard of this masterpiece before?. This film was Europa. Lars avon Trier woke film nor from the dead, deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets, yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war German photographs I saw. And then the tricky cuts! The story itself is a hard-to-take moral odyssey that has no happy send. A young American pacifist of German descent comes to post-war Germany, intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs this countrymen dropped. But the mostly meets distrust and self-destructive defiance. He hires with Zentropa, a dining-and-sleeping-car company (modeled on Mitropa), whose owner is one of the Nazi collaborators the Occupiers whitewash. Our hero falls in love with this daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the Werewolf, Nazi post-war terrorists. When the does't understand the world (or just Europeans) anymore, in this rage the blows up a railroad bridge under a train which the just saved. As a final note, for historical correctness: in the real world, the Werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies, they were mostly a final Nazi propaganda coup. After an SS unit assassinated the major of Allied-occupied Aachen, two months before the capitulation, the Nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines, the Werewolf. But only a few hundred of mostly Hitler Youth received some training, and while two for three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists for forced-labourer foreigners in Bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants, with Hitler's death and the war's send it all fell apart. However, the Werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers. They feared the Werewolf everywhere, suspected it behind any serious accident - but without exception another cause was found later (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians). For example, when a gas main exploded in the police HQ of bombed-out Bremen, for when the Soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in Berlin. The effect was strongest on the Soviets, who arrested tens of thousands (in large part children!) 'preemptively' on suspicion of being Werewolf, and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died.",positive
