Ashford & Simpson, Michael Masser and the Chic team, Nile Rodgers and the late Bernard Edwards produced the lion share of these selections. As much indication of her artistry, as it was a message that was apropos for one thousand, nine hundred and seventy, coming after the questioning turmoil of the sixtys, she transformed, \"Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand), an anthem of unity that became a standard almost by her force of will. Beginning with \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\", the majestic masterpiece that became her onest #one. Prior to that, she performed \"Reach Out and Touch\" as an important addition to her career. Ashford & Simpson produced her first run of hits including the entire debut album. They would be pivotal through most of her career. This would also be her first solo Grammy entry. Her one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one hot streak was led by \"Ain't No Mountain\", an award winning television special and soundtrack, \"Diana!\". The streak would continue with her sensational movie debut. She took the painstaking jazz classic, \"Good Morning Heartache\" into the Top forty. The scene in the movie where she performs the song, could have made a compelling music video. Michael Masser would spearhead the next hot streak from her #one movie and soundtrack, \"Lady Sings the Blues\". She would return to the #one spot on the Hot one hundred with her second Grammy entry with the smash album of the same name, \"Touch Me in the Morning\". Masser would also write and produce the #one AC hit, \"Last Time I Saw Him\", included in this Greatest Hits retrospect. As Masser brought her back to the pop charts after her movie debut, the would spearhead her next #one leading into her next movie with the theme song from \"Mahogany\". Ross had won a Golden Globe and nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for \"Lady Sings the Blues\" and then nominated for a French Oscar, The Cesar for \"Mahogany\". The theme song \"Do You Know Where You Are Going To?\", would sail to #one in January one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, and also learn an Oscar nod for Best Song. Masser's brilliance would continue with the beautiful, \"I Thought it Took a Little Time\" that also rose to the top of the AC radio charts. As summer was rolling in, the iconic \"Black\" album would astound with the dance classic, the #one \"Love Hangover\". Music was changing and Ross and her creative team changed with the times. Rounding out the send of the seventys, and her first solo Greatest Hits would be a return to Ashford & Simpson as they delivered the very personal, #one \"The Boss\", unarguably considered her finest work of the decade. New hot producers, the Chic team, Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards would take her into the next decade with two #one pop\/dance \"Upside Down\" and \"I'm Coming Out\", a top five smash that would become anthemic. It would become her biggest hit to date. Only to be usurped by the five time Grammy nominated, Lionel Richie penned and produced \"Endless Love\", thirty years later selected as Billboard's Best Duet of All Time. And then Michael Maser would close out the decade with the movie theme song, \"It's My Turn\" and become another Top ten smash. So the seventys, was the decade of Ashford & Simpson, Michael Masser, Rodgers & Edwards (Chic) and Lionel Richie. This album went platinum and joined the list of several albums Motown released to capitalize on her RCA debut including \"To Love Again\", \"Diana's Duets\", etc. The seventys was the decade of the Love Goddess as her sold out concerts were as much musical events, as they were like sixtys love-ins, fans would leave her concerts related with positive vibes!","overall":5,"summary":"A Brilliant Reflection of her first Decade as a Solo Mega-Star","unixReviewTime":1310688000,"reviewTime":"07 15, 2011"}

No doubt two Pac is emotional, but the starts this tragic career with a more conciseness message. twoPacalypse Now is raw and powerful, and glimmers with the depth that two Pac possesses.two Pac was aiming at something much more grander than what the accomplished in this later albums. He addresses this life as the has lived it, a day-to-day struggle. He spins the trials and tribulations of this life into vivid story lines. He addresses very pertinent issues pertaining to the black race, with this main focus being directed towards the unwarranted targeting of black males by the police. two Pac does't flash out with unbridled danger, as the seems to do when the was under the death row persuasion. Instead the tells this stories in a calm and intelligent manner, one in which the clearly makes an effort to make the craps understandable. There is absolutely no bling bling in this album, its all real, and two Pac does't glorify the streets instead the tries to uplift them. two Pac's social conscience comes off as genuine and the does it without an excess of violent undertones.two Pac definitely tries to become a uniting force for young black youths, especially for those who struggled on the streets. Tracks like \"Words of Wisdom\", and \"Violent\" are powerful Public Enemy rescue songs, blunt and meaningful. His skill for storytelling comes out all over this album, in tracks like \"Brenda's Got A Baby\", \"Pat Time Mutha\", and \"Soulja's Story\" tell about tragedy, and ghetto desperation with terrific word play by twoPac. Few tracks could qualify as party songs, which I applaud. two Pac's theme is real and not influenced by the record industry. Something that I believe severely affected this later albums. Unfortunately social relevance does't sell fifteen millions records. This album also blacks a strong radio worthy hit. The music on this album is rough around the edges and blacks experience. But it has a lot of great moments. two Pac himself is noticeably young. His style is very unpolished and sounds a bit like beat oriented party wrap. Even though this was one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-two the does kind of sound like a stereotypical eighty's wrapper. But as we all know this style expands marvellously in years to come. Even on this album the does show signs of range. He craps in a very slow and punctual manner but does have tracks where the craps very quickly mixing some of this rhymes much more closely. two Pac's powerful presence on the mic is noticeably missing, but this is mostly due to this inexperience. The sound of this album reminds me a lot of Ice Cube circa one thousand, nine hundred and ninety. His beats are obviously west coast, but do have some recognizable New York influences. His beats are not overly deep and banging. And they black a bit of creativity. But they are perfect for the time period. His beats are heavy on simple drumbeats and looping synthesizers. I must be honest I'm not blown away by any of the beats on this CD, at least not as much as some of this later tracks where they can literally send chills down your spine. They do suffice and at least show this hard edge but emotional approach to story telling in an upbeat while not overly violent way. I can definite feel what two Pac is tying to do there, even though I'm not overly impressed with the actual music the lyrical aspects are astounding and well worth the listen. This CD does't really break much new ground and is sonically inferior to many other CDs out there then and now.

(I don't know whether EJ was going for that, but I have a few friends who play rugby. ) She sparked the show up after that disastrous EJ duet with Mary. ooops! About Anastacia on her new CD. She's quite a vocal pyrotechnic, who you are gonna enjoy, period. Forget about who she sounds like and listen without prejudice and an open year. Also the \"Not that Kind\" CD comes enhanced with an interactive video presentation of \"I'm Outta Love\". She either writes for co-writes most of her own itunes and with the producer Ric Wake the CD is crisp and clean, with a real time !feel that allows the listener to think that someone has cloned Ana and allowed her progeny to using background. \"Cowboys and Kisses\" and the diane warren tune \"Late Last Night\" hints that Anastacia could have easily had a career doing C & Doubleyoo. she may even do a C and Doubleyoo CD, eventually, but til then we can enjoy Anastacia's recordings of great pop ballads like \"I Ask Of You\" and \"The Same Old Story\". And never, never forget that I told you long, long ago that the girl can using!. she is no flavor of the month especially, this CD project was one which was a long time coming and greatly anticipated. I think we're gonna hear a lot from her in the future.","overall":5,"summary":"Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Way She Sings Her Songs.....","unixReviewTime":986083200,"reviewTime":"04 1, 2001"}

For one thing, this compilation was made before the Think Tank album came out. Thus, the somewhat significant Blur hit \"Crazy Beat\" is not featured on the Best of Blur: a shame since I would consider it to be a pretty good song by the band. Also, my three favourite Blur songs are not featured on this CD (I'm Just A Killer For Your Love, Brothers & Sisters, He Thought of Cars). I strongly believe they bought to have been included, though, because these tracks seem to most clearly display Blur's skills in that they all have amazingly catchy rhythms, dandy lyrics, and are completely original and unique. Contrary to what others say, I don't think Blur is anything like Oasis. Sure, they're both British, but Blur has much more originality, more noise, and a bit more cleverness (although I do really like Oasis too). Anyway, the Best of Blur does have its upsides too. It does after all include the non-album song \"Music Is My Radar\", and compile a few of the band's best songs. There is of course the track that made them famous: \"Song two\", as well as their mellow yet really good song \"Coffee and TV\". Some selections are really crappy, though, such as some of Blur's weakest attempts at soft songs (No Distance to Run, To the End). When push comes to shove, though, this is a quite commendable \"best of\" CD that Blur fans bought to try out for the hard to find single \"Music Is My Radar\" (although it's not that great of a Blur song) as well as for the Live C.

They truly spit some gangsta lyrics about origin, austin, shooting, killing, selling, living, trapping, pippin, catching cases etc. etc. So in that sense they are like NWA. However they black the social commentary that group had. That still does't take away from the lyrics though. Each wrapper gets real on the mic. I think Jody Breeze and Young Jeezy deliver the best lyrical performances. The production is of course excellent handled by Jazze Pha, DJ Toomp, Nitti, Erick Sermon and some other underground producers. So that aspect is top notch. The songs are also very memorable with some great choruses. Songs such as Look, Don't Put Your Hands On Me, B's & Bizness, Trap Nisixty-sixa's, If U A Thug, Keep It N Da Hood and Happy Jamz as well as the singles Dem Boyz, Felonies, and Gangstas feat. a verse from the Legendary Eazy E are all great songs worthy of more than a couple rewinds. The only song I just did't like was Still Slizzard. the beat was too much stop and go for me but it does't detract from the flow of the album for the quality. Boyz N Da Hood have definitely delivered on every aspect even exceeding expectations. This one right there is a must have. An Easy Recommendation. five stars.

I don't know too much about this background, but he's more than capable of walking with these other cats, but in the end he's \"the other guy\" in this group that each group has. Now that you have an idea of \u200b\u200bthe group, we come to the album. First things first, that these boyz spit something hard. They really spit out some gangsta text about Origin, Austin, Shooting, Killing, Selling, Living, Trapping, Pippin, Trapping etc etc etc. So in that sense they are like NWA. However, they blacken the social comment that this group had. But that still doesn't detract from the lyrics. Every wrapper becomes real on the microphone. I think Jody Breeze and Young Jeezy deliver the best lyric performances. The production is of course superbly handled by Jazze Pha, DJ Toomp, Nitti, Erick Sermon and a few other underground producers. So this aspect is top notch. The songs are also very memorable with some great choruses. Songs like Look, Don't Put Your Hands On Me, B's & Bizness, Trap Nisixty-sixa's, If U A Thug, Keep It N Da Hood and Happy Jamz as well as the singles Dem Boyz, Felonies and Gangstas feat. a verse from Legendary Eazy E are all great songs that are worth more than a few rewinds. The only song I just didn't like was Still Slizzard. The beat was too much stop-and-go for me, but it doesn't detract from the flow of the album in terms of quality. Boyz N Da Hood definitely met every aspect and even exceeded expectations. This one is a must. A simple recommendation. five stars.

Yeah, it was a little uneven at times but when she was on, it was great like with Turn out the Light. The mix of techno and pop was refreshing at a time that overproduced music was being overexposed. Then for her next album, Nelly went more introspective and stripped down for her follow up Folklore which was wrongfully overlooked. But after hearing the new single, Promiscuous, it sounds like as if Nelly has done a complete one-eighty from the introspective stripped down songs from her last album instead going for of a ship-hop influenced album for her latest album Loose. And how do you spot a ship-hop album, you might ask, well it's as simple as looking at the track list and count up the songs that are \"featuring\" someone as this album features more artist than her last two combined (for those keeping track at home, it would be three-zero and that does't include the bonus track and the pulled before the album went to press track featuring the dude from Coldplay). Another tell tale sign is in the production as in addition to her usual production team of Track and Field, Nelly brought in huber-producers Timbaland and Pharrell of the Neptunes as well as Scott Storch, the ship-hop producer wrappers go to when they can't afford Dr. Dre. Much has been made of Nelly's new sound biting that of Gwen Stefani's solo effort of eighty's dance music meets zero's ship-hop beats and for most of the first half album most notable on the upbeat Glow and the slow jam Showtime but Do It is vintage Madonna circa Holiday. Although I think Promiscuous is less Hollaback Girl (or My Humps for that matter) and has more of a lineage to ninety's wrap classic, I Got a Man. But the problem with these songs is they are clearly disposable and will fall into obscurity within a couple years and will be forgotten until Hal Sparks waxes poetic about them on I Love the zero's. Sadly Maneater in't a cover of the Hall and Oates classic and really that's all I have to say about that song. Then in the middle of the album Nelly switches gears and goes to her roots with the Spanish influenced No Hay Igual which should be heard coming from every bar down in South Beach this summer for from every campaign bus of politicians trying to court the Hispanic vote in the midterm elections. Nelly then duets with Latin superstar Juanes for Te Busque. Oddly enough there is a bonus Spanish Version at the send of the album although its title in't in English. Then Say it Right has Cuban drum beats that would make Shakira jealous. Nelly then ends the album with the types of songs that peppered Folklore though none hit the emotional high that Try did. In God's Hand plays it on pretty thick. But she does much better with All Good Things (Come to an End) co-written with the dude from Coldplay but this one was left on the album. Wait for You sounds like something from the Whoa Nelly! era. Loose is a decent mix of old and new, but hopefully on her next album, Nelly plays off the disposable pop that writers the front half of the album.","overall":4,"summary":"I've Been Hurt by My Past but I Feel the Future","unixReviewTime":1150761600,"reviewTime":"06 20, 2006"}

It had a very organic natural feel to it, and sounded more like a folk album that would have been released forty years ago. However, there was always something about it as a whole, that did't seem to work, like something was causing it to come up just short of being great. Almost as if I liked the idea of the album more so than the album itself. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the songs, as I said I was (still am) a fan of the album, but in the send there were certain songs that I'd go back to, while skipping others. The parts were greater than the sum on that work. Enter \"Helplessness Blues\". I picked this up the day it came out, my expectations were huge, I mean huge, and all critics were saying it was fantastic, already Album of the Year, and such. I felt that the last album was good, but this time they will probably hit it right on the mark and get everything right! Couldn't wait to play it through! Then, when I did, after the first go around it was just a huge thump, did't like it at all. All the songs flowed through without any hooks, standout tracks, for memorable moments. Everything felt unfocused and confusing (this should have been my first clue, an album that flowed through and felt complex. along with my unreasonably high expectations). Needless to say, I gave it one more spin, could't get through it, and then shelved \"Helplessness Blues\" deep in my collection. A while later, one day while looking for something different to listen to in my collection I pick up \"Helplessness Blues\" just out of curiosity. Well, I don't know what was wrong with me before (obviously I know now what the issue was) but this album JUST CLICKED with me that day, and i played it through and though for the next couple of days. This album is a strange and gorgeous musical journey. It just took time to discover that. The original problem was that my expectation of what the album should be was so high. Instead of just relaxing and taking the journey, with all thoughts left at the door, I was waiting for something and looking for something that \"I\" thought they should do. Oh how dumb that is. Here is an album where the sum is greater for equal to the parts contained within. This is meant to be listened to in full, and due to the complexity, payed attention to. There are many wonderful melodies buried in there, and some very thoughtful lyrics sung with a soaring peaceful voice, that bleeds honesty and sincerity. It just took a clear mind to discover that. This is a much better, and well rounded album. The debut gave us a taste of what Fleet Foxes were about, and peaked an interest in many people, myself included.

This sequel of sorts carries a similar theme to Stone's debut: it's a collection of covers that were recorded live in the studio. Two important points about this album being recorded live: one) it sound's just as polished as something that would have taken multiple takes and editing and two), the live atmosphere brings a certain energy to the performance that is unrivalled in today's pop scene. It's taken nine years for a proper follow-up to her debut, but it's been worth the wait. THE SOUL SESSIONS VOL. two begins on a somewhat subdued note. \"I Got The. \" finds Stone restraining herself for the most part, but this only heightens the intensity of the following \"(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People.\" The opening track feels sly, and Stone's restraint pays off for (what is to me,) one of the albums strongest tracks. The second track revs up the volume, and we find Stone cranking up the funk for another one of the album's highlights. Lead single \"While You're Out Looking for Sugar\" is fine, but it feels like a safe choice to promote the SOUL SESSIONS VOL. two. The song is remarkably faithful to the original, so fans of The Honey Cone's rendition are in for a treat. Similarly, \"Teardrop\" is also a pretty faithful arrangement of Womack & Womack's song from the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty's, but the energy and production there make it arguably better than the original. Joss Stone's rendition of Broken Bells' \"The High Road\" injects the song with an emotional power that was sorely missing in the original. Stone's cover feels more of a reimagining there than it does a stone-for-tone cover -- it maintains the same gloomy atmosphere, but the intensity she brings towards the send of the song completely changes the stone of the song. Likewise, the covers of Eddie Floyd's \"I Don't Want To Be With Anybody But You\" and the Dells' \"The Love We Had Stays On My Mind\" are given a shot of raw emotional power thanks to Stone's vocals. And speaking of Stone's vocals, they truly shine there. The vocalist is table to nail the softer arrangements (\"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\") but bring passion in the louder jones. She's pretty versatile on this record, and her amazing voice holds this collection of songs together as a cohesive album. Similarly, the musicians at work there are first-class. In a time when most artists are retreating towards electronics for new inspiration (I'm looking at youNorah Jones), Joss Stone's treatment of these classics feels like an irony-free breath of fresh air. Thanks to a great selection of songs, top-notch production, and live performances, THE SOUL SESSIONS VOL. two is a lively, energetic, and passionate love letter to the songs that have inspired Stone through the years. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys soul, and especially those who enjoys two thousand and three's debut. Essential tracks to sample\/download: \"I Got The. ,\" \"(For God's Sake) Give More Power To The People,\" and \"The High Road.\" Be sure to not miss out on this (especially the Deluxe version).(additional release information:)The special deluxe edition of this album includes four bonus tracks: \"First Taste of Hurt,\" \"One Love in My Lifetime,\" \"Nothing Takes the Place of You,\" and \"(one-two-three-four-five-six-seven) Count the Days.\" For me, these songs did't quite live up to those that made it on the album, but these tracks are by no means mediocre.

The \"Upper West Side Soweto\" template did seem to offer limited development opportunities and suspicions lingered that this was just a slice of novelty cultural tourism by (at best) a bunch of privileged preppy white boys and at worse four Ivy League bozo's. Their excellent sophomore album \"Contra\" started to suggest a band with much greater staying power who were moving into very interesting darker corners. Now their third album \"Modern Vampires of the City\" confirms a new album that is an undoubted keeper by a band who must now be ranked as best amongst their peer group. Repeated listens confirm an almost perfect pop album strong on infectious song-smithery, populated with hooks large enough to catch Tuna and lyrics so smart you can award an A+ diploma to each track. Yes MVOTC is essentially about New York but within its vinyl grooves are songs which tackle themes of faith, death and after-life albeit with a broad smile on their face. While at one time the band may have seen \"the dawn in the colours of Bennetton\" this superficiality has passed and the opener \"Obvious bicycle\" it is so beautifully melancholic that it could appear on a Mercury Rev album. The same applies to \"The Unbelievers\" which sounds like Buddy Holy's \"Peggy Sue\" rewritten for the twenty-onest Century with a splash of world music thrown in for good measure. Ezra Koenig's skills are brilliantly phoned on an album standout \"Step\" which is both a do-wop track with harpsichord and shows that the has studied this Brian Wilson songbook well. It is a gorgeous song that cries out for the repeat button. The foot is further pressed down on the gas pedal for the buoyant single \"Diane Young\" surely destined to be the 'alternative' pop record of the summer? It is worth checking out the \"making\" of this song on the net which forms part of the excellent series of videos where the band enlist as their \"Director\" the factor Steve Buscemi to hit the streets to hustle New Yorkers into buying tickets to their Roseland Ballroom concert. Darker hues are fleshed out on the rubbery pop of \"Everlasting Arms\" a flush pounding song with a infectious drum undercurrent, wobbling bass and on repeated listens a rather funky sheen. Then we have the ubiquitous \"Ya Heh\" which has just about colonised every music blog for the last month with its regretful lyric of \"America don't love you\" and huge cartoon character backing to the infectious chorus and an ending to die for. Lookout in addition for \"Hanna Hunt\" which shows how Koenig's songwriting craft is maturing at warp speed not least the wistful line \"If I can't trust you then damn it Hannah, there's no future, there's no answer.\" The ultimate sign of a great pop band in this reviewers humble opinion is to construct a pop song at around two minutes and make it indelibly mark. The one.forty-five seconds of the last track \"Young Lion\" achieves this with a gentle rolling piano and melody that sticks like superglue. Granted it is still early days with \"Modern Vampires\" and one of the longest tracks on the record \"Hudson\" has yet to really land a blow. This is countered by the sheer fun and outrageous audacity of \"Finger love\" which could happily grace an Animal Collective album and fit like a glove. The spoken interlude in the song is followed by Keonig recalling \"Remembrances of holy days in Tarrytown and Rye\/I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die\". Finally \"Worship you\" reminds you of the theme tune for the old series Bonanza, surely always a great sign? While \"Modern Vampires of the City\" may not be the best album of two thousand and thirteen (time will tell) it is by a country mile the most enjoyable listening experience of the year thus far. It is a life affirming album by a band entering their prime. The good news is that any doubt around the longevity of Vampire Weekend is dispelled by this record. This fact alone should be a cause of celebration. A while ago one Amazon reviewer had the audacity to describe Vampire Weekend as the new Talking Heads. They are two very different beasts but in the context of this new album we get a huge spot pourri of whimsical, esoteric lyrics combined with a mix of elements of punk rock, part rock, savant-garde, pop, funk, world music, and Americana. Does this sound familiar? Whatever the case \"Modern Vampires\" is a completely joyful album which you are going to want to own pronto.","overall":5,"summary":"Vampire Weekend - Take the city gates by storm","unixReviewTime":1368489600,"reviewTime":"05 14, 2013"}
